  "description": "Some experts said the judge's ruling could spur more competition as AI changes the way people search.",
  "content": "A judge\u2019s ruling spared Google from having to sell its Chrome browser but placed other limits on the search giant. Above, a company event in Mountain View, Calif., in 2024.\n\nWhen a federal judge deemed Google a \u201cmonopolist\u201d last year, questions lingered about how he would help restore competition in online search.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta for the District of Columbia gave his answers in a highly watched decision that spared the online behemoth from selling its Chrome browser but placed other limits on the search giant.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, after dodging the most severe penalties, saw its stock surge 9% on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overall a win for Google,\u201d said Yory Wurmster, a principal analyst at EMarketer. \u201cIt\u2019s probably about the best it could have expected, given that they were found guilty.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups and some tech companies expressed disappointment about the ruling, stating that it didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nThe judge said in his decision that forcing Google to divest Chrome is a \u201cpoor fit for this case\u201d and would be \u201cincredibly messy and highly risky\u201d because the web browser isn\u2019t a stand-alone business and is tied to the tech company\u2019s other systems.\n\nBut some of the remedies the judge cleared, such as requiring Google to share some of its search data with certain rivals, could open the door to more competition, some experts said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s dominance grew after it struck exclusive agreements with Apple, Samsung, AT&T and others to be the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices. As Google became more popular, it gathered a trove of valuable data, which in turn helped improve the quality of its search results.\n\n\u201cMaking data available to competitors would narrow the scale gap created by Google\u2019s exclusive distribution agreements and, in turn, the quality gap that followed,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement that the company is worried about \u201chow these requirements will impact our users and their privacy\u201d and is closely reviewing the decision.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, which filed the antitrust lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging the company illegally operated as a monopoly, said the remedies mark \u201can important step forward in the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing fight to protect American consumers.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s lengthy, 200-plus-page opinion comes as artificial intelligence is altering the way people search for information and could reshape Google\u2019s massive advertising business. Instead of sifting through a bunch of results on a search engine, more people are turning to chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to quickly find answers.\n\nGoogle has staked its claim in the AI race by releasing products such as its AI assistant Gemini, providing AI-generated summaries at the top of search results and launching a feature called AI mode that allows people to get conversational answers to questions like they could do on ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much that\u2019s going to have an impact on their bottom line,\u201d Wurmster said. \u201cEven if they win with AI mode, it looks like right now that ChatGPT is a legitimate contender.\u201d\n\nMehta acknowledged in his opinion that artificial intelligence technologies could become \u201cgame changers\u201d in the future, but chatbots aren\u2019t close yet to replacing search engines. Today, Google still dominates and \u201cNo existing rival has wrested market share from Google,\u201d he said in his opinion.\n\nOne of the proposed solutions the judge rejected would have been to require the search giant to display a \u201cchoice screen\u201d on every Google browser when a user hasn\u2019t selected a default search engine. Google was barred from entering into certain exclusive contracts, but wasn\u2019t prevented from paying or offering \u201cother considerations\u201d to partners such as Apple if the companies placed its search engine, Chrome or its generative AI products on browsers and mobile devices by default.\n\nMelissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said if Google was forced to sell Chrome it would have \u201ccompletely discombobulated their business model.\u201d\n\nThis year, Google Search is expected to generate $219 billion in revenue with $37.7 billion projected to go to distribution partners, according to the firm\u2019s estimates.\n\n\u201cThe question then becomes, in this new generative AI world, is that $220 billion sustainable over the next foreseeable future?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is really the question that the market will start to grapple with next.\u201d",

      "text": "- Share via\n- Google\u2019s dominance faces challenges after a federal judge ruled the tech giant illegally maintained a monopoly in search.\n- The company plans to appeal the ruling, but the judge is considering potential fixes including a proposal from federal prosecutors that Google be broken up.\n- Analysts are skeptical a Google breakup will happen, but expect the Trump administration to tackle antitrust concerns surrounding Big Tech.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In its early days, the quirky tech startup known as Google adopted a visionary corporate credo: \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d That later evolved into the motto: \u201cDo the right thing,\u201d reflecting the idealistic ambitions of the company\u2019s founders that its technology could be a force for good.\nGoogle\u2019s pioneering search technology would transform the internet and its home in Silicon Valley.\nBut more than two decades later, Google is confronting a starkly different view of its values and conduct, one that has been shaped by federal prosecutors who\u2019ve depicted the tech giant as an \u201cindustry behemoth\u201d that has \u201ccorrupted legitimate competition.\u201d\n\u201cGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\u201d said Amit P. Mehta, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in a landmark ruling in August that could reshape the future of search.\nThe decision represented a big legal blow for one of California\u2019s most successful technology brands, challenging its influence over how people find and consume information online.\nNow the Mountain View-based company is at a pivotal point in its nearly 30-year history as it tries to fend off scrutiny over its practices. Among the proposed fixes: The government wants the judge to force Google to sell its Chrome browser and share data with rivals.\n\u201cThe scope of potential penalty is greater than anything Google has ever faced,\u201d said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing platform SOCi. \u201cIt\u2019ll either undermine Google\u2019s ability to maintain its position as the market leader in online advertising \u2026 or open up the field to more competition.\u201d\nIn a major blow to Google, a federal judge on Monday ruled that the tech giant maintained and abused a monopoly on web searches.\nThe closely watched showdown could have a lasting effect on more than just Google, affecting the government\u2019s attempts to rein in the power of Amazon, Apple and Meta, experts said. Although some analysts are skeptical that Google will be broken up, many expect the incoming Trump administration to tackle antitrust issues.\nFor its part, Google plans to appeal the ruling and has accused the Department of Justice of pushing a \u201cradical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America\u2019s global technology leadership.\u201d The company proposed solutions that would make its contracts with wireless carriers and mobile device makers less restrictive. The judge is expected to hold a trial in April.\nGoogle declined to comment for this article but cited earlier public comments.\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a blog post that the company achieved success through innovating, building the best search engine and making smart business moves, such as investing early in mobile.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t use Google because they have to \u2014 they use it because they want to,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Google faces a separate antitrust lawsuit accusing it of monopolizing digital ad technology that publishers and advertisers rely on to make money.\nA potentially greater threat comes from emerging artificial intelligence tools such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT search, which can quickly summarize information and could disrupt the way people search and businesses attract new customers.\nGoogle released an AI-powered chatbot called Gemini and includes AI-generated summaries in its search results.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to just ... lie down and let themselves be marched over by these new companies,\u201d Rollison said.\nGoogle faces a new lawsuit in Virginia alleging that the tech behemoth\u2019s dominance of online advertising amounts to a monopoly.\nThe federal government has stepped in to try to spur more competition and protect consumers when powerful companies grow rapidly and rivals emerge.\nIn the 1950s, the U.S. government barred AT&T from entering computing business, citing its domination of telecommunications. Three decades later, AT&T agreed to break up \u201cMa Bell\u201d into smaller independent regional companies.\nThen there was Microsoft, which was forced to give up control over the internet after a federal judge ruled in the 2000s that it abused its monopoly power in personal computer operating systems. The judge ordered that Microsoft be broken up, but an appeals court overturned that decision and the software giant agreed to alter its business practices.\n\u201cThe goal of all of this antitrust enforcement is to have a level playing field and get the best provider of the next technology rather than the last guy,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, a professor of economics at Yale University.\nThe rise of a tech giant\nGoogle got its start in 1995 when founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met at Stanford University and started building a search engine called Backrub in their dorm rooms.\nThe duo renamed Backrub to Google, a play on the mathematical term Googol used to describe a large number. Google was founded three years later with a mission \u201cto organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d\nLike many Silicon Valley startups, Google had humble beginnings. Its first office was a cluttered garage in Menlo Park, Calif., the students rented from the late Susan Wojcicki, who would become the chief executive of Google-owned YouTube.\n\u201cThey seemed nice. Their idea sounded kind of crazy,\u201d Wojcicki said at a commencement speech in 2014 at Johns Hopkins University.\nThis quixotic idea eventually ballooned into one of the world\u2019s most valuable and powerful publicly traded tech companies.\nFrom the home, office and everywhere in between, Google\u2019s products became more intertwined with people\u2019s daily lives. Google runs a popular web browser, email, navigation app, news aggregator, virtual assistant and productivity tools that allow people to write, crunch numbers and video chat.\n\u201cGoogle was earning the goodwill of the consumer during that phase of its development by creating these tools and giving them away for free. Not only were they free, but they were the best,\u201d Rollison said. \u201cEventually you realize ... if the service is free, then it turns out you\u2019re the product.\u201d\nWeeks after California announced a $250 million public-private partnership with Google to fund local news outlets and develop AI, many aspects of the deal remain uncertain.\nToday, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet has a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. It has become an advertising powerhouse, leveraging the trove of valuable data it gathers from people who use Google\u2019s products. The tech colossus has grown even bigger, purchasing valuable platforms including YouTube, Android, Waze, FitBit and DoubleClick.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet reported revenue of $88.3 billion, up 15% from the previous year, virtually all of it from Google. Net income rose 34% to $26.3 billion during the period. Alphabet\u2019s stock price has jumped nearly 40% in the last year, closing Friday at $193.13 per share.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s become a victim of their own success,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey created a product and an algorithm that\u2019s untouchable, and in the views of the Street, they shouldn\u2019t be penalized because they created something that\u2019s changed consumer habits globally.\u201d\nGoogle declared a \u2018monopolist\u2019\nAs Google grew, so did questions about its market dominance.\nThe U.S. government, eager to curb the power of Big Tech and restore competition, honed in on business tactics Google used to shut out potential rivals. The DOJ and multiple states sued Google in 2020, alleging it illegally operated as a monopoly.\nBy then, nearly 90% of U.S. search queries went through Google and it was higher on mobile devices, the judge said. Microsoft\u2019s Bing trailed far behind Google, making up roughly 6% of all search queries.\nThe DOJ alleged in its lawsuit this lack of competition left consumers with fewer choices that could include more benefits such as privacy protections. Advertisers and small businesses also suffered because of higher advertising prices, officials said.\nIn his nearly 300-page decision, Mehta acknowledges the skilled engineers, innovation and business strategy that propelled Google\u2019s success. But he also points to exclusive agreements struck with Apple, Samsung, AT&T and others to be the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices, giving Google a \u201cmajor, largely unseen advantage over its rivals.\u201d\nAs Google gained users, it drew more advertisers, fueling its revenue growth and making it harder for rivals to compete.\nGoogle\u2019s revenue share payment to Apple, which runs web browser Safari, totaled an estimated $20 billion in 2022, according to the judge\u2019s decision.\nMicrosoft, which owns and operates the search engine Bing, tried to get Apple to replace Google as the default search engine but it failed, despite offering to share 100% of its Bing revenue with Apple or even sell the search engine, the judge stated.\nTo Apple, sticking with Google as the default search engine was more of a \u201csure thing\u201d when it came to revenue sharing, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, testified in September in a federal court in Washington.\n\u201cThey have the best search engine, they know how to advertise, and they\u2019re monetizing really well,\u201d Cue said.\nApple estimated it would gain about $40 billion from Google in the next five years if it continued its agreement \u2014 much higher than the $20 billion Microsoft would pay Apple over five years.\nUltimately, the judge ruled that Google violated federal antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in general search services.\nGoogle has disputed the claim.\n\u201cSince the trial ended over a year ago, AI has already rapidly reshaped the industry, with new entrants and new ways of finding information, making it even more competitive,\u201d Mulholland wrote in a blog post.\nThe court ruling could give a significant boost to DuckDuckGo, which was founded in 2008 by Gabriel Weinberg in a basement outside Philadelphia. He wanted to create a rival search engine that would have fewer ads and not collect any user data.\n\u201cIt could signal the beginning of a new era in search,\u201d said Kamyl Bazbaz, senior vice president of public affairs for DuckDuckGo. \u201cThe government proposed a comprehensive package of remedies that is meant to unravel the overlapping grip that Google has had on the search market for more than a decade.\u201d\nMany news outlets are already dealing with declining revenue from digital ads and subscriptions. Now, their business models are poised to be disrupted again by AI.\nA battle with publishers\nRival search engines aren\u2019t the only ones hoping to benefit from the possible breakup of Google.\nDanielle Coffey, president and chief executive of the News/Media Alliance, a nonprofit representing media organizations, contends Google has abused its power at the expense of content creators, changing how their websites rank in search results and giving them less money.\n\u201cWe just want a fair shot at monetizing that content,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, our distributor is reaping all the benefit, and they\u2019re allowed to because of their size.\u201d\nAs Google became the dominant search engine, news publishers increasingly relinquished control to the tech giant to drive traffic to their websites.\nAnd as Google captured more online advertising dollars, publishers worried they weren\u2019t being compensated enough for their content. They have endured massive layoffs and budget cuts.\nThe separate 2023 lawsuit filed by the DOJ, which a judge hasn\u2019t ruled on yet, accuses Google of monopolizing digital ad technologies and harming online publishers and advertisers that rely on these tools. This allegedly included buying rivals such as ad company DoubleClick and forcing publishers to use its tools.\nGoogle has countered in blog posts that the ad tech industry is competitive, publishers and advertisers have control over how ads are bought and sold, and ad buyers and sellers use their tools because they\u2019re simple, affordable and effective.\nThe company\u2019s influence over the news industry attracted the attention of California lawmakers who proposed a bill that would have required Google to pay news outlets for distributing their content.\nGoogle said it will remove links to California news sites for some users because of concerns about a state bill that may require Google to pay publishers.\nBut Google aggressively lobbied against the bill, known as the California Journalism Preservation Act, in the summer.\n\u201cIt was very hard to pass this legislation in Google\u2019s backyard,\u201d Julie Makinen, chair of the California News Publishers Assn., the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, said last year, noting Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s long-standing ties to the company\u2019s founders. A Newsom representative disputed the claim, saying the governor had worked to balance imposing regulations with encouraging innovation.\nThe Los Angeles Times, which supported the bill, is a member of the News/Media Alliance and the California News Publishers Assn. Makinen also worked at the newspaper as a former editor and reporter.\nGoogle said it helps drive traffic to publishers and the bill would have put \u201csmall publishers at a disadvantage and limit consumers\u2019 access to a diverse local media ecosystem.\u201d It has also argued that it supports journalism in other ways, such as the Google News Initiative, which provides funding, resources and training.\nIn August, California lawmakers agreed to shelve the bill after striking a controversial and nonbinding deal with Google and a news industry trade group to fund newsrooms. Google, taxpayers and other private donors would contribute nearly $250 million over five years to fund news outlets and an \u201cAI accelerator\u201d so journalists could experiment with the technology.\nWhile AI can help journalists with tedious tasks such as analyzing data and transcribing interviews, reporters fear these tools could generate false information or eliminate jobs.\nGoogle funded advertising against legislation that would require large tech platforms to pay news publishers.\nAdditionally, news publishers are concerned AI used to summarize news articles in Google search results could cause traffic to plummet because people might not click through to their websites. The DOJ has suggested publishers should be allowed to opt out of having their content displayed as AI-generated content or used to train AI models capable of summarizing text.\nThe Trump effect\nIt\u2019s unclear what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for antitrust enforcement. Trump has signaled he\u2019s wary about breaking up Google, but has also been critical of Big Tech.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous thing because we want to have great companies \u2014 we don\u2019t want China to have these companies,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg in October. \u201cRight now, China is afraid of Google.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s views on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, electric vehicles and other issues could reshape the tech industry.\nWilliam Kovacic, a George Washington University law professor and former Federal Trade Commission chairman, said Democrats and Republicans are skeptical of powerful tech companies for different reasons. Republicans such as Trump have accused Google of suppressing conservative speech and being politically biased, which it has denied.\nMoreover, it was under the Trump administration that the DOJ sued Google, Kovacic noted.\n\u201cIn many ways,\u201d Kovacic said, \u201cit\u2019s in the judges\u2019 hands now, but I don\u2019t see the Justice Department backing off.\u201d\nTimes researcher Scott Wilson contributed to this report."

      "text": "Apple loses bid to dismiss Justice Department antitrust suit\n- Share via\nApple Inc. lost its bid to throw out an antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general on Monday, a victory for the aggressive posture taken during the Biden administration and carried on by enforcers under President Trump.\nThe lawsuit is an existential threat to Apple and could upend its highly lucrative mobile hardware business. The iPhone maker is accused of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices.\nThe government claims Apple has used its power over app distribution and the iPhone\u2019s features to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones.\nIn this early stage of the case, \u201callegations of this nature, which indicate that Apple acts in a manner to protect its monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone market, are sufficient,\u201d U.S. District Judge Julien Xavier Neals in New Jersey wrote in a 33-page ruling.\nNeals also said the allegations about Apple\u2019s intent to monopolize the smartphone market are strong enough to continue. The \u201ccomplaint includes numerous statements allegedly made by Apple executives regarding the barriers set in place to maintain its monopoly.\u201d\nDOJ representatives declined to comment. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe ruling tees up years of litigation. Neals has not yet set a trial date, but antitrust cases can take years to resolve, including appeals. The DOJ sued Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google over its search business in October 2020, with a judge ruling four years later that the company violated the law.\nApple could still seek to settle the case \u2014 filed in March 2024 \u2014 with the Trump administration, though the Justice Department\u2019s new antitrust head, Gail Slater, said at her confirmation hearing that she plans to largely continue the strict enforcement of her predecessors.\nIn addition to the Google search suit, the U.S. has targeted Google\u2019s advertising technology business as well as Visa Inc., Live Nation Inc. and Thoma Bravo-backed real estate software company RealPage Inc.\nIn a November hearing, lawyers for Apple urged Neals to toss the case because it failed to state how the iPhone maker\u2019s alleged monopoly has harmed any consumers or developers.\nApple\u2019s lawyers also argued that Apple has a legal right to choose with whom it does business and has no duty to boost the fortunes of its competitors.\nApple has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services, according to the lawsuit.\nThe judge said those claims can proceed.\n\u201cTo the extent Apple argues it can limit access to its \u2018own proprietary technology available to third parties,\u2019 the court finds this contention is a factual dispute that must be resolved through discovery,\u201d Neals wrote, alluding to pretrial information exchanges.\nThe DOJ says the case is not about Apple refusing to do business with rivals. Rather, it accuses Apple of using its dominant position in the smartphone market to block competitors, a lawyer for the DOJ said at the hearing.

      "text": "Google won\u2019t be forced to sell its Chrome browser, judge rules\n- Share via\nA federal judge ruled Tuesday against the U.S. government\u2019s proposal that Google should sell its Chrome web browser to restore competition in online search, saving the tech giant from having to spin off one of its biggest businesses.\nIn the more than 200-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said forcing Google to divest Chrome went too far and the remedy was a \u201cpoor fit for this case.\u201d\nSince the web browser relies on the tech company\u2019s systems, breaking up Chrome from Google would also be \u201cincredibly messy and highly risky,\u201d the judge wrote.\nThe ruling is a partial win for Google, falling short of the bigger changes the government proposed. But it could still affect other tech companies that face scrutiny over their dominance.\nShares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, surged more than 7% in early after-hours trading following the announcement.\nUnder the ruling, Google would still be required to make other changes. The company would be barred from entering exclusive contracts tied to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app, the tech company\u2019s AI assistant.\nIt would also be required to offer certain rivals search data and services to help them compete with the search giant as they develop their own technology, the ruling stated.\n\u201cWe have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we\u2019re reviewing the decision closely,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.\nMehta acknowledged that the rise of artificial intelligence chatbots that can generate answers to questions may become \u201cgame changers\u201d in the future, but they have yet to replace search engines.\n\u201cGoogle is still the dominant firm in the relevant product markets. No existing rival has wrested market share from Google. And no new competitor has entered the market,\u201d Mehta wrote in the decision.\nGoogle, however, wasn\u2019t barred from paying or offering \u201cother considerations\u201d to partners such as Apple if the companies placed its search engine, Chrome or its generative AI products on browsers and mobile devices by default.\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, called that decision a \u201cmonster win\u201d for both Google and Apple. \u201cWe now see a green light for a bigger Gemini AI partnership between Apple and Google with this DOJ case now in the rear view mirror,\u201d he wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nIn another victory for Google, the judge also ruled that the company wasn\u2019t required to tweak its policies to give website publishers more choice in how the search giant uses their content because that fix \u201cbears no relationship to Google\u2019s unlawful acts.\u201d\nNews publishers are worried that the rise of AI, which can quickly summarize articles, will result in traffic drops to websites.\n\u201cGoogle is forcing content creators to give away their content to be used in its AI offerings in order to remain in Google Search,\u201d Danielle Coffey, president and chief executive of the News/Media Alliance, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a no-win scenario that will continue to harm publishers that invest in high-quality, journalistic and creative content.\u201d (The L.A. Times is a member of the News/Media Alliance).\nSome of the companies trying to take on Google said they didn\u2019t think the changes would open the door for more rivals. Gabriel Weinberg, founder and chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-oriented web browser, urged Congress to take action.\n\u201cGoogle will still be allowed to continue to use its monopoly to hold back competitors, including in AI search,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, consumers will continue to suffer.\u201d\nThe judgment will last six years and take effect 60 days upon entry, the decision said.\nThe highly watched decision came after a three-week hearing that concluded in May, in which lawyers for the U.S. government and Google argued over how to fix the tech giant\u2019s search monopoly.\nLast year, Mehta ruled that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in online search, pointing to exclusive agreements the company struck with Apple, Samsung, AT&T and others to be the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., disagreed with the ruling.\nGoogle, the Mountain View-based search and digital advertising giant, is facing increasing scrutiny as the government has recommended it be broken up and its lucrative search index opened to rivals.\nThe Department of Justice and several states proposed several ways to fix Google\u2019s monopoly, including forcing the company to sell Chrome, a web browser the agency described as the \u201cgateway to the internet.\u201d\nGoogle said the government\u2019s proposal went too far and would harm consumers and America\u2019s technological leadership. Instead, the company suggested more narrow solutions that would make its contracts with wireless carriers and mobile device makers less restrictive.\nThe Tuesday decision was the same court\u2019s call on how far it needed to go to fix the monopoly.\nThe antitrust case stems from a lawsuit the Department of Justice and multiple states filed against Google in 2020, under the Trump administration, alleging it illegally operated as a monopoly.\nSince then, online search has evolved, with more people turning to short videos and AI chatbots such as ChatGPT to find information or summarize search results.\nGoogle has been trying to race ahead as OpenAI, Meta and others compete to dominate AI. Google shows AI-generated summaries of search results, released an \u201cAI mode\u201d in search and has a virtual assistant called Gemini.\nAI companies, including OpenAI in San Francisco, had expressed interest in buying Google Chrome ahead of the judge\u2019s decision. In August, AI startup Perplexity made a bold bid to purchase Google Chrome for $34.5 billion. (The Los Angeles Times partners with Perplexity to generate summaries of ideas expressed in opinion pieces.)\nIn the second quarter, Google\u2019s revenue reached $96.43 billion, up roughly 14% compared with the same period last year. The company\u2019s net income jumped 19% to $28.19 billion.\nGoogle has been such a dominant player in search for so many years that it has become a top target for regulators, courts and rivals looking to force more competition.\nEven with rising competition from ChatGPT and other AI bots, the Chrome browser maintains a global market share of more than 60%, according to some analysts. This, critics say, still could give Google an unfair advantage.\nThere are concerns that it is locking out competition. Google currently pays Apple billions of dollars a year to be the default search engine on its Safari browser. The Justice Department has been trying to prevent Google from receiving preferential treatment on devices that use Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system.\nAlphabet isn\u2019t the only tech giant under fire. Courts have also been weighing whether Apple, Meta and others have been using their size to stifle competition.\nWhile concerns have been raised that Alphabet might have to spin off its Google search engine business, its shares have performed well. Before the Tuesday decision, Alphabet shares were up more than 25% over the previous 12-month period. The benchmark, tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed about 20% during the same period."

      "text": "Google loses appeal in antitrust battle with \u2018Fortnite\u2019 maker Epic Games\n- Share via\nA federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google\u2019s Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that\u2019s designed to give consumers more choices.\nThe unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaw monopolies since late 2023.\nThe unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.\nThe jury\u2019s December 2023 rebuke of Google\u2019s app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgments against the company\u2019s ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.\nAlthough not as lucrative as Google\u2019s search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company\u2019s own payment processing system.\nFollowing a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company\u2019s appeal to overturn the jury\u2019s finding and void the judge\u2019s mandated shakeup.\nBut a three-judge panel that heard Google\u2019s appeal in February rejected its lawyers\u2019 contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic\u2019s case against the iPhone maker\u2019s app store.\nEpic\u2019s lawsuit \u201cwas replete with evidence that Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance, causing the Play Store to benefit from network effects,\u201d the judges wrote in the decision.\nThe ruling \u201cwill significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem,\u201d Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a statement.\nUnless Google can extend the enforcement delay placed on Donato\u2019s order issued last October, the company will have to begin an overhaul that includes making the Play Store\u2019s entire library of more than 2 million Android apps available to would-be rivals and also help distribute the alternative options. Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.\nBut Epic\u2019s lawyers have ridiculed Google\u2019s warnings about the changes as scare tactics in a desperate attempt to protect the fortunes of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.\nAlthough Epic fell short in its attempt to have the iPhone\u2019s app store declared a monopoly, that case resulted in a judge issuing an order that required Apple to surrender exclusive control over the payment processing of in-app transactions and allow links to alternative systems without collecting a commission.\nBesides being hit with Donato\u2019s order, Google still faces further trouble ahead that could leave an even bigger dent in its finances.\nAs part of the effort to address Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search, a federal judge is weighing a proposal by the U.S. Justice Department that would require the sale of its Chrome web browser and ban the multibillion-dollar deals that company has been making with Apple and others to lock in its search engine as the main gateway to the internet.\nGoogle is also facing a proposed breakup of its advertising technology as part of the countermeasures to its monopoly in that business. A trial on that proposal is scheduled to begin in September.\nLiedtke writes for the Associated Press."

  "argos_summary": "A federal judge ruled that Google will not be required to divest its Chrome browser, sparing Alphabet from the most severe antitrust penalties. The decision, while a partial win for Google, still imposes limits such as banning exclusive contracts tied to its search and AI products and requiring data sharing with rivals. Alphabet\u2019s shares rose about 9% following the ruling, reflecting market optimism about the outcome. The judge noted that while AI chatbots may become game\u2011changing, they currently do not threaten Google\u2019s dominant search position. The ruling is expected to take effect 60 days after entry and will last six years.",
