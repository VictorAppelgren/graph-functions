      "text": "Bill Belichick\u2019s UNC debut goes from celeb-filled party to total disaster after months of hype\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.\nA festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.\nAfter that, well, Monday night\u2019s hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU \u2014 along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can\u2019t just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.\n\u201cWe played competitively but then just couldn\u2019t sustain it,\u201d Belichick said in a familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \u201cObviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\u201d\nThe blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick\u2019s college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.\n\u201cIt was a great environment tonight,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cI mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn\u2019t do enough to keep it going. We\u2019ve got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\u201d\nBy the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.\nIt was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost\u2019s athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception, and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year\u2019s opener at Minnesota.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just moving forward, just moving forward,\u201d said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick\u2019s famous \u201cWe\u2019re on to Cincinnati\u201d response to reporters\u2019 questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.\nUNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick\u2019s mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.\nSo there was spectacle to Belichick\u2019s debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie \u2014 only this one bearing the name \u201cCarolina Football\u201d in that distinctive shade of light blue.\nAn estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team\u2019s walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick\u2019s arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.\nThere were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick\u2019s 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.\nBelichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.\nOnce there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.\nThe Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.\nTCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \u201cother\u201d team in Deion Sanders\u2019 debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez\u2019s sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.\nIt quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.\nAnd finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez\u2019s fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.\nBy the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.\n\u201cThey were clearly the better team tonight,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThey deserved to win and they did it decisively.\u201d"

      "text": "Backed by Chicago-based Rush Street Interactive, with numerous brick-and-mortar casinos in multiple states, BetRivers Sportsbook is one of many operators competing in the aggressive online sports betting industry.\nTo entice potential bettors to give them a try, BetRivers is currently offering new users a 2nd Chance Bet worth up to $500 in select states! Michigan and Pennsylvania players can claim a 2nd Chance Bet up to $500, while New Jersey-based users can claim a 2nd Chance Bet up to $250. In West Virginia, first-time players can claim a 2nd Chance Bet up to $100!\nI\u2019m here to guide potential new users through the brand\u2019s bonus code, its terms and conditions, and what users can expect from BetRivers Sportsbook.\nMore on the BetRivers Bonus Code\n- How I Tested BetRivers Sportsbook\n- What Is the BetRivers Bonus Code?\n- Pros and Cons of BetRivers Sportsbook\n- What Makes BetRivers Sportsbook Unique?\n- BetRivers Bonus Code FAQs\nHow I Tested BetRivers Sportsbook\nI considered factors ranging from user experience to live streaming features when testing BetRivers Sportsbook.\nFor starters, the app offers a new shine on a familiar interface. The newer branding makes the layout much cleaner while retaining the same level of data density the app previously had. The primary menu above the homepage offers a mixture of markets and promotions, which helps direct users to the different BetRivers offerings.\nAs for live streaming, BetRivers was one of the first online sportsbooks to incorporate this feature into its app. Unfortunately, the operator doesn\u2019t have the same partnerships as other high-profile platforms, so its live streaming options are limited to smaller European soccer leagues, Korean baseball, and other less mainstream sports.\nWhat Is the BetRivers Bonus Code?\nTo incentivize new users to join BetRivers Sportsbook, the operator offers a 2nd Chance Bet worth up to $500 in Pennsylvania and Michigan, $250 in New Jersey and $100 in West Virginia. There\u2019s no actual bonus code needed to register, as users can simply click on the offer link that corresponds to their state:\n- Pennsylvania: 2nd Chance Bet up to $500\n- Michigan: 2nd Chance Bet up to $500\n- New Jersey: 2nd Chance Bet up to $250\n- West Virginia: 2nd Chance Bet up to $100\nTo be eligible for the bonus, new users must register via the links in this article, deposit at least $10, and make a minimum wager on any market. If the qualifying wager loses, the amount of your first bet will be refunded to you in the form of bonus bets.\nThe bonus bets users receive from the promotion also have limitations. They can only be used for wagers with odds of -200 or longer. For parlays, each leg must have odds of -200 or longer.\nLike most bonus bet promotions offered by the best sports betting sites, with BetRivers, only the winnings from bonus bet wagers are credited to the user\u2019s account. The 2nd Chance bonus will expire from a user\u2019s account after 14 days.\nPros and Cons of BetRivers Sportsbook\nThroughout my time testing BetRivers Sportsbook, I noticed the following pros and cons:\nBetRivers Sportsbook Pros\n- Quality rewards program (iRush Rewards)\n- Active customer service presence\n- Generous 2nd Chance Bet offer for new users\nBetRivers Sportsbook Cons\n- Moneyline odds are not competitive when compared to other sportsbooks\n- Offers frequent promotions, but lots of red tape in the terms and conditions\n- Reports of a clunky interface in app reviews\nWhat Makes BetRivers Sportsbook Unique?\nWhile BetRivers has some areas where it has difficulty competing with larger sportsbooks, there are definitely some areas where its features and promotions stand out.\nOne of the best features it has is the iRush Rewards loyalty program, which offers a tiered promotional structure for bettors. What starts with exclusive promotions can eventually result in in-person VIP experiences, depending on how much you wager regularly.\nI also appreciate BetRivers\u2019 referral program, where bettors who refer friends who deposit and wager at least $50 within 30 days of receiving the referral offer can receive a spin on the bonus wheel that determines their reward.\nAnd, if you\u2019re a college basketball fan like me, you\u2019ll love that BetRivers goes all out for March Madness. During March, bettors can expect frequent boosts and promotions focused on college basketball.\nBetRivers Bonus Code FAQs\nBelow are a few common questions surrounding BetRivers and its bonus code:\nIs BetRivers Sportsbook legit?\nYes. BetRivers Sportsbook is a competitive online sportsbook with a large brick-and-mortar casino footprint across multiple states. The operator does a good job of providing a pleasant user experience to its existing user base.\nIn what states is BetRivers Sportsbook legal?\nBetRivers Sportsbook is legal in 15 states at the moment, including:\n- Arizona\n- Colorado\n- Delaware\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Illinois\n- Louisiana\n- Maryland\n- Michigan\n- New Jersey\n- New York\n- Ohio\n- Pennsylvania\n- Virginia\n- West Virginia\nWhat is the BetRivers bonus code?\nYou don\u2019t need to enter a BetRivers bonus code at registration to claim the site\u2019s 2nd Chance Bet welcome offer \u2014 just click on the links in this article to claim it today!"

      "text": "Our betting expert teaches you everything you need to know on how to bet on baseball online. Baseball betting is a different type of betting altogether, with the most popular wagers on the moneyline. Take a look at our full guide on how to bet on baseball, and get involved in the next MLB campaign.\nMore on How to Bet on Baseball\n- Betting on Baseball Explained\n- Types of Baseball Bets\n- Baseball Betting Tips & Tricks\n- Best MLB Teams\n- How to bet on Baseball FAQs\nBetting on Baseball Explained\nWhen it comes to placing your best on baseball online, you will come across a large selection of different markets to choose from. The Post breaks down each of them, and explains the most popular baseball betting markets.\nBaseball Moneyline Market\nMoneyline betting is arguably the most common and popular form of sports bet you can make, and this does not differ for baseball. Simply put, moneyline betting is when you bet on the overall winner of the match you\u2019re wagering on.\nThe moneyline market for a baseball game may look something like this:\n| Team | Moneyline Odds |\n| New York Yankees | -200 |\n| Boston Red Sox | +170 |\nMoneyline markets will only offer you two choices to choose from when placing your bets, which makes them one of the easy-to-understand sports betting markets out there.\nBaseball Spread Betting\nSpread betting is a market offered by sports betting sites that\u2019s used to even out the odds between the favorites and the underdogs. In baseball, the spread may also be referred to as the run line, which is just baseball\u2019s version of the spread.\nFor those new to betting, spread betting is where the favorite is handed a specific number of points handicap, with the underdog being given the same number of points as a head start.\nShould you bet on the favorites to cover the spread, they must win by more points than they\u2019re handicapped by. If you\u2019ve wagered on the underdog, they will need to lose the game by less points than the head start they have been given, or even just win the game altogether.\nWhen betting on spread markets for baseball, the spread will look something along the lines of this:\n| Team | Spread |\n| New York Yankees | (-1.5) -110 |\n| New York Mets | (+1.5) +150 |\nIn this scenario, if you\u2019re betting your money on the Yankees to cover the spread, you\u2019d need them to win the match by two or more points.\nIf you\u2019re betting on the Mets to run the spread, you need the Mets to lose by less than one. Alternatively, if the Mets won the game, or it ended in a tie, your bet would be a winner.\nBaseball Totals and Over/Unders Markets\nWhen betting on the totals market, you are betting on whether the total number of points scored in the match will be over or under the total that has been predetermined by the sports betting apps.\nFor example, if you were to place your money on a bet of over 9.5 total points for a baseball game, you will need the two teams\u2019 combined run totals to equal 10 or more, with the market for the totals looking something like this.\n| Total Points 9.5 | Odds |\n| Over | -115 |\n| Under | -105 |\nIn addition to betting on the number of total points scored, you are also able to wager on an individual team\u2019s total runs scored.\nIn this scenario, you would need the team you\u2019re betting on to score over or under a certain amount of runs, with this market looking like this:\n| Team | Total Runs Over 5.5 |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates | +105 |\n| New York Yankees | -125 |\nBaseball Grand Salami\nOne of the most fun bets to place on Baseball, the Grand Salami is a total or over/under bet taken to a whole new level. As opposed to just the number of points scored in a single contest, the Grand Salami revolves around the total amount scored for an entire slate of games.\nIt\u2019s most typically offered for MLB and NHL betting, given the large number of games taking place on any given day. The estimated total for a day\u2019s worth of games is posted by the sportsbook, and bettors then decide if they like the final number to be over or under that amount.\nIn its simplest form, it works just like a total or over/under bet for an individual game, except your wager includes every game from that given day.\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example, using a six-game schedule to help paint the picture. Here\u2019s what the over/under may look like for a random six-game slate.\n| Game | Over/Under Total |\n| Baltimore Orioles vs. Boston Red Sox | 8.0 |\n| Minnesota Twins vs. Chicago White Sox | 8.5 |\n| Seattle Mariners vs. Los Angeles Angels | 7.5 |\n| Philadelphia Phillies vs New York Mets | 9.0 |\n| New York Yankees vs. Oakland Athletics | 8.0 |\n| Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Colorado Rockies | 9.5 |\nIf we add up all of the total for these six games, we come up with 50.5. However, remember that sportsbooks won\u2019t necessarily be setting the bar exactly there.\nThey\u2019ll often increase the line for the Giant Salami, making it tougher for you bettors to win. As such, they raise the bar to 55.5 for the slate as a whole and release the following odds to the public.\n- Over 54.5 (-110)\n- Under 54.5 (-110)\nThe odds for the Grand Salami will fluctuate based on market action, but you\u2019ll typically find them in the range of +100 to -120.\nIf you\u2019ve backed the Over, in order for your bet to win you would need the total runs in these games to be 55 or greater.\nThe beauty of the Grand Salami, compared to a parlay of over/under, means that if the Orioles and Red Sox only combine for five runs, but the Mariners and Angels go head to head and score 19 combined runs, your bet is still in a good place.\nThe Grand Salami can vary depending on how many games the sportsbook decides to include, and how many games are occurring on that given day. Don\u2019t be surprised if you see a 15-game grand salami on a certain day, with all teams in action.\nBaseball Prop Betting\nProp betting involves bets that don\u2019t necessarily relate to the overall winner of a baseball match or how many points were scored, but instead relate to other specific events and scenarios that can happen during the game itself.\nPlayer prop bets are a common and fun way of betting on baseball, as they allow you to mix up your betting and wager your money on more unique markets and picks, without relying on the overall outcome of the game.\nPlayer props are one of the most popular prop bets, wagering on whether a certain player will score the first home run, how many points they\u2019re going to score overall or how many outs a pitcher is going to make.\nAs well as this, there will also be game prop markets available, allowing you to bet on whether you think there will be extra innings played or not, which team will reach a certain number of points first and whether the total number of points scored will be odd or even.\nSome of the most common baseball prop bets are listed below:\nTeam Props\n- Team to score first in the game\n- Will there be a run scored in the first inning?\n- Total Hits, Runs and Errors for both teams combined (over/under)\n- First team to reach 3 runs in the game\n- Specific team\u2019s total runs (over/under)\n- Total Home Runs hit in the game combined (over/under)\nPlayer Props\n- Total Hits, Runs and RBI\u2019s (over/under)\n- Total Strikeouts (over/under)\n- Will a player hit a Home Run? (Basically over/under 0.5)\n- Most Hits, Runs and RBI\u2019s (player vs player)\n- Most Strikeouts (pitcher vs pitcher)\nBaseball Parlay Betting\nParlay betting has become one of the most popular ways to wager in the US, combining multiple picks from two or more different games in order to create one larger bet with increased odds.\nThe more picks, or legs, you include in your parlay bet, the higher the odds will end up being. This can lead to a smaller stake returning a big payout, often enticing bettors into creating parlays.\nHowever, as great as the odds and excitement are, it\u2019s important to remember that all of your selections must win in order for your parlay bet to win.\nThe higher the odds for your parlay bet highlight how difficult they are to win, as you need multiple picks to be successful for your bet to win overall.\nAll of the best baseball betting sites will offer parlay betting on baseball games, with these sportsbooks offering pre-selected parlays, but you of course are able to create your own.\nFor example, a parlay bet on the MLB may look something like this:\n| Parlay Bet | Odds |\n| NY Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles all to win | +625 |\nIn order for this parlay to pay out, you would need the Yankees, Pirates and Orioles to win their respective games.\nLive/In-play Baseball Betting\nLive betting, also known as in-play betting, is wagering on baseball matches whilst the game is going on.\nAn example of in-play betting could be betting on a team to score a certain number of home runs in a particular inning, or whether a certain team will win specific innings.\nLive betting is a fantastic feature as it allows you to see how the match is playing out before wagering your money on any bets. The best baseball betting sites will offer a range of live betting markets, and even offer live streaming of these baseball games.\nAn example of a live bet could be if the Yankees are playing the Athletics and the Yankees score three home runs in a row, the Athletics \u2019 moneyline odds will increase, allowing you to then bet on them to win the moneyline at higher odds.\nAlternatively, if the Yankees lose their pitcher through injury, and the backup comes in, you could bet on the Athletics to score over 1.5 runs in that innings.\nLive betting is great if you are streaming the game live, or perhaps even attending the game yourself!\nBaseball Enhanced Odds\nAn enhanced odds bet is when the sports betting site increases the odds of a certain bet to a higher value than the initial price.\nEnhanced odds wagers are excellent, as they allow you to get higher odds on your pick in comparison to what you were getting before, which allows you to win more money.\nFor a competition such as Major League Baseball, a lot of sports betting sites will be offering enhanced odds bets on futures, parlays or even single bets.\nFor MLB, an enhanced odds bet may look something along the lines of this:\n| Moneyline | Previous Odds | Enhanced Odds |\n| New York Mets | +110 | +250 |\nMost of the time, enhanced odds will only be available for new customers, however, they are also made available for existing customers on occasion as well. Make sure to keep an eye out for any enhanced odds on the MLB this season.\nBaseball Futures Bets\nFuture wagers are exactly as they sound, in that they are wagers that aren\u2019t going to be paid off until sometime down the road.\nIn MLB betting, that could mean taking a team to win the World Series months before the playoffs even start, backing a squad to win their respective division, or winning over or under a certain total of games.\nFuture wagers even exist for the individual with things like Rookie of the Year and the MLB MVP. A futures market for the World Series Winner would look something like this:\n| Team | World Series Winner Odds |\n| Atlanta Braves | +500 |\n| Houston Astros | +650 |\n| Tampa Bay Rays | +750 |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | +800 |\n| New York Mets | +1100 |\n| San Diego Padres | +1100 |\nFutures bets can be placed before and during the season, with the odds consistently changing depending on teams\u2019 performances.\nCheck Out the Best Sports Betting Sites and Apps\n- Check out the best sports betting sites\n- Download the best sports betting apps\nBaseball Betting Tips & Tricks\nAvoid Heavy Favorites\nThe casual bettors will always take the favorites, given the ease and lack of thought behind these bets. Sportsbooks recognize this, and will often adjust their lines accordingly. Popular teams such as the Red Sox, Yankees, Cubs, and Dodgers will often be overpriced as they are the nation\u2019s favorite baseball outfits.\nIf these teams enter as favorites, many folks will back these sides regardless of odds, with betting sites increasing their odds from -150 to -200.\nRegular season favorites have a 63% win rate since 2005, with that record appearing impressive. However, because the favorite\u2019s odds are at such small prices, you would end up losing over time.\nDue to the short odds, a win for the favorite results in a small payout, but when they lose, you\u2019ll miss out big time. Don\u2019t fall into the habit of backing the favorites every time, the odds simply aren\u2019t worth it.\nCheck the Forecast\nSomething most of us do every day, but checking the weather forecast can massively aid your baseball bets. When the wind is blowing in towards the batters at 5mph or more, the under line has landed 55.1% of the time since 2005.\nStrong blowing winds result in usual homers dropping short, or into the hands of the outfielders, leading to more outs, and ultimately fewer runs.\nOf course, this works the other way around, if the wind is blowing out, the ball can travel further, resulting in more runs. As of the 2021 MLB season, since 2005, when the wind is blowing out at 8mph or more, the oven has landed 52.9% of the time.\nWhilst this may not seem like a massive percentage, any edge you can gain over online sportsbooks is a good one and can help you come to conclusions regarding your bets.\nNotably, San Francisco Giants\u2019 AT&T Park has averaged the strongest winds in MLB since 2015, with an average wind speed of 11.8mph, and a high of 22mph!\nSeattle Mariners\u2019 Safeco Field has the lowest wind speeds in the league, with an average of 2.5 mph wind, and an all-time high of 6mph.\nShop for the Best Odds\nOne of the biggest mistakes new bettors make when baseball betting is making wagers through only one sports betting site. This is a bad idea because it forces bettors to play whatever number their book is offering.\nInstead, we suggest opening multiple accounts at several different books so you can shop for the best line. For example, say you want to bet on the Yankees Moneyline. Caesars is offering odds of +130, but BetMGM is giving you +135. By having access to more than one book, you are able to take advantage of a little extra bang for your buck.\nIt may not seem like a big deal, but it can make a world of difference in the long run, leading to increased payouts and lower losses.\nBest Major League Baseball Teams\nThe most successful Major League Baseball side resides right here, in the city of New York. The Yankees have won 27 world series, but are currently on a 13-year drought.\n| Team | Number of World Series Titles | Year Last Won |\n| New York Yankees (AL) | 27 | 2009 |\n| St Louis Cardinals (NL) | 11 | 2013 |\n| Oakland Athletics (AL) | 9 | 1990 |\n| Boston Red Sox (AL) | 9 | 2018 |\n| San Francisco Giants (NL) | 8 | 2014 |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers (NL) | 7 | 2020 |\nHow to bet on Baseball FAQs\nHow do you bet on MLB games?\nThere are a number of ways you can bet on MLB games. When wagering on Major League Baseball, you can bet on the moneyline, the runline (point spread), totals (over/under) futures, player and team props (strikeouts, RBIs, and home runs), parlays, and you can bet live (in-play).\nIs it legal to bet on baseball?\nYes, you can legally bet on MLB games online, as long as you reside in a state where online sports betting is legal. Find out where online sports betting is legal in the USA.\nWhat are the best baseball bets?\nThere are many ways to bet on baseball, each suited to different wagering styles. If you\u2019re a rookie when it comes to baseball, sticking to simple wagers is probably best. Consider making straightforward moneyline bets, or totals bets.\nAdvanced fans may want to venture into more exotic wagers, such as parlays and other multipliers. These markets allow expert players to leverage their knowledge to fine-tune their wagers and odds.\nCan I bet on college baseball?\nYes, though with some restrictions. College sports betting rules differ for each state, and it isn\u2019t as widely legal as professional sports betting. The NCAA still objects to all forms of college sports betting, actively lobbying for state bans.\nIn New York, you are unable to bet on any college baseball taking place in the state of New York, or wager on any New York-based colleges playing outside of the state.\nCan I bet on the winner of the world series?\nYes, you are able to bet on the World Series. Ahead of the tournament, you can place your bets using the futures markets. You can place an outright bet on a specific team to win the World Series before the season even begins.\nDuring the World Series, you can wager on the matches and overall winner. Plenty of betting markets is available at the time, including live betting markets during the games. It\u2019s an extremely active time for baseball betting fans, and bookmakers make it worth their while.\n- Check out the latest World Series Winner Odds"

      "text": "Don\u2019t twist Kirk Herbstreit\u2019s words.\nThe ESPN college football analyst was caught on a hot mic at the start of the fourth quarter of TCU\u2019s 48-14 beatdown of North Carolina saying, \u201cYou\u2019re bad,\u201d while letting out a loud groan.\nHerbstreit\u2019s comment raised some eyebrows during an otherwise boring game in Bill Belichick\u2019s Tar Heels coaching debut, and went viral after both the Bartstool X account and the X account for the popular Barstool podcast \u201cPardon My Take\u201d posted the audio.\nHe first quote tweeted the \u201cPardon My Take\u201d post, which had the caption, \u201cThey\u2019re bad,\u201d with the implication being that Herbstreit made the remark about a North Carolina team that trailed, 41-14, at home entering the fourth quarter.\n\u201c(I) Said \u2018you\u2019re bad\u2019 to my spotter Deron for something he said as we were coming back on air. Manipulation at its finest!\u201d Herbstreit wrote at 12:01 a.m. ET.\nSeven minutes later, he went after the Bartstool post that read, \u201c\u2018They\u2019re bad.\u2019 Kirk Herbstreit got caught on the hot mic.\u201d\n\u201cMust be a slow night..not sure why this is so confusing,\u201d Herbstreit wrote. \u201cI said \u2018YOU\u2019RE bad\u2019 to my spotter Deron for something funny he said when we were just coming back on air.\u201d\nHerbstreit later added that calling blowouts like Monday\u2019s game is incredibly difficult when the score is so lopsided with 15 minutes remaining.\n\u201cInstead of making up things I said how bout giving Rece (Davis), Holly (Rowe), and I some love for getting through that game \u2013- those games are by far the toughest games you announcers have to call,\u201d he posted.\nHe also retweeted a post from Tony Granieri, a spotter for ESPN, who tweeted that he stood three feet to Herbstreit\u2019s right in the booth and the analyst indeed said \u201cyou\u2019re bad.\u201d\nFolks ran with the audio after a much-hyped North Carolina debut for Belichick instead turned into one of the ugliest losses of his career.\nNorth Carolina had a well-scripted first drive where it scored a touchdown to grab a 7-0 lead before things totally unraveled from there.\nThe Tar Heels had an uneven performance on both sides of the ball, but their quarterback play was especially troubling.\nGio Lopez completed just 4 of 10 passes for 69 yards and threw a terrible pick-six to bury them in the first half, giving the Horned Frogs a 17-7 lead.\nHe was eventually benched for Max Johnson, who did a better job in mop-up duty.\n\u201cObviously, we have a lot of work to do,\u201d Belichick said postgame. \u201cWe need to do a better job all around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game. It wasn\u2019t up to what it needs to be. I know we\u2019re a lot better than that.\n\u201cThey outplayed us, out-coached us, and they were just better than we were tonight. That\u2019s all there was to it. They did a lot more things right than we did. Give them credit for being the better team.\u201d\nThe Tar Heels are set to face Charlotte on Saturday in their next test."

We\u2019re on hand to take you through and explain some of the ones on offer.\nBe sure to remember to thoroughly read the terms and conditions of any sign-up offer you go to use before doing so to make sure you know exactly what they are and how they work.\nDeposit-match bonus offers are one of the sign-up offers you\u2019re most likely to come across when choosing your betting site. A deposit-match bonus is essentially where the sports betting site matches the initial deposit you make into your sportsbook account.\nFor example, if you initially deposit $500 into your account, you will be given $500 in site credits that you can wager with.\nWherever you choose to sign up, make sure to take advantage of the sign-up offer available, as they are a great way of starting off your new sportsbook account in the right way. Theres plenty of sportsbook bonus codes available, so make sure you make the most of them.\nBaseball Enhanced Odds\nEnhanced odds bets are another common sign-up promotion used by sports betting sites, with these types of offers allowing you to get boosted odds on a pre-selected bet.\nFor example, if the Chicago White Sox are +1000 to win the World Series, their odds could be increased to +3000 through the use of a sign-up offer, allowing you to get much higher odds than you were before for the exact same pick.\nMLB Bonus Bets\nBonus bets are used regularly by sports betting sites in an attempt to convince people to sign-up with them and become a customer.\nEssentially, bonus bets allow you to place bets on either any market of your choice or pre-selected markets, without the risk of losing any money.\nMLB bonus bets are a great way to make your balance go a little further. For example, baseball betting sites may offer customers a bonus live bet if they place a pre-match wager on a selected game.\nThe best baseball betting sites may also offer cross-sport bonus bets. You could place a wager on an NBA regular-season game, and earn yourself a bonus bet to use on Major League Baseball.\nBonus bets are excellent as they allow you to place riskier bets with high odds, ones you wouldn\u2019t normally choose to go with otherwise, without risk.\nLive Baseball Betting\nWhen deciding on your baseball betting site, their live betting markets are another important factor to take into consideration. One of the major parts of baseball betting is the in-play markets, due to the length of the games.\nA large section of the sports betting sites available will offer similar in-play MLB markets to one another, although despite this, it\u2019s still important to do your research before choosing a bookie to do your live betting with.\nSpeed is one of the, if not the, most important factor when it comes to betting in-play, thus the speed at which you can place bets on either their desktop site or mobile app should come into consideration when picking your sports betting site.\nLive MLB odds will be changing minute-by-minute given the pace the sports goes at, thus it\u2019s important you choose a betting site whose user interface and the simplicity of their site/app is one that suits you best.\nCheck Out the Best Sports Betting Sites and Apps\n- Check out the best sports betting sites\n- Download the best sports betting apps\nBenefits of betting on baseball online\nIt\u2019s fair to say that betting on baseball online has its perks in comparison to physical, in-person betting. As online sports betting becomes more available across the country, check out the best of betting on baseball online.\nBaseball live streaming\nA large number of online betting sites will offer live streaming on a number of different sporting events, including games from the current MLB season.\nHowever, only a selection of these betting sites will offer free live streaming on baseball, with the rest requiring you to either have funds in your account or have placed a bet on the match you\u2019re trying to stream.\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s important to do your research and look around for which sites offer the live streaming service for baseball and the MLB.\nVariety of Baseball Markets\nBetting online has some major benefits, with one of these being the huge selection of markets available in comparison to physical, in-person wagering.\nNearly all online sports betting sites will offer a larger, broader selection of markets and bets when compared to an in-person sportsbook.\nWorldwide markets will be available, as well as college baseball betting. Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan is available on select baseball betting sites, so if the NPB is of interest, make sure to select your baseball betting site wisely.\nThis, therefore, means that, with all the different MLB markets and bets available, you can go through and choose the ones that look best to you.\nWide range of statistics and data\nDue to the nature and pace of baseball, there is plenty of data available for bettors online, all of which can be used to help place your bets. Everything that happens in the game is recorded, so you end up with huge spreadsheets full of data and in-game statistics, many of which are available on baseball betting sites.\nHowever, there are not just databases on in-game occurrences only; you can find statistics on umpires, park factors, the weather, and just about anything else that can potentially affect a contest.\nFurthermore, the information from years prior stays relevant longer in baseball.

      "text": "US Olympic legend Greg Louganis sells his medals, home to start a new life abroad: \u2018I needed the money\u2019\nHe is making his boldest leap yet.\nUS Olympic legend Greg Louganis has parted with his California home and three of his cherished Olympic medals to launch a bold new chapter of life abroad.\nThe diving icon, 65, who is widely acclaimed as possibly the greatest diver in history, revealed that he \u201cneeded the money\u201d from his house and medals to be able to start afresh overseas.\nLouganis, who won five Olympic medals between 1976 and 1988, revealed that he had bid adieu to the US and relocated to Panama.\n\u201cSo, as life moves forward, what are you prepared to leave behind?\u201d he wrote on Facebook over the weekend.\n\u201cI am 65 years old, and I am asking just that. I am no longer who I used to think I was. Not even close to \u2018What\u2019 other people or \u2018Who\u2019 other people think I am.\u201d\nThe retired athlete revealed that he sold two gold Olympic medals and one silver medal in an auction \u2014 and the combined $437,000 he made from the sale exceeded all of his expectations.\n\u201cI have auctioned three of my medals, which sold, I believe, because I went against what the \u2018experts\u2019 told me last time when I tried the first time,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI told the truth; I needed the money. While many people may have built businesses and sold them for a profit, I had my medals, which I am grateful for.\u201d\n\u201cThe other consideration is the sale of my house. I am VERY happy with whom I sold it to,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cI thanked and blessed the house to bring joy, love, peace, happiness, and a sense of safety to those who entered the house.\u201d\nIn addition to the medals and his home, Louganis revealed that he sold a lot of his personal belongings after several of his close friends lost their possessions in the deadly Woolsey and Palisades wildfires earlier this year.\n\u201cI know I am choosing to do this, but their resilience is an inspiration for me to start anew, with an open heart and an open door. Opening up to possibilities,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cI realized I often close myself off, shut myself down, and play small for the comfort of others. I don\u2019t think I have realized or given myself credit for what I might be able to accomplish.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said in an earlier post, \u2018I was an instrument of my coach\u2019s, Ron O\u2019Brien\u2019s, creation.\u2019 I was honored, proud, and blessed to have been that for him. It was all achieved with love at the core,\u201d he added.\nLouganis said his new life in Panama will force him to go on a journey of self-discovery.\n\u201cNow I get to discover who is Greg Louganis? Without the distraction and noise from outside. At least this is my goal, and hey, I may not find that.\u201d\n\u201cI think I may find it at times, in moments, my goal is to live it! Discover, allow, and nurture that human spirit through the experiences of life,\u201d he added.\nThe diving legend\u2019s career spanned across three Olympic Games: Montreal in 1976, Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.\nThe athlete racked up a total of five Olympic medals throughout his glittering career, including four gold medals and one silver.\nLouganis is the only man to win consecutive Olympic titles in springboard and platform diving \u2014 in 1984 and 1988.\nAfter retiring from the sport, Louganis tried his hand at acting, motivational speaking and offered up sports commentary.\nAfter his diving career ended, Louganis revealed he was gay in 1994 and announced he was HIV-positive a year later."
