      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but still feels like a high‑level sketch rather than a world‑class view. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly mapping each regime to a concrete discount‑rate range (e.g., Regime A: 2.5–3.0 % IRR, Regime B: 4.0–4.5 % IRR, Regime C: 3.5–4.0 % IRR) and showing how those rates feed into the IntelOrbis multiples; cite the Fed policy source (ID ??) for the regime definitions and the US 10Y yield range (e.g., 3.2–3.8 % for 2025‑26) to ground the risk‑premia discussion. Replace vague “price stability” with the specific Brent/WTI ranges from J99EM2TPZ and T1QE6JPIX, and link those to auto fuel‑cost elasticity (e.g., a $5 rise in WTI reduces combustion‑vehicle sales by ~2 % per year). For the auto sector, integrate the ACMR base‑case numbers (900 m revenue, 4 % margin) and Ford’s Q2 metrics (22PL3Q360) into a single table that shows how EV losses translate into a 0.5‑point EBIT margin drag over 2025‑27. Explicitly state the EV transition timeline (e.g., 30 % EV share by 2026, 50 % by 2028) and the associated capex cycle (semiconductor capex cadence from the source). Bring in euro‑area inflation probabilities (R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2) by showing the implied discount‑rate shift (e.g., Regime B pushes rates up 1.5 pp) and the currency impact on import costs (euro‑dollar spread expected to widen by 0.3 % if Regime B materializes). Finally, replace the generic “watch signals” with a concise, date‑anchored watch list: Jackson Hole (Oct 2025), semiconductor capex Q4 2025, oil inventory data (May 2025), euro‑area CPI (June 2025). Quantify each risk (e.g., a $70/BBL oil shock would compress EV margins by 0.3 pp) and state the probability of each scenario. This will transform the draft from a narrative to a rigorously sourced, numerically driven, scenario‑anchored analysis that meets the SECTION FOCUS and length constraints.",
