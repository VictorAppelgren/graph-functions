  "content": "How To Get The Three Navigation Buttons Back On Your Android Phone\n\nBack in 2011, Google made a tough call, making one of the biggest changes to Android over the years. Until then, devices running the mobile operating system had come with a distinctive set of hardware buttons for Home, Back, Search, and Menu. But the launch of Android 3.0 Honeycomb represented a leap into a future without hardware controls. The tablet-focused Honeycomb consolidated system navigation into three onscreen buttons: Home, Back, and Recents. In Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, the new system was brought to phones. This change allowed displays to take up more space on a phone and made Android devices seem futuristic compared to the flagship iPhone, which retained a physical Home button for six more years. With the iPhone X in 2017, Apple implemented a slick, gesture-based navigation system. It was now Android that looked anachronistic by comparison. In an apparent effort to catch up, Google introduced its own gesture navigation in 2019 as part of Android 10. However, Android is all about customization, and the three-button system was accordingly preserved. Samsung \u2014 coincidentally the last major manufacturer to move from hardware to onscreen buttons \u2014 still ships phones with the three-button system enabled by default. Other manufacturers like Google and OnePlus default to gestural navigation out of the box. However, if you're using Android gesture-based navigation and decide you don't like it, you can always switch back to the classic three-button system.\n\nThree button navigation can be enabled from Android settings The steps to switch from Android gesture-based navigation to the older, three-button system differ across devices, since each manufacturer has a slightly different take on Android. There are a number of reasons some users prefer the three-button array. For example, the back gesture requires swiping in from the side of the screen, which can be too easily triggered and clashes with the user interface in certain apps. Some custom launchers can cause bugs and performance issues when gestures are enabled. And for other users, it's a matter of muscle memory, ergonomics, or accessibility. So, here's how to swap out gestures for three-button navigation on some of the most popular smartphones.\n\u2022 Swipe up from the Home Screen to open the App drawer, then open the Settings app.\n\u2022 Swipe up from the Home Screen to open the App drawer, then open the Settings app.\n\u2022 After selecting button navigation, you can tap More options on the same screen to swap the position of the Back and Recents buttons (the Home button will always stay in the middle). Other manufacturers may place the option to switch navigation modes elsewhere in settings. For instance, OnePlus hides it under System & Update settings. But Samsung owners have a smorgasbord of further customization options that can make three-button navigation even more personalized and convenient. Given that the company is the largest Android vendor, it's worth going over these options to help you get the most out of your smartphone.\n\nHow to customize three-button navigation on Samsung Galaxy devices Samsung Galaxy smartphones include a variety of tweaks for three-button navigation. You can swap to a hybrid three-gesture mode and add more custom options through the Good Lock app. One of the most annoying things about three-button navigation is that it takes up more screen real estate than the gesture bar. However, Samsung offers a workaround. Head to the Navigation Bar settings using the steps above and choose Swipe Gestures, then tap on More options and select Swipe From Bottom. This will divide the bottom of your display into three gesture zones corresponding to Back, Home, and Recents. You'll need to remember which is which, since there are no icons. For even more customization, you'll need to download Samsung's Good Lock customization app from the Samsung Galaxy Store, then use it to install the NavStar module. Open NavStar, then switch the top toggle to On. You can now set custom icons for each button. Samsung offers a few stock options, or you can tap New Configuration and customize each button. You can even use photos or stickers from your gallery. Tap on Button Layout to align the buttons left or right, making them easier to press with one hand. You can even add extra buttons to the array, including shortcuts to the notifications, camera, or screenshot tool, volume and media controls, or even an F5 button to force-refresh pages. Under Advanced options in NavStar is a toggle to hide the navigation bar. Enabling this means you'll need to swipe from the bottom to surface each time you want to use it. There's also a slider to adjust how much vertical space the navigation bar takes up onscreen.",

      "text": "9 Fun Ways You Can Customize Your Android Device's Operating System\nOne of the biggest reasons to buy an Android phone is for personalization and customization. There are all kinds of things that you can do with your device to make it look and act in a way that is unique to you. Some examples include changing your launcher. Each Android launcher has its own capabilities ranging from making your phone feel more like a stock Android device to adding tons of customization. There are also methods to change your icons and the phone's font. With apps like KWGT, you can even make custom widgets.\nThose who want to dig deeper can do that on many Android devices. While it isn't quite as popular as it once was, users still can root their Android phones and then do any number of additional things like flash custom ROMs, run scripts, and add extensions or add-ons that can do things your phone normally can't do. It requires a bit of know-how and patience, but it can be rewarding if you find stuff you really want to use.\nWith that said, the list below represents the very tip of the proverbial spear when it comes to Android customization. Rooting devices and unlocking bootloaders almost always voids your manufacturer's warranty. Plus, rooting and ROMing can cause issues like bootloops, which can be difficult to fix if you don't know what you're doing. It can even result in a bricked device if not done correctly.\nRooting your Android phone\nMost of the things on this list require you to at least root your phone, so it's a pretty good place to start. Rooting your devices gives you administrative control over your phone the same way you have it on a Windows or Mac computer. This won't change how your phone works or operates, but it gives you the ability to install things you otherwise wouldn't be able to install.\nEach device's root method is slightly different, but the core steps are similar. Most phones require you to unlock the bootloader and then use Magisk Manager to patch a boot image, which is then flashed back to the device. Once flashed, the phone will have root access. Most of the time, there are methods to allow the phone to update its software like normal while retaining root, so the phone continues to operate normally. Some devices, like many Samsung devices, have standalone tools or alternative methods, such as flashing with Odin, that achieve the same result.\nFor the most part, root is a harmless modification. However, some phone OEMs make it worse than it needs to be. For example, Samsung devices will void your warranty and you'll lose access to Samsung Pay forever. In addition, Google's SafetyNet function will make it more difficult to use some financial and streaming apps. You can work around it, though, primarily with Magisk Manager modules. Thus, it's important to remember that rooting is only half the process. The rest is tricking the apps on your phone into believing that root isn't there so that they work properly.\nInstall and use Magisk Manager\nMagisk Manager is arguably the most important and powerful app for Android customization. It's an open-source app that lets the user load various modules. Magisk Manager doesn't do too much besides providing root access for applications and tools for unpacking and repacking Android boot images. The root access and boot image functions are nice, since they're a big part of how phones attain root access nowadays. Once you install the app and open it, you'll see a simple UI.\nThe most significant part, though, is the Magisk modules. Developers can create and publish them. There is no central repository for them, so users will have to search around. However, there is a small collection of them on Github along with a couple of repository apps that do what they can, including Fox's Module Manager. It's one of those situations where it's a little difficult to find stuff at first, but then it gets easier once you learn where to look. Once you find a module you like, install it, and it will perform the task it was designed to perform.\nMagisk has installation instructions that work for most devices. Once installed, we recommend checking out something like Simple Bootloop Saver since it can get you out of hot water if a module goes haywire and doesn't work properly. Much like root, Magisk doesn't customize anything on its own. It's mostly the modules that do all the work.\nInstalling a ROM\nInstalling a custom ROM is one of the fastest ways to customize your Android experience. A ROM is simply a modified version of a phone's operating system. The ROM developer can do a variety of things to customize the OS, including ripping out bloatware, adding mods that can change the look or performance, enabling root by default, and enable features that were previously hidden. Typically, you install a ROM using a custom recovery like Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP), or, in some cases, you can flash them using tools like Samsung's Odin3.\nLike any Android OS modification, this approach has pros and cons. You'll get a whole new OS to play with, and many of the modifications are generally positive and give you a lot more control over your device than you usually have with an unrooted, unmodified OS. Plus, since many ROMs are pre-rooted out of the box, it lets you skip a lot of the annoying steps that come with that kind of modding. On the other half of the equation, smartphone OEMs have made things a lot more complicated than they used to be, and workarounds can occasionally be annoying. For example, some modern Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra ROMs have a host of fixes to make things work that would normally work but break in the root and ROM process.\nIn general, folks who like to tinker have used ROMs on many occasions to spice up their phone experience. Just be sure to back up your data since ROM installation almost always requires a factory reset.\nProject Themer\nProject Themer is an app that requires root access to run. As the name suggests, the app themes your phone. It works in two ways. The first is a set of functions that replace your existing UI elements with other designs. For example, you can replace the quick settings toggle icons with other shapes and colors. There are over two dozen shape options to help freshen up your phone's graphics and add a bit of flair.\nThe second way is letting users mess with Material You themes. Generally, Material You themes in Android are automatically generated based on your wallpaper. Project Themer allows you to customize it to your liking, which should probably be a feature in Material You. Users can also add gradients, which aren't natively available in Android theming. The theming also works in Google apps, according to the developer, so it's not just the UI.\nIt currently only works with AOSP Android ROMs 12.0 and up and Pixel devices. The app is also one of the easiest to access since it's available directly from the Google Play Store for $2.99. Once installed, the app will need to install a module, but otherwise it's fairly plug-and-play once you get in and start tinkering.\nPixel Launcher Mods\nPixel Launcher Mods is a Magisk module that helps improve the functionality of the stock launcher on Pixel devices. It does require root to use and adds several features to the launcher. Once installed, it acts like any other app where you can open it, make the changes you want, and then proceed with your day.\nFor the most part, the feature list mostly adds additional features that the launcher doesn't currently have. For example, you can add custom icon pack support, which then lets you add icon packs for further customization. You can also hide various elements and icons from the app drawer, replace the search widget with a widget of your choice, and even remove the limitation on widget sizes on the home screen. There are some hiccups. For instance, if you hide the \"At a Glance\" feature, the space remains blank.\nThe module is free to use, but you need both root and Magisk Manager installed to use it. The module is downloadable on Github, and the developer also has installation instructions and more granular explanations of what the module is capable of.\nFranco Kernel Manager\nFranco Kernel Manager is another root app that has a lot of capabilities. While many apps let you mess around with things like themes, this one focuses more on performance, metrics, and more under-the-hood things. Much like Project Themer, the app is also available on the Google Play Store for a nominal fee. It should work on just about any phone, provided it's been rooted, although the options may change a bit from device to device. Fortunately, the vast majority of functions work on most devices.\nFor starters, this is a kernel manager. That means you can change things like the CPU governor, mess around with the IO scheduler, and even overclock your phone if you want to. That's the main set of features so power users can rejoice that a tool like this exists without complicated scripts or ADB commands. FKM also supports per-app profiles, so you can ramp up the phone while gaming, but then tone it down a bit when doing something light, such as scrolling through social media.\nThe app can do some other things as well. There is an optional battery notification that shows you usage, including which apps are using the most battery both for informational and diagnostic purposes. There is also a screen calibration tool that lets you dial in the color you want along with a build.prop editor, a flash function for Magisk modules, and a script manager for shell scripts.\nThe list goes on and on. It's a powerful app.\nBasic Call Recorder\nMost of the mods, apps, and customizations on the list change many things about phones, including performance, theme, and more. This Magisk module lets you record phone calls. One of the most frustrating issues with Android smartphones is call recording. Google has changed its mind on whether or not Android supports call recording. It does currently, but not all phones allow it in all regions. Thus, a module like this is required for the majority of folks to get call recordings.\nThe module is fairly simple. Once you install it, you open it and tick the settings you want to configure it. From there, you can either manually record calls at your leisure or set it to record every call automatically. If you decide to go with automatic calls, you can set rules so that it doesn't record every single call. It can record in lossy formats like MP3 or lossless formats like FLAC. That's about all it does. However, having this functionality unlocked quickly and easily is quite nice.\nThere are some root-free apps that can do this. For example, ACR Phone can do it, provided that you install the developer's third-party add-on. However, most apps that do that without root also do a lot of other stuff that you may or may not want or need. The Basic Call Recorder module stays in its lane while activating a feature most Android phones should have.\nViperFX\nViperFX is another Magisk module, but this one is for audio. The app has long been known as one of the most powerful audio apps for root users, and although development has gone in and out over the years, it's in a pretty good place now. For starters, it introduces a true, system-wide equalizer that applies everywhere. You can tune this equalizer for wired headphones, your phone speakers, and Bluetooth devices individually. That's just the beginning.\nFor those who want more, Viper FX has it, including a FET compressor, spectrum extension that recovers higher frequency sounds, a master limiter, and various sound effects. For example, you can turn on reverb and then customize how much reverb the sound has based on things like room size and damping factor. There are enough effects and options in this app to manage just about any audio device you could ever want to hook up your Android phone, including surround sound speaker systems.\nThe only downside to Viper FX is that it's a bit more difficult to install than most Magisk modules. The developers have instructions on their official Github for installing the service and a separate webpage for downloading and installing the app. Viper FX is arguably the best reason for audiophiles to root a phone and install Magisk modules.\nPixelify\nIf you don't own a Pixel device and want to see what it's like, this Magisk module is for you. It's called Pixelify, and it adds Google Pixel features to smartphones that don't have them. It's compatible with various devices that run Android 7.0 through Android 13. In addition, several sub-modules that you can install add even more functionality. They include Google's call screening feature along with some other nifty features.\nThe main benefit is that it adds Pixel-exclusive features to non-Pixel devices. That includes wallpapers, Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, call recording through the Google Dialer app, and Adaptive Sound. Once the module has been installed, these features are individually toggled within the app. Some of the features, including Adaptive Sound, may require you to edit your build.prop to make your phone think it's a Pixel device, but fortunately, that isn't terribly difficult to achieve.\nA full list of download links, installation instructions, and features are available on the module's Github page. The only downside is that it doesn't support Android 14, which is the most modern version. Thus, if your phone is newer and has been updated to the latest version of Android, the module won't work for you. The developers also recommend using Zygisk to make the module work better."

      "text": "Android Over The Years: All The Biggest Changes From 1.0 To Update 14\nAndroid is the dominant smartphone OS on the global market, and over the years it has become essentially the only competitor to Apple's iOS. But the platform had humble beginnings before it erased the competition (like Windows Phone, Symbian, and RIM) from the map, and it's evolved considerably from the first version that was released in 2008. Fifteen years after its initial launch, it's time to take a look at how much Android has changed over the years, starting with version 1 and running through to version 14, Google's latest and greatest.\nFounded by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White in 2003, it would be five years before Android was acquired by Google. Interestingly, Rubin thought Android would be a smart camera OS, but a few months after Google bought the company in 2005, he realized his product had much greater potential. From there, there were a series of early versions called Milestones by the Android team. Finally, in September 2008, Android 1.0 launched alongside the HTC Dream, ushering in a new era of mobile computing.\nWe have broken down the major changes across every major release of the Android platform, highlighting the progress made since that first device launched. The most surprising thing is that, for all the upgrades, fresh coats of paint, and new form factors Android has adapted to, it has, in many ways, always remained itself.\n1.0 - 1.6 Cupcake and Donut\nLooking back at the first version of Android a decade and a half after it launched in the fall of 2008, we can already see the bones of a great OS. The best example of this is the notification shade, that bar you pull down from the top of the screen. Those notifications have become more interactive over the years, but the core concept is so good, it was never abandoned. The Android Market (later rebranded to the Play Store) introduced in the early days of the OS was also ahead of its time. When Android launched, it was mere months after Apple finally added the App Store to its own mobile operating system. And with version 1.5, codenamed Cupcake as Android began its dessert-themed naming scheme, static widgets were added along with copy and paste and a virtual keyboard. But the real ace in the hole was that Android supported the full suite of Google apps, making it the clear choice for anyone already invested in that ecosystem.\nAndroid officially launched alongside the HTC Dream, where the home and back buttons showed up for the first time as physical buttons, along with the long-forgotten menu and search buttons. Looking at a modern phone running Android 14, it's clear the OS has progressed by leaps and bounds since its birth. For example, there was no multitouch support at first. But there are still some striking similarities, like that notification panel and the ability to pin apps or widgets to the homescreen.\n2.0 - 2.1 Eclair\nOf all Android's major updates, \u00c9clair wasn't the splashiest, but given the pace of updates Google was shipping, that was to be expected. The 2.0 update shipped in October 2009, less than two months after version 1.6, mainly fixing bugs and improving performance. Although it refined what was already there and had a fresh set of icons, it was sandwiched between more significant updates. Still, better enterprise features were added for business users, including exchange email support and multiple account sync, making it possible for those still on the Blackberry train to switch over to the burgeoning OS.\nThe onscreen keyboard was improved, as it became clear physical keyboards were going the way of the dinosaur. This was also when the big Google search bar made its appearance as the default widget on home screens, providing instant access to information. Notably, Google Maps Navigation launched with \u00c9clair, allowing people to ditch their standalone GPS units. It's remarkable to consider how much that single addition changed the way most people interact with the world around them, no longer relying on memory or road signs to travel the roads. Android 2.0 also had a car mode that we could consider an early precursor to Android Auto.\nThe Motorola Droid launched alongside \u00c9clair and, given how much hype and marketing was centered on it, you'd be mistaken for thinking it was the first Android phone. Even today, the sharp, industrial angles of the device look slick and modern, but it had an anachronistic slide-out keyboard and D-pad that made it look dated.\n2.2 Froyo\nOne of the most significant updates in Android history, Froyo, shipped in May 2010. It was the point at which the OS began to see mainstream adoption with phones like the HTC Desire, the Nexus One, and LG Optimus. It featured the arrival of push notifications, Wi-Fi hotspotting, and plenty of other future-proofing features. UI improvements, like an updated launcher and the addition of PIN and password locks, were nice, but the real meat of Android 2.2 was its performance boost thanks to a new compiler. SlashGear's hands-on with the Nexus One while it was running \u00c9clair didn't find a ton of lag on the phone, but when Android Police tested speeds after the Froyo update, it found a jaw-dropping 450% increase in performance.\nWith Froyo, Android added Flash support, but it was doomed from the start, and eventually dropped in Android 4.1. More long lasting was the Twitter app, which the microblogging platform developed in collaboration with Google. And the search giant continued its foray into voice-to-text by adding Voice Actions to the OS, letting users command their phone vocally. This functionality would be greatly improved years down the line with the introduction of Google Assistant.\n2.3 Gingerbread\nGingerbread was another notable upgrade to Android, showing just how quickly the OS was maturing when it was released in December 2010. One of the most significant additions was NFC support, opening the door to a world of smart interactions with the physical world. The iPhone wouldn't receive NFC until 2014, so it's remarkable to think Android had it back in 2010. But the biggest improvement was a UI overhaul that darkened UI elements, added an app manager, and revamped the Android Market to be more inviting for customers.\nAt this point, fragmentation was beginning to become a problem for Android. Gingerbread had low system requirements, but later versions required more processing power. Lots of users with lower-end hardware wouldn't be able to upgrade any further, and it took many years for both manufacturers and customers to catch up. The problem persists even today, as the latest version of Android has never been the one being used by the majority of devices.\nOne notable device to release with Gingerbread was the original Galaxy Note, which at the time was considered a massive device with its 5.3-inch AMOLED display. It kicked off the trend of ballooning screen sizes, but by today's standards, that's a small phone.\n3.0 Honeycomb\nHoneycomb, the Android version only for tablets released in February 2011, is often considered a failure for its inability to make the tablet experience better. But many of its ideas were ahead of their time and became standard on later versions of Android. Among those ideas were the now ubiquitous on-screen navigation keys and interactive widgets. It was also the first version to feature screenshot-style app previews in the task switcher, letting users visualize where they left off in apps. As consumer demand drove the production of large-screen phones in years to come, many of the ideas Google had for tablets would become equally useful on all Android devices. One reason for the massive step up in design: Google had recently hired Matias Duarte, the lead designer of the now defunct PalmOS. Palm had sold its gorgeous operating system to HP, but Duarte didn't stay there.\nHoneycomb may have been a strange blip on the Android timeline, and it never even had an open-source version, but it drove important innovations in the evolution of the world's most popular mobile operating system. On the hardware side, Honeycomb's flagship device was the Motorola XOOM. While its specs are laughable by today's standards (a quaint 1Ghz of processing power and 1GB of RAM), it received plenty of praise from reviewers at the time.\n4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich\nIce Cream Sandwich was a step back to the drawing board after the curious misfire of Honeycomb, incorporating much of the tablet-only OS's design language into its UI. The update, which shipped in October 2011, was a much-needed modernization for Android that marked the introduction of on-screen navigation buttons for smaller devices, ditched the menu button (to the chagrin of enthusiasts), and added resizable, interactive widgets. It's safe to say this was the dawn of modern Android.\nAlso of note, Visual Voicemail was integrated, as were text responses to calls. Face Unlock was introduced, though the first iteration could be fooled by pictures and was not reliably secure. Native screenshot support was a great addition, as was real-time speech-to-text input and HDR photography. Another big change was the favorites bar or \"dock\" that got added to the home screen. One more useful feature that later got removed was Android Beam, which used NFC to share content from one phone to another when they were pressed back-to-back. Now that Apple has introduced a similar feature in iOS, here's hoping Beam makes a return.\nToward the end of 2012's first quarter, Google debuted the Google Play Store, finally doing away with Android Market and launching a suite of Play apps \u2014 Movies, Books, and Music. Strangely, only Play Books survives today, with Play Music killed off (and user libraries migrated to YouTube Music), and Play Movies having become Google TV.\nIce Cream Sandwich debuted on the Galaxy Nexus from Samsung which, with its signature hump on the bottom and soft but angular design, still stands apart from other handsets. It was well reviewed, even raved about by owners, and to this day, you can find former owners of the device who talk about it with nostalgia.\n4.1 - 4.3 Jelly Bean\nJelly Bean, which was released in July of 2012, seemed like a minor iteration compared to Ice Cream Sandwich's sweeping changes, but under the hood, it modernized the OS. Google's \"Project Butter\" aimed to improve performance at a time when Android had a reputation for lagging and being generally janky. Another core feature added with this update was the Quick Settings panel, allowing users to toggle things like wi-fi and Bluetooth without leaving the current app. Meanwhile, updates to HDR photography and external display support added future-proofing. Google Now also debuted, marking the start of Google's focus on predictive search. It was designed to serve up useful information before you asked for it in a card style interface, including notifications for package deliveries, flight times, and more. Notifications, already Android's strong suite, were also improved.\nGoogle released a slew of Nexus devices alongside Jelly Bean, most notably the Nexus 7, built by Asus. The 7\" tablet looks a bit impractical today, as flagship smartphone screens nearly match its size and foldables dwarf it. Its massive top and bottom bezels seem comical, too. But its design was inviting, with a stippled, soft-touch backplate and an even friendlier $200 price tag. The Nexus 7 sold well enough to kick off a new product category, and Apple responded with its own iPad Mini.\n4.4 KitKat\nThe first Android version to feature a tie-in with a major candy brand, KitKat was internally called Key Lime Pie before Nestle broke them off a piece of that branding. Released in October of 2013, it came with a minor visual overhaul that brightened things up, but more importantly, it optimized the system for midrange and budget devices by reducing memory usage with a program called \"Project Svelte,\" helping to alleviate growing problems with version fragmentation. KitKat expanded NFC payment support along with other near-field capabilities, and at the time, Google was trying to make Google+ a thing, so there were also some integrations with the now defunct social media platform that feel obviously misguided in hindsight.\nIn the hardware space, the Nexus 5 and HTC One M8 were the hot phones of the year. While the former ran stock Android and the latter ran HTC's Sense skin, both received high praise from the tech press.\n5.0 - 5.1 Lollipop\nLollipop refreshed Android's design language for the first time since Ice Cream Sandwich's Holo interface with its November 2014 launch, introducing a new design language called Material Design. Apps were now to be thought of as layers of cloth or paper, with animations and interactions reflecting that paradigm. Important elements were designed to be colorful in comparison to the rest of an app's interface, drawing the user's attention to the most important functions. This reimagining was once again the work of Matias Duarte and his team. Thanks to betas released through the Developer Preview program, far more apps were immediately updated with Material Design at launch than might have been otherwise. It's hard to overstate how positive an impact this had on the experience of using an Android device. Apps finally felt cohesive; no matter where they came from, they shared a basic design language that made them immediately intuitive.\nThe Lollipop update also brought a brand-new app engine, Android RunTime, or ART. It was a massive update that allowed Android to take full advantage of newer chipsets. Additionally, heads-up notifications were added, as well as lock screen notifications \u2014 two things it's hard to believe we lived without for so long. Also added: battery life improvements and 64-bit support. Not everything was great, though. Most annoyingly, Chrome tabs and Gmail threads were now integrated into the app switcher and appeared as recent apps, making it frustrating to navigate around if you had a few open.\nThe Nexus 6 was the most interesting device to immediately support Lollipop. Codenamed \"Shamu\" internally at Google, it lived up to its namesake by being absolutely massive, showing that giant phones were here to stay.\n6.0 Marshmallow\nWhile the previous year's upgrades had focused on UI, Marshmallow focused on refreshing support for newer hardware with its October 2015 launch. USB-C was starting to see wide adoption as a universal standard, so Google added support for it. Native API support for fingerprint biometrics, 4K app rendering, and even MIDI support for musical instruments were also introduced with Marshmallow. Security was vastly improved with more granular permissions controls, letting users revoke apps that got too greedy with their device data, though those systems were still far from perfect and have been improved upon in more recent versions. But Marshmallow's most important feature was one most users would never notice, a deep sleep state called Doze that detected when your phone wasn't being used \u2014 for example, leaving it on the table overnight \u2014 and turn off all unnecessary functions, saving idle users a ton of battery juice.\nThe Nexus 6P was the main launch device for Marshmallow, with a \"visor\" camera design that would resurface years later on the Pixel 6 line. Ironically, the 6P was made by Huawei, which is no longer allowed to sell phones in the US market.\n7.0 Nougat\nWhile Nougat came with under-the-hood performance and security improvements when it dropped in August 2016, the biggest changes were to multitasking. Split-screen mode finally made its way to the OS, and the notification shade was redesigned to organize and fit more information and added the ability to reply to messages from a notification. Battery life was also made better in Nougat with improvements to Android's deep sleep state called Doze, activated when a device is unused with the screen off for extended periods of time. If you left your phone off the charger overnight, your battery would drain slower, for example.\nBut the big headline was the launch of the Pixel lineup, ditching the Nexus moniker Google had licensed out to its manufacturing partners in favor of custom in-house designs. The original Pixel was also the first device to support Google Assistant, which replaced Google Now as the phone's smart assistant.\nThe original Pixel and Pixel XL received positive reviews, with SlashGear's Chris Burns noting that Google's camera was the best on the market at the time due to its computational approach to smartphone photography. It was the phone that kicked off an arms race in smartphone camera software. The Pixel also marked the point at which Google's own phones shipped with a different fork of Android than the AOSP, one that contained Pixel Exclusives.\n8.0 Oreo\nThe second \u2014 and last \u2014 Android version to feature a popular snack brand tie-in, Oreo was launched in August of 2017 at an event held outside the trendy Chelsea Market in New York City, the location of the Oreo cookie's invention (via CNET). Among the headlining changes, notifications got another set of improvements, including dots on app icons to indicate unread alerts, as well as the ability to snooze notifications, and the notification shade now automatically sorted by priority and category to manage the increasing flood of app alerts people were experiencing. Bluetooth devices were now able to show battery life device-side, a welcome change as wireless buds grew in popularity. Picture-in-picture was added, allowing users to watch video while using other apps. Perhaps the best change most users didn't notice was Project Treble, a play on the phrase, \"All bass, no treble,\" that allowed apps to only download parts of an app that needed updating, instead of redownloading the whole app. This significantly cut down update sizes.\nOn the hardware side of the equation, Google's Pixel 2 XL was beset by problems with its screen, but otherwise received lots of praise. Displays would continue to be the weak point of the Pixel lineup when compared to those from competitors like Samsung or Apple.\n9.0 Pie\nBy August of 2018, competition for Android was really heating up, and Apple had completely revamped its aging smartphone lineup with the iPhone X. For the first time since KitKat had ditched physical navigation buttons, Android's UI was feeling dated, so for the OS's 10th anniversary, Android Pie finally added gesture-based navigation. Unfortunately, Google didn't knock gestures out of the park on its first swing, and Pie implemented a so-called \"pill\" interface which was extremely unintuitive and required swiping in different directions on a small button at the bottom of the screen. It also wreaked havoc on third-party launchers. To be fair, the pill button offered more functionality, like opening the app drawer with a full swipe up. Support for display \"notches\" was also added with Pie, since they were in vogue at the time. Cue flashbacks to those ugly intrusions into your screen, another consequence of the iPhone X's popularity.\nOther, smaller improvements that arrived with Android Pie included Lockdown Mode and smart linking to apps like Maps from text. Another great addition was Digital Wellbeing, a suite of features to manage healthy smartphone use. But let's be honest, very few of us actually abide by the app timers we impose on ourselves.\n10.0\nWith Android 10, released in September of 2019, Google finally dropped their dessert naming scheme with 10 letters left to go (a fact that still makes completionist brains itch), but it was internally known as Quince Tart, so maybe that's for the best. It was a pretty big update, revamping gesture navigations to be more like the iPhone's. Unlike the iPhone, it had back gestures, although they conflicted with apps that had navigation drawers accessed by swiping in from the side of the screen and it took some time before developers updated their apps to remove those once-ubiquitous UI elements. Swiping from the bottom corner of the screen now activated Assistant. Other nice-to-haves included a system-wide dark mode to save users' eyes and batteries, as well as a major location permissions overhaul.\nAndroid 10 launched in 2019, just as Samsung released its first ever foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Fold, and Google accordingly added foldable support with this update. Although that original Fold was plagued with issues and had to be re-released, foldable devices have only proliferated on the market in subsequent years. Google clearly saw that trend coming.\n11.0\nInternally called Red Velvet Cake, Android 11 dropped in September of 2020. Its biggest feature, while not a splashy UI refresh, was an overhaul for app permissions that included one-time allowances, thus allowing users to take advantage of an app's location-based features without granting that permission to the app in perpetuity. This much-appreciated privacy enhancement also rolled out to older devices from Android 6 upward through a Google Play update, proving that the company's years-old initiative to decouple many of Android's features from system updates was paying off.\nOther useful additions to Android 11 included fine-tuning for the back gestures, notification history, and better 5G support. A native screen recorder also finally arrived far too late. For years, stock Android users had relied on permissions-hungry third-party apps for that essential function. A new sorting system for app notifications debuted that prioritized notifications from messaging apps. Lastly, chat bubbles arrived. The less said about them, the better.\n12.0\nInternally codenamed Snow Cone, Android 12 was introduced in October of 2021, bringing the biggest design changes since Material was introduced. The new system, Material You, allowed system elements, app icons, and widgets to take on colors complementing the selected home screen wallpaper. Once again, this enticing visual refresh was the work of lead Google designer Mat\u00edas Duarte.\nMore significant privacy features were introduced with Android 12, including indicators when the camera or microphones are accessed, the ability to only show apps an approximate location, and a new Privacy Dashboard. The next year, in 2022, Android 12L was released, a minor update focused on improving support for foldables, tablets, and other devices with larger screens. This was likely due to the development of the Pixel Fold, which Google would release two years later in 2023.\nGoogle launched the Pixel 6 alongside Android 12, which brought the first major hardware design change to the company's phone lineup. It sported a \"visor\" camera bump that echoed the design of the years-old Nexus 6, and also marked the first time Google deployed custom silicon with the Tensor processor.\n13.0\nKnown inside Google HQ as Tiramisu and released in August of 2022, Android 13 was a relatively minor update compared to a lot of other point-oh releases, a fact signaling how much the OS had matured. The biggest addition was that it made apps request permission to send notifications \u2014 a welcome change, given all the notification spam that piles up for most users. (However, Android still won't let you flag spam notifications from apps that beg you to open them, and apps continue to bundle those into vaguely defined notification categories like \"general.\" Please, Google, it's out of control.)\nAllowing multiple devices to receive audio with LC3 became supported, a welcome addition to anyone who wants to share music with a friend without giving up an earbud to them. One feature that many users may not be aware was added is a multitasking shortcut that opens split screen when you drag and drop icons from the notification shade. Accessibility for polyglots was also added at last, allowing users to set per-app languages. Third-party apps were also given the ability to take advantage of themed icons with Material You, though many popular ones still haven't done so as of this writing.\n14.0\nCodenamed Upside-Down Cake internally at Google, Android 14 is the latest version of Android, and it recently started rolling out at the beginning of October 2023. Its development was delayed by a month to ensure stability, although betas have been available for quite a while. The biggest ease-of-use improvement is a preview when back gestures are used that indicates whether the gesture will return to a previous screen or exit the app entirely, and also shows a preview of that page on some versions. It's a welcome update, since horizontal swipes in apps have been a minefield ever since the side-swipe back gesture was introduced, as you'll inevitably end up going to a previous page by accident if you're not precise.\nSupport for using phones as webcams is also here, so you can use your beefy flagship camera instead of your laptop's dinky built-in webcam in video meetings. Meanwhile, new accessibility features let you make text bigger while using smart scaling so those with poor eyesight can still see more than one thing onscreen.\nFifteen years after Android took its first steps, it has grown up into a remarkably mature operating system, capable of powering devices in an array of form factors and dominating the global market. Yet even while being adaptable enough to be forked and reskinned by major manufacturers, even as the world around it changed dramatically, it retains a core identity. Whatever the next fifteen years may hold, Android will sit in the pockets of billions of people around the globe."

      "text": "You Can Customize Your Galaxy Phone With Samsung's Good Lock App - Here's How\nMany Android phones come with built-in personalization features to make the devices look uniquely yours, and Samsung is no exception. However, unlike most brands that bake these features into Settings, Samsung offers a dedicated customization app instead \u2014 the Good Lock app.\nGood Lock is exclusive to Galaxy phones and can only be downloaded via the Galaxy Store. It comes with individual modules, each designed for tweaking certain aspects of your device, such as one for the lock screen and another for the audio. While Good Lock may seem overwhelming and too complex at first, the configurations are actually pretty intuitive and user-friendly. Each setting even includes a short description, so you'll know exactly what it does.\nIf you're looking to personalize your Galaxy phone without having to scour the Play Store for a decent, ad-free app, then Good Lock might be worth checking out. We'll walk you through how to use some of its modules to customize your Android device.\nNavStar: Configure your navigation bar or swipe gestures\nWith Good Lock, you can easily customize the navigation bar on your Galaxy phone. Follow these steps:\n- On the Make up tab, look for NavStar.\n- Download the module if you haven't already.\n- Open the module.\n- Hit Start.\n- Select Allow All to give NavStar the necessary permissions.\n- On the Buttons tab, switch on the toggle at the top.\n- To change the navigation buttons, choose your preferred icons from the sets available. You can customize the icons by pressing New configuration. Then, tap Recents and select a new icon. Do the same for Home, Back, and Close Keyboard. Hit Save to save your new configuration and select your custom icon set from the list.\n- To auto-hide the navigation bar, enable \"Show and hide button\" under Advanced options. The nav bar should now disappear. To bring it back, swipe up from the bottom left of the screen. It will then hide itself again after a few seconds. To keep the navigation bar visible (unless you decide to hide it again), double-tap on the little dot on the leftmost side of the navigation bar. To auto-hide it again, tap the little dot twice.\n- To adjust the height of your navigation bar, drag the slider to your preferred level. Slide it to the left to shrink the nav bar or to the right to make it bigger.\nNavStar has configuration settings for Swipe gestures instead of buttons. You can enable more gesture settings in the Settings app that will allow you to bring back the three-bar swipe gesture at the bottom and remove the gesture hint altogether. Other Swipe gesture configurations include changing the color and sensitivity of the side back gesture indicator and customizing the color, width, and transparency of the gesture bars at the bottom.\nHome Up: Enhance your Home and Apps screen\nGood Lock helps you get the most out of your Home and Apps screen. Here's how:\n- Download and enable Home Up on Good Lock.\n- On the module page, select Home screen.\n- To change the grid, tap Home Screen Grid, adjust the row number and column number, and press Apply to save it. You can have anywhere from a 4x4 grid to a 7x7 grid. Do the same for the Apps Screen Grid.\n- To increase or decrease your favorite apps (the apps at the bottom of the home screen), select Favorites Max Count and change it to up to 9 apps.\n- To have the pages of your Home and Apps screen scroll endlessly instead of stopping at the ends, turn on Loop pages.\n- To enable the finder window (where you can search for apps and Google queries), tap on Finder Access and choose Home screen and/or Apps screen. Now, when you swipe down in the middle of the Home or Apps screen, the finder window will open automatically.\n- To apply a custom color to your wallpaper when you open the Apps screen tap on Background Color Control. Switch on the option at the top and select a new Background color. Change the Background transparency to your rate of choice. When you go to the Apps screen, you should see your new background color with the wallpaper visible depending on how transparent you set it.\n- To change the size of the app icons on the Home and Apps screen, press App Icon Settings and turn it on. Adjust the Icon Size to your preferred size (up to 120%).\n- To hide the labels of the apps on the Home and Apps screen, go to App Icon Settings and disable \"Show app icon label on home screen\" and \"Show app icon label on apps tray.\"\nHome Up offers other customization settings for your folders, recent apps window, and sharing screen.\nQuickStar: Personalize your Quick Settings\nWhile you can edit your Quick Settings menu on Android by default, there are more options that the QuickStar module on Good Lock offers. Here are some additional customizations:\n- Download and install QuickStar from the Good Lock app.\n- Turn on Quick Star.\n- To customize the colors on the Quick Settings, open Style your own Quick Panel and enable it. Pick one of the recommended themes or select My Themes to create your own. Tap on the circles shown to change their colors and saturation. Once you're done, press the download icon at the top, enter a name for your theme, and hit OK. Finally, choose your new theme to apply it.\n- To hide or show your indicator icons (e.g., Wi-Fi, battery, mobile data signal), select Visibility of Indicator Icons. Under System Icon, turn on/off ones you don't want to appear at the top of your screen.\n- To change the clock attributes, go to Clock Settings. Enable the date, AM/PM, and seconds to show these elements in the status bar. Move the clock to the right by tapping on Right under Position and Visibility or select Hide to remove the clock from the status bar.\n- To adjust the spacing of the buttons in the Quick Settings panel, turn on \"Change quick settings button grid.\" Drag the slider to your preferred spacing option.\n- To resize the width of the swipe area for the Quick Settings and Notifications, adjust the slider under Quick settings instant access.\n- To move the Quick Settings swipe area to the right and the Notifications swipe area to the left, tap the swap icon.\nOnce you're done, swipe down to open Quick Settings. All your customizations should automatically apply to the panel.\nLockStar: Redesign the lock screen\nIf you're not a fan of downloading lock screen apps for your Android phone but want to tweak your lock screen, then the LockStar module on Good Lock might just be what you need. Here's a guide to use LockStar:\n- Install LockStar as you would other Good Lock modules.\n- Turn on the left toggle to customize the lock screen.\n- Tap on the screen under the left toggle.\n- To edit the clock, select it and tap the icon on the bottom-left corner. Choose your clock style from the available options. Adjust the size by dragging the slider to the left or right.\n- To change the shortcut apps at the bottom, tap on them and hit the edit icon (on the lower left corner). Press the first plus sign icon and choose a new app. Select the rightmost plus sign icon to add a different app. You can opt to fill the other plus icons with other apps too. Select the new shortcut row you created and set the alignment.\n- To add widgets, press on an empty space and select Add Widget. Then, choose your widget from the available options, customize it, then drop it anywhere on the lock screen.\n- To remove your lock screen widgets, select them and hit the X icon in the top-right corner.\n- To tweak the recent notification icons, tap on it and press the icon in the lower left. Select a new design under Notification type, resize the icons using the Scale slider, and change their transparency with the Transparency slider. You can also pick a different color for the icons.\nAside from the lock screen, LockStar lets you configure the Always On Display screen too. Just turn on the option in the LockStar home page and edit away.\nKeys Cafe: Customize the keyboard\nSamsung's default keyboard can get pretty boring to use and look at. To spice it up a bit, try the Keys Cafe module available on the Good Lock app. Follow these steps to change the functionality and style of your keyboard with Keys Cafe:\n- Download and open Keys Cafe on Good Lock.\n- To customize the buttons on your keyboard, toggle on Make your own keyboard. Select Simple keyboard under English (US) and hit Edit. On the keyboard that appears, press the keys you want to tweak (e.g., resize it, swap it out for a different key, change the secondary function). You can also add more rows to the keyboard if you want. Once you're finished editing the keyboard, hit the checkmark to save it. Repeat the same steps for the Simple keyboard under Symbol to edit the symbols pages on your keyboard.\n- To add colors and effects to the keyboard, enable Style your own keyboard. Choose your preferred background color, key press effect, and key press sound from the tabs at the bottom. Preview your new configurations by hitting the keyboard icon in the top-right corner.\n- To make your own sticker, go to My Sticker. Hit the plus sign on the bottom, select a photo from your gallery, and crop it. Enter a name for the sticker and press the upload button.\n- To enable advanced configurations for your keyboard, go to Advanced keyboard setting. Here, you can hide the .com key when typing in a URL box, turn off delete accelerator (which deletes multiple words with just one long-press), and resize the sticker suggestions.\nKeys Cafe also comes complete with some nifty keyboard games you can play to essentially practice your typing skills.\nSound Assistant: Modify how your audio settings look and work\nLooking to make the audio configurations on your Galaxy phone more convenient to use?
