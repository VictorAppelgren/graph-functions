  "content": "12 ago (Reuters) - El IBEX 35 abri\u00f3 el martes al alza tras prolongarse la tregua comercial entre Estados Unidos y China, mientras el mercado espera un dato crucial de inflaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos.\n\nLas dos mayores potencias econ\u00f3micas del mundo decidieron prorrogar el lunes su periodo de negociaci\u00f3n comercial \n por otros 90 d\u00edas para evitar aranceles mutuos de m\u00e1s del 100% en algunos casos.\n\nAunque la medida estaba en parte descontada por los mercados, daba a la renta variable un impulso adicional que deja al IBEX 35 a 100 puntos de la cota psicol\u00f3gica de los 15.000, una barrera que no supera desde enero de 2008.\n\nDe cerrar en positivo, se tratar\u00eda de la s\u00e9ptima jornada consecutiva al alza en el \u00edndice, aunque todo depender\u00e1 del IPC mensual de Estados Unidos, que se publica a las 1230 GMT.\n\nEn caso de ser m\u00e1s elevado de lo previsto, el dato podr\u00eda rebajar las expectativas de recortes de tipos de inter\u00e9s de la Reserva Federal (Fed) en los pr\u00f3ximos meses.\n\nLos analistas prev\u00e9n que el \u00edndice general de precios al consumo muestre subidas del 0,2% mensual y del 2,8% interanual, mientras que para los indicadores subyacentes (que excluyen energ\u00eda y alimentos frescos por su elevada volatilidad) los incrementos ser\u00edan del 0,3% y del 3,0% respectivamente.\n\nTras la reciente racha alcista en las bolsas, algunos observadores del mercado advierten de un optimismo excesivo que podr\u00eda chocar bruscamente con la realidad en alg\u00fan momento de agosto.\n\nAs\u00ed, analistas de Bankinter destacan en su canal de Telegram que \"una encuesta de BofA muestra que el 91% de los gestores de fondos encuestados (169 con AUMs conjuntos de 413.000M$) consideran que la bolsa americana est\u00e1 sobrevalorada. Es decir, nuevos est\u00edmulos deben justificar esas valoraciones o bolsa, y tambi\u00e9n bonos, deber\u00edan sufrir una correcci\u00f3n\".\n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, las plazas financieras esperan a la cumbre entre Rusia y Estados Unidos que tendr\u00e1 lugar el viernes para abordar la guerra en Ucrania.\n\nCon este contexto, a las 07:05 GMT del martes, el selectivo burs\u00e1til espa\u00f1ol IBEX 35 (.IBEX) sub\u00eda 43,90 puntos, un 0,30%, hasta 14.899,80 puntos, mientras que el \u00edndice de grandes valores europeos FTSE Eurofirst 300 (.FTEU3) avanzaba un 0,34%.\n\nEn el sector bancario, Santander (SAN.MC) sub\u00eda un 0,20%, BBVA (BBVA.MC) retroced\u00eda un 0,19%, Caixabank (CABK.MC) avanzaba un 0,42%, Sabadell (SABE.MC) ganaba un 1,35%, Bankinter (BKT.MC) se dejaba un 0,12% y Unicaja Banco (UNI.MC) sub\u00eda un 0,33%.\n\nEntre los grandes valores no financieros, Telef\u00f3nica (TEF.MC) se anotaba un 0,06%, Inditex (ITX.MC) avanzaba un 0,43%, Iberdrola (IBE.MC) se revalorizaba un 0,26%, Cellnex (CLNX.MC) ganaba un 0,53% y la petrolera Repsol (REP.MC) sub\u00eda un 1,25%.",

  "translation": "Aug 12 (Reuters) - The IBEX 35 opened on Tuesday, after prolonging the commercial truce between the United States and China, while the market awaits a crucial data of the United States inflation.\n\nThe two greatest economic powers in the world decided to extend their commercial negotiation period on Monday \n for another 90 days to avoid mutual tariffs of more than 100% in some cases.\n\nAlthough the measure was partly discounted by the markets, it gave the Variable Income an additional impulse that leaves the IBEX 35 to 100 points of the psychological level of the 15,000, a barrier that has not exceeded since January 2008.\n\nTo close positively, it would be the seventh consecutive day up in the index, although everything will depend on the monthly IPC of the United States, which is published at 1230 GMT.\n\nIn case of being higher than expected, the data could reduce the expectations of federal reserve interest rates (FED) in the coming months.\n\nAnalysts foresee that the General Consumer Price Index shows increases from 0.2% monthly and 2.8% year -on -year, while for the underlying indicators (which exclude energy and fresh food due to their high volatility) the increases would be 0.3% and 3.0% respectively.\n\nAfter the recent bullish streak in the bags, some market observers warn of excessive optimism that could collide sharply with reality at some point in August.\n\nThus, Bankinter analysts stand out in its Telegram channel that \"a Bofa survey shows that 91% of the fund managers (169 with set aums of 413,000m $) consider that the American bag is overvalued. That is, new stimuli must justify those valuations or bag, and also bonds, they should suffer a correction.\"\n\nFor the rest, the financial places await the summit between Russia and the United States that will take place on Friday to address the war in Ukraine.\n\nWith this context, at 07:05 GMT on Tuesday, the selective Spanish stock market IBEX 35 (.IBEX) rose 43.90 points, 0.30%, up to 14,899.80 points, while the index of large European values FTSE Eurofirst 300 (.fteu3) advanced 0.34%.\n\nIn the banking sector, Santander (San.MC) rose 0.20%, BBVA (BBVA.mc) retreated 0.19%, CaixaBank (Cabk.mc) advanced 0.42%, Sabadell (knows.mc) earned 1.35%, Bankinter (bkt.mc) left 0.12%and Unicaja Bank (Uni.MC) 0.33%.\n\nAmong the large non -financial values, Telef\u00f3nica (Tef.mc) recorded 0.06%, Inditex (ITX.mc) advanced 0.43%, Iberdrola (IBE.MC) was revalued 0.26%, Cellnex (Clnx.mc) earned 0.53%and the Repsol oil company (Rep.MC) rose 1.25%.",

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
