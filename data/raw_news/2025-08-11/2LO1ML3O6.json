  "title": "The Prettiest Village In France, Voted By The French\u2014In Pictures",
  "description": "Looking to visit the prettiest village in France? France has voted for 2025 and results include everything from medieval abbeys to Musketeers.",
  "content": "Beauty is, of course, subjective, but for a European village, it is usually measured in old houses, castles, churches, rivers, and cobbled streets. A television program in France asks its viewers to vote every year on the prettiest village in France, and for 2025, the results include one near the birthplace of one of the Musketeers, the northernmost town on the island of Martinique in the Caribbean (this is one of France's overseas territories and is officially part of France), and plenty of abbeys.\n\nThese are the top ten villages voted for by the French viewers on Les Plus Beaux Villages En France (The Prettiest Villages in France). This isn't a prize given out lightly; every village considered must have no more than 2,000 residents, already have at least two sites that are protected or considered historic monuments or heritage sites, and the local council must be ready to argue their case.\n\nOnce a village has passed this pre-selection process, there are 32 criteria for judgment, including the quality of building renovations, the management of public spaces, the control and flow of traffic, its biodiversity, energy-efficient lighting, and the presence of accommodation and leisure facilities.\n\nIt's taken very seriously as a way to protect French heritage sites and traditional ways of life. Driving around France, it is common to pass through villages that are labeled as one of the prettiest villages in France.\n\nThe village of Lupiac near the Pyrenees and the Spanish border in southern France is probably best known for being the birthplace of Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan in 1611, who became a Musketeer; the elite guard to the king of France. His life was fictionalised by Alexander Dumas in The Three Musketeers and there is a museum dedicated to d'Artagnan in the village.\n\nSituated in northern France in the Aisn\u00e9 region, north of Paris, Longpont village is packed full of listed buildings, the ruins of an abbey, and a medieval bridge, surrounded by the Retz forest\u2014one of France's largest forests that hasn't much been touched since 1672, attracting a multitude of cyclists and hikers on its many trails.\n\nFerri\u00e8res-en-G\u00e2tinais, an hour's drive south of Paris is home to a benedictine abbey, known for its magnificent library in the Middle Ages, picturesque bridges and architecture, as well as traditional markets.\n\nPass north through the winding roads of the French Caribbean island of Martinique, and Grand'Rivi\u00e8re is the northernmost village before the ocean and the island of Dominica, further north. This village, comprised of fisherman and volcanic beaches, surrounded by rainforest and mountains, is often called by locals, the village at the end of the Earth.\n\nSierck-les-Bains sits almost exactly on the border between France, Luxembourg and Germany and is known best for its medieval 11th century castle that sits on the Moselle river. Influenced over the ages by both French and German culture, travelers arrive for health reasons too, as the region has been known for its thermal baths since the 19th century.\n\nCl\u00e9cy, The Fifth Prettiest Village In France, 2025\n\nIn 1932, Cl\u00e9cy, in the north of France, was named the capital of 'Swiss Normandy', as the region is called because of the resemblance of its natural beauty and that of the Swiss Alps. Its gorges were carved by the river Orne and its tributaries, on which the village sits, and the region is renowned for its 18th century aqueduct, and the multitude of swimming, water sport, hiking and mountain biking routes.\n\nBeaulieu-sur-Dordogne, the fourth prettiest village in France, 2025 is renowned for its medieval abbey from the 12th century on the banks of the river Dordogne, although only the church remains in situ today.\n\nSemur-en-Auxois, The Third Prettiest Village In France, 2025\n\nLocated in the famous wine region of Bourgogne, also home to the city of Dijon, known for its gastronomy and mustard, the village of Semur-en-Auxois is worth visiting not just for its medieval beauty but also for its military ramparts. It was built on a bluff made of pink granite surrounded by the river Arman\u00e7on.\n\nMalestroit, The Second Prettiest Village In France, 2025\n\nIn the northwest of Brittany near France's Atlantic coastline, sits France's second prettiest village, 2025. It is on the Nantes-Brest canal, which holidaymakers explore by barge, mooring up in town to potter around the cobbled streets and half-timbered houses.\n\nThe abbey of Saint Anthony is the main draw in France's prettiest village, 2025, classified as a historic monument in 1840 because of its medieval architecture.\n\nSaint Anthony was an Egyptian monk whose relics were brought to France during the Crusades in the Middle Ages, after inspiring many people to take up seclusion and self-denial.\n\nMany people made pilgrimages to the prettiest village in France, to the south east of Lyon, from the 13th century onwards, to ask Saint Anthony to cure skin infections such as shingles.",

      "text": "Dreaming of retiring abroad? An increasing number of Americans are considering making the move. For some, the best option might be a retirement visa, and Global Citizen Solutions has released the Global Retirement Report 2025, evaluating 44 destinations as the best places to retire abroad. These visas differ from golden visa programs or ancestral visas, instead intended for individuals seeking to retire on a passive income or utilize non-lucrative visas.\nLast year, GCS focused on the American diaspora, but this year, it broadened the approach. GCS collected 20 indicators across six indices: quality of life, economics, taxation, safety, citizenship and the difficulty or complexity of the procedure. GCS then combined these indices into an overall index.\nBest Places To Retire Abroad\u2014Portugal Scores Highly\nFor 2025, the following 10 countries score highly across all dimensions, making them attractive for retirees:\n- Portugal\n- Mauritius\n- Spain\n- Uruguay\n- Austria\n- Italy\n- Slovenia\n- Malta\n- Latvia\n- Chile\nThe best choice for you depends on your reasons for wanting to retire abroad. Perhaps it is to enhance your quality of life, access better healthcare, live in a more cost-effective destination, reunify family members, optimize taxes or, increasingly, due to political dissatisfaction.\nMany of the countries that rank highly offer a path to permanent citizenship, allow dual nationality and permit holders to bring their children and parents.\nPortugal came in first with its D7 passive income visa. It is pretty accessible, requiring an income of $1,054 per month (\u20ac900) for a single person, which increases with family size, as is the case in most countries offering this type of visa.\nThe lower threshold makes it very appealing, says Adalberto Pucca, Head of Global Mobility at GCS, and after five years, holders can apply for residency. The climate, safety and infrastructure are also significant advantages, and the expat community is very active and generally welcoming.\nPucca also notes that Portugal offers English-speaking expats a high level of English proficiency in certain parts of the country, making it easier to adapt to the country than in other destinations. (The Portuguese government is currently considering making the path to citizenship more complicated, but the government has not yet decided.)\nUruguay ranks highly as it doesn't tax foreign pensions, and Mauritius is very tax-efficient. EU countries, such as Latvia and Slovakia, offer borderless travel throughout the European Schengen region, access to excellent healthcare, and good infrastructure. Italy offers a flat tax in some southern areas.\nGreece, a top favorite among Americans searching for a home in Europe, ranks 12th.\nBest Places To Retire Abroad\u2014Digital Nomad Visas And Golden Visas Offer Another Option\nIn many countries, the retirement visa is just one option among others, including digital nomad visas or golden visas, particularly for individuals who are still working or planning to work. Portugal and Italy are the current favorites in Europe.\nMike Swigunski, author of GlobalCareerBook.com, suggests using the NOMAD acronym when thinking of where to retire, why and how:\n- Network and community. Having one or two friends already in place can be a significant boost and very helpful compared to knowing nobody. It also offers an opportunity to test the place out by visiting beforehand, and can identify if a location is a good place to live.\n- Opportunities for geo-arbitrage, where you earn a high salary but live in an inexpensive place where the cost of living is cheaper.\n- Mobility and long-term visas. Every visa is different, and Swigunski makes the point that the Destination Thailand Visa is a swift, inexpensive, and online process that allows for a 5-year stay.\n- Amenities and safety. These issues become more important when living in a destination, more than when you visit.\n- Desirable climate. Whether cold or hot, there is a perfect temperature for everyone.\nAmong the factors when choosing the best places to retire abroad, it is worth considering the ethical dimensions to geo-arbitrage and golden visas and how they may be viewed by locals on the ground and even the political class.\nIn certain pockets, across some EU countries, this sort of geo-arbitrage or the existence of golden visas are viewed as negative, because of the view that expats can price locals out of the market for rents and cost of living. A good example is the recent demonstrations against tourists across Spain."

      "text": "The most visited country in the world (according to U.N. Tourism) has a lot to admire and is often thought to live la dolce vita in terms of the food, the climate and the scenery, le paysage. But what does it actually mean to live well in France, and how much would you need to earn to be considered well off?\nL'Observatoire des In\u00e9galit\u00e9s studies the inequalities in French society and frequently reports on what it means to be wealthy in Europe's second-largest economy. Here's what it has to say.\nHalf Of French Employees Earn Less Than $2,295 After Tax Per Month\nA 2024 study based on 2022 figures from Insee, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, reports that half of employees in France working full time in the private sector earn less than $2,295 (\u20ac2,092).\nA quarter earn less than $1,832 (\u20ac1,670) and almost a quarter earn more than $3,291 (\u20ac3,000). The top 10% of high earners earn $4,575 (\u20ac4,170), and to be in the top 1% you need to be earning at least $11,000 (\u20ac10,000) per month after tax. Beyond that amount, data is not available.\nObviously, this data only considers income and not spending, which changes drastically according to obligations and possible differences in standards of living. It doesn't take age into account, either, which would naturally skew the data depending on where someone is in their working life. It is also based on the private sector, which has lower salaries than the public sector because individuals in the public sector in France tend to be more \u201cqualified.\u201d\nThese figures are only slightly higher than Insee's data from 2019.\nThe cost of living in Paris varies depending on the cost of housing in each arrondissement but a single person can expect to pay, on average, $1,200 (\u20ac1,091) per month without rent. As a comparison, the average cost of living in Paris is around 25% less than in New York with rents around 60% less. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city centre in Paris might cost on average $1,418 (\u20ac1,304) per month and $1,000 outside the city centre.\nA Person Is Rich In France If They Earn More Than $4,256 A Month, After Tax\nAccording to a 2022 report on what it means to be rich in France, someone is rich if they earn double the national average from any source of income after tax, which was calculated to be $4,256 (\u20ac3,880). Only 10% of French people earn this amount.\nL'Observatoire des In\u00e9galit\u00e9s has a pay scale tool where you can enter your monthly net salary and it tells you where you sit in relation to everyone else in France. It's been used more than 3 million times and is based on the latest 2022 Insee data.\nOther Proxies For Measuring French 'Wealth'\nPrevious research conducted in France on what it means to be rich has found other proxies to measure other than salary. Research suggests that having 60 square meters (645 square feet) of space in the place that you live would suggest that you're doing well. As does having a luxury car, home help or the finances to take vacations.\nThe study also took into account job security and that someone is more \u201crich\u201d if they have job security and control over working hours. Likewise, they were more secure in society if they had access to education and a wide network of friends and relatives, higlighting the idea that la richesse appelle la richesse\u2014 that is to say, wealth begets wealth.\nMoney Brings Happiness, But Only Up To $2,300\nResearch conducted by the same organization also shows that while clearly it helps to have enough money to live, people do not get happier the more money they have. Self-reported happiness climbs with wealth from the poorest 5% of French people who earn $873 (\u20ac800) up to those who earn $2,300 per month (\u20ac2,100).\nHowever, after that, higher earners didn't report feeling any happier, even for the people who earn the highest amount\u2014the top 1%, around $7,100 (\u20ac6,500) per month. A lot of money, it seems, cannot buy more happiness."

      "text": "Little is known about the real d'Artagnan. There is only one on him portrait/selfportrait, the authenticity of which is not guaranteed, and imaginary memories published in 1700, 27 years after his death. Mixing the real and imaginary, they were written by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, who discovered the life of the Gascon hero during one of his stays in the Bastille. So let's dig a little deeper into the subject to disentangle the fictional from the real... One thing is certain: motto of the Musketeers is well anchored in our world & everyone knows it:\nAll for one, one for all ! \u2694\ufe0f\nRight wrong\nFollowing the novels of our dear Alexandre Dumas, he makes our Gascon a real hero. It is through the representation of these facts and their revelation to the public that Alexandre Dumas creates the legend of d'Artagnan, now known to everyone. The novels are inspired by historical facts but it is also necessary to note the numerous divergences with history.\n01\nD'Artagnan only exists in books and films\nWrong! Our Gascon hero was born around 1613 in Lupiac.\n02\nThe 3 musketeers are more than 3?\nTrue ! The three musketeers are four in number, it has been said spiritually; Alexandre Dumas was not wrong either in saying the three musketeers, because the fourth only becomes a musketeer in the middle of the novel. Their names are Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan; Everyone has their own distinct personality.\n03\nD'Artagnan had no children\nWrong! He had 2 children with his wife Anne-Charlotte Boyer de Chalecy. The first son is called Louis I de Batz-Castelmore (1660-1709), and takes the title of Count d'Artagnan. His second son was named Louis II de Batz-Castelmore (1661-1714).\n04\nHis first real feats of arms took place at the very beginning of the 1640s.\nTrue ! As part of the Thirty Years' War. We find him in the service of Cardinal Mazarin, who dissolved the company in 1646.\n05\nD'Artagnan participated in the arrest of Nicolas Fouquet\nTrue ! In 1661. Charles de Batz was finally promoted to captain-lieutenant of the musketeers and governor of Lille in 1667.\n06\nD'Artagnan dies of natural causes\nWrong! He lost his life during the Dutch War during the siege of Maastricht in June 1673 during a Dutch counterattack. He was killed by a musket ball in the throat alongside a hundred companions.\nThe statue of d'Artagnan on his rearing horse erected in Lupiac, means that he died in battle, like a true hero.\n07\nD'Artagnan is buried at Castelmore Castle\nWrong! Castelmore Castle is his birthplace.\nD'Artagnan's burial place was unknown until recently. French historian Odile Bordaz speculated that the famous musketeer could have been buried in the Church of Saint Peter and Paul in Wolder, near Maastricht."

      "text": "It\u2019s no secret that more Americans are exploring life beyond U.S. borders, with online searches surging for digital nomad visas, golden visas, and retirement visas. According to Global Citizen Solutions, a consultancy specializing in residency and citizenship by investment, this trend is accelerating: five years ago, Americans represented just one-fifth of their clients; today, they make up almost half.\nGolden Visas And Citizenship Boom\nA new report by GCS shows that interest in Europe\u2019s golden visa programs is particularly strong. Applications for Portugal\u2019s golden visa from Americans rose eightfold between 2020 and 2023, surpassing Chinese investors for the first time. Irish passports have also seen a 60% spike in 2025, and Americans are making record numbers of requests for British citizenship.\nBased on Global Citizen Solutions\u2019 data, five destinations are currently trending among Americans seeking new lives abroad:\n- Portugal\u2014because it has EU access, a favorable tax scheme, and is seen to have a high quality of life. Investment ranges from $291,000 to $581,000.\n- Greece\u2014again, for its EU access, where a golden visa for renovated homes would cost $291,000.\n- Caribbean nations\u2014because they are often the fastest route to passports.\n- Panama\u2014because the Pensionado Visa requires a $1,000 per month income requirement.\n- Costa Rica\u2014because of its high quality of life for under $2,000 per month.\nPatricia Casaburi, CEO of Global Citizen Solutions, says that \"Golden Visa programmes remain accessible across several EU countries with property investment thresholds that cater to a range of budgets.\"\nTravel, Wellness, And The Science Of Aging\nThe appeal of moving abroad isn\u2019t just about visas and new addresses. Travel itself may be a powerful defense against aging. A 2024 study by Edith Cowan University in Australia found that positive travel experiences boost both physical and mental health by exposing individuals to new environments and encouraging social and physical engagement. As study author Fangli Hu noted, \u201ctourism isn\u2019t just about leisure and recreation, but it could also contribute to people\u2019s physical and mental health.\u201d\nThe Washington Post reported at the time that the study, published in Science Daily, found \"how positive travel experiences help maintain the human body's low entropy or gradual decline.\"\nWellness tourism is capitalizing on these benefits. Nine hours, for example, is a Japanese hotel chain that studies guests' sleep via an in-pod camera, microphone, and body sensor. \u201cWe wanted a business that could withstand market crashes, even if tourism failed,\u201d Yasuyuki Watanabe, a director at Hotel Nine Hours, told Bloomberg. It plans to expand and open 10 in Europe and 30 across North America by the end of 2030.\nSo, Where Is The Best Place For Americans To Retire?\nRecent data from the Global Retirement Report 2025 evaluated 44 global destinations that offer retirement visas. That's to say, visas for individuals seeking to retire on a passive income or utilize non-lucrative visas. Collecting data across 20 indicators and six indices, the author, Global Citizen Solutions, names these countries as the top ten: Portugal, Mauritius, Spain, Uruguay, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Malta, Latvia, and Chile.\nLikewise, many of these countries are on CNTraveler's list of 10 Countries Where Americans Can Retire Abroad. These countries\u2014Thailand, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Colombia, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Panama, and Costa Rica\u2014stand out for retirees because the visa process is often straightforward; it sometimes only requires proof of stable income or pension.\nMany of these places offer pleasant climates, rich cultures, thriving communities, but crucially, they also offer affordable living costs and a high quality of life. Countries like Portugal and Spain offer safety and great infrastructure, while countries like Costa Rica and Panama are renowned for their natural beauty.\nFour out of the five trending countries for Americans to find golden visas are on both of these retirement lists\u2014Portugal, Greece, Panama, and Costa Rica, proving that these places are the most sought after right now, for Americans of any age."

      "text": "A French resort town has caused a stir by taking to social media to complain about holidaymakers that are walking around topless or in swimsuits anywhere outside designated beach areas. It's a response to local concerns about public decency, but more importantly, the impact of tourism on community life, tied to the issue of overtourism.\nThe Mayor of the town, Les Sables d\u2019Olonne, Yannick Moreau, published the town's poster on Instagram saying, \"200 years of Sablaise elegance wasn't meant for us to end up in the streets in our underwear.\"\nThe small village of Les Sables d'Olonne welcomes mostly French visitors throughout the summer, who increasingly leave the beach to shop and walk about\u2014in their swimsuits. And it's a situation that Mayor Yannick Moreau thinks is deteriorating. As reported in The New York Times, Moreau said, \"If you go to a market to buy local food, fruits, vegetables, meat, you cannot be half-naked with hair falling onto the vegetables,\" adding, \"It's a matter of decency.\"\nThe town doesn't think it's being unfair. On the Atlantic coast of France, Les Sables d'Olonne spans miles and miles of sandy beaches; plenty of room to stroll without many clothes. Moreau adds in his post, \"If you want to show off your pecs and your best swimming shorts, there are 11 kilometers of beach at your disposal.\" Plus, if you want to, you can also go naked\u2014since the town has a nudist beach too.\nLocals risk a fine of up to $175 (\u20ac150) for not being fully dressed. In July, the resort town gave out 10 fines, all to French tourists. The New York Times reports that's the most the town has handed out since the rule was first introduced in 2020. And that's what prompted Moreau to post on social media. The tagline for the ad campaign says, \"In Les Sables d'Olonne, respect doesn't go on holiday.\"\nLes Sables d'Olonne is not the only town struggling with half-dressed tourists. Drive four hours south down the Atlantic coast past La Rochelle and Bordeaux, and the summer crowd favorite of Arcachon is handing out fines of $175 (\u20ac150) to anyone considered to be not fully dressed.\nLast September, the Spanish city of Malaga set up billboards around the city to crack down on anti-social behaviour by British tourists, reminding them how to behave in public places. Primarily, it wanted them to wear more clothes and to sing less late at night.\nLast week, Malaga's City Hall was again posting the same campaign on social media, reminding people to stay fully dressed, to keep the city clean, and not to be too conspicuous with noise. In Malaga, tourists can be fined up to $825 if they are found in public places without clothes or wearing only underwear.\nCity officials in other European tourist destinations, such as on the Amalfi Coast, Italy, and Dubrovnik, Croatia, have also advertised that walking around the city in bathing suits is undesirable behavior. Italy can issue fines of hundreds of euros.\nSuch anti-social behavior, such as not being fully dressed on the streets of Spanish or French towns, particularly in high tourist season, can only fuel the antagonism felt by locals towards the multitude of tourists who arrive in Europe every summer.\nRecord-breaking tourist numbers were expected this summer 2025, and locals have been protesting over perceived injustices caused by rampant overtourism\u2014in 2024, more people visited Europe than the population of Europe itself, almost 750 million visitors."
