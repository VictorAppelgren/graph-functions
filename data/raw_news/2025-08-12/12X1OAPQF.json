  "content": "A number of stocks jumped in the morning session after positive inflation data fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation rose by a modest 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the last year. This cooler-than-expected data prompted a significant market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all climbing as investors grew more optimistic. The prevailing view is that easing inflation gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. Lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds, contributing to widespread gains across sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Health Insurance Providers company Centene (NYSE:CNC) jumped 3.1%.

Is now the time to buy Charles River Laboratories? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nRadNet\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 2 months ago when the stock gained 5.2% on the news that the major indices rebounded (Nasdaq +1.5%, S&P 500 +1.0%) as reports pointed to easing tensions between Israel and Iran. The Wall Street Journal said senior Iranian officials had signaled a willingness to restart stalled nuclear talks, on the condition that Washington refrain from joining Israel's ongoing strikes. This development triggered a significant decline in oil prices, easing inflation concerns. Also, it is possible some investors were buying the dip following the sell-off at the end of the previous week.",

      "text": "RadNet (RDNT)\nWe\u2019re cautious of RadNet. Its sales have underperformed and its low returns on capital show it has few growth opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy RadNet Is Not Exciting\nWith over 350 imaging facilities across seven states and a growing artificial intelligence division, RadNet (NASDAQ:RDNT) operates a network of outpatient diagnostic imaging centers across the United States, offering services like MRI, CT scans, PET scans, mammography, and X-rays.\n- Smaller revenue base of $1.91 billion means it hasn\u2019t achieved the economies of scale that some industry juggernauts enjoy\n- Responsiveness to unforeseen market trends is restricted due to its substandard operating margin profitability\n- A positive is that its incremental sales significantly boosted profitability as its annual earnings per share growth of 29.6% over the last five years outstripped its revenue performance\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than RadNet\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than RadNet\nAt $63.25 per share, RadNet trades at 111x forward P/E. This valuation is extremely expensive, especially for the quality you get.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. RadNet (RDNT) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nDiagnostic imaging company RadNet (NASDAQ:RDNT) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 8.4% year on year to $498.2 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.31 per share was 97.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRadNet (RDNT) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $498.2 million vs analyst estimates of $490.4 million (8.4% year-on-year growth, 1.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.31 vs analyst estimates of $0.16 (97.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $81.25 million vs analyst estimates of $77.4 million (16.3% margin, 5% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 6.2%, down from 7.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 13.5%, down from 15.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $4.77 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith over 350 imaging facilities across seven states and a growing artificial intelligence division, RadNet (NASDAQ:RDNT) operates a network of outpatient diagnostic imaging centers across the United States, offering services like MRI, CT scans, PET scans, mammography, and X-rays.\nRadNet's imaging centers serve as critical diagnostic hubs where physicians can send patients for a wide range of imaging procedures that help detect and monitor diseases. The company's multi-modality approach means most centers offer several types of imaging technologies under one roof, creating convenience for patients who might need multiple scans and providing physicians with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities.\nWhen a patient visits a RadNet facility, they might receive anything from a routine X-ray for a potential bone fracture to a specialized PET/CT scan to evaluate cancer treatment effectiveness. A typical patient experience involves checking in, undergoing the prescribed imaging procedure administered by technologists, and having their images interpreted by radiologists who then send detailed reports to the referring physician.\nRadNet generates revenue through a mix of payment sources. Commercial insurance companies pay agreed-upon rates for services, while Medicare and Medicaid reimburse according to government-established fee schedules. The company also participates in managed care capitation agreements where it receives fixed monthly payments per member to provide all necessary imaging services.\nBeyond traditional imaging services, RadNet has expanded into artificial intelligence through its DeepHealth subsidiary and European acquisitions. These AI initiatives focus on enhancing radiologist interpretations of breast, lung, and prostate images, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.\nRadNet also provides teleradiology services internationally through its Heart & Lung Imaging subsidiary, which serves providers within the United Kingdom's National Health Service by remotely interpreting medical images. The company's software division, eRad, develops and sells systems for managing, storing, and distributing digital medical images.\n4. Testing & Diagnostics Services\nThe testing and diagnostics services industry plays a crucial role in disease detection, monitoring, and prevention, serving hospitals, clinics, and individual consumers. This sector benefits from stable demand, driven by an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases, and growing awareness of preventive healthcare. Recurring revenue streams come from routine screenings, lab tests, and diagnostic imaging, with reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. However, the industry faces challenges such as pricing pressures, regulatory compliance, and the need for continuous investment in new testing technologies. Looking ahead, industry tailwinds include the expansion of personalized medicine, increased adoption of at-home and rapid diagnostic tests, and advancements in AI-driven diagnostics that enhance accuracy and efficiency. However, headwinds such as reimbursement uncertainties, competition from decentralized testing solutions, and regulatory scrutiny over test validity and cost-effectiveness may impact profitability. Adapting to evolving healthcare models and integrating automation will be key for sustaining growth and maintaining operational efficiency.\nRadNet competes with other outpatient imaging center operators like Akumin (NASDAQ:AKU), as well as hospital-based imaging departments, physician-owned imaging centers, and other healthcare facilities offering diagnostic imaging services.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $1.91 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, RadNet is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, RadNet grew its sales at a solid 12.4% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. RadNet\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 11.7% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable.\nThis quarter, RadNet reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.4%, and its $498.2 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.6%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and suggests the market sees some success for its newer products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nRadNet was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 4.9% was weak for a healthcare business.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, RadNet\u2019s operating margin decreased by 3.8 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. RadNet\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, RadNet generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.2%, down 1.4 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nRadNet\u2019s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it\u2019s at a critical moment in its life.\nIn Q2, RadNet reported adjusted EPS at $0.31, up from $0.16 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects RadNet\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.36 to grow 55.1%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nRadNet has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 2.7%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that RadNet\u2019s margin expanded by 2.9 percentage points during that time. The company\u2019s improvement shows it\u2019s heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose while its operating profitability fell.\nRadNet\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $67.41 million in Q2, equivalent to a 13.5% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 1.5 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but it\u2019s still above its five-year average. We wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter\u2019s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, causing short-term swings. Long-term trends trump temporary fluctuations.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nRadNet historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 6.9%, somewhat low compared to the best healthcare companies that consistently pump out 20%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. On average, RadNet\u2019s ROIC decreased by 1.6 percentage points annually over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nRadNet reported $833.2 million of cash and $1.84 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $276.3 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view RadNet\u2019s 3.6\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $83.32 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from RadNet\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly RadNet blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 2% to $63.25 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy RadNet?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:31 AM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on RadNet, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nRadNet\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. Although its revenue growth was solid over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its subscale operations give it fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals. And while the company\u2019s astounding EPS growth over the last five years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders, the downside is its operating margins are low compared to other healthcare companies.\nRadNet\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 111x. This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $71.57 on the company (compared to the current share price of $63.25)."

      "text": "Charles River Laboratories (CRL)\nCharles River Laboratories doesn\u2019t excite us. Its weak sales growth and low returns on capital show it struggled to generate demand and profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Charles River Laboratories Will Underperform\nNamed after the Massachusetts river where it was founded in 1947, Charles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) provides non-clinical drug development services, research models, and manufacturing support to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\n- Organic sales performance over the past two years indicates the company may need to make strategic adjustments or rely on M&A to catalyze faster growth\n- Sales are projected to be flat over the next 12 months and imply weak demand\n- A positive is that its disciplined cost controls and effective management have materialized in a strong adjusted operating margin\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Charles River Laboratories\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Charles River Laboratories\nAt $148.93 per share, Charles River Laboratories trades at 14.8x forward P/E. Charles River Laboratories\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among healthcare peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nCheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. They often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Charles River Laboratories (CRL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nLab services company Charles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales were flat year on year at $1.03 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $3.12 per share was 24.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nCharles River Laboratories (CRL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.03 billion vs analyst estimates of $986.9 million (flat year on year, 4.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $3.12 vs analyst estimates of $2.50 (24.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $236.7 million vs analyst estimates of $241.5 million (22.9% margin, 2% miss)\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $10.10 at the midpoint, a 5.8% increase\n- Operating Margin: 9.7%, down from 14.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 16.4%, up from 15% in the same quarter last year\n- Organic Revenue was flat year on year (-3.2% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $8.23 billion\nCompany Overview\nNamed after the Massachusetts river where it was founded in 1947, Charles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) provides non-clinical drug development services, research models, and manufacturing support to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nCharles River operates through three main segments that support different stages of drug development. The Research Models and Services segment supplies laboratory animals (primarily rodents) that are essential for early-stage drug testing, along with related services like colony management and health monitoring. These purpose-bred research models serve as foundational tools for discovering new molecules and testing drug safety before human trials.\nThe Discovery and Safety Assessment segment, which generates the majority of the company's revenue, offers comprehensive services spanning from early drug discovery to regulatory-required safety testing. Scientists at Charles River can identify and validate drug targets, optimize potential drug candidates, and conduct toxicology studies to determine if compounds are safe enough for human trials. This segment allows pharmaceutical companies to outsource complex scientific work rather than maintaining these capabilities in-house.\nThe Manufacturing Solutions segment helps ensure the quality and safety of biopharmaceutical products. Its Microbial Solutions business provides testing systems to detect contamination in pharmaceutical manufacturing, including the industry-standard endotoxin testing products derived from horseshoe crab blood. The Biologics Solutions business offers analytical testing for biologic drugs and contract development and manufacturing services for cell and gene therapies.\nA typical client might engage Charles River to help identify a promising drug candidate, test it in appropriate research models, conduct required safety assessments, and support manufacturing quality control\u2014essentially outsourcing much of the non-clinical development process to a specialized partner. The company generates revenue through service fees and product sales to pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, academic institutions, and government agencies worldwide.\nCharles River has expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions, particularly in high-growth areas like cell and gene therapy. The company maintains facilities across North America, Europe, and Asia, positioning itself near major biopharmaceutical hubs to serve clients globally.\n4. Drug Development Inputs & Services\nCompanies specializing in drug development inputs and services play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology value chain. Essential support for drug discovery, preclinical testing, and manufacturing means stable demand, as pharmaceutical companies often outsource non-core functions with medium to long-term contracts. However, the business model faces high capital requirements, customer concentration, and vulnerability to shifts in biopharma R&D budgets or regulatory frameworks. Looking ahead, the industry will likely enjoy tailwinds such as increasing investment in biologics, cell and gene therapies, and advancements in precision medicine, which drive demand for sophisticated tools and services. There is a growing trend of outsourcing in drug development for nimbleness and cost efficiency, which benefits the industry. On the flip side, potential headwinds include pricing pressures as efforts to contain healthcare costs are always top of mind. An evolving regulatory backdrop could also slow innovation or client activity.\nCharles River's competitors include other preclinical contract research organizations like Labcorp Drug Development (NYSE: LH), IQVIA (NYSE: IQV), and Thermo Fisher Scientific's (NYSE: TMO) contract research services. In the cell and gene therapy CDMO space, it competes with Catalent (NYSE: CTLT) and Lonza Group (SWX: LONN).\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $4.03 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Charles River Laboratories has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Charles River Laboratories\u2019s sales grew at a decent 7.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Charles River Laboratories\u2019s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 1.8% over the last two years.\nCharles River Laboratories also reports organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Charles River Laboratories\u2019s organic revenue averaged 1.6% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its two-year revenue growth, we can see the company\u2019s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results.\nThis quarter, Charles River Laboratories\u2019s $1.03 billion of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 4.6%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 2.2% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its newer products and services will not lead to better top-line performance yet.\n7. Operating Margin\nCharles River Laboratories has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 13.1%, higher than the broader healthcare sector.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Charles River Laboratories\u2019s operating margin decreased by 12.9 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 12.4 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Charles River Laboratories generated an operating margin profit margin of 9.7%, down 5.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nCharles River Laboratories\u2019s solid 8.5% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded.\nIn Q2, Charles River Laboratories reported adjusted EPS at $3.12, up from $2.80 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Charles River Laboratories\u2019s full-year EPS of $10.71 to shrink by 7.2%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nCharles River Laboratories has shown impressive cash profitability, giving it the option to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 11.3% over the last five years, better than the broader healthcare sector.\nCharles River Laboratories\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $169.3 million in Q2, equivalent to a 16.4% margin. This result was good as its margin was 1.4 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nCharles River Laboratories historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 7.2%, somewhat low compared to the best healthcare companies that consistently pump out 20%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Charles River Laboratories\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCharles River Laboratories reported $182.8 million of cash and $1.44 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $965.2 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Charles River Laboratories\u2019s 1.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $52.77 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Charles River Laboratories\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Charles River Laboratories blew past analysts\u2019 organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 1.5% to $165.01 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Charles River Laboratories?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:24 AM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Charles River Laboratories.\nCharles River Laboratories isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. Although its revenue growth was decent over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its organic revenue declined. And while the company\u2019s sturdy operating margins show it has disciplined cost controls, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out.\nCharles River Laboratories\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 14.8x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we think the potential downside is too great. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $168.75 on the company (compared to the current share price of $148.93)."

      "text": "Evolent Health (EVH)\nWe\u2019re skeptical of Evolent Health. Its negative returns on capital suggest it eroded shareholder value by squandering business opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Evolent Health Will Underperform\nFounded in 2011 to transform how healthcare is delivered to patients with complex needs, Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH) provides specialty care management services and technology solutions that help health plans and providers deliver better care for patients with complex conditions.\n- Negative returns on capital show management lost money while trying to expand the business\n- Sales are projected to tank by 4.4% over the next 12 months as demand evaporates\n- A bright spot is that its performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were extremely profitable, as its annual earnings per share growth of 48.4% outpaced its revenue gains\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Evolent Health\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Evolent Health\nEvolent Health\u2019s stock price of $9.22 implies a valuation ratio of 21.1x forward P/E. This multiple rich for the business quality. Not a great combination.\nPaying a premium for high-quality companies with strong long-term earnings potential is preferable to owning challenged businesses with questionable prospects. That helps the prudent investor sleep well at night.\n3. Evolent Health (EVH) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare solutions company Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 31.3% year on year to $444.3 million. Next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $470 million underwhelmed, coming in 12.9% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.10 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nEvolent Health (EVH) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $444.3 million vs analyst estimates of $459.5 million (31.3% year-on-year decline, 3.3% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.10 vs analyst estimates of $0.08 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $37.55 million vs analyst estimates of $35.89 million (8.5% margin, 4.6% beat)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.87 billion at the midpoint from $2.09 billion, a 10.6% decrease\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $152.5 million at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\n- Operating Margin: -0.3%, down from 1.2% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$39.1 million, down from $14.31 million in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes rose 7.4% year on year (-1.7% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $1.12 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2011 to transform how healthcare is delivered to patients with complex needs, Evolent Health (NYSE:EVH) provides specialty care management services and technology solutions that help health plans and providers deliver better care for patients with complex conditions.\nEvolent Health focuses on three core areas: specialty care management, total cost of care management, and administrative services. The company's specialty care management services target high-cost, complex conditions like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders. These services include building networks of high-performing providers, designing evidence-based clinical pathways, and deploying proprietary technology to guide treatment decisions.\nFor specialty care management, Evolent uses its CarePro platform to provide clinical decision support and ensure providers adhere to best-practice treatment protocols. This approach aims to improve patient outcomes while reducing unnecessary costs for health plans and risk-bearing entities.\nThe company's total cost of care management solution helps healthcare providers succeed under value-based contracts, where they assume financial responsibility for patient populations. Evolent identifies high-risk patients and coordinates targeted interventions through primary care physicians to prevent costly complications or hospitalizations.\nOn the administrative side, Evolent offers its Identifi platform, which aggregates and analyzes healthcare data to manage care workflows and engage patients. The platform provides services like health plan administration, pharmacy benefit management, risk management, and analytics.\nA health plan might engage Evolent to manage its cancer patients by implementing evidence-based treatment protocols, connecting patients with high-performing oncologists, and using technology to track outcomes. This approach can reduce unnecessary treatments while ensuring patients receive appropriate care.\nEvolent generates revenue through service contracts with health plans, provider organizations, and other risk-bearing entities. The company has expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions, including New Century Health (oncology and cardiovascular care), IPG (musculoskeletal management), and NIA (radiology and genetics management).\n4. Healthcare Technology for Providers\nThe healthcare technology sector provides software and data analytics to help hospitals and clinics streamline operations and improve patient outcomes, often through value-based care models. Future growth is expected as providers prioritize digital transformation to manage rising costs and patient demands. Tailwinds include the adoption of AI-driven tools and government incentives for digitization. There challenges as well, including long sales cycles and slow adoption by providers, who may be resistance to change. Tightening hospital budgets and cybersecurity threats are additional risks that could slow adoption.\nEvolent Health competes with other healthcare management and technology companies such as Optum (part of UnitedHealth Group, NYSE:UNH), Signify Health (acquired by CVS Health, NYSE:CVS), and Evernorth (part of Cigna Group, NYSE:CI), as well as specialized care management firms like Magellan Health and AIM Specialty Health.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $2.2 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Evolent Health lacks scale in an industry where it matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Evolent Health\u2019s sales grew at an impressive 19.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Evolent Health\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 16% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of average lives on platform, which reached 77.02 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Evolent Health\u2019s average lives on platform averaged 101% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the company\u2019s average selling price decreased.\nThis quarter, Evolent Health missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 31.3% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $444.3 million of revenue. Company management is currently guiding for a 24.4% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n7. Operating Margin\nAlthough Evolent Health broke even this quarter from an operational perspective, it\u2019s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 2.1% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nOn the plus side, Evolent Health\u2019s operating margin rose by 2.7 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Still, it will take much more for the company to reach long-term profitability.\nIn Q2, Evolent Health generated a negative 0.3% operating margin.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlthough Evolent Health\u2019s full-year earnings are still negative, it reduced its losses and improved its EPS by 44.5% annually over the last five years. The next few quarters will be critical for assessing its long-term profitability.\nIn Q2, Evolent Health reported adjusted EPS at negative $0.10, down from $0.18 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Evolent Health\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.02 will reach break even.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nEvolent Health broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that Evolent Health\u2019s margin expanded by 11.1 percentage points during that time. The company\u2019s improvement shows it\u2019s heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability.\nEvolent Health burned through $39.1 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 8.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nEvolent Health\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 3.1%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, Evolent Health\u2019s ROIC averaged 2.6 percentage point increases over the last few years. This is a good sign, and if its returns keep rising, there\u2019s a chance it could evolve into an investable business.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nEvolent Health reported $151 million of cash and $681.1 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $128.8 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Evolent Health\u2019s 4.1\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $9.7 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Evolent Health\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its full-year revenue guidance missed and its revenue guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 5.6% to $9.15 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Evolent Health?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:11 AM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own Evolent Health, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nEvolent Health isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Although its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. And while the company\u2019s growth in average lives on platform was surging, the downside is its low free cash flow margins give it little breathing room.\nEvolent Health\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 21.1x. This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $15.31 on the company (compared to the current share price of $9.22).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "Illumina (ILMN)\nIllumina keeps us up at night. Its weak sales growth and low returns on capital show it struggled to generate demand and profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Illumina Will Underperform\nPioneering the ability to read the human genome at unprecedented speed and affordability, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) develops and sells advanced DNA sequencing and microarray technologies that allow researchers and clinicians to analyze genetic variations and functions.\n- Earnings per share have dipped by 6.3% annually over the past five years, which is concerning because stock prices follow EPS over the long term\n- ROIC of -0.5% reflects management\u2019s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities\n- Sales tumbled by 1.4% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Illumina\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Illumina\nIllumina\u2019s stock price of $94.79 implies a valuation ratio of 21.3x forward P/E. This multiple is higher than that of healthcare peers; it\u2019s also rich for the top-line growth of the company. Not a great combination.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. Illumina (ILMN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nGenomics company Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 3% year on year to $1.06 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.36 per share was 64.4% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIllumina (ILMN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.06 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.05 billion (3% year-on-year decline, 1% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.36 vs analyst expectations of $1.01 (64.4% miss)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $252 million vs analyst estimates of $221.3 million (23.8% margin, 13.8% beat)\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $4.50 at the midpoint, a 5.9% increase\n- Operating Margin: 20.2%, down from 40.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 19.3%, up from 4.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Organic Revenue fell 3% year on year (-6.2% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $16.88 billion\nCompany Overview\nPioneering the ability to read the human genome at unprecedented speed and affordability, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) develops and sells advanced DNA sequencing and microarray technologies that allow researchers and clinicians to analyze genetic variations and functions.\nIllumina's technology platforms enable genetic analysis at all levels of complexity, from targeted gene panels to complete whole-genome sequencing. The company's flagship product line includes sequencing instruments like the NovaSeq X Plus, which can sequence a human genome for as little as $200, and the more compact MiSeq systems designed for smaller laboratories. These systems use Illumina's proprietary sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry to accurately read DNA sequences.\nBeyond hardware, Illumina provides a comprehensive ecosystem of consumables, software, and services. The consumables include reagents, flow cells, and library preparation kits that are essential for running experiments on their instruments. The company's bioinformatics solutions, such as the BaseSpace Informatics Suite and DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform, help customers manage, analyze, and interpret the massive amounts of data generated by sequencing.\nIllumina serves diverse markets including academic research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and clinical laboratories. In research settings, scientists use Illumina's technology to study everything from basic gene function to complex disease mechanisms. Clinically, the technology enables applications like non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which can detect fetal chromosomal abnormalities from a maternal blood sample, and cancer genomics, where tumor DNA is analyzed to guide treatment decisions.\nFor example, an oncologist might use Illumina's technology to sequence a patient's tumor, identifying specific mutations that could make the cancer susceptible to targeted therapies. Similarly, a research institution might deploy Illumina sequencers to analyze thousands of human genomes as part of a population-wide study to discover genetic factors associated with common diseases.\nIllumina generates revenue primarily through instrument sales and the recurring purchase of consumables needed for each sequencing run. The company maintains a global presence with direct sales operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region, supplemented by distributors in other markets.\n4. Genomics & Sequencing\nGenomics and sequencing companies within the life sciences industry provide the technology for increasingly personalized medicine, drug discovery, and disease research. These firms leverage cutting-edge platforms for high-throughput sequencing and genomic analysis, enabling researchers and healthcare providers to better understand genetic underpinnings of diseases. While the industry enjoys high barriers to entry due to proprietary technology and intellectual property, the business model also faces significant R&D costs, reliance on continued innovation, and exposure to shifts in academic, biotech, and clinical research funding. Over the next few years, the subsector is well-positioned to benefit from tailwinds such as increasing adoption of precision medicine, expanded applications for sequencing technologies in areas like oncology and rare disease diagnostics, and growing use of genomic data in drug development. Advances in artificial intelligence could further enhance the speed and accuracy of genomic insights. However, potential headwinds include price sensitivity among research institutions and healthcare systems that are constantly trying to contain and lower costs. Additionally, regulations around data privacy and genomic testing are not yet set in stone, adding uncertainty to the industry.\nIllumina's main competitors include Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) with its Ion Torrent sequencing platform, Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:PACB) specializing in long-read sequencing technology, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (LSE:ONT) known for its portable sequencing devices. The company also faces competition from emerging players like Element Biosciences and BGI Genomics (SHE:300676).\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $4.28 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Illumina has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Illumina\u2019s 5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was mediocre. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Illumina\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 1.4% annually.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Illumina\u2019s organic revenue averaged 1.3% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its two-year revenue growth, we can see the company\u2019s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results.\nThis quarter, Illumina\u2019s revenue fell by 3% year on year to $1.06 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its newer products and services will not catalyze better top-line performance yet.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\nIllumina has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 22.4%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Illumina\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 5 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 1.8 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see Illumina become more profitable in the future.\nIn Q2, Illumina generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 23.8%, up 1.6 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development, especially since its revenue fell, showing it was more efficient because it scaled down its expenses.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Illumina, its EPS declined by 10.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 5%. However, its adjusted operating margin actually improved during this time, telling us that non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes affected its ultimate earnings.\nWe can take a deeper look into Illumina\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Illumina\u2019s adjusted operating margin expanded this quarter but declined by 5 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 6.1%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, Illumina reported adjusted EPS at $0.36, down from $1.09 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Illumina\u2019s full-year EPS of $3.42 to grow 30.2%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nIllumina has shown impressive cash profitability, giving it the option to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 10.6% over the last five years, better than the broader healthcare sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Illumina\u2019s margin expanded by 1.4 percentage points during that time. This shows the company is heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose while its operating profitability fell.\nIllumina\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $204 million in Q2, equivalent to a 19.3% margin. This result was good as its margin was 14.8 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nIllumina\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 0.9%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Investors are likely hoping for a change soon.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Illumina\u2019s ROIC has increased. This is a good sign, but we recognize its lack of profitable growth during the COVID era was the primary reason for the change.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nIllumina reported $1.16 billion of cash and $1.99 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.15 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Illumina\u2019s 0.7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $54 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Illumina\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Illumina blew past analysts\u2019 full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS missed. Overall, this print was mixed. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 1.7% to $101.03 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Illumina?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:48 PM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nIllumina doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. To kick things off, its revenue growth was mediocre over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its rising returns show management's prior bets are at least better than before, the downside is its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets. On top of that, its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nIllumina\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 21.3x. At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $113.52 on the company (compared to the current share price of $94.79).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

  "argos_summary": "Positive inflation data led to a stock market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all rising as investors anticipated potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Key stocks in the healthcare sector, including Centene, RadNet, Evolent Health, Illumina, and Charles River Laboratories, experienced notable gains, although analysts express caution regarding their long-term growth prospects and valuations. Despite some companies reporting strong quarterly results, concerns about high valuations and declining revenue growth suggest that investors should carefully evaluate these stocks before making investment decisions.",
