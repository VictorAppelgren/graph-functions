  "content": "Even high earners aren\u2019t immune to credit card debt. According to BHG Financial, 62% of individuals earning more than $300,000 annually carry a credit card balance.\n\nYou might think that scoring a six-figure income would finally spell financial freedom and stability, but this finding challenges that assumption.\n\u2022 Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\u2022 I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\u2022 Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan \u2018works every single time\u2019 to kill debt, get rich in America \u2014 and that \u2018anyone\u2019 can do it\n\nOne major culprit is lifestyle creep: as income rises, so does spending. Bigger homes, luxury cars, and lavish vacations may feel justified with more money coming in, but they can undermine financial security.\n\nHigher taxes, larger mortgages, and the social pressure to spend in high-income communities \u2014 combined with easy access to credit \u2014 only exacerbates this.\n\nBut how many people actually earn that much? It's rare. According to U.S. Census data, only about 2% of individuals make more than $300,000, and fewer than 10% of American households earn $250,000 or more.\n\nBeyond lifestyle factors, broader economic forces also drive people into debt.\n\nFor one, inflation \u2014 especially on essentials like groceries, gas, and housing \u2014 quickly eats into budgets and erodes purchasing power, even for high earners. A July 2025 Associated Press survey found that more than half of Americans are highly stressed about grocery costs, and only 14% report not worrying about them at all.\n\nUnplanned expenses are another major strain. From medical bills to sudden home or car repairs, these costs can overwhelm even those with strong incomes.\n\nThe Federal Reserve reports that 23% of adults faced major unexpected medical expenses in the past year, and 15%-18% are carrying medical debt. Even with insurance, medical emergencies can be costly.\n\nA 2022 study on elective orthopedic surgeries found that out-of-pocket expenses ranged from $2,700 to nearly $3,200 per procedure, and those numbers continue to rise.\n\nThe rich aren\u2019t immune to market volatility. Many invest heavily in stocks or real estate, assuming these assets will ensure financial stability. But when markets fall, wealth can shrink dramatically.",

      "text": "The vast majority of US adults are stressed about grocery costs, an AP-NORC poll finds\nThe vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs remain widespread.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs remain widespread.\nAbout half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it\u2019s a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it\u2019s not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.\nOther financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.\nThe survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they\u2019ve used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.\nAdam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.\n\u201cI just keep watching the prices go up, so I\u2019m looking for the cheapest possible stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHot pockets and TV dinners.\u201d\nEveryone is stressed about groceries\nGroceries are one of the most far-reaching financial stressors, affecting the young and old alike, the poll finds. While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.\nEsther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.\n\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d\nBland\u2019s monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs.\n\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven\u2019t seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d\nAccording to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That\u2019s compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.\nBut even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren\u2019t a worry at all.\nWomen and Hispanic adults are especially economically anxious\nHousing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.\nAbout 3 in 10 say credit card debt is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, while about 2 in 10 say that about the cost of child care and student debt.\nBut some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the cost of housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, compared with about half of Black adults and about 4 in 10 white adults.\nSome people are making changes to their lifestyle as a result of high costs. Shandal LeSure, 43, who works as a receptionist for a rehabilitation hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and makes between $85,000 and $100,000 a year, said she\u2019s started shopping for groceries at less expensive stores.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an adjustment,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the quality isn\u2019t as good.\u201d\nMany US adults have used \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 services\nAs they stretch limited budgets, about 3 in 10 U.S. adults overall say they\u2019ve used \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services such as Afterpay or Klarna to purchase groceries, entertainment, restaurant meals or meal delivery, or medical or dental care, according to the poll.\nBland, the Washington state retiree, said she\u2019s paid for pet surgery with a pay-later plan.\nYounger Americans are much likelier than older people to have used pay-later plans for entertainment, groceries or restaurant meals, but there\u2019s no age gap on medical care. Black and Hispanic people are also especially likely to adopt the plans.\nAn increasing share of \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d customers are having trouble repaying their loans, according to recent disclosures from the lenders. The loans are marketed as a safer alternative to traditional credit cards, but there are risks, including a lack of federal oversight. Some consumer watchdogs also say the plans lead consumers to overextend themselves financially.\nLeSure said she\u2019s used pay-later services for things like new clothes, while she balances debt payments for a car loan, student loans and medical bills. She\u2019s also turned to them to cover hotel costs after being evicted.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been able to help me stretch my dollar,\u201d she said.\nYour Buy Now Pay Later loans will soon affect your credit score. Here\u2019s what to know\n___\nSanders reported from Washington.\n___\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,437 adults was conducted July 10-14, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

      "text": "Expenses\nThe share of adults who would cover a relatively small emergency expense using cash or its equivalent was unchanged from 2022 but down from 2021. Most adults said that changes in prices they paid compared with the prior year had made their finances worse, and a majority adjusted their spending in response to higher prices. Low-income adults were more likely to experience difficulties covering expenses. These difficulties included not paying all bills in full, sometimes or often not having enough to eat, and skipping medical care because of cost.\nBills and Regular Expenses\nTo understand how people were handling their regular household expenses, the survey asked about paying bills. Seventeen percent of adults said they did not pay all their bills in full in the month prior to the survey.28\nLower-income adults were less likely to have paid all their bills in full. In the month prior to the survey, 36 percent of adults with a family income less than $25,000 did not pay all their bills in full, compared with 6 percent of adults with a family income of $100,000 or more (table 10). In addition, Black and Hispanic adults were less likely than White or Asian adults to have paid all their bills in full in the prior month.\nTable 10. Did not pay all bills in full in prior month (by family income and race/ethnicity)\n| Characteristic | Percent |\n|---|---|\n| Family income | |\n| Less than $25,000 | 36 |\n| $25,000\u2212$49,999 | 24 |\n| $50,000\u2212$99,999 | 13 |\n| $100,000 or more | 6 |\n| Race/ethnicity | |\n| White | 11 |\n| Black | 31 |\n| Hispanic | 27 |\n| Asian | 12 |\n| Overall | 17 |\nNote: Among all adults. For credit cards, \"did not pay in full\" is defined as paying less than the minimum payment.\nRenters were more likely than homeowners to say they did not pay all their bills in the prior month (table 11). In part, this reflects that renters have lower incomes than homeowners, although even for those with similar incomes, the share of renters who did not pay at least one bill exceeded that for homeowners.\nTable 11. Types of bills not paid in full last month (by homeownership status)\nPercent\n| Bills | Homeowner | Renter | All adults |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Water, gas, and electric bills | 3 | 11 | 5 |\n| Phone, internet, and cable bills | 2 | 8 | 4 |\n| Rent or mortgage | 1 | 7 | 3 |\n| Car payment | 1 | 6 | 3 |\n| Credit card (less than minimum payment) | 2 | 4 | 3 |\n| Any bills not paid in full | 11 | 27 | 17 |\nNote: Among all adults. Respondents could select multiple answers. Respondents could also select that they did not pay all bills in full but that the unpaid bill was not one of these options.\nThose who did not pay at least one bill in full were asked about several specific bill types. Of these, the most common types of bills people did not pay in full were a water, gas, or electric bill (5 percent) or a phone, internet, or cable bill (4 percent). Across each of these bill types, renters also had higher rates of nonpayment.\nMost adults said that price increases made their financial situation worse. Sixty-five percent of adults said that changes in the prices they paid compared with the prior year had made their financial situation worse, including 19 percent who said price changes had made their financial situation much worse. In contrast, 4 percent of adults said that price changes compared with the prior year had made their financial situation better. Thirty-one percent of adults said overall changes in the prices they paid had little to no effect on their financial situation in the last year.\nAdults with income under $100,000 were more likely to say that price changes had made their financial situation worse compared with responses from higher-income adults (table 12).29 White and Hispanic adults, adults with a disability, and parents living with their children under age 18 were also more likely to say that changes in prices they paid compared with a year ago had made their financial situation worse.\nTable 12. Changes in prices paid compared with last year made financial situation worse (by demographic characteristics)\nPercent\n| Characteristic | Much worse | At least somewhat worse |\n|---|---|---|\n| Family income | ||\n| Less than $25,000 | 29 | 67 |\n| $25,000\u2212$49,999 | 24 | 70 |\n| $50,000\u2212$99,999 | 20 | 68 |\n| $100,000 or more | 11 | 58 |\n| Race/ethnicity | ||\n| White | 19 | 67 |\n| Black | 16 | 54 |\n| Hispanic | 24 | 66 |\n| Asian | 9 | 54 |\n| Disability status | ||\n| Disability | 27 | 71 |\n| No disability | 17 | 63 |\n| Parental status | ||\n| Parents (living with own children under age 18) | 23 | 69 |\n| All other adults | 18 | 63 |\n| Overall | 19 | 65 |\nNote: Among all adults.\nMost people took some action in response to higher prices. The most common actions were spending changes, including switching to a cheaper product (62 percent of adults), using less of or stopping using a product (61 percent), or delaying a major purchase (48 percent) (table 13). Forty-five percent of adults reported they reduced savings. Increasing borrowing was less common, as were activities to generate additional income, such as working more or asking for a raise.30 Compared with actions taken in 2022 in response to higher prices, people were less likely to report spending changes or reduced savings but slightly more likely to report asking for a raise.\nTable 13. Actions taken in response to higher prices in the prior 12 months (by year)\nPercent\n| Action | 2022 | 2023 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Spending | ||\n| Switched to cheaper products | 64 | 62 |\n| Used less or stopped using products | 66 | 61 |\n| Delayed a major purchase | 49 | 48 |\n| Saving/borrowing | ||\n| Reduced savings | 51 | 45 |\n| Increased borrowing | 15 | 15 |\n| Income | ||\n| Worked more or got another job | 18 | 18 |\n| Asked for a raise | 8 | 9 |\n| Took any action | 83 | 79 |\nNote: Among all adults. Respondents could select multiple answers.\nAdults who had less margin between their spending and their income appeared more likely to take action in response to higher prices. Among adults who said their spending exceeded their income in the month before the survey, 92 percent took at least one action in response to higher prices. Among those whose spending was less than their income, a lower 71 percent took at least one action.\nFood Sufficiency\nInability to afford food is a particularly severe hardship. To measure this type of material hardship, the 2023 survey included a new question about food in the household. Seven percent of adults said that members of their household sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the prior month, referred to here as \"food insufficiency.\" An additional 26 percent of adults said that members of their household had enough to eat in the prior month but not always the kinds of food they wanted to eat.31\nTwenty-one percent of adults with a family income less than $25,000 said members of their household sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the past month, as did 10 percent of those with a family income between $25,000 and $50,000 (table 14). Younger adults, Black and Hispanic adults, adults with a disability, and parents living with their children under age 18 were also more likely to report food insufficiency in their household in the prior month than other adults.\nTable 14. Sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the prior month (by demographic characteristics)\n| Characteristic | Percent |\n|---|---|\n| Family income | |\n| Less than $25,000 | 21 |\n| $25,000\u2212$49,999 | 10 |\n| $50,000\u2212$99,999 | 5 |\n| $100,000 or more | 1 |\n| Age | |\n| 18\u221229 | 11 |\n| 30\u221244 | 10 |\n| 45\u221259 | 7 |\n| 60+ | 3 |\n| Race/ethnicity | |\n| White | 5 |\n| Black | 10 |\n| Hispanic | 13 |\n| Asian | 4 |\n| Disability status | |\n| Disability | 15 |\n| No disability | 6 |\n| Parental status | |\n| Parents (living with own children under age 18) | 11 |\n| All other adults | 6 |\n| Overall | 7 |\nNote: Among all adults.\nHealth-Care Expenses\nForgoing medical treatment is another reflection of financial hardship. Twenty-seven percent of adults went without some form of medical care in 2023 because they could not afford it, similar to the share in 2022 but up from 24 percent in 2021 (figure 20). Dental care was the most frequently skipped, followed by visiting a doctor (table 15). Some people also reported skipping prescription medicine, follow-up care, or mental health visits.\nTable 15. Forms of medical treatment skipped because of cost in the prior 12 months\n| Type | Percent |\n|---|---|\n| Dental care | 19 |\n| Seeing a doctor or specialist | 15 |\n| Prescription medicine | 10 |\n| Follow-up care | 9 |\n| Mental health care or counseling | 9 |\n| Any treatment | 27 |\nNote: Among all adults. Respondents could select multiple answers.\nThe likelihood of skipping medical care because of cost was strongly related to family income. Among those with family income less than $25,000, 42 percent went without some medical care because they could not afford it, compared with 12 percent of adults making $100,000 or more.\nUnexpected or large medical expenses can be a particular financial hardship for families. Twenty-three percent of adults had major, unexpected medical expenses in the prior 12 months, with the median amount between $1,000 and $1,999. Seventeen percent of adults had debt from their own medical care or that of a family member (not necessarily from the past year). The share with outstanding medical debt has ranged from 15 to 18 percent each year since the question was first asked in 2019.\nHealth insurance is one way that people can pay for routine medical expenses and protect against the financial burden of large, unexpected expenses. In 2023, 91 percent of adults had health insurance, similar to that seen each year since 2016, but up from the 85 percent who reported having health insurance in 2013 when the survey began.\nThose without health insurance were more likely to forgo medical treatment because they could not afford it. Among the uninsured, 46 percent went without medical treatment because they could not afford it, compared with 25 percent among the insured.\nUnexpected Expenses and Emergency Savings\nRelatively small, unexpected expenses, such as a car repair or a modest medical bill, can be a hardship for many families, especially those without a financial cushion. When faced with a hypothetical expense of $400, 63 percent of all adults in 2023 said they would have covered it exclusively using cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement (referred to, altogether, as \"cash or its equivalent\"). The remainder said they would have paid by borrowing or selling something or said they would not have been able to cover the expense.\nThe share who would pay using cash or its equivalent was unchanged from 2022 but down from a high of 68 percent in 2021, and around the levels in 2019 and 2020 (figure 21).32 The higher shares who said they would pay with cash or its equivalent in 2021 is consistent with other research showing that fiscal relief measures and a pullback in consumer spending boosted saving in the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic.33\nAmong the 37 percent of adults who would not have covered a $400 expense completely with cash or its equivalent, most would pay some other way, and some said that they would be unable to pay the expense at all. For these adults, the most common approach was to use a credit card and then carry a balance, although many indicated they would use multiple approaches. Thirteen percent of all adults said they would be unable to pay the expense by any means (table 16), unchanged from 2022 but up from 11 percent in 2021.\nTable 16. Other ways individuals would cover a $400 emergency expense\n| Characteristic | Percent |\n|---|---|\n| Put it on a credit card and pay it off over time | 16 |\n| Borrow from a friend or family member | 10 |\n| Sell something | 7 |\n| Use money from a bank loan or line of credit | 3 |\n| Use a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft | 2 |\n| Would not be able to pay for the expense right now | 13 |\nNote: Among all adults. Respondents could select multiple answers.\nSome of those who would not have paid an unexpected $400 expense with cash or its equivalent likely still had access to $400 in cash. Instead of using that cash to pay for the expense, they may have chosen to preserve their cash as a buffer for other expenses.\nTo explore this potential difference between how people would pay for a small, unexpected expense and whether they could pay for it with cash or the equivalent, the survey included a question asking people what the largest emergency expense was that they could handle using only savings. Eighteen percent of adults said the largest emergency expense they could handle right now using only savings was under $100, and 14 percent said they could handle an expense of $100 to $499 (table 17).\nTable 17. Largest emergency expense individuals could handle right now using only savings\n| Amount | Percent |\n|---|---|\n| Less than $100 | 18 |\n| $100\u2013$499 | 14 |\n| $500\u2013$999 | 10 |\n| $1,000\u2013$1,999 | 10 |\n| $2,000 or more | 48 |\nNote: Among all adults.\nSixty-eight percent of adults said they could pay an expense of at least $500 using only their current savings (table 17), unchanged from 2022. This is a somewhat larger share than the 63 percent of adults who said they would pay an unexpected $400 expense with cash or the equivalent, suggesting that some people do choose to pay with other methods, even if they have cash savings available to them.34\nSome financial challenges, such as a job loss, require more financial resources than would an unexpected $400 expense. One common measure of financial resiliency is whether people have savings sufficient to cover three months of expenses if they lost their primary source of income. In 2023, 54 percent of adults said they had set aside money for three months of expenses in an emergency savings or \"rainy day\" fund\u2014unchanged from 2022 but down from a high of 59 percent of adults in 2021.\nFor those who did not set aside money for this purpose, some would have dealt with a loss of their main source of income by borrowing, selling assets, or drawing on other savings. Fifteen percent of all adults said that they could have covered three months of expenses in this way. Thirty-one percent of adults indicated they could not cover three months of expenses by any means.\nReferences\n28. The question on bill payment was revised for the 2023 survey and the results are not directly comparable to prior years. In this report, adults who did not pay all their bills in full are those who (1) did not pay a credit card bill or made less than the minimum payment last month or (2) did not pay another type of bill in full last month. In earlier surveys, respondents were asked about their expected ability to pay all their bills in full this month, and the question did not specify what paying in full meant for credit card bills . Shifting to a retrospective question can affect results since expected ability to make a payment does not perfectly predict actually making the payments (Jeff Larrimore and Erin Troland, \"Improving Housing Payment Projections during the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 20, 2020), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2772).

Recent research has observed that low-income households experience slightly higher rates of inflation than those with higher incomes (Joshua Klick and Anya Stockburger, \"Inflation Experiences for Lower and Higher Income Households,\" Spotlight on Statistics, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, December 2022, https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2022/inflation-experiences-for-lower-and-higher-income-households/home.htm).

These results reflect those who indicated that they asked for a raise specifically because of higher prices, which is lower than overall share who asked for a raise, as discussed in the \"Employment\" section of this report.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food insufficiency as sometimes or often not having enough to eat, and marginal food insufficiency as having enough to eat but not always the kinds of foods they wanted to eat. See the USDA Economic Research Service at https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/measurement/. The SHED food insufficiency question is similar to questions fielded on the Census Household Pulse survey and the annual Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS), although the reference periods are different, which may contribute to differences in their estimates.

To check how changes in price levels affect responses to this question, the 2022 survey asked one-fifth of respondents how they would handle a $500 expense instead. Changing the threshold only altered the share who would pay in cash by 0.5 percentage points, suggesting that shifts in the price level have not materially affected the trend in this series.

  "argos_summary": "Even those earning over $300,000 often carry credit card balances, with 62% reporting debt, driven by lifestyle creep, rising costs, and unexpected expenses. Inflation\u2014especially on groceries, gas, and housing\u2014erodes purchasing power, while medical bills and elective surgeries add to debt burdens. A July 2025 AP survey shows most Americans feel stressed about grocery costs, and a broader survey indicates high rates of missed bill payments, food insufficiency, and skipped medical care, especially among lower\u2011income and minority households. These financial pressures highlight that high income does not guarantee debt freedom, and many adults rely on credit, pay\u2011later plans, or reduced savings to cope.",
