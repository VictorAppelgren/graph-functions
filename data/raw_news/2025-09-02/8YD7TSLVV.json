  "description": "When the sky goes dark or your smartphone's siren starts blaring, preparation doesn\u2019t make storms pleasant, but it does keep the lights on.",
  "content": "As hurricane season ramps up along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts \u2014 from Florida and Louisiana to Texas and the Carolinas \u2014 forecasters warn the odds of an above-normal year are high. Wildfires are burning earlier and hotter out West, violent wind storms are snapping lines across the interior, and winter\u2019s ice and snow aren\u2019t far behind.\n\nFor millions of Americans, watching the weather forecast these days feels like an endless loop of desperate doomscrolling. Will the next refresh tell you to pack a bag and leave, hunker down, or brace for the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d storm that now seems to arrive every season?\n\nGenerators help when the sky goes sideways\n\nPortable backup generators are the talk of modern storm tech prep. Sure, flashlights and extra drinking water are important, but the true test of \u201cwe\u2019ll get through this\u201d versus \u201cthis is catastrophic\u201d can come down to keeping essential power running when the grid can\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to 64-year-old retired nurse Donna Niebauer when, over the course of one terrifying night, Hurricane Helene ravaged her peaceful mountain community of Burnsville, North Carolina and cut off power for more than two months.\n\n\u201cI felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. You know, when she's sitting on her bed and everything starts flying by her window? Propane tanks were spinning by, the water [from the nearby South Toe River] was rising. We heard crashing and banging and saw our neighbors\u2019 houses start breaking apart and floating by,\u201d Niebauer told me from her home in the Blue Ridge Mountains. \u201cWe stayed here without power. It was so cold that you could see your breath. We ate everything left in our freezer that we could cook on the grill outside. There was no communication. Nobody knew if we were dead or alive,\u201d she told me.\n\nStill, Niebauer says they are the lucky ones. They survived. More than 100 others in their community did not.\n\nTheir saving grace? An international relief organization called Samaritan's Purse used Black Hawk helicopters to fly in massive portable gas-powered generators.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we would have done without that. I really don\u2019t. You never imagine being so cut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Niebauer added.\n\n\u201cPeople think outages are temporary until they aren\u2019t,\u201d says Carol Friedland, director of LaHouse at LSU and a longtime building-science specialist who trains housing professionals on disaster resilience. \u201cBut this is the best-case scenario \u2014 that you don't have power and you\u2019re basically camping in your house,\u201d she warned.\n\nHow do I safely use a generator during a storm?\n\nI\u2019ve been tuning our home setup since we moved to the Pacific Northwest almost four years ago, after a windstorm knocked out power for two weeks. The longest we\u2019ve been off grid is three days, but with two of us working from home and elderly parents under our roof, we plan for longer.\n\nOur backbone is the Generac GP9500E Tri-Fuel portable (the main benefit is that it runs on gas, propane or natural gas, and retails for around $1,100\u2013$1,300). The last time power was out for three days during a windstorm, we started it up with the push of the electric start button and it ran for about 12-hours before we had to top it up. A tri-fuel option gives you the most flexibility, but we\u2019ve also used the Generac GP8000E ($980) as a mainstream workhorse as well. These all let you power on your essentials during an outage to stay comfortable and connected.\n\nWe also keep a suite of battery power stations and portable banks for immediate, quiet support: phones, laptops, routers, CPAPs and a small fridge. Batteries buy breathing room; fuel generators buy runtime and the startup watts needed for motors like sump and well pumps.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area contractor Sam Farnsworth, who has perfected backup power many clients as well as for himself due to wildfires, earthquakes, and rolling blackouts in his area put the trade-offs plainly: \u201cThe phones are going to work, the internet is going to be connected, the fridge is going to stay cold for a couple days\u2026,\u201d he said of portable generator setups. But he cautioned that battery-only systems have serious limits: \u201cWith solar, it doesn't power up as fast as you're drawing it. It'll sort of give you a little bit more time, but it's a losing battle that way.\u201d\n\nCarol Friedland agrees. Practically speaking, if your checklist is mostly phones and a CPAP, a mid-size electric battery station is civilized: quiet, indoor-safe and instantly useful. If you need to run a refrigerator, sump pump or multiple circuits for days, choose a fuel generator sized to your actual load and couple it with a transfer switch.\n\nBest practice? Friedland says to pair them: batteries for instant failover and sensitive gear, a generator for the marathon.\n\nBeyond generators, you really don\u2019t need a bunker full of gear. You need the right little tools, ready to go. Here\u2019s our own handy, tried and true checklist:\n\u2022 Pocket power: Tiny power banks like the newest Anker Nano or Nimble CHAMP Series 2 (both are 10,000 mAh) are my top go-tos. Both are smaller than a deck of cards, charge two devices at once, and Anker\u2019s latest includes built-in or retractable cables so you\u2019re not hunting for cords during an outage. I keep one in my go-bag and one in the car.\n\u2022 Hand-crank radio: The Midland ER310 gives NOAA alerts, acts as a flashlight and can crank-charge a phone when there\u2019s no grid or cellular signal. It\u2019s not glamorous; it\u2019s life insurance.\n\u2022 Pet safety: Did you hear about that dog rescued in the Texas flooding? A GPS tracker like the Tractive Collar sends real-time location updates straight to your phone. Another go-to for pets \u2014 FidoAlert and Flew The Coop joined forces to create a free, nationwide pet-preparedness program you can join in under two minutes (no credit card required). It provides Fido ID tags for every pet in the household, real-time SMS alerts if a pet is reported missing, a \u201cpet preparedness playbook\u201d with storm and evacuation tips, and emergency-contact sharing into a 1,000+ member lost-pet alert network.\n\u2022 For off-grid communication: Garmin inReach Mini 2 or ZOLEO lets you send texts and trigger SOS even with no bars.\n\u2022 Apps: set up FEMA for official alerts, Watch Duty for volunteer-verified wildfire updates, Zello for push-to-talk neighborhood communication, PulsePoint for CPR/AED alerts where supported, GOES Health for offline medical guides, and IQAir/AirVisual for air-quality monitoring during smoke events.\n\nWhat can I do right now to prepare for a disaster?\n\nPrep is mostly boring work that pays massive dividends when it matters the most. Here\u2019s a simple list that you can get done in a night or weekend:\n\u2022 Charge a phone and two power banks and stash one in the car.\n\u2022 Photograph and cloud-backup your insurance documents and IDs.\n\u2022 Label the circuits you want the generator to run.\n\u2022 Test your battery station and the generator once a year.\n\u2022 Keep a printed list of emergency numbers in a waterproof bag.\n\nFriedland also says now\u2019s the time to, \u201ccheck your insurance policies. Make sure your homeowners [insurance] is in force. Look at what your deductible is, because they use these percentage deductibles, and it's a percentage of the value of your home, not the percentage of the damage that you experience.\u201d She also says that if you have to rebuild, spend some of the recovery money on resilience upgrades like fortified roofing, so you\u2019re less likely to be in the same predicament when the next storm hits.\n\nWhen the sky goes dark or your smartphone's siren starts blaring, preparation doesn\u2019t make storms pleasant, but it does keep the lights on, the meds refrigerated and the people who depend on you safer. That\u2019s the work that matters.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links.

      "text": "Coinbase victims speak out as breach, brazen hackers and a culture of silence collide\nEach victim tells a nearly identical story of loss, heartbreak, and feeling ghosted by a company promising trust.\n- Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange in the United States.\n- On May 15, Coinbase filed a notice with the Maine attorney general, disclsoing 70,000 customers had been affected by a breach.\n- The breach could cost up to $400 million.\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve spoken with dozens of victims of a stunningly sophisticated account-draining scam \u2013 exploiting trust, technology, and a massive data breach at Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States.\nEach victim tells a nearly identical story of loss, heartbreak, and feeling ghosted by the company that promises to be \"the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and use crypto \u2026\"\nJust reading that statement on the company\u2019s homepage now makes many of them feel physically ill. And the added banner across the top of the homepage warning about social-engineering scams? Far too little, too late for a nearly $63 billion company that recently made the Fortune 500 list and could have \u2013 should have \u2013 sounded much louder alarms months ago.\nOther journalists have done significant work documenting the breach itself \u2013 how it happened, who orchestrated it, what Coinbase knew, and when.\nThis is not a story about the hackers. It\u2019s a story about the people who got hurt.\nPeople often stereotype crypto investors as reckless, young, or greedy. But the people I\u2019ve interviewed are teachers, engineers, business owners, and parents. They are smart, cautious, and aware of how online scams work. They followed the rules. They double-checked URLs. They asked the right questions. And still, they lost everything: down payments for homes, retirement funds, and the belief that anyone was looking out for them.\nMany of the people I spoke with asked that we not use their full names due to concerns about reputational harm or possible retargeting. They agreed to be identified by their initials.\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t anyone warn us?\u2019\nD.R. started learning about investing when he was 13 with the goal of building something big. By 32, he had more than $100,000 in his Coinbase account. It was supposed to be his generation\u2019s Apple stock.\nThen, in early May, came a flurry of warnings \u2013 emails from spoofed Coinbase.com addresses, suspicious activity alerts, and a barrage of phone calls. When he finally picked up, the man on the other end introduced himself as \u201cJacob Williams,\u201d a security employee at Coinbase. He sounded official. Still, D.R. said he cautiously \u201cgrilled him,\u201d and demanded extensive proof.\n\u201cWilliams\u201d sent a verification email that appeared to be from a Coinbase.com address to D.R.\u2019s Coinbase-linked Gmail account (that D.R. did not give the hacker over the phone). He sent an official-looking email that even fooled antiscam software.\nHe also instructed D.R. to check his Gmail Sent folder. Sure enough, there were emails there to help@coinbase.com that he did not write. D.R. thought this was the important \u201cproof\u201d that someone had hacked his Coinbase account and maybe even his Gmail account. (How the hackers gained access to D.R.\u2019s Gmail is still unclear.)\n\u201cI thought I was being very cautious,\u201d D.R. told me. \u201cI asked all the right questions. This guy knew every detail of my account, inside and out.\u201d\nThe caller instructed D.R. to use a \"whitelisted\" account to protect his funds. That\u2019s an account that D.R. set up with additional security features within his Coinbase Wallet app.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way anyone could have seen all of that unless they had internal access,\u201d D.R. said.\nThe hacker watched and commented on it all in real-time, even though D.R. claims he never handed over passwords, seed phrases, or any other information that could have given the hackers direct access.\n\u201cThey had my name, my driver\u2019s license, and the last four digits of my Social Security number. They even mimicked official Coinbase warnings. It was terrifying,\u201d D.R. added.\nWhen D.R. finally hung up and called Coinbase support to confirm that he had now locked down his account, a customer service agent told him that he had fallen for a scam and there was nothing they could do. They advised him to file a police report with his local authorities.\nSpend your money smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid for my family\u2019\nF.K., an experienced tech entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, shared a similarly devastating story.\n\u201cThey knew everything. My transaction history, my recent logins, even which tokens I\u2019d moved and when,\u201d he said over the phone. \u201cThe shame is unbearable. I know the industry, the history of scams, and had all the security measures in place.\u201d\nOne moment from the call still haunts him: \u201cHow do I tell my wife that we had hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen over the holidays?\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just tech. It\u2019s trauma.\nErin West, a former prosecutor and founder of Operation Shamrock, said the fears about reputational harm or retargeting are valid. She\u2019s now working with more than 60 victims, including 39 who responded within minutes of an initial outreach to her network late last month.\n\u201cPeople have been plunged into incredibly dark places,\u201d West said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost life savings, identity security, and trust in digital systems. The damage isn\u2019t just financial \u2013 it\u2019s emotional and deeply personal.\u201d\nOne of the highest-profile victims is 67-year-old Los Angeles artist Ed Suman, who told Bloomberg he lost more than $2 million in crypto after a fake Coinbase support call. The attackers convinced him that even his \u201ccold wallet\u201d was compromised.\n\u201cThe most effective thing Coinbase could have done was email customers and say, 'There are scammers impersonating us,'\u201d Suman said. \u201cInstead, they were woefully remiss.\u201d\nA Coinbase spokesperson told me they have warned customers, most notably in blog posts on the company website under the topic \u201cConsumer Protection Tuesday.\u201d There have been 20 of those articles posted since December 2024. He also pointed to warnings shared from its Coinbase Support account on X and YouTube accounts and said that anytime Coinbase learns of a breach, it files \u201cin accordance with all state and federal laws, and all are publicly available.\u201d\nIn addition, the spokesperson said that the company contacts anyone affected by the breach immediately.\nThe breach that broke the trust and set the stage for more sophisticated scams\nOn May 15, Coinbase filed a notice with the Maine Attorney General: nearly 70,000 customers had been affected by a breach. Using stolen data, such as government IDs, phone numbers, emails, and account histories, criminals launched targeted social engineering attacks.\nA class-action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York filed late last month shows a breach with vendor TaskUs in India and claims Coinbase executives knew about it as early as January.\nThat suit is one of at least 13 class actions now pending.\nOne investor alleges Coinbase delayed the breach disclosure to avoid a stock drop. Other litigation encompasses a wide range of issues, including biometric privacy violations, pig-butchering scams, and account lockouts.\nBloomberg Law confirmed that even high-profile industry figures, like Sequoia Capital\u2019s Roelof Botha, had their data compromised.\nCoinbase told us they cannot comment on any pending litigation.\nTaskUs later confirmed it had terminated at least two employees for illegal access and disclosed the activity to Coinbase.\nA TaskUs spokesperson said the company believes the employees were recruited as part of a larger criminal campaign.\n\u201cWe immediately reported this activity to the client (Coinbase), terminated the individuals involved, and are coordinating with law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution, TaskUs ceased all Coinbase operations in Indore, India, in early January 2025, impacting 226 teammates. Following the investigation, all teammates excluding the two bad actors, were offered a generous severance package, including six months of pay,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe place the highest priority on safeguarding the data of our clients and their customers and continue to strengthen our global security protocols and training programs, including by investing millions of additional dollars in physical and information security.\u201d\nWhat Coinbase knew \u2013 and when\nErin West is blunt: \u201cThis didn\u2019t start in May. I had victims calling me last August.\u201d She said Coinbase ignored numerous warning signs. \u201cInstead of alerting customers or locking down systems, they waited. They updated their terms of service \u2013 quietly \u2013 limiting customers\u2019 rights to participate in class-action lawsuits. And people, to this day, keep getting hit.\u201d\nF.K.\u2019s attack happened in late December. Ed Suman\u2019s came in March. D.R.\u2019s was in early May.\nWhen F.K. lost almost $400,000, he reported it immediately to Coinbase, the FBI, and local police. He followed up dozens of times. All he heard back was, \u201call transactions confirmed on the blockchain are final.\u201d\nThen, in late May, after he saw the news of the breach, he reached back out to Coinbase again. He said this time, a Coinbase customer service representative told him, \u201cmore than a million accounts have possibly been affected going back to November 1 of 2024.\u201d\nF.K. said the same support agent told him to \u201cbe patient, that it might take a while for the company to alert all of the people possibly involved.\u201d In the meantime, his crypto holdings would be worth nearly $625,000 today.\nWho decides who gets paid back?\nA Coinbase spokesperson wrote to me in an email that \u201call impacted customers have already received an email from no-reply@info.coinbase.com; all notifications went out at 7:20 a.m. ET on 5/15 to affected customers.\u201d\nWhen I asked for further clarification and explained that none of the victims I spoke with received emails from Coinbase on May 15, he offered to escalate their cases to the support teams. Then he added,\n\u201cBut important to note we will reimburse anyone who sent their funds to the attacker as a result of this incident. If a customer was not part of this incident and was socially engineered to send funds to a scammer, that would not fall into the refund.\u201d\nOn June 3, both D.R. and F.K. received notice that Coinbase will not reimburse them because their personal information \u201cwas not exposed in the recent incident.\u201d\nNeither victim understands how the scammers could have accessed their personal information without insider access. They followed security protocol. They didn\u2019t share private keys. But hackers still emptied their wallets.\n\u201cThe hackers sucked the funds out of my wallet without my consent to Roobet, a crypto gambling site in Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d F.K. explained. \u201cI did not initiate that. They did. Because I never shared my private key or seed phrase with them. They had backdoor access to my actual Coinbase Wallet.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s something I just learned: Every transaction you make on public blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum is completely transparent, and anyone can look it up. If someone gains access to your wallet address, they can see what you\u2019ve sent and received, when those transactions happened, and which platforms or smart contracts you\u2019ve interacted with. They can\u2019t always see exact dollar amounts or what you \u201cbought\u201d in the traditional sense \u2013 but they can trace your balance and behavior.\nIn crypto, your wallet address is like your phone number, bank routing number, and purchase history \u2013 all rolled into one. And if it\u2019s ever linked to your real identity, your entire transaction history becomes searchable.\nD.R. and F.K. still maintain the only way anyone could have gotten their wallet addresses is through a Coinbase breach, but most people investing in crypto right now have no idea how exposed they really are.\nAll of this comes at the same time the current administration is easing restrictions on cryptocurrency trading in the United States.\n\u201cThis is their chance to do the right thing in a very public way,\u201d D.R. said. \u201cIt\u2019s like crisis communications 101. I\u2019ve heard that they want people to sign NDA\u2019s and drop any future legal action in order to get reimbursed. I would do that in a heartbeat,\u201d he added. F.K. agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want, for Coinbase to do the right thing.\u201d\n\u2018Coinbase should have sounded the alarm immediately\u2019\n\u201cCoinbase should have sounded the alarm immediately,\u201d cybersecurity expert Richard Blech told me over the phone. He said other major crypto exchanges, like Binance and Kraken, faced the same kind of social-engineering attacks but blocked them before hackers could steal any customer data.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difference a real zero-trust system makes,\u201d Blech said. \u201cIn a setup like that, this kind of breach either doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 or it gets shut down fast.\u201d\nHe called Coinbase\u2019s failure a collapse of digital architecture. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a breach,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was a betrayal of trust. And in crypto, trust is the product. Lose that, and you lose everything.\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s asking the same questions now: Why didn\u2019t Coinbase send out a warning months ago? \u201cThe only emails I have from them are promotions,\u201d F.K. said.\nWhy didn\u2019t they take out full-page ads on popular investor channels during the bull run, send in-app alerts, email mass notifications urging customers to be cautious, or go one step further than posting their own warnings on social media and engage with influencers on platforms like YouTube, X, and TikTok to get the word out?\nCoinbase estimates the most recent breach will cost up to $400 million in reimbursements, legal costs, and security upgrades. But no one knows how they\u2019re deciding who to \u201cmake whole\u201d again.\nThe bigger problem: 'It\u2019s the Wild West all over again'\nCrypto scams aren\u2019t new. However, the scale and precision of this latest spate sets a new standard \u2013 and serves as a warning to everyone who banks online.\nThe breach didn\u2019t unlock Coinbase\u2019s crypto vaults. It didn\u2019t have to. With enough stolen data, scammers created the illusion of safety and authority.\nThey sounded American. They used Coinbase\u2019s scripts. They shared scam tactics over Discord and Telegram. They were organized and, at times, bragged about their exploits.\nAnd just as the breach became public, the Department of Justice shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team \u2013 the only federal group built to stop scams like this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West all over again,\u201d West said. \u201cAnd good people are paying the price.\u201d\nWhat you can do now\nVictims want answers. They want Coinbase to:\n- Make the reimbursement process transparent.\n- Follow through and do what they claim on their website to harden security and track stolen funds.\n- Be much more vocal and prolific with scam warnings.\n- Reverse the Terms of Service updates that limit consumer rights.\nAnd most of all, they want people in charge at Coinbase to realize they\u2019re just like them, not nameless, faceless \u201cusers.\"\nWhat you can do\n- Join a class action: Law firms like Milberg are pursuing cases.\n- File a complaint: With the SEC, FTC, or your state attorney general.\n- Talk to a tax professional: Some losses may qualify for deductions.\n- Contact Operation Shamrock: For advocacy and support.\nTo protect yourself\n- Use app-based or hardware 2FA.\n- Don\u2019t give your wallet address to anyone, ever. This is critical.\n- Never move funds based on a call or email.\n- Set withdrawal allowlists on exchange accounts.\n- Use a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor for long-term holdings\n- Don\u2019t download remote-access apps unless absolutely necessary\nAnd finally: demand accountability.\nThis story isn\u2019t over. But hopefully the people who refuse to slink away and remain silent will get a chance to rewrite it \u2013 for good.\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist and on-air contributor for \"The Today Show.\u201d The views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of USA TODAY.

      "text": "Farmers' Almanac winter forecast for 2025-2026: A long season of cold, snow across US\nThe upcoming 2025-2026 winter may not be as brutal as last year's season, which led to record-setting cold temperatures, the Farmers' Almanac says. But expect plenty of snow and wintery weather.\nAfter winter 2024-2025 brought record-breaking snowfall and dangerously cold temperatures to parts of the U.S., an \"old-fashioned winter,\" as forecast by the Farmers' Almanac may be welcome news for farmers \u2013 and the rest of us, too.\nThe 209th edition of the Farmers' Almanac, out now, forecasts \"Chill, Snow, Repeat\" weather patterns for the upcoming 2025-2026 winter season.\nThe cold and snow may not reach as far south as last year, but the Northern Plains to the New England are likely in for a cold, snowy winter, \"hopefully not as brutally cold as last,\" Farmers' Almanac Editor Sandi Duncan told USA TODAY.\n\"Most of the country is on tap for a cold or very cold winter, kind of almost going back to an old-fashioned winter,\" Duncan said. \"It's going to cool down, it's going to snow, then it might warm up a little, then it's going to repeat itself again.\"\nEven though the upcoming winter may not bring a repeat of last year's prolonged bone-chilling temperatures, the upcoming season's expected weather cycle means \"this winter\u2019s shaping up to be a wild ride,\" the Almanac predicts.\nWintery effects may begin in late fall as cold winter temperatures could \"sneak in a little bit early in many of the northern sections,\" Duncan said.\nWhile winter doesn't officially start until Dec. 21, \"we do see some very cold conditions, kind of blowing in with some possible snow in some areas,\" she said. \"I think the greatest chance of a White Christmas would be out in the northern Plains, perhaps, but not too many other places.\"\nWinter could linger, too. \"It looks like it's going to hang on for a little bit through March and even through April \u2026 especially in New England, Great Lakes and the northern Plains,\" Duncan said.\nDid the Farmers' Almanac get its winter weather prediction right last year?\nIn part, the Almanac proffers, mentioning in the new edition how its winter 2024-2025 forecast \"for a mild winter in Texas and the Southern Plains hit the mark, and we correctly called the cold weather over the Northern Plains and Great Lakes.\"\nThe Almanac also notes, \"We also accurately forewarned of a very cold spell at the end of January,\" perhaps referencing some of winter 2024-2025's milestones including the arctic air mass that contributed to cold weather advisories that month. \"But La Ni\u00f1a threw a curveball, leaving us with fewer wet weather events than expected,\" the Almanac said.\nFebruary also brought dangerously cold temperatures but overall, the contiguous U.S. had the third warmest winter on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with an average temperature of 34.1 degrees F, 1.9 degrees above average.\nThere's a chance a La Ni\u00f1a winter could be in store, according to the Climate Prediction Center. That could mean cold and snow for the Northwest, dry conditions in the South, and higher-than-average temperatures in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\nThe Farmers' Almanac creates its forecasts \"using a proprietary formula that adapts to the mysteries of nature and the ever-changing world in which we live,\" this edition notes. \"The basis of our prediction method was developed by our founding editor according to correlations between celestial events and various meteorological conditions.\"\nWhile scientists may question the accuracy of The Farmers' Almanac \u2013 and the competing The Old Farmer's Almanac \u2013 the guide, which includes planting tips and an astronomical calendar, remains an interesting read.\nHere's a closer look at its regional winter forecasts.\nNortheast, New York: 'Active time' for storms in late January\nWinter in the New England and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont) will include a \"cold snap\" around Jan. 8-15, especially in New England, but \"leaking down into some of the more northern Mid-Atlantic states,\" Duncan said.\nNew England, along with the Northern Plains, is expected to bear the brunt of the season\u2019s coldest temperatures, according to the Almanac.\nIn mid-January, the Almanac expects \"some pretty good snowstorms in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and southern New York \u2026 (and) then again in February, between the 8th and the 11th, we're calling for some very cold conditions, with some heavy snow in northern New England.\"\nMilder temperatures in early March will be followed by colder temperatures and cold, gusty winds in the middle of the month, the Almanac says.\nMidwest, Ohio, and Michigan: 'Big freeze' in January\nIn the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin), New Year's Day will bring chilly, breezy temperatures; northern Michigan and Wisconsin can expect snow.\nAs in the Northeast, the region will get cold temperatures \"perhaps blowing down from the north, especially in Indiana and northern Michigan,\" Duncan said. \"And we're calling for a pretty big snowstorm\" in the Great Lakes region from February 8-11. As the snow gives way to very cold temperatures there, snow moves into Kentucky and Ohio. The beginning of March brings snow to most of the region. The month ends with brisk, windy conditions, plus snow in the north.\nNorthwest: Rain and wet snow for Idaho, Oregon and Washington\nGood news for skiers in the Northwest region (Idaho, Oregon and Washington) because there's overall chilly and wet conditions expected this winter. \"the wet conditions obviously in the mountains are going to help that snow pack \u2026 (for) skiing,\" Duncan said.\nThe Pacific Northwest\u2019s mountains \"are gearing up for some impressive snowfall totals,\" the Almanac says.\nFor coastal Washington in the middle of February and March, \"we're calling for a lot of wet conditions, especially along the coast,\" with rainstorms, Duncan said.\nNorth Central states, Colorado: 'More like winter'\nThe North Central states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming), along with the Great Lakes region, \"are set for a classic winter wonderland,\" the Almanac says.That means the region can expect a \"very cold and snowy\" winter, Duncan said. Snowstorms are expected mid-February in Kansas and Nebraska and in mid-March in the Central Plains.\nEaster may even bring light snow to the Dakotas and Minnesota, while it will be chilly but clear in Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.\nSoutheast, Florida: 'Mild and wet' winter\nWinter is expected to bring average temperatures and wet conditions in the Southeast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia), according to the Almanac.\nThe second week of January will bring \"some very cold temperatures with some possible wintry precipitation, in the more northern areas, such as the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia,\" Duncan said.\nFebruary will also be \"a very wet period, especially from the 16th to the 20th, then turning mild at the end of February, but unsettled in many places,\" she said. \"So just very wet, I would say, is the focus.\"\nTexas, South Central: Another winter snowstorm predicted\nCold and wet conditions are expected this winter in the South Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and Texas, too. \"We don't see too much snow, but we're feeling like some of these more northern areas in this region may have icy rain and the cold conditions, so you might want to make sure you have deicer and your boots ready,\" Duncan said.\nNorthern Texas could get snow and freezing rain in mid-January and snow again in mid-February and mid-March, according to the Almanac. Mild weather will arrive as the month of March nears its end.\nCalifornia, Southwest: 'Fair, dry, very chilly' Christmas\nSouthwest states (Arizona, California, Nevada \\, and Utah) are forecast to have average temperatures and wet conditions \u2013 weather that could help prevent a repeat of the January wildfires in California, Duncan said.\nCalifornia is expected to get rain ahead of windy conditions at the end of January. \"Hopefully it will be enough moisture in the air in California that we don't see anything crazy like it was last year,\" Duncan said.\nOverall, the region should have a \"nice winter with not too many extremes,\" she said.\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Bringing Help and Hope After Helene\n\u201cI've never experienced God's love like that.\u201d\nHurricane Helene turned the Cane River, usually about 40 feet wide, into a raging, swollen behemoth that swallowed houses, cars, utility poles, and huge chunks of land on both sides of its gluttonous path as it charged downstream.\nBut when the storm swept through the hills and valleys of western North Carolina in late September, Victoria Hensley didn't think much of it\u2014at first. She grew a bit more concerned when Little Creek, the normally gentle stream that flows behind her property, flooded and some water trickled into her house. And, of course, she lost power\u2014typical for a heavy rainstorm in the outer reaches of Yancey County.\n\u201cI saw we were completely cut off. There was no way out or in.\u201d\nBut after the downpour stopped and she cleaned up the puddles from her floors, she and her husband, Justin, and their two young sons rode down the street to the Cane River that runs through their rugged, mountainous community. They couldn't believe their eyes.\n\u201cI saw we were completely cut off. There was no way out or in,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cThe roads on both sides of the river were gone. The bridge was demolished. We saw the roof of someone's house float by.\u201d\n\u201cThe water was up past the windows of the house.\u201d\nAnother Little Creek resident, Stacey Randolph, 64, watched it all unfold standing in the pouring rain high up on a hill behind the white, clapboard house his parents bought in 1952. The house, which hugged the riverbank, is where Stacey was born and where he has lived most of his life.\n\u201cThe water was up past the windows of the house, and it busted the foundation. The whole back of the house is lifted up,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything inside is ruined. It's deep in mud. I also lost a truck. The water just came and spun it around and off it went down the river.\u201d\nIt took three days before the floodwaters receded. Several men in the community then used their tractors, a dump truck, and a trackhoe to carve out a crude, single-lane muddy road along a narrow strip of earth adjacent to the river. It took them four days. It's the only access the community, which has many elder residents, now has if they need to leave for work or doctor visits or to get groceries.\nThe flood washed away the roads, all of the power poles and electric lines that fed into Little Creek, and the ground the poles were erected on. So, the area could be without electricity for up to six months. The infrastructure\u2014and the very ground\u2014must first be repaired and restored. Snow has already fallen, and the residents know that more will likely follow\u2014and may make their makeshift road impassable.\n\u201cThat's God's Hand on This Little Community\u201d\nVictoria, 39, is one of the youngest residents in Little Creek. She quickly realized that the biggest need for her community was for generators. For many of her retired neighbors, it could be a matter of life and death. Without the generators, there would be no heat, no power to run well pumps, and no lights.\nVictoria found out about Samaritan's Purse through one of her cousins, who had been manning a supply site we had set up at nearby Big Creek. The cousin reached out to her and put her in contact with us. She asked for 50 generators. We quickly responded and airlifted 52 because of the way they are packed four to a pallet. And that's exactly how many were needed! \u201cThat's God's hand on this little community,\u201d Victoria said.\nMore airlifts followed\u2014nine in all, including six deliveries by twin-rotor Army National Guard Chinooks\u2014that flew in propane and electric heaters, water, food, winter clothing and blankets, fuel, two ATVs, and more. Victoria, an eighth-grade science teacher, now oversees the stockpile seven days a week, which is kept in several large, weatherproof tents supplied by Samaritan's Purse. She hands out the supplies as they are needed. She expects to keep doing this until school starts back\u2014probably around the first of the year.\n\u201cIt's Been a Lifesaver\u201d\nThe residents say the generators and heaters have been a Godsend. \u201cThe generator and heater are a blessing, that's for sure, especially with really cold weather coming,\u201d Stacey said. After the storm, he moved into a friend's cabin that also is without power. But he's grateful. \u201cGod is at work. He's on the job.\u201d\nJack Stark, 72, is especially relieved to no longer be living in the dark. \u201cIf you don't have lights on in the house, it's like being in the doldrums,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can lead to depression.\u201d And Jack was particularly thankful that it was Samaritan's Purse that provided much of the relief for Little Creek as there's a full-circle connection with the organization's president, Franklin Graham. Stark said he gave his life to Jesus 30 years ago while watching Franklin's father, Billy Graham, preach on TV. \u201cBilly's how I came to know the Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know what made me turn on the TV that day, but I did, and I accepted Christ. Billy was the greatest evangelist there ever was.\u201d\n\u201cIt's a relief to know they're warm at night\u201d\nAfter the homemade road was completed, Nina King, 66, left and lived with her daughter for two weeks. When she heard that Samaritan's Purse had a generator for her, she returned home. \u201cIt's been a lifesaver,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm thankful I can now wash some clothes!\u201d She also got a heater. The generator and heater are a great comfort to her because two of her grandchildren live with her, and she works second shift at a commercial equipment supplier. \u201cIt's a relief to know they're warm at night while I'm working.\u201d\nSpearheading an Unprecedented Response\nBecause Helene's damage was so vast and catastrophic, Samaritan's Purse responded on an unprecedented scale across western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. We also brought relief along the Gulf Coast of Florida and southern Georgia.\nSince so many roads and bridges were washed out in areas along the Blue Ridge Mountains, we coordinated a fleet of 10 helicopters, including those Army National Guard Chinooks, three ex-Army Blackhawks, and several privately owned choppers, to fly supplies into 23 counties affected by the storm. We conducted 359 flights and made over 240 ground missions.\nWe've already given out over 500,000 liters of water; 24,666 boxes of food; 17,339 solar lights; 3,847 generators; 7,768 heaters; and thousands of warm clothes and blankets. We also set up emergency medical facilities, installed dozens of Starlink satellite devices to restore communication, and operated water filters in towns where municipal water systems were wiped out. Additionally, we plan to provide upwards of 500 mobile homes and build hundreds of houses for those who lost theirs to Helene. We likely will be working in western North Carolina for the next three years or more.\nPutting Boots on the Ground Quickly\nAs soon as Helene passed, we put boots on the ground. Our orange-shirted volunteers\u2014nearly 30,000 in just the first month\u2014cut downed trees, shoveled mud, tarped roofs, hauled off debris, and prayed with survivors.\n\u201cYou guys have done an amazing job taking care of our neighborhood. We can rebuild with God's grace.\u201d\nIn Asheville, Jerry Owensby and his wife, Kelly, barely escaped their bedroom before a tree crashed through its roof. Days later, they were relieved when dozens of Samaritan's Purse volunteers arrived to mud out their home and remove the tree. \u201cYou guys have done an amazing job taking care of our neighborhood,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe can rebuild with God's grace.\u201d\n\u201cThe love and the compassion, the care and the concern with everything they did was just amazing. I've never experienced God's love like that.\u201d\nAnother homeowner in Boone, Monnie Roten, broke down in tears when she saw volunteers arriving to clean out her home. \u201cWhen I saw those orange shirts come onto the property, I really hadn't cried until I saw them step off that truck,\u201d she said. \u201cThe love and the compassion, the care and the concern with everything they did was just amazing. I've never experienced God's love like that.\u201d\nOver in Creston, North Carolina, Joshua Jones also was thankful for the volunteers who helped clean up his property, but he was even more grateful when a member of our staff shared the Gospel with him. \u201cWe were talking about God and how He's an amazing person,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI learned that if you know Jesus is in your heart, God can be there for you at all times. It was really beautiful.\u201d Joshua then prayed to receive Christ as his Lord and Savior. He's one of over 300 people who have placed their faith in Jesus so far during our response to Helene.\nWe praise God for the tens of thousands of volunteers who have donned an orange shirt and worked as the hands and feet of Jesus after Hurricane Helene. They helped more than 5,000 individuals and families in western North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\nGod Is Working\n\u201cWe're just so thankful for Samaritan's Purse. They looked deep into a holler that nobody could get to and came in and met our needs in a mighty way. It's God at work. He's been so good.\u201d\nThrough all of the devastation and hardship, Victoria in Little Creek says she's seen God at work and has seen good come from it. \u201cFor one thing, I now know all of my neighbors and it's brought us all closer together,\u201d she said. \u201cGod orchestrated all of this. He has a plan for it. And we're just so thankful for Samaritan's Purse. They looked deep into a holler that nobody could get to and came in and met our needs in a mighty way. It's God at work. He's been so good.\u201d\nPlease continue to pray for those affected by Hurricane Helene and for our volunteers as they serve as the hands and feet of Jesus.\nSamaritan's Purse will rebuild hundreds of houses and replace hundreds of manufactured homes for families whose dwellings were left uninhabitable due to the storm.

      "text": "Rapid intensification? Hurricane forecasters say Erin's winds could skyrocket.\nTropical Storm Erin, now spinning far out in the central Atlantic Ocean, could undergo rapid intensification into a powerful 125-mph hurricane.\nTropical Storm Erin, now spinning far out in the central Atlantic Ocean, could undergo rapid intensification into a powerful 125-mph hurricane over the next few days, meteorologists said in an Aug. 14 advisory.\nThis phenomenon can cause a tropical storm to escalate into a hurricane or a hurricane to jump one or more categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale in less than a day.\nAn early Aug. 14 forecast from the National Hurricane Center said that Erin was forecast to undergo rapid intensification, but based on new data, a later forecast called for \"steady\" intensification over the next few days.\n\"Erin is moving into an environment with very warm water temperatures, and it's not going to exit that environment for at least 5 or 6 days,\" said Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza in his Substack The Eyewall. \"Erin should begin to tap into this environment over the next couple days, and it's possible that we see a burst of rapid intensification at some point.\"\nRegardless, the environment ahead looks ripe for Erin to become a powerful major (Category 3 or stronger) hurricane this weekend, and the storm is forecast to be nearing Category 4 strength as it turns into the western Atlantic early next week, noted WPLG hurricane specialist Michael Lowry in an Aug. 14 Substack post.\nThough not currently thought to be direct threat to land, Erin's waves are forecast to batter the East Coast with high surf and the threat of dangerous rip currents for beachgoers.\nWhat is rapid intensification? Why is it dangerous?\nRapid intensification is a process in which a storm undergoes accelerated growth: The phenomenon is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\nAs of the 11 a.m. ET advisory from the hurricane center, a rise of 30 mph in 24 hours is expected.\nWhatever happens with Erin, rapidly intensifying tropical storms and hurricanes are especially dangerous because they can give the public less time to prepare and often catch people off guard, AccuWeather said. \"Predicting a storm's peak intensity and its intensity at landfall is one of the most difficult aspects of weather forecasting, and a rapidly intensifying hurricane adds tremendously to that challenge,\" according to AccuWeather.\nWhat causes rapid intensification?\n\"Rapid intensification occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. \"Typically, this environment consists of very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\"\nSuch sudden spikes have been the hallmark of history\u2019s most fearsome hurricanes, Ken Graham, former director of the hurricane center and now director of the National Weather Service, told USA TODAY in 2022. Out of the nine hurricanes with winds of 150 mph or greater that struck the U.S. mainland over 103 years, all but one saw the explosion of force and power known as rapid intensification.\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson scale?\nHurricanes are measured by wind speed, with the higher categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale corresponding to more intense storms. Here's the full scale:\nCategory / Sustained Winds:\n- 1: 74-95 mph\n- 2: 96-110 mph\n- 3: 111-129 mph\n- 4: 130-156 mph\n- 5: 157 mph or higher"

      "text": "Western US braces for fiery Fourth\nAs the Wolf Fire roars in Southern California, much of the rest of the U.S. is bracing for one of the most wildfire-prone times of the year.\nAs the Wolf Fire continues to char hundreds of acres in southern California, forcing evacuations, much of the rest of the United States is bracing for one of the most wildfire-prone times of the year.\nWhy is this?\n\"There is a huge spike in the number of human-caused wildfires in the United States around the 4th of July holiday, related to the improper use of fireworks,\" AEM senior meteorologist James Aman told USA TODAY in an e-mail.\nHe said the highest concentration of wildfires caused by fireworks occurs in the western half of the United States, mainly in national parks, national forests and certain other rural areas. \"Other smaller clusters of wildfires caused by fireworks are seen around some large U.S. cities, and in national parks and forests in the eastern U.S.\"\nWeather isn't helping\nThe weather isn't helping matters.\n\"Heat will build over the Intermountain West and the Southwest the next couple of days,\" the National Weather Service said in an online forecast on June 30. \"Lightning from dry thunderstorms can create new fire starts and combined with gusty winds may cause a fire to rapidly grow in Oregon and northern California.\"\nThe weather service in northern California also said that \"given the long stretch of dry and hot\u2026 conditions, lightning efficiency will be high to very high for fire starts. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly.\"\nA red flag warning has been issued for much of northern California and north-central Nevada: \"A red flag warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. A combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and warm temperatures can contribute to extreme fire behavior.\"\nLatest wildfire numbers\nAccording to the National Interagency Fire Center, as of June 30, there were 26 large uncontained fires being suppressed across the country, with nearly 6,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel assigned. Several crews are also on assignment to battle critical fires in Canada.\n\"Several geographic areas in the U.S. are seeing hot, dry conditions and dry fuels, increasing the potential for new ignitions and large fire growth,\" the fire center said in an online report.\nIn addition to those 26 fires, another 48 fires are also being managed, mostly in Alaska. Nationwide, the number of wildfires this year \u2013 33,552 \u2013 is running nearly 8,000 ahead of the 10-year average year-to-date of 25,648.\nThe amount of acres burned so far is very close to the 10-year average.\nMost of the fires \u2012 67 - are burning in Alaska. In the continental United States, New Mexico and Arizona are both battling three large fires, and one large fire is burning in Utah.\nWildfire worries ongoing\nThe severe drought conditions will intensify wildfire risks in the West, a recent report from environmental risk firm AEM said.\nAreas such as California, the Great Basin and the northern Rockies are projected to face \"above-normal fire potential throughout the summer months, further straining firefighting resources and endangering communities,\" AEM said.\n\u201cThis summer will bring a dangerous combination of heat, dryness, and fuel buildup that elevates wildfire risks across North America,\u201d said Aman, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing an above-average number of wildfires in the U.S., with similar trends north of the border.\u201d"

      "text": "Best tech products to have in case of wildfires and other disasters\nLanding at Los Angeles International Airport still feels surreal even a week after firestorms torched 12,000 homes, businesses and structures, and killed at least 24 people in Los Angeles.\nThere\u2019s still a faint smoky smell, and our eyes burn as we walk from the airport to our rental car.\nThe hotel near Universal Studios that we booked last minute is filled with evacuees and their pets. People everywhere are incredibly kind to us \u2014 from the man checking us into the hotel, to the security guard at the TV studio where I\u2019m about to go on air and talk about tech tools to help deal with disasters. They take a moment to look us in the eyes with an unspoken, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d We smile and thank them, hoping to communicate the same back. The atmosphere feels so fragile.\nEveryone here is affected\nToday infernos whipped by a perfect storm of high winds and drought conditions hit the Western edges of the United States especially hard. But tomorrow\u2019s catastrophe could be any number of other extreme disasters across the map. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of dire calamities, here are a few key apps and gadgets making a big difference in times of crisis.\nThis is hands-down the number one wildfire-warning app to add to your smartphone right now, especially if you live in one of the 22 states it currently covers.\nThey use an automated system that monitors 911 dispatch and other emergency calls and flags related to fires. The minute a call comes in, the system sends messages to a team of active and retired firefighters, first responders and reporters \u2014 people from all around the world monitoring public sources, scanners, cameras, satellites and more \u2014 to gather and vet as much information as possible. Everything gets cross-checked, uploaded and updated in real-time as the situations evolve.\nThe app forwards alerts about evacuations, where to find shelter, wind direction, weather forecasts and tracks air quality. It\u2019s free to use because it's run by a nonprofit, but an optional $25/year subscription helps the team keep it up and running.\nThe official FEMA app is a handy resource everyone should download and update as part of \u201cadulting.\u201d Emergency preparedness is more crucial than ever, and waiting until disaster strikes to have a plan is always too late.\nThe app is an excellent resource for preparing what to pack in your emergency go-bag, ways to mitigate potential damage, learn how evacuations work, and figure out items to include in a pet emergency kit, too. It\u2019s constantly updated with new information for people affected by any disaster, from severe storms to earthquakes and beyond.\nWith built-in notifications, the FEMA app tells you if you\u2019re in a watch or warning zone so you can plan accordingly. It also points to relief and recovery centers if you\u2019re impacted or need to evacuate. FEMA is a government agency, so the app is entirely free. It\u2019s one of those apps everyone should have, even if they don\u2019t think they need it.\nThis app was initially designed for off-grid travelers and the growing number of people caught in climate disasters who may need a first-aid encyclopedia without an active internet or cellular connection. But the company\u2019s technology chief lives close to the Sunset Fire in LA, and he discovered that air-quality information from GOES was more accurate than any other resource he could find.\nWith built-in location-specific guidance, the app caters to current conditions, whether they involve extreme temperatures, the risk of dangerous wildlife, poor air quality, or even UV exposure. Its offline library of medical information comes in handy when cell service is miles away. The app addresses over 60 medical topics with hundreds of pieces of advice, information and recommendations.\nIt\u2019s free to try, and the premium subscription is $36 per year after that.\nTreating physical injuries or ailments is often critical, but when the dust settles, our mental health can take the brunt of the damage. It\u2019s essential to treat our minds with the same care as we treat our bodies, and the Feeling Great app\u2019s AI-powered chatbot is packed with tools to help make sense of even the most complex and distressing situations.\nThe app is based on decades of work by Dr. David Burns, a Stanford professor and best-selling author who popularized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) \u2014 now considered by many to be the gold standard of mental health treatment \u2014 in his clinical practice. The app\u2019s AI uses over 100 techniques to address negative feelings, providing guidance along the way to challenge negative thoughts and assess changes.\nIt\u2019s free to try, with an annual subscription priced at $99.\nScammers are out in full force\nCountless donations and charity efforts are collecting funds to help people impacted by disasters, with the California wildfires being the latest large-scale example.\nUnfortunately, these well-meaning programs can bring out the worst in people. The scammers are out in full force online and in person, pretending to raise money for good causes or even posing as FEMA inspectors. Here are some quick tips to help steer clear of crooks and thieves:\n- Don\u2019t respond to unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls, especially if they seem urgent and require action immediately. That sense of urgency is a common way to dupe people while emotions run high.\n- GoFundMe created a centralized online hub with all verified fundraising pages related to the Los Angeles-area wildfires.\n- Verify the website is securely encrypted \u2014 look for a gray lock icon.\n- Never respond to requests for gift cards or personal information.\n- For fire victims: Beware of people soliciting you \u2014 and telling you they can file your FEMA report and get you paid faster.\n- Legitimate FEMA inspectors always wear an official government badge to identify themselves. You may ask the person to show their identification. FEMA inspectors will never:\n- Ask for money or banking information.\n- Ask for your nine-digit registration number \u2014 which is included in their records.\n- Charge for an inspection process is free.\nGadgets to the rescue\nOnce you get into emergency preparation, it can be easy to go overboard, but you don\u2019t have to go full \u201cdoomsday prepper\u201d to give yourself and your loved ones a leg up if something terrible happens. I keep a few gadgets with the just-in-case mindset that don\u2019t break my bank account but give me some added peace of mind.\nBackup battery power\nEcoflow and Jackery have earned their golden reputations in the backup power space through many years and countless product launches. Both are solid picks for keeping everything from your refrigerator to your laptops and smartphones powered in an emergency.\nMy current go-to is the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2, an updated version of one of the company\u2019s most popular backup battery systems.\nThis thing is small but mighty, with a 1500W output and over 1000Wh capacity. It can recharge your gadgets dozens of times over, so you\u2019re never without a fully charged phone, tablet or laptop. It\u2019s built for emergency use and is super rugged. It can charge from 0% to 100% in as little as one hour, making it the ideal backup when your life turns upside down.\nAt $799, it\u2019s an easy win and takes up very little space. I also added solar panels to mine, which are incredibly helpful when the power goes out, and you\u2019re not sure when it might come back on.\nPortable device chargers\nI always carry. It can charge two devices simultaneously, such as my phone and laptop, and holds an impressive 10,000mAh of juice, enough to top up my iPhone or Android smartphone multiple times.\nIt\u2019s also made of 90% recycled plastic and is carbon neutral, so I feel good about using it. Oh, and it\u2019s TSA-approved, so you won\u2019t have any issues getting it through security checkpoints. For $60, you really can\u2019t go wrong.\nAir purifiers\nI have kept Coway\u2019s Airmega Mighty on hand as my air-purifying guardian angel ever since I took a deep dive into the world of cleaner-air gadgets back in 2020. At the time, I lived in an area of Oakland, California with some of the worst ongoing air quality in America. Wildfire smoke turned our skies an otherworldly orange and forced us all indoors for weeks at a time.\nIt has a four-stage filter structure and can pump through nearly 1,800 square feet of indoor air in just one hour. Indoor pollution is no joke, and if you\u2019re downwind from wildfires or any other air quality nightmare, you, your family, and your pets will all breathe easier with a powerful air filtration system on hand.\nSurprisingly affordable at $163 for the unit and just $60 for a filter set, it\u2019s a great pick for dealing with all kinds of air issues from fires to allergy season.\nWhen it comes to air quality, remember, you want HEPA for filtering and carbon for cleaning.\n(This story has been updated to correct a typo in a photo caption.)\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist and on-air contributor for \"The Today Show.\u201d The views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of USA TODAY.
