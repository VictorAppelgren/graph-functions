  "content": "With tariffs in effect and a weak jobs report, Wall Street is preparing for potential market volatility.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 ended on Friday up more than 8 percent on the year and on the cusp of all-time high levels, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was at a record, as stocks rebounded from declines following a weak employment report earlier this month. Strategists at firms including Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have recently said the market could be poised for some level of pullback after a largely unabated climb over the past four months, which has pushed valuations to historically expensive levels as a seasonally treacherous period for stocks begins. The monthly U.S. consumer price index report, due on Tuesday, could cause volatility. Data showing higher-than-expected inflation could undermine the growing expectation for impending interest rate cuts.\n\n\u201cI do think the market is set up for a bit of a pullback,\u201d said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Wealth. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern bubbling underneath.\u201d The S&P 500 has surged 28 percent since its low for the year in April, as investor fears about a tariff-induced recession calmed after President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement earlier that month had set off extreme asset volatility. The index is trading at over 22 times its earnings estimates for the next year, well above its long-term average P/E ratio of 15.8 after recently reaching its highest valuation in over four years, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nInvestors are also wary of risks posed by the calendar. Over the past 35 years, August and September have ranked as the worst-performing months for the S&P 500, according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. The index has declined an average of 0.6 percent in August and 0.8 percent in September \u2014 the only months of negative average performance for the index during that time period. \u201cThe combination of a softer payroll number with concerns of tariff-related inflation could be the recipe for \u2026 a correction, especially in the seasonally weak third quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said in a note this week. Still, Wilson said his 12-month outlook was bullish, adding \u201cwe\u2019re buyers of pullbacks.\u201d The CPI for July is expected to have climbed 2.8 percent on an annual basis, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Investors will be watching to see if Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports are translating into higher prices after the June CPI report suggested levies were impacting the prices of some goods.\n\nMarket bets on Fed rate cuts rose following the recent weak jobs data as investors expect the central bank will ease monetary policy to help shore up the labor market. Fed funds futures indicate an over 90 percent chance the Fed will cut at its next meeting in September, with at least two cuts priced in for this year, LSEG data showed. That narrative could be at risk if CPI rises more than expected, making the Fed more hesitant to cut rates, investors said. \u201cIf the CPI suggests that the market got a little ahead of itself, that can create volatility,\u201d said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. \u201cBut if it\u2019s not worse than feared \u2026 that can further reinforce that we are now in an inflection point for the Fed.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of higher tariffs and the economic fallout from those levies already instituted by the Trump administration has been a persistent theme clouding markets, but stocks have managed to rise to records despite the uncertainty. Higher tariffs on imports from dozens of countries took effect on Thursday, raising the average U.S. import duty to its highest in a century, while the president also this week announced plans for levies on semiconductor chips and pharmaceutical imports. China could face a potential tariff increase on Tuesday unless Trump approves an extension of a prior truce.",

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have surged to record highs, but elevated valuations and historically weak August/September performance suggest a pullback could be imminent.
