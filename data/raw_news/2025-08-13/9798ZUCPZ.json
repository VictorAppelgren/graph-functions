  "description": "Stocks hit a record high after cooler-than-expected inflation data.",
  "content": "Wall Street got just the inflation report it was looking for on Tuesday, and investors wasted no time in celebrating. July CPI showed headline inflation rising 2.7 percent year-over-year, below economists\u2019 2.8 percent forecast and matching June\u2019s pace. The core reading, which strips out food and energy, rose 3.1 percent from a year ago, above forecasts for 3.0 percent and marking the highest level since February. The numbers offered the latest counterpoint to predictions that President Trump\u2019s tariffs would trigger a broad inflation spike.\n\n\u201cTariffs have had limited effects on inflation so far,\u201d said Comerica\u2019s chief economist Bill Adams. \u201cBut since tariff rates are up one day, down the next, then up even more the day after, it is too early to say how large their effect on prices will ultimately be.\u201d Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, added that there\u2019s \u201clittle evidence\u201d tariffs are causing a meaningful rise in inflation at this point, noting that shelter and energy services like electricity and piped gas remain primary drivers. In any case, markets seemingly read the data as the final green light for Fed easing. September rate-cut odds jumped to 94.4 percent from 85 percent a day earlier.\n\nOne month prior, those odds hovered at 57 percent, according to CME data. Notably, JPMorgan Wealth Management strategist Elyse Ausenbaugh cautioned that it\u2019s still possible the Fed doesn\u2019t budge next month. \u201cI don\u2019t think a cut at that meeting is as much of a given as market pricing is implying,\u201d said Ausenbaugh.\n\nThe print was nonetheless enough to fuel the S&P 500 above 6,400 for the first time to a fresh record high. Large-cap stocks rallied and small-cap names\u2014 which benefit most from lower interest rates \u2014 also climbed. Economists, for their part, have spent much of 2025 on the wrong side of the macro outlook, warning tariffs would unleash a wave of inflation. While certain categories \u2014 like footwear \u2014 show some pass-through effects, broad price pressures remain contained. Goods inflation has firmed up, yet falling energy costs and moderate services inflation have offset material gains. Meanwhile, market-implied inflation expectations have also moderated from the start of the year.",

In our Monday newsletter, I made the case that the Fed is late on rate cuts. For today\u2019s edition, we\u2019re unpacking why the central bank may skip rate cuts entirely until next year.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nWhat if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut at all?\nBond traders, prediction markets, and traditional data all point to rate cuts starting as soon as September, yet two of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks aren\u2019t buying it.\nStrategists at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley told clients they do not expect a single rate cut until at least 2026, even after Friday\u2019s dismal jobs data, which showed the US added just 73,000 jobs in July, far weaker than expected.\nWhile Opening Bell Daily remains in the camp that the central bank should have started lowering interest rates months ago, the no-cut argument should still be taken seriously.\nInterest rates still hover at multi-decade highs (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nBank of America\u2019s view hinges on a key distinction \u2014 markets are mistaking stagflation for a recession.\n\u201cLabor supply has cratered due to immigration restrictions,\u201d BofA economists wrote. \u201cSo while demand has also weakened, labor slack hasn\u2019t increased.\u201d\nThey point to stable unemployment and steady wage growth as evidence that the slowdown stems more from constrained supply than collapsing demand.\n\u201cThe downward revisions to job growth in May and June were undeniably concerning,\u201d BofA economists added.\n\u201cBut the silver lining is that more than half of the revisions were due to seasonal factors and public payrolls.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley agrees that the labor market has softened, though its team argues that inflation remains too sticky to justify rate cuts.\n\u201cTariff-related inflation could limit the Fed\u2019s dovish reaction function,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley strategists.\nFed Chair Powell has similarly pointed out that inflationary pressures from President Trump\u2019s trade policy still haven\u2019t fully filtered through to consumer prices.\n\u201cOur house view continues to be that the Fed won\u2019t cut this year, but will end up cutting more than expected next year,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists said.\nInflation has come in cooler-than-expected every month this year (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nIncidentally, both banks are now at odds with futures markets, which assign a roughly 90% probability for a 25-basis-point rate cut in September.\nThey also contrast with Goldman Sachs, which reiterated its view Monday that the US economy is near \u201cstall speed\u201d and so the Fed will deliver three rate cuts in a row starting next month.\nGoldman\u2019s economists estimate that underlying job growth has cratered to less than 50,000 payrolls a month \u2014 a level that has historically triggered rate cuts.\nPayroll growth has slowed over recent months (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nUltimately, the debate comes back to Powell\u2019s own words: \u201cIt\u2019s the unemployment rate.\u201d\nTo policymakers, that figure takes precedent over payroll growth or economic activity.\nAnd while hiring and job growth have lost momentum, the jobless rate remains historically low at 4.2%.\nThe unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2% last month (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nFor Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, that\u2019s not enough to justify rate cuts, regardless of markets betting on looser monetary policy.\nFrom the banks\u2019 perspective \u2014 though Opening Bell Daily disagrees \u2014 the Fed still risks moving too early rather than too late.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, BitcoinIRA\nWhy smart investors use BitcoinIRA:\nTax Savings: When you trade in an IRA, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes that can be as high as 37%\nTop-Level Security: Assets are custodied with a US based custodian and insured up to $250M\u00b2\nWorld Class Customer Service: BitcoinIRA has a team of IRA specialists that will help guide you through every step of the process\nP.S.

President Trump gave a wide-ranging interview Tuesday morning, though his comments on the healthcare and pharma industry caught my attention. He plans to impose hefty levies on the space, which could very well drag down a sector that\u2019s already dragging its feet.\nBig pharma, big tariffs\nPresident Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat has targeted a sector that\u2019s already hobbled.\nOn Tuesday, Trump told CNBC he plans to impose levies of up to 250% on imported pharmaceuticals, a jump from the 200% figure he floated in July.\nWhile no action has rolled out yet, pharma stocks dipped on the news, adding pressure to what\u2019s already been a historically bad stretch for healthcare investors.\nNovo Nordisk has dropped 46% in 2025, while Pfizer and Eli Lilly are lagging the S&P 500.\nGilead is the only major drugmaker ahead of the benchmark year-to-date, while the rest of the sector has stalled.\nThe current setup resembles a \u201csequel to the purge movies,\u201d said Todd Sohn, technical strategist at Strategas Securities.\nNearly $26 billion has exited healthcare ETFs since early 2023, making it one of the few sectors facing sustained outflows in a rising market.\nSource: Strategas Securities\nTrump\u2019s latest threat injects new uncertainty.\nThe proposed tariffs follow his push to revive the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status for the US and his campaign to pressure drugmakers to slash prices.\nAll that leaves pharma stocks in a perfect storm of declining sentiment, policy pressure, and now a potential trade war.\nBut the risks go beyond Washington. High interest rates have weighed on pharmaceuticals\u2019 business model all year.\nThe industry relies on multi-year R&D timelines and capital-intensive manufacturing, making it particularly vulnerable to higher financing costs.\nWith Jerome Powell and the Fed hesitant to cut rates, that\u2019s eroded margins and investment appetite for Big Pharma.\nInterest rates hover near two-decade highs (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nMeanwhile, structural shifts in the market have also undermined the health sector.\nData from Strategas shows passive flows have rotated into cash, crypto, and cyclical ETFs and out of defensives such as healthcare.\nConcentration risk exacerbates the issue.\nThe 10 largest S&P 500 stocks now make up roughly 40% of the index, leaving little room for the beaten-down corner of the market to gain traction.\nThe Morningstar Healthcare Index is down about 3.4% year-to-date, while its drug manufacturing index is roughly flat on the year.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, Ondo Finance:\nOndo Finance is driving one of the most significant upgrades to global finance through real-world asset tokenization.\nTokenization is poised to reshape $16 trillion in assets by 2030, and Ondo Finance is at the forefront, partnering with the world\u2019s largest institutions, setting industry standards, and pioneering a financial system that\u2019s faster, fairer and more accessible to all.\nElsewhere\n\ud83c\udfe6Scott Bessent won\u2019t be the Fed Chair. President Trump said he has ruled out the Treasury Secretary from the running, and that Bessent told him he doesn\u2019t want that job: \u201cI love Scott, but he wants to say where he is.\u201d (Politico)\n\ud83d\udcc9 Markets are punishing negative earnings surprises more than usual. Companies that reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results have seen an average stock drop of 5.6% the two days before through two days after the release. That\u2019s larger than the typical -2.4% move. (FactSet)\n\ud83d\udea2 The US trade gap has narrowed to a 2-year low. President Trump\u2019s tariffs caused a sharp drop in consumer goods imports in June, and activity has slowed in the services sector. Meanwhile, tariffs have shrank the trade gap with China to its lowest in 21 years.

Today\u2019s the first full day in President Trump\u2019s latest iteration of a trade war, but the response from Wall Street has been lukewarm. Today we\u2019re unpacking why.\nLooking beyond Liberation Day\nPresident Trump\u2019s new tariff regime is officially underway but markets have barely flinched.\nOn Thursday, sweeping new levies took effect to lift the US\u2019 effective tariff rate to the highest in a century at around 20%. Just a few months ago, similar news catalyzed a historic sell-off.\nYet now the trade war barely stirs any additional trading volatility.\n\u201cIT\u2019S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nEstimates range between 16-21% for the current effective tariff rate (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nThe VIX \u2014 Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge \u2014 remains well below its long-run average, and the S&P 500 saw a tiny dip Thursday but remains positive for the week.\n\u201cThe idea that the market rally was predicated on the TACO [\u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d] trade is at best outdated, meaning we\u2019ve moved on to other driving factors,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\u201cOr [it] was never the motivator that many had thought.\u201d\nTrading volatility remains muted (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nTo that point, investors who bailed during the April Liberation Day sell-off have missed a sharp rebound.\nThat strength has persisted in the months since Trump\u2019s initial tariff announcement, and it\u2019s evolved into a kind of trade war complacency on the part of investors.\nOnce seen as the definitive macro risk, tariffs have been downgraded to background noise or political theater, depending who you ask.\nOne trading day accounted for most of the S&P 500\u2019s gains after Liberation Day (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nNow, it\u2019s not that tariffs won\u2019t have economic consequences. Indeed, they\u2019re the main reason the Fed hasn\u2019t cut interest rates this year, according to Jerome Powell.\nIn his view \u2014 which Opening Bell Daily disagrees with \u2014 higher import costs risk nudging inflation higher, particularly if some countries retaliate more than expected.\nThat said, markets continue to bet that corporate earnings and AI momentum will carry stocks higher anyway.\n\u201cOur base case remains that the US effective tariff rate will settle at around 15%,\u201d said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, Global Head of Equities for UBS Wealth.\n\u201dEnough to weigh on growth and lift inflation, but not enough to derail the US economy or the equity rally.\u201d\nMarket snapshot\nElsewhere\n\ud83c\udfe6The president will nominate his top economic advisor to the Fed. Stephan Miran is the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Trump said he\u2019s tapping him to fill a vacancy on the central bank\u2019s board of governors on a short-term basis. (WSJ)\n\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3Trump called for Intel\u2019s CEO to step down. He said the exec is highly \u201cCONFLICTED\u201d and \u201cmust resign, immediately.\u201d The demand appeared to stem from a senator\u2019s letter sent to Intel\u2019s board raising questions about the CEO\u2019s links to Chinese firms, and national security issues.

It\u2019s CPI day, and this morning will deliver a key input for the Federal Reserve\u2019s September rate cut decision. We\u2019re unpacking what to know below \u2014 plus the latest on tariffs, chip stocks, and more.\nBuying into inflation risk\nThe July inflation report could give the Fed another reason to keep delaying rate cuts, but investors don\u2019t seem to care.\nWall Street has shrugged off a conflicting macro backdrop for months. While central bankers have cautioned that sticky, tariff-driven inflation could still postpone rate cuts, investors are nonetheless positioning for smooth economic sailing and higher asset prices.\nEconomists see headline and core CPI rising to 2.8% and 3.0% year-over-year, respectively, each up about a tenth of a point from June.\nThat would mark the second straight monthly acceleration in core prices, driven largely by tariff pass-through in goods across autos, apparel and AI-linked products, according to Morgan Stanley.\nHeadline and Core CPI expected to rise to 2.8% and 3.0% for July, respectively (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\n\u201cOur base case remains that most of the tariff-related price effects will materialize over the summer,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief global economist Seth Carpenter in a Sunday note, adding that risks are \u201ctilted towards a more gradual and persistent upswing in monthly prints through year-end.\u201d\nMarkets are overwhelmingly betting on a rate cut in September, with CME data showing 86.5% odds for a quarter-point move lower.\nTraders on the prediction platform Kalshi similarly see 76% probability for a cut.\nSource: Kalshi\nYet a hotter-than-expected inflation report would challenge that consensus, according to Morgan Stanley, particularly if the three-month annualized rate of core CPI materially rises.\nJay Woods, chief global strategist for Freedom Capital Markets, noted that a hot print \u201ccould also cause recessionary and stagflation talk to grow louder.\u201d\nThat outlook doesn\u2019t exactly align with investors\u2019 risk-on positioning.\nBank of America\u2019s August Global Fund Manager Survey showed cash allocations hover at 3.9% \u2014 near historic lows \u2014 while equity allocations are near their highest since February.\n7 in 10 investors expect a soft-landing\nJust 5% are positioned for a recession\n91% of respondents say US equities are overvalued, but investors keep buying stocks anyway\nIf the latest CPI print lands in line or cooler than forecasts, it could catalyze the next leg higher in risk assets.\nThe S&P 500 is having a better-than-typical year so far (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nThat said, even a hot inflation report isn\u2019t guaranteed to derail the bull run.\nThe prevailing soft-landing narrative has remained remarkably durable all year, and it\u2019s likely to stay intact with cash levels historically low and stocks trading at record highs.\nFed rates are at two-decade highs (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nIt would likely take a loud and unambiguous shift in the data \u2014 one that leaves the Fed no choice but to delay rate cuts \u2014 to break that momentum.\n\u201cWhile markets are treating a September cut as a near certainty, we think there is still a lot to play for,\u201d Carpenter said.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, BitcoinIRA\nWhy smart investors use BitcoinIRA:\nTax Savings: When you trade in an IRA, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes that can be as high as 37%\nTop-Level Security: Assets are custodied with a US based custodian and insured up to $250M\u00b2\nWorld Class Customer Service: BitcoinIRA has a team of IRA specialists that will help guide you through every step of the process\nP.S.

Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, had itself a weekend, jumping about 8% Saturday night while Wall Street was sleeping.\nCrypto bulls expect that rally to persist through the end of year as alternative assets enter retirement accounts, institutions and ETFs keep adding digital assets, and retail maintains its enthusiasm.\nAnd that momentum has made itself plenty obvious in the stock market, too.\nBREAKING: Nvidia and AMD will reportedly pay 15% of its chip sale revenues in China to the US government, according to the Financial Times, as part of an unusual arrangement with the White House.

  "argos_summary": "Wall Street reacted positively to the July CPI report, which showed headline inflation at 2.7% year-over-year, slightly below expectations, while core inflation rose to 3.1%, exceeding forecasts. Despite concerns about tariffs impacting inflation, economists noted limited effects so far, contributing to a surge in market optimism and a record high for the S&P 500. However, some strategists caution that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates as soon as anticipated, with major banks like Bank of America and Morgan Stanley predicting no cuts until at least 2026.",
