  "title": "Layoffs Don\u2019t Just Impact People, But Also Profits",
  "description": "Layoffs aren't just bad for team morale, but also for the bottom line. Companies that view employees as partners always reap the rewards.",
  "content": "Nearly every company will claim that their greatest asset is their people. However, when it\u2019s time to streamline operations, pivot strategy, or navigate economic turbulence, that same valued asset is often the first to be discarded. Employee layoffs are an easy card to play in the corporate game.\n\nBy now, the corporate layoff has become so normalized that it\u2019s practically a reflex. Growth slows? Cut staff. Miss quarterly targets? Cut staff. Merge with another company? You guessed it. It\u2019s efficient, fast, and it\u2019s often applauded. However, companies that reflexively resort to layoffs are playing the short game and leaving real money on the table. Layoffs as a reactionary measure are one thing. In today\u2019s workforce, major companies are making intentional cuts\u2014driven by AI\u2019s potential to automate human tasks. In March, IBM laid off staff in its communications and marketing division, aligning with CEO Arvind Krishna\u2019s plan to slow hiring for 26,000 back-office roles\u2014about 10% of the workforce\u2014that AI could eventually replace. Data shows that businesses that prioritize job security, invest in their employees, and treat workers as partners\u2014not costs\u2014aren\u2019t just doing the right thing. They\u2019re dong the smart thing. Their results are better, their people are more engaged, and their long-term profitability is stronger.\n\nThe JUST Capital data: Investing in workers pays off Let\u2019s cut to the numbers. JUST Capital\u2019s Workers Leaders Index ranks companies based on their performance on critical employee-related issues (wages, benefits, health and safety, training and development, and inclusivity). It has delivered a stunning financial performance. Since its inception, the index has outperformed the Russell 1000 benchmark by 17.3% as of August 5, 2025. That\u2019s not a rounding error. That\u2019s a market signal. It turns out that treating workers well isn\u2019t just a feel-good talking point; it\u2019s a winning strategy. The companies that top the index (think PayPal, Microsoft, and NVIDIA) aren\u2019t just progressive in their HR policies. They\u2019re category leaders, delivering long-term shareholder value precisely because they understand that a loyal, skilled, and secure workforce is a core asset, not a liability. Curious how your company stacks up? JUST Capital\u2019s JUST Jobs Performance Tracker allows Russell 1000 companies to benchmark, compare, and strengthen key job quality issues.\n\nConventional wisdom often frames layoffs as tough decisions made by strong leaders. However, more frequently, they reveal poor forecasting, shallow leadership, long-term valuation decline, or a culture that views people as line items. When companies reduce head count to please investors or chase short-term gains, they send a powerful internal message to the people who create value at their company. It screams, \u201cYou\u2019re expendable.\u201d That message comes with cascading costs, like lower morale, decreased productivity, and a talent drain that can take years to reverse. It\u2019s no coincidence that so many companies experience a dip in innovation and engagement after initiating layoffs. What happens when employees are treated like partners Meanwhile, companies that avoid layoffs, even during downturns, are doing something different. They\u2019re choosing resilience. They\u2019re telling their employees that they aren\u2019t hired hands, but trusted partners, and that everyone will figure it out together. Those employees, in turn, give more, stay longer, and innovate harder.\n\nResearch from Harvard Business Review has shown that companies who treat their employees like partners\u2014sharing financial information, listening to input, and giving them a stake in financial performance\u2014see twice the profitable growth compared to those that treat workers like expendable labor. The economic engagement tool that came from this research enables any company to see where they stand in partnering with employees and where they can profitably improve. Real-world examples: The companies getting it right Let\u2019s look at a few standouts.\n\u2022 Costco famously offers higher-than-average wages and has consistently resisted large-scale layoffs\u2014even during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Result? Low turnover, high productivity, and a fiercely loyal customer base.\n\u2022 Salesforce committed to avoiding layoffs during the pandemic\u2019s early chaos and focused instead on internal redeployment. This created goodwill that persisted even as the tech sector began shedding jobs. It\u2019s further proof that how you treat your workforce in a crisis shapes your brand for years. JUST Capital found that they also disclose AI talent initiatives, equipping workers to upskill through the AI revolution.\n\u2022 Barry-Wehmiller, a manufacturing company led by CEO Bob Chapman, embraces a leadership model centered on \u201ctruly human leadership.\u201d It treats employees not as functions but as people. They haven\u2019t conducted layoffs even in downturns. Their productivity and profits speak for themselves. These companies don\u2019t just lead industries; they reshape them.\n\nCritics argue that layoffs are sometimes necessary for survival. In rare cases, that may be true. However, they are more often used to pad quarterly earnings reports, not to prevent bankruptcy. The more courageous path is building business models that prioritize workforce continuity\u2014 cross-training employees, restructuring roles instead of eliminating them, and investing in operational efficiency without reducing head count. In other words: growth. Not only does this preserve institutional knowledge, but it avoids the costly cycle of expensive rehiring once business rebounds. The corporate world has long treated labor as a cost to be minimized. However, in today\u2019s knowledge-driven economy, human capital is increasingly the key differentiator. Companies that view employees as assets that appreciate over time are already reaping the rewards. The data from JUST Capital and others like them shows that there\u2019s no longer a tradeoff between doing right by workers and delivering returns to shareholders. The two are intertwined.\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",

This week, I\u2019m putting our money where our mouth is by sharing findings from one of our own summer intern projects: an analysis by Sofia Maria Giorgianni that reveals crucial insights about how America\u2019s most just companies are approaching AI workforce development.\nSofia\u2019s research couldn\u2019t be more timely. Our polling shows that AI is a critical issue to the American public with 70% of respondents agreeing that CEOs have a key role to play in the ethical use of AI, and Americans consistently rank worker advancement and training as a top issue. As AI reshapes the private sector, a critical question emerges: How are companies investing in their workers to ensure they can thrive in an AI-powered future? The answer, according to our data, is encouraging.\nAmong the 2025 JUST 100, 84% of companies mention AI in their disclosures, yet only 20% specifically disclose AI talent development initiatives. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The companies leading the way \u2013 including Salesforce, Constellation Energy, Boston Scientific, Visa, and The Hershey Company \u2013 span 13 different industries, showing that AI readiness isn\u2019t just a tech sector concern.\nInterestingly, companies with AI training initiatives tend to rank higher overall in our Rankings of America\u2019s Most JUST Companies while those without such programs skew toward the bottom. This suggests a link between future-readiness and just business behavior. Companies that invest in their workers\u2019 AI capabilities are often the same ones excelling across other stakeholder dimensions.\nSofia\u2019s work demonstrates how fresh perspectives can illuminate critical business challenges.

To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.\nThe last day Regina Lee was in the office, she was coughing so badly it rattled her whole body. The Costco Travel agent didn\u2019t often work on Saturdays, but she\u2019d picked up an extra shift on March 14 to help field the barrage of calls from customers trying to cancel cruises amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beloved in the office, the 59-year-old rarely missed a day of work in her 20 years at the company. That day, though, her coworkers kept wondering why she was there.\nTen days earlier on March 4, officials in King County, Washington \u2014 home to Costco\u2019s headquarters and the initial epicenter of the US outbreak \u2014 called on businesses to let their employees work from home during a \u201ccritical moment in the growing outbreak.\u201d Major Seattle-area companies like Microsoft and Boeing heeded that warning, shuttering their corporate operations and shifting employees to remote work. Costco did not. That same day, Costco CEO Craig Jelinek emailed thousands of workers at the company\u2019s sprawling corporate campus in Issaquah, Washington, to say that allowing corporate employees to work remotely wouldn\u2019t be fair to the \u201cgreat number of Costco employees locally and across the country\u201d in its stores who could not. \u201cOur jobs here are to support our retail business, and we\u2019re not prepared at this point to have corporate employees work from home,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201c\u2018We take care of employees.\u2019 Bullshit.\u201d\nThroughout her Saturday shift, Lee, who had diabetes, struggled to control her dry, hacking cough while processing refunds for some of the hundreds of customers calling Costco\u2019s 20-year-old travel business. \u201cShe should go home,\u201d Lee\u2019s concerned colleagues whispered among themselves as she struggled to catch her breath. A supervisor eventually checked on her, but the agent remained at her desk until the end of her shift at 3 p.m. By Monday morning, she was dead.\nLee was the first known Costco employee in the US to die of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, after she collapsed at the Everett, Washington, home she shared with her sister, Willa, and their mother, Susie. Two weeks later, they were dead too. The Lees are now three of the more than 31,000 people who have died in the US \u2014 and nearly 140,000 people globally \u2014 from the novel coronavirus.\nWith 547 retail warehouses across the US, Costco has become a lifeline for millions of people during the pandemic. However, more than 100 employees and contractors told BuzzFeed News that the $140 billion global retailer placed thousands of workers at its corporate offices and stores at risk through its lack of transparency on confirmed cases, disregard for warnings, and inability to adjust long-standing policies during a critical period. These people, most of whom asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said Costco left its workers unprotected and uninformed on the front lines of the worst global health crisis of their lifetimes.\n\u201cIs business that much more important?\u201d Regina\u2019s brother Raymond Lee told BuzzFeed News. \u201cShame on Costco. They say, \u2018We take care of employees.\u2019 Bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cNo higher priority than your own well-being\u201d\nCostco employees said the company should have seen this coming.\nIn conversations with BuzzFeed News, both corporate and warehouse workers wondered why Costco management was so slow to enact firm coronavirus protocols at its North American locations, given what the global retail giant had seen in its stores in Asia, where the pandemic first spread.\nAnd that hesitation may have let the virus spread further than it otherwise would have.\nAccording to interviews and internal memos obtained by BuzzFeed News, at least 21 people at Costco\u2019s corporate offices and at least 62 workers at warehouses across the US have tested positive for COVID-19. According to employees, at least two have died after contracting the disease.\nMeanwhile, workers at Costco\u2019s warehouses \u2014 what the company calls its stores \u2014 said the retailer didn\u2019t do enough to prepare or protect them from thousands of customers who flooded in to stock up on toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and bulk groceries as coronavirus fears ramped up in March. Some employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News said warehouse managers failed to properly inform them of confirmed coronavirus cases among their colleagues and were slow to shut down or professionally sanitize their stores \u2014 leaving them and their members at risk.\n\u201cWorking for Costco during this devastating point of time has become a living nightmare,\u201d a Los Angeles\u2013based warehouse employee told BuzzFeed News, noting that the company\u2019s coronavirus response has disillusioned workers. \u201cThey will continue to prioritize the needs of the business over their employees\u2019 well-being, even when we are in a state of emergency. We were never prepared for this.\u201d\n\u201cWorking for Costco during this devastating point of time has become a living nightmare.\u201d\nCostco, its CEO, and members of its leadership team did not respond to repeated requests for comment on a detailed list of questions regarding its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a March 21 memo obtained by BuzzFeed News, Jelinek suggested he would not be responding to press inquiries. \u201cAs we\u2019re dealing with this unprecedented situation we aren\u2019t spending a lot of time engaging with the media and other occasional critics,\u201d he wrote.\nWhile many companies in the US, including Starbucks, Trader Joe\u2019s, and Amazon, were slow to respond, in part because their leaders followed the federal government\u2019s haphazard messaging and response, Costco\u2019s management had plenty of warning. On an earnings call 11 days before Lee died, the company\u2019s chief financial officer touted its response to the spread of the coronavirus in China and South Korea, both countries where it has stores. Costco has also weathered previous health crises, including the 2002\u201303 SARS outbreak.\nIn conversations with BuzzFeed News, Costco workers from an array of positions across the US detailed circumstances they deemed irresponsible. Two pregnant women in Texas were so concerned about their working conditions they took extended, unpaid leaves, their manager said. In Ohio, a manager described the \u201ccarelessness\u201d of ignoring social distancing protocols by keeping every checkout register open. Employees in Las Vegas wondered why their stores were letting customers mill around and touch nonessential items like clothes and patio furniture. A manager in Michigan said elderly hourly workers were made to sanitize an area of the store where an infected employee had been without being told what and why they were cleaning.\nGot a tip? Email one of the reporters of this story at Brianna.Sacks@buzzfeed.com or Ryan.Mac@buzzfeed.com, or contact us here.\n\u201cI do think Costco has implemented some good practices now, but it just took too long,\u201d the Michigan manager said. \u201cThey were reactionary the entire time instead of taking the opportunity to be a leader in the industry.\u201d\nSince BuzzFeed News first reported on working conditions at Costco facilities during the outbreak, the company has strengthened its response. More than a week after Lee\u2019s death, it enabled most of its corporate employees to work remotely. It also confirmed it would temporarily boost warehouse pay by $2 an hour, promised to provide masks and gloves, shortened store hours, required plexiglass shields on registers, and limited how many customers were allowed in a store at a time, though some employees say those aren\u2019t being followed. BuzzFeed News obtained an internal memo sent earlier this month that shows that Costco now monitors employees\u2019 temperatures in accordance with federal guidelines. The company has also ramped up its messaging to employees and its CEO has visited multiple warehouses to thank his workers.\n\u201cWhile we should be very proud of serving our communities, at the same time I know Costco employees have personal concerns and anxiety as well,\u201d CEO Craig Jelinek said during a rare company-wide video address on March 30. \u201cSo I want to be clear about this: The business of Costco is important, and our communities and coworkers depend on us. But there\u2019s no higher priority than your own well-being and the well-being of your families.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all expendable.\u201d\nFor some workers, Jelinek\u2019s message seemed like damage control. Many people worked at Costco for years, citing the company\u2019s health care benefits, retirement plans, and relatively high pay as reasons why it was a good place to work. The company\u2019s delayed and deficient handling of the coronavirus pandemic, however, has dampened those sentiments, making employees feel as if they had to choose between their health and their livelihoods. Without accumulated holiday or sick pay, some employees living paycheck to paycheck said they were told they had to come to work or take unpaid leave \u2014 even if they thought they had been exposed to the disease.\n\u201cWe are all expendable,\u201d said one Costco shift supervisor in Oregon. \u201cWho talks about protecting us? I am not hearing anyone stand up for us.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone is sharing gloves\u201d\nDetailing potential risk factors in its 2019 annual earnings report, Costco warned of potential \u201cpublic health issues\u201d that \u201ccould disrupt our operations ... or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels.\" But the coronavirus pandemic, at least in its early weeks, seems to have had the opposite effect.\nAs people flocked to warehouses to stock up for weeks of self-isolation, Costco\u2019s sales jumped more than $1.6 billion, or 11.7%, in the five weeks leading up to April 5, according to a recent financial report. E-commerce sales were up nearly 50%. Those numbers were \u201cstrong,\u201d said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson, who noted that the pandemic was an \u201copportunity for them to pick up customers\u201d and build upon its membership count of some 100 million cardholders.\nCostco had seen crisis-inspired sales booms before. In 2003, as SARS wreaked havoc on Asia, its stores in Taiwan \u2014 where it now has 13 locations \u2014 not only weathered the storm but thrived. \u201cPeople would come to Costco to buy food because they trusted it,\u201d Richard Chang, Costco\u2019s senior vice president of Asia, said in a 2018 interview.\nSo as the coronavirus outbreak gained momentum in China and South Korea, company leaders who\u2019d been through the SARS crisis temporarily closed and cleaned affected locations while implementing strict daily disinfecting and social distancing regimens.\n\u201cOur warehouses have overall remained open with only a few total days of closures at a couple of locations in Korea, as well our Shanghai location, [and] there has been some limitations required on the number of people in the facility at a given time,\u201d Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a March 5 earnings call.\nIn the US, Costco\u2019s workers aware of the measures taken to protect their foreign colleagues wondered why the same wasn\u2019t being done for them. In private Facebook groups for employees and in interviews with BuzzFeed News, they fumed about the disparity between the precautions taken abroad and what was happening in the US.\n\u201cWhen you look at the Costcos in [South] Korea, they shut down the entire store and cleaned it,\u201d one employee at the company\u2019s Hayward, California, warehouse told BuzzFeed News in mid-March. \u201cWe only shut down to control how many people were in the store. There hasn\u2019t been one deep cleaning. The employees there are decked out with masks. [There\u2019s a] commitment to protection.\u201d\n\u201cWe were having 3,500 people allowed to come in at a time and no masks have been required.\u201d\nMeanwhile, as wave after wave of customers clamored for paper towels and pasta at US locations, employees at a number of Costco warehouses said managers floundered amid a lack of clear direction from higher-ups about social distancing and customer limits.\nAt the store in Culver City, California, on March 13, two days after Gov. Gavin Newsom advised citizens to avoid large crowds, door count sheets provided to BuzzFeed News illustrated the chaos. From 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., employees at the door checked in 4,015 Costco cardholders. The total door count for that day was 10,371 members, which does not account for the fact that multiple people can enter the store on the same membership card.\n\u201cWe were having 3,500 people allowed to come in at a time and no masks have been required,\u201d a supervisor at that location told BuzzFeed News on March 19. \u201cEveryone is sharing gloves. We\u2019re bringing our own, and if we have enough we give them to each other.\u201d\nAt one point, as Costco stores racked up banner days, with some regularly exceeding sales of $1 million every 24 hours, employees struggled to buy supplies for their own families. They\u2019d often find that crucial items like baby formula and disinfecting wipes were sold out by the time their shifts ended. Multiple warehouse workers told BuzzFeed News they felt expendable.\n\u201cI feel like we weren\u2019t considered and we are like little guinea pigs looking at sales,\u201d said one Culver City warehouse employee, adding that management took nearly a day to tell them about a colleague\u2019s positive COVID-19 test, after cleaners in hazmat suits wiped down the areas where they worked. \u201cThe store will manage $600,000 to $1 million on a normal day. The other day we were at $1.4 million.\u201d\nAt the end of March, Costco mandated that every location let employees shop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. every Friday, according to internal documents seen by BuzzFeed News.\n\u201cBusiness as usual\u201d\nGregory Ulrich had just acclimated to his new warehouse in Norwalk, Connecticut, when he abruptly called in sick around mid-March. His colleagues immediately worried that the manager, an esteemed Costco veteran of nearly 20 years, had contracted the virus. The affable 57-year-old had been \u201ccoughing up a storm\u201d for a few days, an employee told BuzzFeed News, explaining that \u201cNorwalk had a huge outbreak, so people were getting a bit on edge.\u201d\nOn Friday, March 27, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital, a friend told BuzzFeed News. He died the following Monday from complications associated with the novel coronavirus. Alicia Ramnarine, a former Costco colleague, told BuzzFeed News that Ulrich was always cheerful, kind, and \u201ca gentle man in a place full of chaos.\u201d Ulrich\u2019s family declined to comment.\nAccording to two employees, warehouse leaders held two \u201cemergency meetings\u201d addressing the coronavirus panic. At the first, around March 16, management told staff that no one at the store had the virus and that people who spread rumors to the contrary could be fired because of the \u201cseverity of the misinformation,\u201d a worker in attendance said. At the second meeting, about a week later, management said they \u201cdid not know about his positive results\u201d and that they were going to enact more safety measures. Norwalk, Connecticut, had 17 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time. That number has since swelled to 747 cases and 32 deaths.\nIn a note posted in the warehouse break room the day Ulrich died, management called his death \u201ca great loss\u201d and said that the longtime employee would be \u201cprofoundly missed.\u201d As the store closed for the night, workers watched as a hazmat crew came in and disinfected the store\u2019s cash registers.\nThe following day, the Norwalk store\u2019s general manager posted a second letter in the break room, saying he did not know Ulrich had the coronavirus because \u201chis doctors did not feel he had it, nor would they test him.\u201d The store leader told staff in bold letters to \u201cDEMAND\u201d to be tested if they were feeling symptoms as \u201cdoctors are waiting far too long to test people on their assumption that their patients don\u2019t have it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Greenwich Hospital of the Yale New Haven Health System declined to comment on Ulrich\u2019s case, citing patient privacy laws.\nAt the time, his Norwalk colleagues had been hearing about coronavirus cases at other warehouses and saw every cough as a potential danger. Two employees who worried Ulrich had the virus feel that management should have been more vigilant in monitoring for early warning signs and done a better job enforcing social distancing rules.\n\u201cI remember posts in our employees group page about measures some warehouses were taking, and many of us did wonder what we were waiting for. It was like business as usual,\u201d one employee told BuzzFeed News, adding that his colleagues were \u201cscared\u201d to come into work.\nHowever, another worker there said he was \u201chappy\u201d with the warehouse\u2019s response. Costco did not respond to requests for comment on safety protocols at the Norwalk location.\nAs of April 6, three other workers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, bringing the Norwalk warehouse\u2019s total case count to at least four.\n\u201cHis doctors did not feel he had it, nor would they test him.\u201d\nThe experience of the employees in Norwalk is not unique. At more than a dozen warehouses across the country, workers told BuzzFeed News that management at their locations was often slow to implement safety measures and failed to adequately inform them of new or suspected coronavirus cases among their colleagues. Some workers have taken it upon themselves to tally the cases, using a private, employee-only Facebook group to share information about coworkers who have reportedly contracted or died from COVID-19.\nLabor advocates said the federal government\u2019s own dismissiveness of the virus, blundered response, and weak guidelines set the tone for Costco and other major retailers. Protocols from the CDC and FDA offer \u201cvery minimal guidance\u201d on how to protect workers and could enable businesses to pressure employees to return to work even if they\u2019re sick, Peter Dooley, senior project coordinator for the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, told BuzzFeed News, calling essential workers the \u201cmost at-risk and the most neglected.\u201d\n\u201cThe messaging from the top was of total denial for action or precaution, and the shame of it is that we had examples of what had been put in place in other countries,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cThe real problem is the deception for people to think that they're not at risk, or in the low-risk category, and now we have grocery workers dying from the virus. If a worker gets sick with the illness it should be a presumption it was work exposure.\u201d\nCostco\u2019s corporate leaders have been issuing new temporary operational guidelines for all its US warehouses. On March 27, they told managers that they\u2019re required to provide masks, gloves, and plexiglass screens at checkout stands, sanitize registers every 15 minutes, and limit common contact points like silverware dispensers in break rooms. Some changes are happening, workers said, but many feel it\u2019s too late. In New York, the Westbury warehouse on Long Island has at least eight infected workers, according to company notices provided to BuzzFeed News.\nAmanda Rosado, a deli worker at Costco\u2019s Port Chester, New York, location told BuzzFeed News that by this month four of her coworkers had tested positive for COVID-19, a situation she described as \u201ca holy fucking clusterfuck.\u201d\nThe 31-year-old told BuzzFeed News that during a recent Saturday shift, she noticed that a supervisor overseeing the registers was coughing and had red eyes, but he continued to work without gloves, handling cash that was later touched by dozens of employees. Later, he went home sick. Another colleague she worked with recently in the meat department had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to letters sent by another employee to BuzzFeed News.\nAnd she couldn\u2019t help but wonder: \u201cHow many people might have gotten sick because they walked into my warehouse?\u201d\n\u201cHow many people might have gotten sick because they walked into my warehouse?\u201d\nRosado has worked for Costco since she was 19. Now a single mom with three kids who also cares for a brother with HIV, she said she felt vulnerable because of her managers\u2019 lax approach to safety. She told BuzzFeed News that one person she\u2019s worked closely with in the small deli room has been sick, and that another coworker went home with a terrible cough, only to come back a week later. The warehouse where Rosado works is just 15 minutes away from New Rochelle, New York, an early coronavirus hot spot and containment zone, but it only started giving employees masks at the beginning of April, she said.\nFearful of contracting the virus and bringing it home to her kids and immunocompromised brother, Rosado decided to take a leave of absence, using some of her vacation days to cushion the financial blow. At first, she said she was told she did not \u201cfall under the criteria\u201d to apply for a coronavirus-related break, where employees could request unpaid time off if they\u2019re high-risk, concerned about working, or have symptoms \u2014 though she said she\u2019d been in contact with an infected coworker and has chronic asthma.\n\u201cI want to do what I feel is right for me and my family,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking at Costco is like fighting an invisible enemy with a blindfold and no weapons.\u201d Costco did not respond to requests for comment on the exchange.\nAmong the most marginalized workers at Costco are its contractors, some of whom were thrown into difficult roles to keep up with demand, from packaging to loading supplies in crowded distribution centers. After Costco shuttered its famous food sample stations in early March, it placed the sample servers, who were employed by a third-party company named Club Demonstration Services, on sanitization teams to keep them on the payroll.\nIt was a tough spot to be in, several former CDS sample servers told BuzzFeed News. They needed the money \u2014 but some of the tasks, including walking the length of warehouses to clean where a potentially sick person had been, were difficult for the workers, many of whom were over 65 and had preexisting health problems. Less than a month later, CDS abruptly fired all 30,000 workers, as BuzzFeed News first reported, without warning or severance. In an announcement, Costco said it would be using its own employees to clean.\nEmployees out, seasonal workers in\nCostco\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic varied across its 547 locations in the US. Employees at some warehouses told BuzzFeed News their managers have been proactive, strictly enforcing limits on customers allowed in stores and mandating social distancing in the break rooms.\nBut for every story of the company\u2019s success, there seems to be another of its failures. In Hayward, California, home to the second-largest Costco warehouse in the Bay Area, employees continue to complain of lax safety measures. Minutes after management announced its fifth COVID-19 case at the end of March, half of one manager\u2019s employees walked off the floor. Most haven\u2019t come back, and the manager told BuzzFeed News he doesn\u2019t blame them. Over the past few weeks, he has logged and photographed what he believes to be at least 10 sanitization and safety failures at the 154,000-square-foot warehouse.\nThe manager told BuzzFeed News that Costco\u2019s decision to expand open hours at an already overworked store has made things worse. Hayward, which used to open its doors at 10 a.m., now officially opens at 7:30 a.m. and closes at 6:30 p.m. But hours before that, at 3 a.m., it welcomes health care workers and first responders who are unable to shop during normal business hours. At 6 a.m., seniors and Instacart workers can begin shopping. It\u2019s a grueling schedule that makes coronavirus safety protocols tougher to manage.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking care of the community if none of the employees are protected.\u201d\nSince the end of March, about 100 of the Hayward store\u2019s 330 employees have taken leave, the manager said, some forgoing pay after exhausting their sick days and paid time off. To supplement the loss of full-time employees, the warehouse, like many others across the US, has hired scores of seasonal hourly workers who require training. These temporary employees said they, too, have become essential parts of the workforce but have remained largely invisible, with no hazard pay or sick time. Some contractors said they were given scant protections for working in crowded environments and handling supplies.\n\u201cThe aggressiveness is not there. You hear it from [the governor], but it's not trickling down to the businesses and their essential workers,\u201d the manager in California said. \u201cI do like Costco \u2014 in dire times we take care of the community \u2014 but we're not taking care of the community if none of the employees are protected.\u201d\n\u201cCostco \u2026 won\u2019t close for anything\u201d\nBy early February, Regina Lee and her Costco Travel colleagues were already feeling the impact of the coronavirus on their work. As news filtered to the US that hundreds of passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner had been quarantined in Japan, customers began flooding the phone lines, asking if they should cancel trips or if there were any deals to be had.\nAgents told BuzzFeed News that, at times, more than 850 people would be waiting on lines for up to three hours, overrunning their systems. To manage the volume, some travel employees worked 12-hour shifts, while others came in seven days a week, even as the state of Washington received early signs of what lay ahead.\n\u201cHere we are in a very close working environment amid the outbreak, and we\u2019re right up the road from Kirkland, [Washington,] and that retirement home where all the first deaths came from,\u201d one travel employee told BuzzFeed News, referencing Life Care Center, a nursing home that accounted for the nation\u2019s earliest coronavirus cases and fatalities. \u201cI pass it every day on my way to work [and] wondered what happens when it hits here at Costco Travel. It would be like a bomb going off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens when it hits here at Costco Travel. It would be like a bomb going off.\u201d\nBy Friday, March 13, Washington had recorded 694 cases of COVID-19 and more than 100 deaths, the majority of which were in King County. The news deeply unsettled employees at Costco Travel and the company\u2019s corporate offices, who told BuzzFeed News of their mounting anxiety as coworkers developed coughs or flulike symptoms. The risk for contagion was high, they said, pointing to their open floor plans with close-quartered pods, crowded shuttles that ran between parking lots and other buildings, and shared eating areas.\nMany employees wanted to work from home but were forbidden from doing so. Some told BuzzFeed News that Costco\u2019s resistance to remote working stemmed from its \u201cold-school\u201d culture, where long-serving executives didn\u2019t understand its merits. Employees said management refused to give them laptops and often cited solidarity with their warehouse colleagues as justification for forbidding remote work. The stores were renowned for staying open in harsh weather, and if warehouse workers could brave snowstorms, management said, so should office employees. If you got snowed in, that counted as a sick day.\n\u201cCostco thinks it is the USPS and won't close for anything,\u201d one former employee of 15 years said. \u201cYou have to bring your butt into work, despite the conditions.\u201d\nAs the coronavirus spread across King County, executives stuck to the same logic, sending emails that they were monitoring the outbreak, telling sick employees to stay home, and suggesting that those people who were considered \u201chigh-risk\u201d use paid time off. The majority of office workers, though, were expected to come in if they wanted to collect a paycheck, and those without vacation time were left in difficult positions.\nCostco did not respond to repeated requests for comment about these policies.\nThe death of Lee shocked her coworkers. She was a favorite among colleagues, who remembered her smile and knack for leaving chocolates on people\u2019s keyboards. On the Monday she died, Lee\u2019s fellow agents had been answering the onslaught of calls when at around 11:30 a.m., management cut off their phone lines. The office became abruptly, eerily quiet. Then an email arrived in their inboxes.\n\u201cI was so mortified that they didn\u2019t close the office when my friend died.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as I read her name, I leaped out of my chair,\u201d one agent who sat near Lee for years said. \u201cMy headset was still on my head, and I pointed to her nameplate, which was still on her cubicle.\u201d\nIn announcing her death, Costco Travel Vice President Peter Gruening said Lee died \u201cunexpectedly\u201d and that the company had \u201cno information that this was related to COVID-19.\u201d As a precaution, the company would close the building for a cleaning, he wrote, adding, \u201cAs of now, we expect to open tomorrow as usual.\u201d\nShortly after the announcement, supervisors came to the floor and ushered everyone out. Agents remembered checking their phones all night for a message, wondering if they\u2019d be quarantined at home. \u201cThe next morning, they said, \u2018We are open just as usual,\u2019\u201d a current employee told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThere was so much confusion and anxiety. So many people didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\nThose who did come back on Tuesday furiously wiped down their desks while wondering aloud if they should have stayed home. Later that afternoon, corporate leadership confirmed in an email that Lee had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, acknowledging that the news \u201ccauses a great deal of concern and anxiety among employees.\u201d The building, though, remained open.\n\u201cI was so mortified that they didn\u2019t close the office when my friend died,\u201d said one travel employee who has been with the company for more than a decade. \u201cCostco is my family, and I love them \u2014 but that really tore it for me right there.\u201d\nThe morning after Lee\u2019s death, CEO Craig Jelinek said in an email that company leadership was \u201cnow encouraging more employees at the Home and Regional office to work remotely.\u201d Later that evening, the retailer posted a message from Jelinek on Facebook addressed to Costco members, noting that it \u201cis firmly committed to the health and safety of our members and employees\u201d and was \u201ccomplying with public health guidance.\u201d At the time, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee had closed schools and banned gatherings of more than 250 people in certain counties but had yet to issue a stay-at-home order.\nAccording to corporate employees, Costco began disclosing confirmed COVID-19 cases in company-wide emails three days after Lee's death, sometimes sending multiple notes in a day. It kept employees at its corporate offices until March 25 \u2014 long after its corporate peers had shuttered theirs and two days after Inslee\u2019s executive order mandating residents stay home. The campus, though, has remained open and some employees have told BuzzFeed News that they\u2019ve seen colleagues and their managers taking conference calls from the offices.\nOn March 25, Gruening congratulated his team on the shift to working from home. By the end of that workday, Costco corporate had confirmed that at least nine of its employees, including a worker at a campus deli, had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\u201cFrankly, it is absolutely amazing that we\u2019ve been able to transition from 100% onsite to a fully functioning remote-work program in under two weeks,\u201d the Costco Travel vice president wrote in an email to staff. \u201cIt is a testament to the hard work, quick thinking and resourcefulness of many.\u201d\nAs of April 9, at least 21 corporate and travel employees have tested positive for COVID-19, according to internal emails obtained by BuzzFeed News. Ten of those people work in the travel department, and four of them sit on the same floor as Lee. One of those agents, who was officially diagnosed March 19, had been complaining on Facebook about her high fever and loss of taste two weeks earlier. \"This is what happens when people are so afraid and they can\u2019t afford to stay home and they come in,\u201d an employee told BuzzFeed News.\nWorkers said they\u2019re infuriated and frustrated that their leaders did not enact stronger precautionary measures. Some, like an IT employee who worked in another building down the road from Lee and contracted the virus, wondered what would have happened if management had simply listened.\nThe first week of March, when the total of coronavirus cases in King County surpassed 70, the IT employee had come down with aches and a fever but couldn\u2019t get tested due to the scarcity of kits. Reading headlines about hospitals rationing masks and infected Washington residents quarantined in motels, the employee sent multiple emails to several leaders notifying them about their coronavirus-like symptoms, expressing fear for the worker's close-quartered colleagues, and asking to work from home. It was going to get bad, the employee warned in emails, and no one was taking it seriously.\nIn response, this employee said, they were reprimanded for overreacting. It took nearly four days, but they were approved to work from home right before Lee died.\nShortly after, the employee tested positive for COVID-19. Now their entire family is sick too. So far, according to internal emails, eight people who work in the same building have told Costco they have the virus.\n\u201cI was sick and trying to shout from the rooftops: \u2018This is serious!\u2019\u201d the employee said, voice breaking. \u201cI was sitting there, absolutely helpless.\u201d\nThe Costco family\nIt\u2019s been nearly a month since the pandemic brought the country to a tumultuous halt, forcing millions of Americans out of work and to stay at home. As the initial panic subsided, so too has the early chaos at Costco\u2019s warehouses. Though stores often see significant lines, the people who work at them are better protected and better compensated. There are fewer shoppers in stores and more masks, and temperature checks.\nIn certain states, lawmakers have heard and acted upon food service workers\u2019 fears and concerns. Washington state passed new protections on April 13, prohibiting companies from forcing high-risk employees into unsafe conditions or penalizing or firing them for refusing to work in them. The governor\u2019s proclamation came just days after the Trump administration announced that employers do not have to officially document coronavirus cases.\nBack in Issaquah, Costco\u2019s corporate employees have settled into their new remote working routines. Travel staffers are still fielding calls, occasionally from people inquiring about deals on cruise packages.\nOn April 3, agents received a message about Regina Lee. Kathy Robinson, Costco Travel\u2019s associate vice president of operations, sent an email to employees noting that the \u201crapid transition to work from home did not allow us to fully digest the news of Regina\u2019s passing.\u201d In her note, the executive called the 59-year-old a \u201cquiet and beautiful person\u201d who \u201calways included your name when she walked by and said hi.\u201d She included a link to her obituary page for people to share their thoughts.\nThey did. Although Lee was soft-spoken, she lit up the office with her giggle, kind gestures, and giant cookie trays. She will be greatly missed, they wrote. They\u2019re in shock that she\u2019s dead.\nRaymond Lee is too. He continues to struggle with the idea that most of his immediate family is dead. His sisters, Regina and Willa, were getting ready to retire, he told BuzzFeed News, and they had just paid off the mortgage on the home they shared with their mother.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a total of two younger sisters and my mother in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe week before, I buried my baby sister. And the following Friday, I buried my mother and my other baby sister.\u201d\nSome of his sister\u2019s colleagues have called him to offer condolences. It\u2019s been nice, he said, but it\u2019s not the call he\u2019s been waiting for.\n\u201cNo one from Costco has made one call to say that they\u2019re sorry for the loss of Regina,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that something? Costco says they treat their employees like family.\u201d \u25cf\nUPDATE\nAfter publication, more Costco warehouse employees sent us documents confirming 9 more COVID-19 cases at stores in New York and Colorado."

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that reflexive layoffs are a short\u2011sighted strategy that harms morale, productivity, and long\u2011term profitability, while companies that treat employees as partners\u2014investing in wages, benefits, training, and inclusive culture\u2014see stronger financial performance, as demonstrated by JUST Capital\u2019s Workers Leaders Index outperforming the Russell 1000. It cites IBM\u2019s planned pause on hiring for AI\u2011replaceable back\u2011office roles and Salesforce\u2019s commitment to avoid layoffs during the pandemic as examples of intentional workforce strategies. The piece also details Costco\u2019s delayed response to COVID\u201119, which led to employee deaths, widespread criticism, and a tarnished reputation for treating workers as expendable. Overall, the narrative stresses that prioritizing employee well\u2011being is not only ethically sound but also a smart business decision that drives sustainable growth. ",
