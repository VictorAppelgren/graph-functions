  "content": "Strong winds and waves battered Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard and dangerous rip currents threatened from the Carolinas to New England as Hurricane Erin made its way farther out to sea Friday.\n\nThe storm was forecast to cause possible coastal flooding into the weekend along the East Coast but was also expected to weaken gradually.\n\nDespite being twice the size of an average hurricane, Erin so far has managed to thread the needle through the Atlantic between the East Coast and several island nations, limiting its destructiveness.\n\nOn North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, waves breached dunes in the town of Kill Devil Hills on Thursday evening, and water and sand pooled on Highway 12.\n\nAlthough damage assessments were still underway, the low-lying islands appeared to have dodged widespread trouble.\n\nA tropical storm warning remained active on Bermuda, where residents and tourists were told to stay out of the water through Friday.\n\nBut warnings along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia were discontinued.\n\nCommunities along the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coast could see tropical storm-force wind gusts through early Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued coastal flood warnings for places as far north as New York and New Jersey.\n\nBeaches were closed to swimming Thursday in New York City, but more than a dozen surfers still rode waves at Rockaway Beach in Queens.\n\nScott Klossner, who lives nearby, said conditions were great for experienced surfers.\n\n\u201cYou wait all year round for these kinds of waves. It\u2019s challenging, really hard to stay in one place, because there\u2019s a heavy, heavy, heavy rip,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut this is what surfers want \u2014 a hurricane that comes but doesn\u2019t destroy my house? I\u2019ll take that.\u201d\n\nThe Outer Banks \u2014 essentially sand dunes sticking out of the ocean a few feet above sea level \u2014 are vulnerable to erosion.\n\nStorm surges can cut through them, washing tons of sand and debris onto roads and sometimes breaking up pavement and creating new inlets.\n\nThe dunes and beach took a beating the last two days, but Dare County Manager Bobby Outten said there have been no new inlets with Erin or significant structural damage to homes or businesses.\n\n\u201cAll in all it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been,\u201d Outten said. \u201cHopefully the worst of it is behind us.\u201d\n\nOn Jennette\u2019s Pier in Nags Head, where sustained winds reached 45 mph, dozens of onlookers snapped photos of the huge waves crashing into the structure amid driving rain.\n\n\u201cThis is nature at her best,\u201d Nags Head resident David Alan Harvey said. \u201cI love this. I love these storms.\u201d\n\nErin has fluctuated in intensity since forming nearly a week ago but remained unusually large, stretching across more than 600 miles.\n\nIt was still a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds around 100 mph, the hurricane center said. Erin was about 535 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nSo-called Cape Verde hurricanes like Erin, which originate near those islands off the west coast of Africa, cross thousands of miles of warm ocean and are some of the most dangerous to North America.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Shocking video shows CEO with service dog being knocked out by illegal Russian Uber driver\nA Russian Uber driver working illegally in the US was caught on camera head-butting a South Carolina CEO as he held his service dog, leaving the knocked-out rider with a brain injury, according to the victim and a new lawsuit.\nCharleston-based CEO Bryan Kobel, 45, canceled a ride home from a French restaurant, Maison, in April because the driver refused to take his service dog, Kobel told The Post on Thursday.\nDisturbing surveillance footage shows the driver \u2014 identified as Vadim Uliumdzhiev, 42 \u2014 suddenly marching over and knocking out Kobel as he holds his 17-pound golden doodle in the parking lot.\n\u201cThe next thing I know, I\u2019m waking up in a hospital bed with seven staples in my head and four stitches,\u201d Kobel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a brutal experience to this day.\u201d\nKobel, who is the CEO of a biotech company, suffered a concussion, amnesia, and scarring\u2014 and soon learned from cops the driver had gotten the Uber job with a fake license, he said.\n\u201cUber has to take more accountability for its drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re opening the door to mayhem.\u201d\nKobel said he had just asked the driver if his service dog was allowed in the car and the driver responded \u201cno.\u201d\nWhen he told the driver to cancel the ride, in an interaction Kobel described as \u201cinnocuous,\u201d the driver attacked him \u2014 and his memory went black, Kobel said.\nAn onlooker is shown in footage snapping a photo of Uliumdzhiev\u2019s driver\u2019s plate, and a dramatic 911 call ensued.\n\u201cHe\u2019s bleeding very badly in the back of the head, we\u2019re going to need an ambulance,\u201d the caller said, according to 911 audio.\nUliumdzhiev was later arrested for assault and battery, records show. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then placed a hold on him, and he was transferred to a federal ICE processing center in Folkston, Ga., after posting a $10,000 bond for the assault, the Post and Courier noted.\nIn the weeks that followed, Kobel struggled to remember words and stumbled over phrases due to his brain injury.\n\u201cMy job involves a lot of public speaking and I was unsure whether I would be able to do that again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI wondered, \u201cAm I ever going to be the person I was before, and that\u2019s a very scary thought,\u201d he said.\nKobel is now suing Uber for unspecified financial damage \u2014 but his ultimate goal is to get the company to better protect its riders, he said.\n\u201cUber hides behind a thin veil of legalese to protect their riders,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s fake.\u201d\n\u201cThe company needs to make substantial changes on how it protects riders,\u201d he said.\nThe lawsuit, filed last week in Charleston County Court, notes the Uber driver \u201cposed an unreasonable risk of harm\u201d and that Uber failed \u201cto implement and enforce reasonable safety policy.\u201d\nUber sent a statement condemning the attack on Thursday, but didn\u2019t specify how Uliumdzhiev slipped through the cracks.\n\u201cThere is no place for violence on the Uber platform,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t comment on pending litigation, Uber is deeply committed to safety and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations around worker eligibility.\u201d\nUber added that it screens drivers with a criminal background check and requiring a social security number and driver\u2019s license.\nThe firm didn\u2019t immediately respond to The Post\u2019s questions about whether it plans to change any of its policies around the screenings."

If they are involved in any violence after their release, Briggs promised to schedule an emergency hearing to reconsider her decision.\nThe girl, Briggs noted, has \u201cmajor truancy issues\u201d and was even missing from home for a few months at one point. At the youth shelter, where electronics are banned, she will be drug tested weekly.\nThe boy will be sent to his home because the shelter house is unreasonably far away from his school, Briggs said, noting that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to put hardship\u201d on his family.\nStill, he will also have to complete spot drug tests, Briggs added.\nProsecutors have insisted that the girl, who still has another pending matter in Maryland, is a danger to the community and even a flight risk. Her attorney, though, asserts that she was only \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of the attack and that there was limited evidence to prove she was fully involved.\nNeither teen had come into contact with the DC juvenile justice system before now, both their attorneys said.\nBoth are expected to start school within the next week \u2014 falling in line with the girl\u2019s anticipated trial for her outstanding Maryland case.\nAuthorities are still looking for a black male they suspect was also involved in the carjacking attempt."

      "text": "Hurricane Erin unleashes monster waves, forces beaches along East Coast to shut down\nHurricane Erin has forced beaches across the East Coast \u2013 including in New York and New Jersey \u2013 to shut down due to the possibility of deadly waves and rip-currents as vacationers tried to capture the last bit of summer.\nWhile the center of the powerful storm is forecasted to remain offshore, furious winds, heavy rain and potential flooding were still expected to slam areas along the coast into Friday.\nBruising waves and life-threatening rip currents were also anticipated, according to the National Weather Service.\nWhile New York City\u2019s beaches themselves will remain open, anybody caught trying to play in the water will be booted by lifeguards and park officers through Thursday.\nGov. Kathy Hochul also prohibited beach goers from jumping in the water at three Long Island state beaches through Thursday.\n\u201cAs Hurricane Erin passes the East Coast, I am asking all New Yorkers to prepare for the possibility of dangerous conditions along our beaches and coastal cities and towns,\u201d Hochul said in a statement.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are no strangers to hurricanes \u2014 that is why I\u2019m urging those living in areas that may be impacted to stay safe and exercise caution until the hurricane tapers off later this week.\u201d\nNew Jersey towns also took action at summer hot spots like Asbury Park, Belmar, Wildwood and Margate all closed off to swimming while Island Beach State Park will be shuttered through at least Thursday, officials said.\nMargate officials said anyone who ignored the ban on swimming will venture into the ocean at their own risk.\n\u201cPlease avoid swimming in the ocean, especially when lifeguards are not present. It is more important that you stay alive than get one more beach day before the end of summer.\u201d Gov. Phil Murphy said.\nNational Weather Service forecaster Bob Oravec said rip currents can swallow even the best swimmers.\n\u201cYou can be aware all you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can still be dangerous.\u201d\nIn North Carolina, where the Outer Banks are under particular threat of dangerous waves evacuations were underway Wednesdday.\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday with Erin\u2019s storm possibly swamping roads with waves of 15 feet.\nForecasters expected Erin to swell in size as it travels through the Atlantic and moves north. It was currently a Category 2 storm with winds up 100 mph and nearly 400 miles southeast of North Carolina\u2019s Cape Hatteras.\nWith Post wires."

      "text": "Georgia bigot filmed berating neighbor with antisemitic slurs fired by health care company he co-founded\nA Georgia man who defended his wife\u2019s rampage against their Jewish neighbor was fired from the health care company he helped develop from the ground up.\nMark and Anna Bouyzk both came under fire earlier this week after they carelessly called their Jewish neighbor a \u201ck\u2013e\u201d and said that his daughter, a slain Israeli sergeant with the Jewish state\u2019s border patrol, deserved to die.\n\u201cYou are calling yourself a k\u2013e, you know what you are. You know what you are better than me. You are a corrupt politician with a daughter in the IDF that went there to kill, and has killed maybe in friendly fire because the Israeli soldiers kill each other all the time, and you know very well,\u201d Anna seethed.\nWhile Anna did most of the shouting, Mark backed up his wife and insisted that the young woman\u2019s death was OK because \u201cshe was fighting.\u201d\nMark was let go from AllaiHealth, an AI-powered health care platform, on Monday, the company wrote on LinkedIn.\n\u201cThe behavior displayed in that footage is reprehensible, completely inconsistent with our values, and has no place in our organization or society. We hold ourselves and all those who represent AllaiHealth to the highest standards of integrity and accountability,\u201d CEO Robert Boisjoli wrote.\nMark founded the company alongside Boisjoli after his first business venture, AKESOgen, was bought out by Tempus Laboratories, a biotechnology company based in Chicago.\nDavid Lubin filmed the entire confrontation with his neighbors, which came to a head when he posted signs in remembrance of his daughter opposite their pro-Palestine signs with Jewish slurs scrawled across them.\nHis daughter, Rose Lubin, was stabbed to death by a teenage \u201cterrorist\u201d while patrolling through Jerusalem in November 2023, just one month after the Israel-Hamas War started.\nThe grieving father\u2019s irate neighbors called him a \u201ccorrupt Israeli\u201d and suggested that Rose was shot and killed by the IDF, which the country\u2019s border patrol force is not directly part of.\nEven after both parties returned home, Anna said she later called David and told him that he was responsible for Rose\u2019s death.\nDavid said he never once took issue with his neighbors\u2019 signage, since they have a right to post whatever they want on their property, and that the viral shouting match was the first real confrontation with the raving couple."

      "text": "Hurricane Erin batters NC Outer Banks, floods part of its main highway\nRODANTHE, N.C. \u2014 Hurricane Erin battered North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks with strong winds and waves that flooded part of the main highway and surged under beachfront homes as the monster storm slowly began to move away from the East Coast on Thursday.\nForecasters predicted the storm would peak Thursday and said it could regain strength and once again become a major hurricane, Category 3 or greater, but it was not forecast to make landfall along the East Coast before turning farther out to sea.\nTropical storm conditions were in effect over parts of the Outer Banks and the coast of Virginia, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. In Bermuda, residents and tourists were told to stay out of the water with rough seas expected through Friday.\nThere was flooding along part of the North Carolina and mid-Atlantic coasts, the center said Thursday morning. Authorities predicted that the largest swells during high tide would cut off villages and homes on the Outer Banks and whip up life-threatening rip currents from Florida to New England.\nBig waves push water over roads\nAs Erin\u2019s outer bands brushed the Outer Banks, water poured onto the main route connecting the barrier islands and a handful of stilted homes precariously perched above the beach. By Wednesday evening, officials had closed Highway 12 on Hatteras Island as the surge increased and waves rose. The road remained closed Thursday. Ocracoke Island\u2019s connection to its ferry terminal was cut off.\nMelinda Meadows, property manager at the Cape Hatteras Motel in Buxton, who decided to ride out the storm, said a door was ripped off a townhouse, some walls have been knocked out, and some heat pumps were washed out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the force behind the water,\u201d she told WRAL-TV.\nFarther north, on Jennette\u2019s Pier in Nags Head, dozens of people were out taking photos of the huge waves crashing into the structure and even birdwatching amid the driving rain Thursday morning.\n\u201cThis is nature at her best,\u201d said David Alan Harvey of Nags Head. \u201cI love this. I love these storms.\u201d\nHarvey was unconcerned about being on a pier jutting into the ocean, saying he considered it safer than most other places. \u201cDriving my car is a lot more dangerous than this.\u201d\nA few feet away, 23-year-old Daniel Irons, who lives in Hatteras, was birdwatching and waiting to see what new ones might be brought in by winds from the storm. Another man, Sebastian Kettner, was fishing.\nBeaches off-limits along the coast\nBeaches were closed to swimming Wednesday and Thursday in New York City, and some others in New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware were temporarily off-limits. Widespread, moderate coastal flooding was forecast for low-lying areas of Long Island and parts of New York City.\nOff Massachusetts, Nantucket Island could see waves of more than 10 feet (3 meters) this week. But the biggest threat remained along the Outer Banks, where longtime residents didn\u2019t seem too concerned.\n\u201cI remember taking canoes out of my front yard to get to school, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be that bad,\u201d said Jacob Throne, who lives on Hatteras Island and works for surf shops.\nDespite beach closures elsewhere, some swimmers continued to ignore the warnings. Rescuers saved more than a dozen people caught in rip currents Tuesday at Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina, a day after more than 80 people were rescued.\nBob Oravec, a National Weather Service forecaster, said that even if someone thinks they know how to handle a rip current, it\u2019s not safe.\n\u201cYou can be aware all you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can still be dangerous.\u201d\nHuge waves forecast to cause coastal flooding\nA combination of fierce winds and huge waves estimated at about 20 feet (6.1 meters) could cause coastal flooding in many beachfront communities, North Carolina officials warned. Waves were estimated as high as 18 feet (5.5 meters) Thursday morning, according to local weather reports.\nDozens of beach homes already worn down from chronic erosion and protective dunes could be at risk, said David Hallac, superintendent of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.\nMost residents decided to stay despite evacuations ordered on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.\n\u201cWe probably wouldn\u2019t stay if it was coming directly at us,\u201d said Rob Temple, who operates sailboat cruises on Ocracoke.\nHis biggest concern was whether the main route would wash out and if tourists and delivery trucks may be cut off from the thin stretch of low-lying islands, which are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges.\nThe Hatteras Island Rescue Squad, a volunteer group based in Buxton, said it received no calls for rescues Wednesday night through Thursday morning.\nErin remains a large hurricane as it heads out to sea\nErin has become an unusually large and deceptively worrisome system, with tropical storm-force winds spreading across 500 miles (800 kilometers) \u2014 roughly the distances from New York City to Pittsburgh.\nIt remained a Category 2 hurricane Thursday morning with maximum sustained winds around 105 mph (165 kph), the hurricane center said. Erin was about 210 miles (338 kilometers) east of Cape Hatteras and moving north-northeast at 17 mph (28 kph).\nThe hurricane center was also watching two tropical disturbances far out in the Atlantic that could develop into named storms in the coming days. With thousands of miles of warm ocean water, hurricanes known as Cape Verde storms are some of the most dangerous that threaten North America.\nClimate scientists say Atlantic hurricanes are now much more likely to rapidly intensify into powerful and catastrophic storms, fueled by warmer oceans."

It\u2019s bringing an intense amount of energy to the coastline,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s experienced people only out there right now.\u201d\nWaves on Rockaway beach peaked at 9 feet Thursday and swelled up to 16 feet on the Jersey shore, said FOX Weather Senior Meteorologist Greg Diamond.\nOverall, Hurricane Erin is expected to have only a minor impact on the Big Apple weather Thursday night and Friday with breezy winds up to 30 mph, Diamond told The Post.\nBut coastal sections of southern Long Island and the entire Jersey shore are at risk of flooding as the storm churns northwest, he said.\n\u201cOne thing we do have to watch for is high tide. There could be some moderate coastal flooding,\u201d he said.\nHigh tide will hit Long Island around 9 a.m. Friday morning and the Jersey shore at 8 a.m., he said.\nIn New York City, Friday is expected to be \u201cpretty gorgeous,\u201d in the mid-80s and partly sunny, Diamond said.\nSaturday will be sunny and also in the mid-80s after the storm leaves.\nErin has skirted the East Coast will mercifully avoid landfall, but the storm was so massive its effects were felt on beaches across the Eastern Seaboard.\nIt stretched more than 500 miles in diameter Thursday evening \u2014 placing it in the largest 10% of storms ever recorded in the Atlantic, Fox Weather said.\nAnd while the swells it sent crashing into North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks reached up to 20 feet, a National Weather Service buoy about 150 miles offshore recorded an average wave height of 40-feet Thursday morning.\nAnd some of those waves reached as high as 80 feet as the hurricane passed overhead.\n\u201cIt is larger than most storms,\u201d meteorologist Jarrod Maoloney said.\n\u201cThis area of the Atlantic has larger sized storms than other parts of the Atlantic, larger than the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d"

Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency over warnings about possible flooding in beachside towns.\nBig Apple beaches began feeling the storm\u2019s effects in earnest Thursday \u2014 when some brave souls defied the closures to surf the waves \u2014 and will continue being pounded into Friday.\nThe city itself and inland areas throughout New England are not expected to experience any serious adverse conditions.\nFox Weather predicted the storm\u2019s effects will have passed by Monday morning."
