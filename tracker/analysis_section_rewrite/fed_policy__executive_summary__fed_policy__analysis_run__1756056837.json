      "feedback": "Overall, the draft is dense, source‑rich, and conceptually sound, but it fails to deliver a crisp, decision‑useful house view in 4–6 sentences or bullets and the causal chain from macro regime to equity leadership isn’t tightly operationalized for a professional investor brief. Actionable edits: reframe into a 4–6 item house view (base case Regime A, alternate Regimes B and C) with explicit catalysts, risks, and a tight 0–12 month watch list; anchor each regime to a quantified transition trigger (e.g., inflation deviation vs. target for multiple quarters combined with wage momentum and a clear policy signal shift) and link these to observable proxies (Jackson Hole cues, Jobs data, Chips Act/Intel policy signals). Strengthen first‑principles grounding by clearly defining the real policy‑rate differential to neutral, the external‑balance/terms‑of‑trade channel, and the policy‑reaction function, then show how those inputs drive risk premia and sector leadership (AI/semis in Regime A, defensives/quality in Regime B, onshore‑chips/AI capex in Regime C) with concise, source‑backed numerical anchors (where possible, quote or cite the exact ranges or levels from the sources you’ve used). Tighten the narrative around the three horizons: ensure the 0–3 week section lists 3 auditable catalysts with explicit time windows and clear invalidation conditions, prune duplicative examples (Ford, Disney, J&J, WH Smith) to those that illuminate the macro regime‑to‑stock‑price channel, and ensure every factual claim remains tied to one or more source IDs. Improve the regime map’s consistency across sections (Regime A/B/C definitions, transition, and market pricing logic) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., chips policy as mid‑cycle catalyst vs. broader macro easing) so the causal chain remains coherent rather than episodic. Elevate quantification by converting qualitative statements into ranges or probability‑weighted outcomes (e.g., discount‑rate path, risk premia changes, potential uplift in AI/semis multiples) and attach citations after each factual point to satisfy density and correctness requirements; reduce repetition and ensure the final version adheres to the 4–6 sentence/point brief format with an executive tone.",
