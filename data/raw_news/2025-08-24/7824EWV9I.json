  "title": "UK set to outshine Tenerife and Barcelona in bank holiday heatwave",
  "description": "Weather forecasters predict the mercury peaking at 28C across the UK with 'fine' conditions this bank holiday",
  "content": "Britain will bask in temperatures hotter than Tenerife today - as sun-starved Brits can finally savour a glorious bank holiday. The thermometer is set to soar to a balmy 28C across the nation, with scattered downpours only forecast for Northern Ireland. Temperatures will reach at least 25C widely throughout Britain, stretching as far north as County Durham. Coastal resorts are braced for crowds, particularly along the North Sea shoreline at destinations like Skegness, Scarborough and Great Yarmouth. The hottest conditions will bake the East of England, with the mercury poised to climax in Cambridgeshire this afternoon - a bank holiday across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nMuch of Britain will actually outshine the beloved holiday island of Tenerife today. The Canary Island, which attract more than six million Brits each year, is expected to reach just 25C. Even Tenerife's hottest locations today, including the resort town of Los Cristianos, will struggle to match the scorching 28C predicted across areas like Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire this afternoon. Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen explained: \"High pressure over the UK this weekend and into Monday will help to keep any more persistent rain offshore and will bring a good deal of dry, fine and settled weather. \"Cloud amounts are the main variable through the weekend... But temperatures are generally on the rise through the weekend, possibly peaking around 28C in some parts of southern and central England on Monday.\"\n\nThe UK is currently under the influence of high pressure, leading to \"a good deal of dry and fine weather\" throughout the week, according to the Met Office. However, some regions are bracing for thunderstorms on Wednesday afternoon. Despite this, temperatures remain above average for this time of year. In fact, the UK will be warmer than both Tenerife and Barcelona today, reports the Mirror. The temperature in Barcelona is only expected to reach a peak of 27C, say meteorologists at Metdesk. \"It is going to get warmer, generally getting sunnier as well, so by the time we get to Monday, I think we will see more blue skies generally,\" said Alex Deakin, a meteorologist with the Met Office. He also hinted at the remnants of Hurricane Erin heading our way later this week, which could explain the forecasted storms. Meanwhile, along the eastern US coast, Erin continues to generate life-threatening rip currents. Despite the storm remaining well offshore, rough seas are expected to persist for the next few days.",
