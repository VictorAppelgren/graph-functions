  "content": "5 Of The Best Hedge Trimmers You Can Buy In 2025\n\nHedge trimmers don't have the buzz of chainsaws or the utility of lawnmowers, and they're not seen as particularly exciting tools to add to your yard-maintenance arsenal. But if you have shrubs or hedges, you'll need one \u2014 unless you prefer to go old school with a pair of labor-intensive hedge shears. Once you've decided you're getting a hedge trimmer, it pays to know which model fits your trimming style. Some are built for heavy-duty work like slicing through thick branches or years of overgrowth. Others are lighter and more precise for quick and regular maintenance and detail work around flower beds. But it also depends on your yard size. If it's small, you don't need a big, heavy trimmer. Something compact that's easy to handle is the better choice. But if you have long hedges and mature shrubs across a larger property, you'll want to consider more blade length, longer runtime, and better cutting power. We've looked to pick the best hedge trimmers on today's market that balance performance, comfort, and price. We didn't go for commercial-grade beasts or gas-powered relics. These are all cordless models that are among the best-reviewed and best-performing you'll find. They're quieter, cleaner, and easier to maintain than gas models, and most now also have the necessary power and runtime to handle regular yard work. They are clean-cutting and reliable, and there's barely a reason for homeowners to go back to fumes. Here are a few of the best hedge trimmers available in 2025.\n\nSlashGear ranks EGO highly when it comes to hedge trimmers, and the EGO Power+ HT2411 is one of the company's best. It's a cordless hedge trimmer designed for homeowners who need serious cutting power without the headaches of a gas model. Its 24-inch dual-action steel blade is driven by a brushless motor that can deliver up to 3,000 strokes per minute (SPM). That means fast, clean cuts, and you can even tackle tough branches up to an inch in thickness. If you have other Power+ tools, you can use the POWER+ ARC Lithium battery that you should already have with this trimmer, meaning you can save money by buying the tool-only variant, which goes by the model number HT2410. With the battery attached, the trimmer remains lightweight. You shouldn't have any problem handling it, and you won't feel fatigued when getting stuck into some serious hedge trimming. The garden tool reviewers at Forestry.com note that comfort is prioritized in the design. You still get a secure grip, though, and an electric brake stops the blade immediately when you release the trigger, improving both safety and control. The blades do require some attention to keep them performing. You'll need to lubricate them with lightweight oil before and after each use, and routine cleaning with a brush and resin solvent is required. That said, they are fully serviceable, or you can sharpen them with standard tools. However, when all is said and done, the Power+ HT2411 does cost a bit more than similar 24-inch budget models. But it does offer more power, longer run times, and a thicker cut capacity. Additionally, its quality is backed confidently by a 5-year tool and 3-year battery warranty.\n\nCraftsman has a plethora of yard tools to add to your outdoor power equipment collection. And, if it's a compact cordless tool that works as both a hedge trimmer and a grass shear that you seek, consider the CRAFTSMAN V20 Cordless 2-in-1 another excellent addition. It comes with a 4-inch blade for grass work and an 8-inch blade for use on small bushes. And with the easy blade-swap mechanism, you can quickly switch between trimming and shearing for some effortless yard work. It's designed for one-handed use, and it is lightweight at just over 3 lbs with the battery attached, and the experts at ProToolReviews note that it delivers impressive precision and maneuverability. The kit includes a 1.5 Ah battery and charger, and it runs on CRAFTSMAN's V20 system. This means you can swap the battery out with other V20 tools if you have them, which is another big convenience for gardeners. However, the runtime won't suffice if you need a tool for bigger projects, and the blade runs at 1,250 SPM. This is plenty enough for the jobs it's designed for, but this trimmer won't cut through substantial growth. So, just remember, it is all about precision rather than power. But if that's what you need, this is your tool. The dual-blade setup is genuinely handy for delicate work around shrubs and flower beds, making it another outdoor Craftsman tool to take your yard to the next level.\n\nUsers recommend many 18V Makita tools, but if it's hedge-trimming speed you need, the Makita XHU07T could be the one for you. In terms of cost, it does sit toward the higher end of the market for a cordless model, but this is a pro-grade tool with a long 24-inch blade, advanced features, and extra speed that out-trims many of its competitors. This Makita unit has a max stroke rate of 4,400 SPM, putting it up there with some of the most powerful electric hedge trimmers. For gentler work, the low setting operates at 2,000 SPM and the mid at 3,600 SPM, but the variable speed trigger gives you complete control. The dual-action, double-sided stainless steel blade has a cutting capacity of seven-eighths of an inch with 1-inch tooth spacing, which allows you to tackle thicker, woodier branches better than most homeowner models can. And when trimming at angles or working along hedge sides, you can get better control by rotating the rear handle into any of five positions. This allows you to maintain a natural posture when getting stuck in, which you'll be thankful for on big jobs. The tool weighs 8.65 lbs with the 5.0 Ah battery attached. ProToolReviews notes that despite it being noticeably lighter than the previous Makita 18V X2 model, it still performs better. Noise levels are noticeably quiet, too, and not just in comparison to gas models \u2014 it also beats most other battery-powered hedge trimmers when it comes to decibel levels. You'll also be pleased with the 2.5-hour runtime and the built-in reverse function that helps clear blade jams. Safety functions include protection against overload, over-discharge, and overheating, and Makita's Extreme Protection Technology (XPT) improves resistance to dust and water.\n\nAnother affordable, lightweight, easy-to-handle hedge trimmer is the WORX WG261. This cordless model weighs just 5.5 lbs with the battery attached and is much lighter than most trimmers in its class. The overall design focuses on comfort, and it's a good choice for elderly or casual gardeners needing a quality tool for small jobs. The 22-inch dual-action blade cuts in both directions, which reduces vibrations and ensures smooth, controlled trimming. It outperforms many of its competitors by cleanly handling branches of up to three-quarters of an inch in thickness. Most other hedge trimmers in the budget price range usually max out at around a half inch. The D-shaped front handle supports trimming at multiple angles, which reduces strain on arms and shoulders, while the tip guard protects the blade when working close to fences or walls. It comes with a 20V lithium-ion pack that delivers about 30 minutes of steady use. However, at five hours, the recharging time is on the sluggish side. That said, if you plan out your gardening time ahead, you should manage to get through the small jobs it's designed for in time. Furthermore, the PowerShare battery system works across many WORX tools, so you can swap packs between devices and cut down on gear clutter if you're a serial WORX customer. Trimming quality is satisfying, especially considering the budget-friendly price; cuts are clean, and hedges are easily sculpted into the shape they're supposed to be. Build quality is solid for regular home use, and it's backed by a 3-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. All in all, the 20V WG261 hits the sweet spot for standard garden trimming, but if you're tackling thick overgrowth or larger jobs, you might want to look at the beefier 40V model instead.\n\nStihl may be best known for gas-powered, professional tools like chainsaws, but the company has made forays into the battery-powered, household tools market, too. One of these tools that homeowners with large yards and long-established hedges that need regular attention may want to consider is the Stihl HSA 56 Cordless Hedge Trimmer. If you're dealing with mature shrubs and need to put in a bit of elbow grease, you'll be delighted how Stihl has managed to keep this model at a mid-range price without cutting capability corners. It runs on 36V lithium-ion batteries with three different ampere-hour capacity options that provide different runtime lengths for various job sizes. The 18-inch blades have 1.1-inch tooth spacing and run at 2,800 SPM to keep things moving along nicely, while the brushless motor helps to stretch the runtime to cover up to 2,700 linear feet on a single charge. It's relatively lightweight at 8.2 lbs with battery, and it can cut through tough, woody material without upping the decibels too much. BBC Gardeners' World mentioned, \"It's quiet, comfortable, and well balanced and is easy to use.\" The ergonomic loop handle certainly contributes to the easy handling, especially when putting in a longer shift. There's a tip protector to keep the blade safe when trimming next to walls and fences, and Stihl backs the HSA 56 with a two-year warranty.",

      "text": "Makita 18V Cordless Hedge Trimmer Drops Weight While Improving Performance\nWith more than 100 years of experience making electric motors and their acquisition of Dolmar bringing another 90 years of experience in gas OPE, Makita knows a thing or two about making battery-powered lawn care equipment with the performance of gas. So what does all that get you with the latest Makita 18V cordless hedge trimmer?\nThe short answer is more than what many of the other brands can offer.\nPros\n- 24-inch and 30-inch blades available\n- Low vibration and noise compared to other cordless models\n- 3 speed settings with a variable speed trigger\n- Reverse gets you out of a jam\n- Blazing fast 4400 SPM stroke rate\n- 5-position rotating handle\nCons\n- No major drawbacks\nMakita 18V Cordless Hedge Trimmer Performance\nMakita has to compete against companies that have 40, 56, 80, and even higher voltage. Rather than going with the 18V X2 platform, they stick with just 18V. And that\u2019s not an issue at all.\nThe trimmer\u2019s 3/4-inch knives are on par with what many cordless models have, though some are moving up to 1-inch gaps or a little more. However, its 4400 SPM stroke rate is quite a bit higher than most of the competition that tends to be in the 3000\u20133500 SPM range.\nThis Makita 18V cordless hedge trimmer also has 3 speed modes to work with\u20142000, 3600, and 4400 SPM. Low is good for when you\u2019re doing some light trimming and want to conserve your battery. Medium matches the high speed of most of Makita\u2019s competition and high lets you fly through your trimming duties quicker than other most other cordless models.\nI prefer to use it at high speed. I get plenty of runtime to get all of the hedges done on one charge and the faster cutting helps get done faster so I can move onto other important work\u2014like making sure somebody keeps the bass on their toes!\nOne thing I notice is that there\u2019s very little vibration and noise when I\u2019m trimming, even for a cordless hedge trimmer. It\u2019s not an accident and Makita builds in specific vibration controls that you don\u2019t see on some of the other models out there.\nMakita Cordless Hedge Trimmer Design\nWeight and Balance\nThe latest Makita cordless hedge trimmer uses just one 18V battery instead of two to get its outstanding performance. It\u2019s interesting that they go with a side entry instead of a rear entry, but it doesn\u2019t seem to affect the balance in a negative way at all.\nBalance is dead level on the guide handle without a battery and slightly to the rear with a 5.0 Ah pack. The 30-inch model likely has a more neutral balance with its longer blade.\nOur scales show the full weight with 5.0 Ah battery at 9.2 pounds\u2014pretty light in the professional cordless sector and 2-1/2 pounds lighter than the XHU04 with its 18V X2 configuration.\nRotating Handle\nThe Makita XHU07T includes a 5-position rotating handle. A simple push-down thumb lever releases it to let you maintain a more natural position when you\u2019re trimming the sides of any hedges.\n3-Stage Trigger Safety\nMakita adds a power button to its trigger safety system. Just hold it down for one second to activate it. After 1 minute of non-use, it shuts itself off.\nThe rest of the safety systems are pretty standard. A safety on top of the handle mechanically locks out the trigger and the final one is on the guide handle, ensuring you have to use two hands when you\u2019re working.\nMakita sees the majority of their users take an overhand grip to their hedge trimmers, so the guide handle safety pushes in toward the blade. I initially wanted to argue for a different placement because I like an underhand grip. But the more I used it, the more I realized I use an overhand grip the majority of the time as well.\nReverse?\nReverse doesn\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense on a hedge trimmer since it\u2019s a reciprocating motion. But jam the blades on a branch that\u2019s a little too thick and Makita\u2019s makes a lot of sense. It makes a quick reverse movement and stops, letting you release the branch before continuing on your merry way.\nWhen 24 Inches Isn\u2019t Enough\nYou have a couple of options when it comes to the blade length for the Makita 18V cordless hedge trimmer. The Makita XHU07T (or Z for the bare tool) comes with a 24-inch blade. The XHU08T has a 30-inch blade. The rest of the tool is the same and you can swap the blades out if you like.\nMakita 18V Cordless Hedge Trimmer Price\nAs a bare tool, the Makita XHU07 runs $249 and it\u2019s $389 as a kit with two 5.0 Ah batteries and a Rapid Optimum Charger. The 30-inch XHU08 is about $20 more.\nCordless hedge trimmer pricing is all over the map along with features and performance. The differences are so great, that there\u2019s not a really great way to compare this Makita cordless hedge trimmer to others in such a short space. But you can check out some of those in more detail at OPE Reviews\u2019 hedge trimmer shootout!\nThe Bottom Line\nDrawing on its deep history in gas equipment and cordless tools, Makita scores a huge win with its latest 18V cordless hedge trimmer. It significantly drops the weight down from the 18V X2 model while putting some serious distance on their competition in cutting speed. Combine that with a feature set that makes your job easier and the Makita XHU07T and XHU08T are very easy to recommend.\nMakita 18V Cordless Hedge Trimmer Specifications\n- Model: Makita XHU07T\n- Battery: 18V LXT Lithium-Ion\n- Strokes Per Minute: 4,400 SPM\n- Blade Length: 24 inches\n- Length: 44-1/4 inches\n- Weight: 7.8 lbs, 9.2 lbs with battery\n- Warranty: 3 years limited\n- Price: $389 .00"

The EGO\u2019s brushless motor enhances efficiency and run time, suitable for prolonged and intensive use, while Black & Decker\u2019s model provides reliable performance for standard home gardening tasks.\nEGO\u2019s trimmer is part of a broader battery system, offering versatility for users with multiple EGO tools, whereas Black & Decker\u2019s trimmer, though more budget-friendly, is limited to its included battery. In essence, the EGO HT2411 is ideal for heavy-duty, regular use in larger or more varied landscapes, while the Black & Decker LHT2436 caters well to routine domestic gardening with its user-friendly design and lower cost.\nMaintenance Tips for EGO Power+ HT2411 Hedge Trimmer\n1. Cleaning Your Hedge Trimmer Blade\nFor the cleaning process, you will need a soft brush, resin solvent, and dry cloths. These tools are essential for effectively removing dirt, debris, and sticky substances from the hedge trimmer blades without causing damage.\nCautionary Measures\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember never to use water for cleaning your hedge trimmer, as moisture can damage the electrical components and lead to rust formation on the blades. Also, solvents should be kept away from plastic parts of the trimmer to prevent any potential damage.\nCleaning Process\n- Start by ensuring the hedge trimmer is powered off and the battery is removed to eliminate the risk of accidental starting. This step is critical for safe cleaning.\n- Using dry cloths, wipe away any surface dirt, dust, oil, and grease from the blade. This action helps prevent the buildup of grime and maintains the blade\u2019s sharpness.\n- Employ a soft brush to gently clear out debris from the air intakes and the cutting blade. Pay particular attention to the spaces between the blade\u2019s teeth where debris commonly accumulates.\n- To tackle pitch and sticky residue, spray the blades with a resin solvent. This solvent is specifically designed to dissolve sap and other sticky materials without harming the blade\u2019s metal surface.\n- Reinsert the battery briefly and activate the motor. This short run helps distribute the solvent evenly across the blade, ensuring a comprehensive cleaning effect.\n- After removing the battery again for safety, give the blade a final wipe with a dry cloth. This last step ensures all solvent and residue are completely removed, leaving the blade clean and functional for its next use.\n2. Sharpening Your Hedge Trimmer Blade\nFor sharpening the blade, you\u2019ll need a clamp or vice to secure the trimmer during the process and a file or grinder suitable for the blade material. It\u2019s important to consult the trimmer\u2019s manual to determine the right type of file or grinder to use.\nCautionary Measures\nRegular sharpening is crucial to prevent the trimmer from operating with dull or damaged blades, which can lead to overloading and poor cutting performance. Some hedge trimmer blades may require a diamond file for effective sharpening. Additionally, when using a grinder, it\u2019s essential to keep the blade teeth cool with water to prevent overheating and damage.\nSharpening Process\n- Begin by starting and stopping the hedge trimmer to offset the cutter blade and the guard, creating enough space to file between the cutter and guard teeth comfortably.\n- Always remove the battery pack from the hedge trimmer before proceeding to prevent any accidental starts during the sharpening process.\n- Firmly clamp the blade assembly in your vice on the workbench. This stabilizes the trimmer, allowing for precise sharpening of each blade tooth.\n- Carefully file the exposed cutting surface of each blade tooth, aiming to remove as little material as necessary. Maintain the original angle of each tooth to preserve the blade\u2019s effectiveness and ensure uniform sharpness.\n- After sharpening one side of the blade, remove the trimmer from the clamp to access the unsharpened side. You may need to briefly reinsert the battery and activate the trimmer to offset the teeth for better access.\n- With the battery removed again, re-clamp the trimmer and sharpen the remaining unsharpened blade teeth. Follow the same careful process to ensure all teeth are uniformly sharpened.\n3. Lubricating Your Hedge Trimmer\nFor lubricating your hedge trimmer, you will need suitable lightweight oil. This oil is crucial for maintaining the smooth operation of the blades and ensuring their longevity.\nCautionary Advice\nIt\u2019s imperative to lubricate the hedge trimmer blade with lightweight machine oil before and after each use to guarantee optimal performance and extend the blade life. Never attempt to lubricate the hedge trimmer while it\u2019s connected to the battery or while it\u2019s running. Some hedge trimmer models might require a more robust lubricant, especially for the gear case, so it\u2019s essential to refer to your manual for the specific type of lubricant needed.\nLubricating the Blade\n- Ensure the hedge trimmer is powered off and remove the battery pack to prevent accidental activation.\n- Lay the trimmer flat on a stable surface. Apply a thin stream of lightweight machine oil along the edge of the top blade, ensuring even coverage across the length of the blade.\n- Manually move the blades back and forth (with the battery still removed) to distribute the oil evenly between the blade teeth, ensuring comprehensive lubrication.\nLubricating the Gear Case (if applicable)\n- First, remove the battery to ensure safety. Locate and unscrew the sealing screws to access the gear case oil hole.\n- Using a grease gun or similar tool, inject the special grease into the gear case through the oil-hole. Be careful not to overfill; just enough grease should be applied to ensure smooth operation without causing excess buildup.\n- Once lubricated, replace the sealing screws and ensure the gear case is securely closed to prevent leakage or contamination.\nConclusion: A Solid Investment\nOverall, the EGO Power+ HT2411 24-inch Brushless Hedge Trimmer stands out for its innovative design, robust performance, and user-friendly features.

The CRAFTSMAN V20* Cordless 2-in-1 Hedge Trimmer and Grass Shear (CMCSS800) steps in when precision is your number one priority. We\u2019re teaming up with CRAFTSMAN to tell you more about it.\nPrecision Cutting with the CRAFTSMAN V20* Cordless 2-in-1 Hedge Trimmer and Grass Shear\nYour standard hedge trimmer is capable of getting your hedges back into shape. The CRAFTSMAN V20* Cordless 2-in-1 Hedge Trimmer and Grass Shears make detailing a breeze.\nThe 8-inch Hedge Trimmer blade works great for detailing your smaller shrubbery where you don\u2019t need the reach of a long hedge trimmer blade. It can certainly help you keep that boxwood border looking pristine.\nSwitching to the 4-inch grass shear, the shorter blade lets you trim fescues and clean up garden beds giving your lawn area a nice finish.\nNo matter which blade you\u2019re using, it\u2019s about finesse over sheer power and the max capacity is 5/16-inch.\nSwitching Blades on the CRAFTSMAN CMCSS800\nSwitching blades on the CRAFTSMAN CMCSS800 V20* Cordless 2-in-1 Hedge Trimmer and Grass Shear is a simple, tool-free process. After removing the battery, flip the trimmer over, push the gray button forward, and lift the cover from the back. Once you have it off, align the pins with the blade you want to install and set the cover back in place. Re-insert the battery, and you\u2019re ready to trim!\nThere is some grease for lubrication under the cover, so keep a shop towel nearby in case you need to wipe off your fingers.\nCompact Grass Shear and Hedge Trimmer Sheds Size and Weight\nA big part of what helps you perform accurate trimming is the shorter length. The tool measures only 21-3/8 inches long with the hedge trimmer and 15-1/8 inches with the grass shear.\nIn addition to its short length and maneuverability, another great benefit of this design involves just how lightweight the tool is. With the 1.5Ah battery included in the kit loaded, the hedge trimmer weighs 3.4 pounds. Configured as a cordless grass shear, it drops to just 3.0 pounds.\nCRAFTSMAN V20* Cordless 2-in-1 Hedge Trimmer and Grass Shear Price\nWith the tool\u2019s combination of compact length and light weight, this 2-in-1 makes precise trimming easy to get right. Even better, it doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg.\nYou can find this hybrid grass shear/trimmer at Lowe\u2019s for $79.96. The kit includes everything you need to get started: the tool, grass shear blade, hedge trimmer blade, 1.5Ah V20* battery, and charger.
