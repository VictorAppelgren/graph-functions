      "summary": "India, ASEAN, and Latin America are projected to drive growth in the light commercial vehicle and truck market in 2025, buoyed by stronger macroeconomics and improving business sentiment. The global market, however, is expected to decline, especially in medium‑heavy trucks, due to oversupply, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and tariff uncertainty. Counter‑tariffs and delayed U.S. EPA EV regulations may further dampen demand, particularly in North America and Europe, while emerging markets mitigate the overall downturn.",
