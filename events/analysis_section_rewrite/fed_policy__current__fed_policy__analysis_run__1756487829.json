Fed signals no cut or a hike → spx down 1‑2 %.  \n     2. New semiconductor tariff → spx down 1‑2 %.  \n     3. Key tech earnings miss → spx down 0.5‑1 %.  \n   - Specify how each trigger would alter the forecast.\n\n5. **Avoid Drift**  \n   - Remove any mention of unrelated assets (e.g., “AI infrastructure” or “crypto” unless directly tied to spx).  \n   - Keep focus on spx, Fed policy, tariffs, and earnings.\n\n6. **Formatting & Length**  \n   - Condense to a single paragraph (≈ 120‑150 words).  \n   - Use bullet points only for the risk list; otherwise keep narrative concise.\n\n**Revised Paragraph (example)**  \n> The S&P 500 (spx) sits at a fresh all‑time high of 6,501.86, driven by a Q2 GDP revision to +3.3 % q/q (VDO8D9T7M, QJEVQZHQR) and falling initial jobless claims (VDO8D9T7M). Earnings from Snowflake, Datadog and Pure Storage lifted the index, while Hormel and Nvidia’s disappointments added volatility (EIGII8HNM). Treasury yields eased to 4.209 % on the 10‑year UST (VDO8D9T7M) and 2.679 % on the Bund (VDO8D9T7M), reflecting a hawkish backdrop that still leaves room for a 25‑bp Fed cut (90 % probability) at the Sept 16‑17 FOMC (D0R3LX8F7, XHDE9MSFQ). Trump’s threat to raise semiconductor tariffs (VDO8D9T7M) adds upside‑down risk.  \n> **Catalyst window (0‑3 wk):** Sept 16‑17 FOMC, core‑PCE release early Sept, final Q2 earnings.  \n> **Forecast:** If a cut materializes, spx could rise 0.5‑1 % (≈ +30‑60 pts); if Fed stays hawkish or tariffs tighten, spx could fall 1‑2 % (≈ ‑60‑120 pts).  \n> **Invalidation triggers:** Fed signals no cut or a hike; new semiconductor tariff; key tech earnings miss.  \n\nFollow these edits to meet the Argos standards.",
