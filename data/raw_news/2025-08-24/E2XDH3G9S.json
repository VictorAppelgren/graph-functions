  "content": "Live from Singapore. This is inside with Haslinda Amin, where we dive deeper into the stories that matter with crucial context and sharp analysis. Investors await the Trump. Zelensky talks in Washington for clues on market direction after the US-Russia summit ended without new sanctions or oil trade restrictions. The Ukrainian president, facing a tough choice, risk Trump's anger or accept a deal that creates land for a vague security promise, raising fears of future Russian aggression. American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Dalibor Ro Hogg joins us with his view that Trump's current plan may empower Putin while sidelining Ukraine and Europe. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in India today as the two countries get friendlier in the face of Trump's tariff attacks and thawing ties between the two most populous nations are getting investors excited. Ten Caps co-founder Jun Liu joins us with her insights. Investors looking to Donald Trump's talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies for direction this after the US Russia talks ended without any geopolitical escalation, easing concerns of energy supply disruptions. Zelensky is gearing up for another critical face to face with President Trump. He's headed to Washington this Monday, flanked by several European leaders as Trump sets out the terms for a potential peace deal he discussed earlier with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump posting on social media ahead of the meeting that Zelensky can end the war with Russia almost immediately or he can continue to fight. Sources say while the US is expected to focus on territorial concessions demanded by Russia, Kiev will seek to pin down possible security guarantees. It's important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine and where it's harmful to the United States and to the president for such a signal. It's the beginning of Russia's brutal invasion. Europe has been at Ukraine's side. United And we will support you for as long as it takes for a just and lasting peace. And this peace must be achieved through strength. Let's get perspective from Dalibor Ruggeri, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Taliban. Good to have you with us. We heard from Trump who says Zelensky can end the war almost immediately. You get a sense that according to him, the onus is on Zelensky to accept the terms laid out by Putin. But it really is an extraordinary development because for weeks and weeks we've been hearing about how President Trump was running out of patience with the Russians. On August 1st, he called the Russian strikes against Ukrainian cities despicable. He talked about a 15 day ultimatum to Russia, then about an eight day ultimatum to Russia and going into the Alaska summit. He said that unless he could secure an immediate cease fire, there would be severe consequences for for Russia. Yet Vladimir Putin offered nothing in terms of concessions, nothing in terms of constructive proposals to end the war. He just regurgitated his maximalist demands. And yet now the U.S. president seems to be under his spell, putting the onus on Ukraine and and the Europeans, as you as you put it. And that really puts Ukraine and Europe into a into a hot spot, thinking that perhaps the United States is no longer the guarantor of European security, no longer a trustworthy partner, but an emerging ally of of the Russian war effort. So not a great starting point for Zelensky when it comes to this Monday meeting. Doesn't matter whether or not he has the European leaders on his side, how much room to do to maneuver to to actually negotiate times. I mean, the real question for President Zelensky and for the European leaders is whether the U.S. approach is really set in stone, whether this is the the course that the U.S. administration is going to be following or whether there is any room for changing hearts and minds. Because it is very easy to demonstrate that making concessions to Putin, trying to appease Putin, trying to push Ukraine into an unfavorable deal that only enables pushing to rearm and restart the war few years down the line is not in the U.S. interest, even not in the personal interest of Donald Trump, who a few months ago negotiated this minerals deal with Ukraine and basically giving away Ukraine's land to Russia jeopardises that very deal. So in the end, will it be about security guarantees? I mean, when you take a look at the battlefield, it is not working in Ukraine's favor. Russia is making inroads, albeit slowly, slowly, but it is. Ukraine is not winning in any way. Well, I would challenge that premise, to be honest. I mean, Russia went into this full scale invasion in 2022 with the ambition of taking over Ukraine. And that has really gone terribly wrong for for Russia. And the front lines have been stable. Obviously, there is a lot of bloodshed. There is the constant pounding of of Ukrainian cities. But the sort of small breakthroughs that happened along the frontline in Donetsk are far from being kind of operationally or or strategically important for for Russia. So the idea that Ukraine is somehow losing the war, whereas it is Russia that started this conflict with really maximalist expectations, maximalist objectives and has failed to achieve those objectives and has suffered a terrible, terrible human toll. I don't think that's quite quite the right framing in the end. It will be the Ukraine, it will be Ukraine itself that will be its own best security guarantee going forward, I suspect. All the security guarantees Enough. We heard from Steve Whitcomb saying that Russia has agreed to such tasks. But is that enough for Zelensky? Look, if you look at it from the European perspective right now, there is a, you know, debate taking place about whether Article five guarantees and whether by the nature of itself provides for sufficient security guarantees to two countries on NATO's eastern flank. So the idea that a piece of paper that would be signed by President Trump and maybe other other Western leaders would provide sufficient guarantees for for for the Ukrainians, I think is is fanciful. Ukraine already has security guarantees from 1994, from the Budapest Memorandum. And obviously. Paperwork and signed documents do not provide deterrent for us in their own right and right now. And the strongest security guarantee that Ukraine has is the determination of the Ukrainian nation and the skills of the Ukrainian defense forces and the successes that they have have shown on the battlefield defending their country against the Russian invaders. So what now then? Deliver. If security guarantees are not good enough for Zelensky and Putin isn't likely to give him any more than what he's laid out to Trump. Where do we go from here? What's next? What happens? I mean, the US administration has ample space to put pressure on Russia to put really debilitating sanctions on the Russian economy. There is the Grand Blumenthal bill awaiting passage in the Senate that would sanction the purchases of Russian oil and gas worldwide. There are other tools in the hands of the administration, including enforcement of existing sanctions, including lethal aid to Ukraine. There is no reason why Russia, an economy of the size of Italy's, should be holding the whole world hostage. But if that's not the path taken by by the administration, by President Trump, I think the ball will be in the court of of the Ukrainians and of Europeans. And I very much hope for the sake of the Western alliance and for the sake of democracy in Ukraine and in Europe, that the Europeans and the Ukrainians will be able to sustain this this defense effort and will not yield to the to the pressure and to the to the bullying that is now coming both from Moscow and apparently from Washington. The thing is delivered. There is no reason to think that Russia or rather the US will impose new sanctions when the old sanctions, the original sanctions have not been implemented well. And we saw at the meeting in Alaska how President Trump actually late the red carpet allowed Putin to ride in the beast. So there's really no sense that the U.S. is willing to take the hard stance. And again, that's something that makes the whole situation extraordinary. Donald Trump said that he would know within 2 minutes of meeting Vladimir Putin, but Putin was serious about trying to achieve peace. He promised that he would push Russia to agree to a cease fire in that meeting, otherwise there would be severe consequences. And yet Russia agreed to none of that. And there is no pressure coming out of Washington. And I'm afraid to say that there is really makes President Trump look weak in the eyes of the world. Look smoke, look at him as somebody who is not credible on the world stage who, you know, must like. Republicans were complaining about President Obama's unenforced red lines in in Syria. I mean, this is, you know, 100 times worse because the geopolitical stakes are just so much higher. At the crux of it, a land swap. What do you see happening here? Do you see Russia getting what it wants, getting Ukraine to withdraw from the region? It's an interesting word, used land swaps, because I've yet to hear about the land that Russia is offering to Ukraine in exchange for for the territory it is asking Ukraine to see through to Russia. Obviously, this whole pressure on Ukraine to see territory basically involves rewarding Putin for for it's his aggression against Ukraine by giving him land. He has not been able to take over militarily. I'm trying to, you know, award him these lands at the negotiating table, essentially in exchange for nothing. And so I don't think that's a viable proposition for any Ukrainian politician, and I don't think it should be a viable proposition for anybody who cares about peace and security in Europe. It's been the case since 1945. The borders in Europe have not been revised, changed by force. And it's been the United States in part that's been a guarantor of this of this of this order, of this of this basic rule of of conduct. And if tomorrow brings an abrupt end to that system, I think it would be really bad news for everybody in Europe and beyond, including in in countries of Asia. So Dalibor After a ten minute conversation, I get that we're not seeing lance swaps, we're not seeing security guarantees. So we won't be seeing that meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelensky. Well, one thing we will be seeing, I think, is, is Ukraine an agency? Ukraine has demonstrated that it is a viable country that cares about its own self determination, that is willing to fight for it, for its future and for its freedom. And I don't think great powers can't be England in the sort of 19th century colonial manner are going to change that. And that is something that gives me hope not just for Ukraine, but also for Europe and for the future of of of the rules based international order, if you will. What do you make of the pursuit of an agreement without first getting a cease fire? That seems to be what Trump is pushing for. Well, Donald Trump originally pushed for a cease fire. Then he saw President Putin for 2 hours and basically endorsed the Russian rhetoric about seeking the end to the war through a peace agreement, which would supposedly address what the Russians called the root causes of this war. But the root cause of this war is not that Russia would not have enough land and would need land in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Ukraine. The root cause of this war is this idea that Putin has in his head that he has the same place in Russian history as Peter the Great and Stalin, that he is to recreate the Russian Empire by by conquering Ukraine. And and unless he is disabused of the notion, I don't think we are able to arrive at a definitive resolution of this of this conflict. Is there anything, any role Natal can play, a productive role that Natal can play at this stage? Well, NATO has been vitally important in coordinating the efforts to help Ukraine militarily. The Ramstein meetings involve NATO allies in various various formats. Eventually, should this war come to an end with Ukraine still intact, I think NATO's would provide the obvious security framework for Ukraine to do to to be protected against future Russian aggression. NATO's deterrent works on the on the eastern flank, much as is being questioned now. Or rather, U.S. commitment to the alliance is being questioned. But as of now, nobody is talking about bringing NATO's into the conflict in an open and direct way. Nobody is calling for U.S. or Western European boots on the ground in Ukraine. I mean, it is the Ukrainians who are doing the fighting. All they're asking the West to do is to support them in their effort through military assistance and through effective sanctions. And right now, I'm afraid to say that the U.S. administration is is failing them on both counts. But you got to wonder how China's looking at it, how North Korea may be looking at it, and what some of the messaging they may be getting from what's happening in Ukraine right now. Well, I think the Chinese are certainly looking at, you know, how serious and determined the United States is to stand by its prior commitment and its relevance, obviously, in Taiwan and the Philippines for other Indo-Pacific allies. And I think it's also many other countries that would have quasi imperial ambitions and or would harbor grievances about unfair borders around the world that might be looking at the situation and they might be wondering whether they might not be able to get away with more than what they have thought thus far. And and I think in the world in which Russia is able to grab a piece of Ukraine and then have it ratified by by the world's leading power is a world that will be fundamentally more unstable and dangerous and conflict ridden than the one that I grew up with that I took for granted until recently. Talib Art, thank you so much for your perspective today. Liberal hard senior fellow at American Enterprise Institute. Now President Trump says he's holding off on raising tariffs on Chinese goods over the country's purchases of Russian oil. That's after citing progress made with Vladimir Putin during the summit in Alaska. Trump earlier this month had threatened buyers of Russian energy with additional tariffs as a means of pressurising Putin into peace talks with Ukraine. China and India are by far the two biggest buyers of Russian crude. Trump has already announced his doubling duties on Indian products to 50%. But raising tariffs on China would risk breaking a trade truce that he's agreed to extend for another 90 days. However, Trump's tariff pressure on China and India are helping forge stronger ties between the world's two most populous countries. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is visiting New Delhi today, making his first trip to the country in over three years. For more on this, our government reporter today, Ranjan sen joins us live from new delhi. Sorry, it does look like trump is forcing the saw in bilateral ties. Well, I mean, yes and no at the same point of time, the fact that the US has become a US policy is becoming very and I think is something that is playing on the minds of Indian policymakers and is largely or partly responsible for the poor that we have seen. Having said that, this, however, is, you know, started before Trump came into office for the second time in January this year. The India and China, as you know, started or look, you know, starting to look at normalizing relations from last year. And the big breakthrough that we saw was both sides pulling back troops from the disputed parts of the border. And then the then prime minister, Narendra modi and President Xi Jinping meeting in Kazan last year, setting the ball rolling. But definitely, yes, the tariffs, the you know, the threat of penalties for buying Russian energy has added a lot of more urgency to normalise the relationship, to get the relationship back to a working order where both sides, if not pre 2020, when the border skirmish happened to two levels of that, but to some, you know, some level of normalcy where trade people to people connect can start once again. What are the priorities of this meeting? Well, to begin with, this is going to be a very important meeting. And the reason why we think it is going to be very important is this is the meeting that is basically setting the tone for Prime Minister Modi to meet his counterpart, President Xi, later in the month. And much of what is going to be discussed and therefore agreed upon is going to be discussed here, both at the level of the national security adviser and with the foreign minister. For the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi is both meeting Ajit Doval and Jaishankar. So, so much of the much of the policy, so much of the discussion, you know, the announcements, how far both sides will go, how far both sides will normalize and get back. A working relationship is going to be decided in these meetings. Soon. He talked to us about the paradox of China India relations. I mean, as you mentioned, there are lots of areas that both sides can work and cooperate on, but they are constrained by unresolved tensions between the two sides as well. Well, it's, you know, definitely it because there is a sense of, you know, a trust deficit that is that was there. And, you know, and that has been deepened because of the border skirmish. And this is this is the border skirmish, which, you know, was the worst that we have seen in the last four decades. Soldiers died, which never had happened earlier, except for the 1962 India, China war. So a lot of a lot of trust needs to be built on top of that. There have been instances where India has complained about Chinese predatory, you know, commercial, you know, methods and tactics, those that come at a level after once, you know, the two countries have kind of settled all feel comfortable again at the borders. So, you know, it's a long way to walk, but the beginning of that has already started. But to be sure, India needs China in a huge way as Modi aims to be a manufacturing hub for the world. It does need all the raw materials from China. It does. It does. And despite the fact that, you know, India has been discouraging Chinese investment since the border skirmish, India pegging the entire relationship to peace on the border. If you've heard Foreign Minister Jaishankar repeatedly say that the relationship was not normal. Of course, this was prior to, you know, a meeting between the two two leaders. We have seen him repeatedly saying the relationship is not normal. And you know, what happens on the border affects the overall relationship. But having said that, we have seen senior members of the government go out and back openly for Chinese investments into India, indicating that there is a very strong, you know, section in the government or there is a large section of the government, which is things that Chinese investments is necessary and India should go for it. Zuhdi, thank you for that. Glenn Beck, Government reporter, City Region Center in New Delhi. Still ahead this hour, we'll talk global market risks from the Ukraine peace talks to President Trump's tariff deals with ten CAP co-founder John Bailey. Keep it here with us. This is. Welcome back. You're watching INSIGHT. Here are some of the top global stories we're tracking. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have rallied amid a nationwide strike demanding an end to the war in Gaza and a deal with Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Organizers of the biggest protests in Tel Aviv say half a million people gathered in what's now known as hostage square. Netanyahu's government this month gave the army the green light to take control of the de facto capital in Gaza City and crush Hamas holdouts. China is escalating its trade fight with Canada filing a WTO complaint of Ottawa's steel tariffs and quotas. Beijing calls the measures typical trade protectionism after also slapping duties in Canadian canola. Tensions have grown since Canada moved against Chinese steel, aluminum and electric vehicles. Ottawa says it's protecting domestic producers hurt by U.S. tariffs. The U.K., Japan, South Korea and the EU are among U.S. trading partners waiting for Washington to deliver on that promise. Tariff concessions. U.K. steel lobbyists worry the commodity has slipped in priority for President Trump and promised a customer. Meanwhile, Japan's top negotiator says the bleeding hasn't stopped for its auto sector, urging the White House to implement that deal. South Korean carmakers are facing similar strain as they wait for the trade deal announced on July 31st to become a reality. And EU chief Ursula von der Leyen is also awaiting the enforcement of an all inclusive 15% tariff on European goods. Three weeks after it was announced, let's bring in John Bailey, the co-founder and lead portfolio manager at ten CAP. Jim, you got to imagine that traders have already looked past tariffs and perhaps even the situation in Ukraine. Now the attention shifts to Jackson Hole. Yeah, absolutely. Look. Hi. Thank you for having me. Look, um. Look, you know, equity market has been really resource resilient, and then the investors are being very, very pragmatic. And now that seems to that we are now, you know, gradually getting different trade deals. And with China there's truce and then, you know, this extension seems to be making the right step, and that's good enough for the investors. And then Jackson Hole, of course, it seems to be now what everyone's talking about, what does that mean for, you know, for for for the path and the toll, whether it's dovish, whether it's hawkish. I think, you know, taking a step back, I don't think that's an event that you get a lot of information. All we know is that, you know, inflation is on the way down and that there will be rate cuts. And increasingly there's more expectation for, you know, the almost 90% probability of a cut in September. We think there's a few more to come later this year. So I look at all that together is bode pretty well for the equity market and for investor confidence. So the S & P can grind higher, can test new highs from here. Look, we do think so, but that's not to say that we won't have any volatilities. You know, in general, if you look at the equity markets, seasonality is the August normally is the softer month and the heading to September is a bit softer and then we rally into the year ends. But this year, of course, August, it's actually been pretty good. It's partly because the economic reality, as we said, is actually not as bad as we expect and inflation is not as bad. The the pickup of inflation as a result to trade hasn't been as bad. And so we've seen the market is being supported at the same time. At the same time, we also have this rate cut to underpin the valuation, to underpin the investor confidence and financial liquidity. So, you know, so so sort of we seen a bit of positivity and grinding higher. But look, if there's any time that we do have equity market volatility or sell off, it's absolutely a buying opportunity. Investors should be buying on the tape, you know, if it should that happen. The thing is, we're all waiting for the tariffs to bite. And if you take a 12 month period, would you agree that U.S. stocks will get hit more than the others because of the pain the US economy is likely to feel versus the international economy? Mm. Look, to be honest, we were we were thinking that, look, many investors thought that, you know, three, three month ago, four months ago, when Fritz was the trade discussions taking started taking place. Hence why the sell off across the US stocks in tech. But since then, we've seen this remarkable pickup and also incredible resilience in the US economy. And, you know, we've yet to see, you know, the really significant inflation pick up there in the US. So look, I'll be holding back, but you know, technically you should see improvement in other markets or the outperformance of other markets relative to the US. We do think for the next 12 month, however, you will see this rotation from, you know, a lot of, you know, yesterday's winner. It will be moving, you know, will probably become the funder. So US equities potentially could become the funder for every other economy. We have so far, seeing a lot of outperformance out of emerging economies and China and others despite all that trade uncertainty. So, you know, we do think that there's a level of rotation to come through, but we still think the US market probably will go on higher too, given how resilient it's been. The thing is, sentiment will be driven by what comes out of Jackson Hole. What kind of messaging are you expecting from Jerome Powell? Look, I think he will continue the current trajectory of war or what he has been saying, that essentially it will be data driven. They will wait and see. However, you know, the data has come through a little worse than expected. So we do think the rate cut is on the cards. But I don't think he'll will change the trajectory. I don't think he will in a rush to become very dovish because they want to see, you know, what the trade deal finally looks like and what its impact be. I don't think they want to be preempting some of those weaknesses to shoot. So what how were you positioned for for what's what's to come? Which assets are you attracted to right now? Look, I think, you know, for me, equity market is the best place to make great returns. And as a manager, you know, this is a you know, you can control your risk and that this is a fantastic environment for us. So we do think, though, as I mentioned before, next 12 months, you know, you are looking you need to look for sectors that will benefit from a cyclical upswing because we got the rate cut around the world to taking place and the US and an emerging economy. And that kind of support will support the valuation and the cyclical upswing. We are seeing, you know, early stage of that rotation taking place in the last few months, particularly this reporting season in the US. You've seen some of the more expensive sort of more defensive, you know, parts of the market being sold off as investor taking, taking profit and putting into more cyclical part and smaller companies as well, simply because next month the earnings will do better. As you know, interest rate cut take place. We've seen in the US, the homebuilders having a massive rally, even though, you know, underlying fundamentals still pretty poor. So, look, I do think that, you know, this is where you go into smaller going to more cyclical. You know, your growth leader is still great, spending is still there. But, you know, I just think that some of them start really well, it's time to move into some of the other space that you can make lots of money. And how are you thinking about Chinese stocks? Because they've been pretty late last year, even though they haven't been touched by sanctions much. If you take a look at how the stocks have been doing, only about 9% of the stocks have actually tested new highs. Mhm. That's right. I think Chinese stores still look pretty reasonable value when you compare to some of their global or Western peers. So, you know, it's partly because as you mentioned, the economy is still coming out of it. And you know, even despite all the continuous stimulus, the consumer is, you know, only gradually coming out of, you know, what was a very patchy, very, very tough few years. So however, we do think that with, you know, with the government ready to pull the trigger on the stimulus, once the outcome of the trade negotiation is decided, you know, we do think it will be those sectors, particularly consumer sectors. It will be very, very interesting and I think they will continue to recover. You know, these sectors we've seen around the world coming out of COVID and others all had a huge rally, whereas Chinese sector, they never did because the Chinese consumer has been doing it pretty tough. So next couple of years could be a huge tailwind for them to do significantly better than others. Do you see MAGA caps like Saiyami continue to grind higher. How much more upside might they see? Look, I think China equities at this stage looks pretty supported simply because that one is valuation and two is the cyclical upswing that we were talking to. You know, of course, what will happen with the final trade deal is going to determine their final performance. But to taking a step back, you know, these sectors, these companies tell me, has been underperforming for years relative to what's being traded with the Nasdaq. So, you know, so we do think there's a lot of opportunity I'd be staying with. And I do think that they are grinding higher. And Judy, even as you stay optimistic when it comes to Chinese stocks, what do you deem as the biggest risk for them? Oh, look, the biggest risk. Look, at this stage, it's very clear it is the trade. You know that the trade, if there is in the trade deal, if there's more escalation of trade, you know, true trade, tariff and and conflict, that's clearly, clearly going to put a huge dent on what is going to come. Market is taking the view at this point is the both country will be pragmatic as some sort of deal will come through and that that will be more reasonable than expected. So that that will be the biggest, biggest risk faced by the Chinese market at this stage. Now, going forward, though, you know, the the China does have quite a few sectors that's, you know, structurally challenge. And then with a housing sector and the like, a still seems to be struggling to really find its footing. So you know with the stimulus that's to come that's been rumoured again targeting a more consumer and smaller businesses. But that is just not enough. You know, we're still waiting to see what's going to really arrest and reform that whole housing market. Maybe enough because you will. Confidence is enough, but it just seems like that's a much bigger medium to a problem. Jin beI Hang tight Tan Cap co-founder and lead portfolio manager Jim Bellevue is sticking around in this hour, trading about 4 minutes from here. Let's take a look at what the opportunities are looking like for the Indian markets amid warming ties with China. India now just minutes away from that open the Sensex pointing to higher open up 9/10 of 1%. Remember that promise? Narendra modi is planning to cut tariffs on everyday goods, which could help soften the blow of potential US tariffs. It is pointing to a positive open. Keep it here with us. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. One consequence of this growing diplomatic rift with the US is a move closer to long standing rival China. And in today's taking stock shows, some Indian firms with links to China might see a resurgence thanks to those thawing relations. For more, let's bring in senior Asia equities reporter Abhishek Bishnoi. So you know where to look. Absolutely. And, you know, this is a set of companies which is possibly going to outperform, but it has started outperformers this week. It's not a new team. This was a team a you know, a before tariffs war started. I mean there were a lot of China linked companies consuming inputs partnerships, technology coming out of China and India. There were also companies backed by Chinese money. But, you know, at the bottom of it was this issue where the government is going to be friendlier towards such companies or otherwise friendlier towards Chinese goods and Chinese money. But now that it's an open, it looks like, you know, government has no qualms about, you know, receiving Chinese money. Government is okay as far as Chinese inputs are concerned. So all these sectors like pharmaceuticals, electronics, which have gained immensely from made in China, are going to benefit now from lower input cost. And there is an increase in comfort around companies which are partnering. Chinese companies are receiving money or investments from them now. And this is definitely a tailwind for this set of companies, but it does not solve India's problem. It's not a tailwind for the Indian market, which has been underperforming, which has its own set of issues. So is it broad based when you talk about pharmaceutical companies that might benefit manufacturing companies, even, you know, tourism related companies, are there specific companies which will likely benefit more than the others? Absolutely. And you know, the sector that you mentioned for us, pharmaceuticals, you know, probably going to benefit most. It's a well-known fact that, you know, after U.S., the most the highest number of US FDA approved plants are in China and India. So, you know, these two countries benefit a lot. We have seen a resurgence of, you know, innovation in China. Right. And something similar happened in India. But now, you know, given the the gates have been opened, you know, for Chinese and Indians to get closer further in terms of investments on other things, there are a lot of inputs which are essentially, you know, very cheaply available in China. So Indian companies would save on CapEx. Indian companies would save on their operational costs because they be importing those APIs or building blocks, as you know, pharmaceuticals to India. And then they'll be making those finished dosage formulations on drugs. So pharmaceuticals would gain electronics, would gain the same bam and bolt as used to, you know, get a lot of its parts made in China and then assemble a little bit in India. And then it was a made in India product. But now a lot of those companies would be very confident in importing those products. So these sector, these two sectors would definitely gain the most. But, you know, there are very, very big other sectors like industrials or, you know, banks and so much more in India. So it it won't become a big tailwind for India. Probably the bigger tailwind for India will now be the tax reforms that government is pushing. Right. The. We'll leave it there for the moment. Abhishek senior Asia equities reporter Abhishek Bishnoi there. Let's do a check on Indian markets right now. He's just kicked off its trading day. It is in the positive, the Sensex along with the other benchmarks. But bear in mind that it is from a lower basis and secondly up by more than 1%. India are doing much better than the rest of the Asian region at this point in time. Year to date, though, the Nifty is only up by 4%, the world index higher by 13% with at the same time frame. Let's get perspective. June value from ten CAP is still with us. Jan, but your thoughts on India. Are you still liking or, you know, just trepidation perhaps in view of the terrors that we're seeing? Look, I actually think the Indian market looks it looks very interesting now. If you remember 12 months ago, say 12 months ago, people couldn't get enough of Indian markets and they were trading on very hefty multiples. And, you know, just because the way it's a it's a it's a somewhat separate from Chinese economy and then it's got its own really strong growth drivers, a very tech bent and the like. And now because of tariffs, it's clearly now that we're seeing the market sort of staggered somewhat and lagged behind. You know, it does see, you know, create quite an interesting opportunity. You know, I talked to earlier about some of the sectors facing the closer link with China and the like. But I do think net net overall, the overall market is looking very interesting relative to others. We have seen this from other markets. When we talk about whenever there's a tariff, news headlines come through and the market gets sold off and then subsequently when we have better deals or when we actually have some certainty with the deal, we start seeing the market rally away from there. And it's every time it's proven to be a good buying opportunity. So I do think the India just from a top down, actually looks very interesting now. The thing is, the theme is a strong theme throughout the world. But when it comes to India, you can't really play the theme in India. And some perhaps say that that is detrimental to the outlook for for the market. Yeah, that's true. But they do have growing other sectors as well. And the remember in the economy is a somewhat it's a very, you know, very, very self-sufficient and and it's very, you know, very diverse. It creates that diversification for the global pool, for the global investor portfolio. If you look across the the Asian portfolio there, most of the economy is somewhat linked to what China is doing. Of course, you've got Japan and then you've got India on the side. It it is running a very different race now with with the I seems to be decoupling really driven into China. And then the more a more the NASDAQ the western pack. But I do think given the valuation, it does have its own, you know, the strength underneath. India versus China, which is more attractive convey. That's the perennial. You know me, No gods are really, you know me. Look, I think China represent incredible amount of opportunity. And, you know, it's some sector may look a little bit more expensive, but if you compare to what's happening globally, they look very, very attractive. China, though, the main not problem, the main risk, the challenges this they're you know, their tail risk every now and then becomes real. So you know, with China it kind of you need to be pragmatic Once you made your return, you do have to rotate into other sectors. And also China, you've got to invest with the government, not against it. So so there's a lot of things into invest in China, but I guess it's a similar to India. But just from this perspective, tactically at this point, I see the India looks quite attractive at the moment. How are you looking at the government's efforts to revive household confidence? It's been very challenging for the government and we know that Chinese consumers prefer to save than to spend, and that has been the problem for Xi Jinping. Look, I tell you exactly. And I do think, though, knowing being the Chinese myself, that, you know, Chinese people love to take our risks when they feel comfortable, they will take our risks. So look, the consumer participation or, you know, the retail participation of the share market, it's been actually quite incredible in recent months. You know, there's been a lot of retail investors or individual mums and dads now already coming back into the market in a big way. And in this is in China and the it is the institutional investor actually are selling the market, taking profit. So you know, that is usually a sign the consumer is feeling a bit more confident, a little bit better. This also coincides with, you know, improving confidence as you see some of the consumer, you know, sector's doing a little bit better, people spending on experiences and, you know, and, you know, the toys and the like. So, you know, so all that together, it does show Chinese consumer incredibly resilient. And and then the good sign is that they are finally coming around the corner doing a little bit that are still on the water, but doing a little bit better. And then with government continuously giving them, you know, more and more support to help them through, I do think that they they will you know, they they will increase their spend. Talking about support. How much support do you think emerging markets can get in the coming quarters, given the optimism around China as well as India? Yeah. Look, I think it's it really depends a little bit on what's going to be the narrative for the trade now, because the market, you know, we had a big or actually market has performed pretty well, both emerging economies and even across the developed economy as well. So we kind of need a bit more news flow just in terms of, you know, more solid, you know, story about more deal to be signed. What is the final detail. So for it to come through, to really have the next leg up, you know, I do think the market probably will be somewhat in the holding pattern and waiting for more news flow to come through. And once that we have more certainty, particularly of of course, the most important will be China in the US. And once we have more uncertainty, then the you know, the Chinese government have every likelihood will start pulling a trigger on the stimulus package. That is, you know, the right size, the for the the deal. And for most OEM's in Asia, a weaker dollar and cheaper oil would benefit them for the most part. Absent? Absolutely. It's all looking good. It is looking good indeed, Jim. Thank you, Jim Value co-founder and lead portfolio manager at ten CAP. Speaking of oil, let's take a look at how oil is trading at this point in time.

  "summary": "Investors are looking to Donald Trump's talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies after the US-Russia summit ended without new sanctions or oil trade restrictions. This comes as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in India as relations between the two countries improve despite Trump's tariff attacks. Observers suggest that Trump's current plan may empower Putin while sidelining Ukraine and Europe. While the US is expected to focus on territorial concessions demanded by Russia, Kiev will seek to secure possible security guarantees. This could raise fears of future Russian aggression. The question is whether the U.S. approach is set in stone or whether there is any room for change.",
