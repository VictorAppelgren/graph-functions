  "content": "Stay up to date on all gym stocks with Benzinga Pro, your go-to stock market research platform with real-time news and actionable insights.\n\nFitness has many benefits for the human body. It makes people stronger, happier and more confident. Fitness also gives investors an opportunity to grow their money through gym stocks. The fitness industry is expected to reach $434.74 billion in 2028, a figure that represents a 171% growth rate over five years. These investments allow investors to profit from people\u2019s desire to get fit and stay in shape. Some gym stocks have delivered exceptional returns over the years and provide good value propositions for new investors.\n\nQuick Look at the Top Gym Stocks:\n\nInvestors who want to strengthen their portfolios and flex their financial muscles may want to consider these top gym stocks.\n\nPlanet Fitness is an affordable gym chain with over 2,000 locations with memberships starting at $10 per month. Planet Fitness is one of the fastest-growing health club franchises in the U.S.\n\nLululemon Athletica specializes in fitness clothing and has rewarded long-term investors. Leadership believes the company is still in the early innings of its growth curve and has significant opportunities across categories, geographies and channels. Lululemon Athletica is focused on digital and retail growth.\n\nGarmin creates fitness devices that make it easier for athletes to optimize their performance. Garmin\u2019s smartwatches help runners track average mile paces, and the company\u2019s golf products can help you improve your swing. The company has additional fitness products and various products that stretch beyond health and fitness.\n\nLifetime Fitness has over 790,000 members. Total subscriptions are over 832,000 members. Bahram Akradi, the company\u2019s CEO, mentioned Lifetime Fitness is experiencing great momentum.\n\nBellring Brands creates convenient nutritious products for fitness enthusiasts. The company\u2019s products are available worldwide in food, drug, convenience, club, specialty, e-commerce and food service channels. Bellring Brands manages Premium Nutrition Company and Active Nutrition International.\n\nTechnogym produces fitness equipment and has been the official supplier to eight Olympic Games, including the Tokyo 2020 Games. The company was also recently confirmed to be the official supplier for the Paris 2024 Games.\n\nSkechers produces clothing and sneakers for fitness enthusiasts. SKX stock has a 19 P/E ratio, which gives it a lower valuation and better growth rates than competitors like Nike and Adidas.\n\nInvesting in gym stocks can help you diversify your portfolio and give you exposure to assets that benefit from the rising demand for gym memberships and fitness products. Many people want to get fit and stay in shape, and gyms help with those objectives. Investing in gym stocks allows you to profit from this rising demand. Fitness enthusiasts tend to purchase several products and hold onto their gym memberships for a while, creating predictable revenue models for some of these businesses.\n\nInvesting in gym stocks can increase your portfolio returns, but the broker you use also impacts your portfolio\u2019s gains. If you are still on the fence, you may want to invest in gym stocks with one of these top brokers.\n\nInvestors should consider several factors before buying stock, including gym stocks. These are some details to consider.\n\nInvestors should monitor trends in the health and fitness industry to gauge how gym stocks will perform. Current trends suggest the industry will grow over the next few years, but those trends can change at any time. Past performance is no guarantee of future success.\n\nFinancial Health of the Company\n\nInvestors should analyze a gym stock\u2019s balance sheet before investing in the company. Revenue growth, rising earnings and healthy profit margins are all good signs.\n\nInvestors should review a company\u2019s initiatives to see how they are planning for the future. Revenue and earnings deceleration can hurt a company\u2019s stock price in the long run. However, promising growth opportunities can generate high returns for investors.\n\nThe best gym stocks methodology involved finding stocks that benefit from the rising demand for fitness products and services. Profitability and long-term returns were considered as part of the methodology.",

      "text": "TradeZero is an online broker and free stock trading platform that provides everything you need to successfully share and trade, including round-the-clock customer support. TradeZero provides four different trading state-of-the-art software programs with its services, a locator for sourcing shares for shorting, commission-free trades, and real-time streaming, to name a few of the features promoted on their website. The software is a unique and (potentially) affordable option for anyone interested in stock trading.\n- 24/7 live customer support\n- Uses ZeroWeb technology, a powerful level 2 online platform with direct market access\n- Mobile app allows users to access stocks and trade in real-time while on the go\n- Enforces Pattern Day Trading restrictions (accounts need to maintain a daily equity balance of at least $25k)\n- Mobile app could offer more features\nTradeZero Ratings at a Glance\nWinner of Benzinga's 2021 FinTech Awards for Best Broker for Short Selling.\n- TradeZero Pricing\n- TradeZero Customer Service\n- TradeZero Mobile App\n- See All 10 Items\nTradeZero is a broker dealer based in New York and aims to provide stock and options trading services through a full suite of trading platforms. With features such as commission-free trading, real-time streaming on desktop and mobile platforms and a range of other comprehensive software options, TradeZero is the virtual broker that makes trading easy and efficient.\nUsers can choose from 1 of 3 TradeZero platforms: ZeroFree (free real-time trading option), ZeroWeb or ZeroPro, which are different tiers that offer specific features. With any of the three tiers, ZeroMobile is automatically included.\nTradeZero sets itself apart by offering commission-free trading.\nIt also offers 4 unique trading platforms that deliver the speed and functionality that active traders need. These include:\n- ZeroFree costs $0 per month\n- ZeroWeb costs $0 per month.\n- ZeroPro costs $59 per month\nZeroMobile is included with any of the above plans, and is a free add-on.\nIn addition, all orders with TradeZero are either free or paid. Free orders, of course, include $0 free limit orders, but the symbol must trade on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ and be greater than $1.\nPaid orders cost $.005 per share:\n- Less than 200 shares is $0.99 fee\n- Market orders or marketable limit orders on all stocks, ETFs and warrants on NYSE, NASDAQ and the AMEX are $0.005 per share with a minimum of $0.99\n- OTC/Pink Sheets above $1 trade between 9:30 AM to 4 PM ET are charged a $0.005 per share with a minimum of $0.99, and there is a $7.95 max charge up to 250k shares.\n- All equity securities below $1 traded between:\n- 4 AM to 7 AM ET for $0.005 per share with a $0.99 flat fee/minimum\n- 7 AM to 8 PM ET for $0.005 per share with a $0.99 flat fee/minimum and a $7.95 max charge up to 250k shares.\nAdditional paid options are available for those seeking more customized plans.\nTradeZero charges no inactivity fee for quarterly maintenance for accounts.\nGiven how convenient TradeZero\u2019s terms are, both of the paid software options and free software features are more than satisfactory for those who either anticipate frequent trades, or want to use the software with fewer features in exchange for more share flexibility.\nTradeZero offers 24/7 customer service via live webchat. Users of any software tier will always have access to quick and convenient support. Other options for reaching TradeZero customer support include phone (+1-877-4-TRADE-0) from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, as well as email (support@tradezero.us).\nThe TradeZero mobile app is available for both Android and iPhone and offers instant market data in real-time for users on the go. Access to the app is automatic for users of any of the three TradeZero tiers and allows:\n- Trading and locating stocks in real-time\n- Viewing real-time news\n- Options trading (coming soon)\n- Charting with indicators.\nOverall, the TradeZero mobile app is only somewhat functional for what it does, offering limited features. It\u2019s also not ideal for Pro members that the app extends the same number of features for those taking advantage of the free software as it does for paying users. This isn\u2019t a good deal for Pro members paying a high monthly fee for additional TradeZero services.\nThere are almost 3,000 reviews for the TradeZero software on TrustPilot, with the platform earning an overall rating of 4.6/5 (equating to an \u201cexcellent\u201d delineation). Among the favorable feedback includes consistent praise of the program\u2019s usability and customer service.\nHowever, some users did cite instances of technical difficulties and software bugs, which were promptly cleaned up with the help of the support team. Some users also noted that the UI could undergo some improvement to make it more aesthetically attractive.\nTradeZero earns a perfect rating when it comes to performance. The software provides a solid, reputable, easily-navigable platform for traders to stay on top of market trends and, well, trade. It\u2019s a good option for both experienced and new stock traders alike.\nThe TradeZero website asserts the following in its Privacy Policy:\n\u201cWe restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.\nIf you have any questions about security, contact TradeZero at support@tradezero.us. In addition, no security breaches were reported among users who reviewed TradeZero on TrustPilot.\nOverall, TradeZero is a solid stock brokerage platform for traders of all experience levels. Its strong points include tight security, unparalleled (live) customer support and user benefits, particularly for those enrolled in the ZeroWeb or ZeroPro plans.\nHowever, the program loses points for fairly basic mobile capability, which offers the same functions for pro and free members alike. Pricing is also on the high side for paid plans.\nTradeZero vs Competitors\nTradeZero is one of several online brokers that aim to perform the same function: giving users the ability to trade with as few restrictions and as much autonomy as possible. A few of the program\u2019s competitors include:\n- eToro\n- IC Markets\n- xtb online trading\nAmong these platforms, TradeZero stands out for its unparalleled customer support but loses points in most other areas. When stacked against its competitors, it has the lowest number of available instruments, 0 Forex pairs, no cryptocurrency capability, no commodities offered and only 100 stocks offered. TradeZero performed most poorly in all of these categories compared with competing software.\nTradeZero Tutorial\nThe TradeZero website offers the following tutorial on placing free stock trades.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan U.S. citizens use TradeZero?\nYes, U.S. citizens can use TradeZero. Those interested should visit Tradezero for more information.\nIs TradeZero safe?\nThe majority of users found the platform to be successful for their trading goals, and the site is encrypted with SSL protection for the security of their users.\nWhat types of accounts does TradeZero offer?\nTradeZero typically offers individual and joint brokerage accounts."

The fitness industry has been booming in recent years, as more and more consumers are investing in their health. Here are the key fitness industry and gym statistics globally and in the U.S.:\n-\nThe market value of the global fitness industry is over $87 billion\n-\nThe US fitness industry revenue in 2021 was $33.25 billion\n-\nIn the United States, 39% of Americans hold gym memberships\n-\nBetween now and 2028, the fitness industry is expected to grow 171.75% to $434.74 billion\n-\nFrom now until 2028, the online fitness industry is expected to see a growth of 33.10% per year\nFor further analysis, we broke down the data in the following ways:\nGym Members and Fitness Consumers | Gym Member Demographics | Health and Fitness Clubs | Pandemic\nFitness industry trends and projections\nThe fitness industry has changed over time with consumer interests. From the increased popularity of Yoga, to people wanting gym memberships, fitness is more popular than ever before. To see where the industry might be heading, we\u2019ve gathered the latest fitness industry trends and projections:\n-\nFitness industries have been growing at a rate of 8.7% per year for the past few years.\nPrices for gym memberships and exercise programs are not necessarily getting higher; rather, more and more people are choosing to prioritize their physical health.\nSo many people realize that the benefits of physical fitness go beyond the obvious of weight loss and more energy; it can improve mental health as well.\n-\nBetween 2011-2019, the revenue for gyms and health centers in the United States consistently rose each year.\nIn 2020, revenue dropped drastically due to the pandemic, social distancing, and the rise in online fitness programs. We saw in 2021 that the revenue for gym memberships rebounded and was on the rise again.\n-\nThe fitness industry revenue declined by 32.45% in 2020 but rebounded to 0.55% pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021.\nThe health industry that was hit the hardest during 2020-2021 were gyms and health centers. Even at the end of 2021, they were still down 22.5% from their revenue levels in 2019.\nHowever, the online fitness industry was up 66.32% by the end of 2021 when compared to their pre-pandemic levels.\n-\nBy the end of 2028, the expected revenue for the fitness industry in the United States is expected to be $434.74 billion.\nThis projected trend shows annual growth of 33.10% from 2021-2028. By 2028, the fitness industry will have grown 171.75%. The fastest-growing segment in the fitness industry is the online/digital fitness industry. It is expected to grow 640.1% from 2021-2018.\n-\nBy 2030, there are predictions that the fitness industry will have 230 million members.\nCurrently, the United States has the highest gym industry revenue in the world. If the US wants to retain its leadership in the fitness industry, it would need to increase by 15.6 million members by 2030, or 1.33 million new gym members each year.\n-\nThe online and digital fitness industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 33.5% from 2020-2027.\nThis noteworthy growth is due largely to the fact that many prefer virtual fitness solutions because of the convenience factor of being able to exercise from your own home.\nFitness industry statistics by gym members and fitness consumers\nThe fitness industry is driven by gym memberships, and there are millions of Americans who go to the gym on the regular. Don\u2019t believe us? Here are some fascinating fitness industry statistics by gym members and fitness consumers:\n-\nThere are 64.19 million Americans who are members of a gym or health club.\nThis equates to about 19% of the population in the US having a gym membership. About 49.9% of Americans go to the gym at least twice a week.\nTotal number of gym memberships each year\nYear Total Number of Gym Memberships 2019 64.2M 2018 62.5M 2017 60.9M 2016 57.3M 2015 55.3M 2014 54.1M 2013 52.9M 2012 50.2M -\nThe average American spends less than $30 per month on a gym membership in the United States.\nThe price can vary depending on the location, types of equipment and classes, and the facility. Budget gyms can cost as low as $10 per month, whereas elite fitness clubs often go as much as $100 per month. Aside from the monthly fee, you can also expect to pay other fees, such as initiation fees and annual fees.\n-\nBoutique fitness studios account for 42% of all gym memberships.\nA boutique fitness studio is a small gym that focuses on group classes and specializes in one or two fitness areas. These studios typically cost two-four times more than other health clubs. This area of the fitness industry is expected to continue rising and is projected to grow by nearly 17% by 2025.\nFitness industry statistics by gym member demographics\nFitness industry gym memberships are more popular with certain demographics over others. Luckily, we\u2019ve analyzed who goes to the gym, and our research found that:\n-\nThe generational breakdown of the average gym\u2019s membership is as follows:\n-\nGen Z (born 1994-2022): 35%\n-\nMillennials (born 1979-1993): 45%\n-\nGen X (born 1964-1979): 14%\n-\nBaby Boomers ( born 1949-1963): 6%\n-\nFitness industry statistics by health and fitness clubs\nThe fitness industry is home to many fitness clubs that offer services to their members.

      "text": "Investing in stocks can offer an excellent means of wealth accumulation over time but it can also be intimidating for beginners. This guide aims to empower you with the knowledge and practical techniques needed to make informed decisions and build a successful investment portfolio. Whether you're a young professional, a seasoned investor or someone looking to secure their financial future, understanding the stock market and learning how to buy stocks like a pro can be a game-changer.\nFrom how to buy stocks to diversification, risk mitigation and the difference between fundamental and technical analysis, find everything you need to begin your stock market journey with confidence.\nWhy Should You Invest in Stocks?\nInvesting in stocks offers several potential benefits, including:\n- Long-term growth potential: Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes, such as bonds and cash, over the long term, providing the opportunity for substantial wealth accumulation.\n- Compound returns: By reinvesting dividends and capital gains, you can harness the power of compounding, allowing your money to grow exponentially over time.\n- Inflation hedge: Stocks can act as a hedge against inflation, as companies can often pass on increased costs to consumers, helping to preserve the purchasing power of your investments.\nHowever, it's important to recognize that investing in stocks also carries risks, including market volatility, company-specific risks and the potential for losses. Diversification across asset classes and investment types, plus a long-term investment horizon can help mitigate these risks.\nUnderstanding the Stock Market\u2019s Basics\nStocks represent ownership in publicly traded companies. When you buy stocks, you become a shareholder and have a claim on a portion of the company's assets and profits. Stock prices are determined by supply and demand in the market, reflecting investors' collective perception of a company's future performance and growth prospects.\nStocks are traded on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. These exchanges provide a platform for buyers and sellers to come together and execute trades. Stock prices fluctuate during the trading day, reflecting the constant ebb and flow of buy and sell orders.\nSelecting an Online Brokerage\nWith the proliferation of online trading platforms, investing in stocks has become more accessible than ever before. When choosing an online brokerage, consider the following factors:\n- Commissions and fees: Seek brokers with low trading commissions and account fees, as these costs can cut into your returns over time. Low-cost index funds typically have fees of 0% to 0.03%.\n- Investment products and services: Evaluate the range of investment products offered, such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds and options, as well as the availability of research and educational resources to make informed investment decisions.\n- Trading platforms and tools: Check out the user-friendliness and functionality of the trading platform, including charting tools, real-time quotes, and mobile access. The best trading platforms will include extensive charting and research tools plus historical data.\n- Account minimums and account types: Consider the minimum account balance requirements and the availability of different account types such as individual, joint, and retirement accounts. Many brokerage accounts have no account minimum, so you can start with what you've got and build up gradually.\n- Customer service and support: When you need help, you want a brokerage that can offer exceptional support that can answer your questions or troubleshoot issues. You can look for brokers with responsive and knowledgeable customer service teams and availability through various channels like phone, email, and chat.\nPopular online brokers for stock purchases include Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*TRADE, and TD Ameritrade, among others. Compare their offerings to choose the one that best suits your investment needs and preferences.\n- Best For:Active and Global TradersVIEW PROS & CONS:Securely through Interactive Brokers\u2019 website\n- Best For:Active Short Sellers With Modest CapitalVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through TradeZero's website\nEstablishing Your Financial Goals\nBefore investing in stocks, it's crucial to establish precise financial goals and understand your risk tolerance. Ask yourself:\n- Goals: What are your investment objectives? Are you saving for retirement, building an emergency fund, or investing for a specific goal like a down payment on a house?\n- Timeline: What is your investment time horizon? The longer your time horizon, the more aggressive you can be with your stock investments, as you'll have more time to ride out market fluctuations.\n- Risk tolerance: Are you comfortable with the potential for significant short-term losses, or do you prefer a more conservative approach? What is your risk tolerance? Discover more about trading psychology.\n- Available assets: Look at your investment budget based on your overall financial situation and investment goals. How much can you afford to invest in stocks?\nOnce you've defined your goals and risk tolerance, you can create an investment plan tailored to your needs.\nStock Research and Analysis Techniques\nBefore investing in any stock, conducting thorough research and analysis is essential. Investors use different analysis techniques, including fundamental and technical analysis as well as various stock screeners.\nWhile fundamental analysis is the most common investment strategy, it's important to learn the basics and study fundamental analysis techniques to get comfortable accessing stocks. Technical analysis is primarily used by large investment firms or professionals with access to extensive tools to perform these complex analyses.\nHere is an overview of research and analysis techniques to consider.\n- Fundamental analysis: Evaluating a company's financial health, competitive position, management team and growth prospects by studying its financial statements, industry trends, and other qualitative factors.\n- Technical analysis: Analyzing historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends that may predict future price movements.\n- Stock screeners: You can use online tools to filter stocks based on specific criteria, such as valuation metrics, industry sectors or performance indicators. This combines some of the fundamental or technical analysis techniques into a simplified screening process.\n- Company news and analyst reports: Regardless of the other analysis techniques you use, it's important to stay up-to-date with company news, news releases, as well as analyst ratings and recommendations.\nConducting thorough research enables more informed investment decisions and potentially identifies undervalued or promising stocks. In addition to these techniques, you can place a portion of your portfolio in a low-cost index fund, which aims to track or mimic the overall stock market. In this way, you'll own a small portion of the top 500 companies, giving you a degree of built-in diversification.\nInitiating Your First Stock Trade\nOnce you've chosen an online brokerage and identified a stock you want to buy, it's time to place your first trade. Here's a step-by-step guide:\nStep 1: Open a Brokerage Account\nComplete the account opening process, providing personal and financial information. Opening a brokerage account can happen in even a day.\nStep 2: Fund Your Account\nTransfer funds from your bank account to your brokerage account, ensuring you have enough cash to cover your desired stock purchase. Transfers can take up to three business days or may transfer in as little as a day.\nStep 3: Place a Market Order\nA market order is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at the best available price in the current market. This type of order is executed immediately, but the price may differ slightly from the last quoted price. If you don't see how to place a market order in your brokerage account, you can speak with customer service to understand the specifics of your platform.\nStep 4: Place a Limit Order\nA limit order allows you to set a specific price at which you're willing to buy or sell a stock. The order will only execute if the stock reaches your specified price or better. You can place limit orders for the current market price or place the order at a lower price in case the price drops.\nStep 5: Monitor Your Trade\nAfter placing your order, keep an eye on its status and track the stock's performance. Continue to monitor stocks, companies, and overall performance and readjust your portfolio as needed.\nIt's essential to understand the different order types and their implications before placing trades. Several brokers provide educational resources and practice accounts to aid in getting comfortable with the trading process. Below, you'll find an overview of trading strategies.\nTrading Strategies\nThere are various trading strategies you can employ when investing in stocks, each with its risks and possible rewards:\n- Buy-and-hold: This long-term strategy involves buying stocks and holding them for an extended period, typically years or decades, to benefit from long-term growth and compounding returns. Buy and hold is one of the strategies used by conservative investors interested in long-term time horizons.\n- Day trading: Day traders aim to profit from short-term price movements by buying and selling stocks within the same trading day, capitalizing on intraday volatility. This is typically the highest-risk trading strategy unless you have extensive day trading experience. You can learn more about how to begin day trading.\n- Swing trading: Swing traders hold stocks for a few days to several weeks, attempting to capture short-term price swings and trends. While swing trading carries less risk than day trading, without strong analysis and market understanding, this also carries significant risk.\n- Options trading: Options contracts give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price within a specific time frame. Options allow you to (potentially) profit on both down and up market swings. You can find brokers for options traders.\nEach strategy requires different skill sets, risk tolerances and time commitments. It's essential to understand the risks and potential rewards before embarking on any trading strategy.\nRegulatory Considerations\nThe stock market is regulated by various government agencies and industry organizations to ensure fair and transparent markets. Key regulatory bodies include:\n- Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): The SEC oversees the U.S. securities markets, enforcing laws and regulations to protect investors and maintain market integrity.\n- Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA): FINRA is a self-regulatory organization that oversees and regulates brokerage firms and their registered representatives.\nInvestors should familiarize themselves with relevant regulations, such as insider trading laws, disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions, to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal issues.\nTransaction Costs\nBy understanding and minimizing transaction costs, you can maximize the potential returns on your stock investments. Even an extra 1% saved annually could lead to significant additional growth over decades. When investing in stocks, it's essential to consider the various transaction costs that can impact your returns, including:\nBrokerage Commissions\nMost brokers charge a commission or fee for executing trades, which can vary depending on the broker, account type, and trade size. The standard commission for full-service brokers is between 1% to 2% of assets under management (AUM). Other brokerages can be significantly less.\nBid-Ask Spread\nThe bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask). This spread represents an implicit cost for investors. The bid-ask spread is also a measure of market liquidity impacted by market risks that can widen when the market is highly volatile.\nTaxes\nCapital gains on stock investments are subject to taxation, with the rate depending on your income level and the holding period of the investment. Whether you have realized or unrealized capital gains will also affect your tax filings. You can find a comprehensive guide to how your investments are taxed.\nBuilding a Diversified Stock Portfolio\nDiversification is a key principle of successful investing, as it helps mitigate risk by spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors and individual stocks. By diversifying your stock investments, you can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk, improve stability of returns and enhance long-term performance. Strategies for building a diversified stock portfolio include:\nAsset Allocation\nAllocate your investment capital across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and cash, based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. For example, a more aggressive portfolio might consist of 80% stocks and 20% bonds, while a more conservative portfolio might be 60% stocks and 40% bonds. A risk-averse or retirement portfolio might reverse the aggressive portfolio and contain 20% stocks or index funds and 80% bonds.\nSector Ddiversification\nEven within asset classes, it's important to diversify. Invest in stocks from various sectors, such as technology, health care, finance and energy to reduce the impact of industry-specific risks. Or even consider investing a small portion of your portfolio in cryptocurrency.\nFor example, you can invest in sector-specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or by carefully selecting individual stocks across different industries. You can also choose index funds that track the wider market like the S&P 500, which aims to track the 500 largest companies in the U.S. market. You can also check out the best stocks under $100.\nGeographic Diversification\nConsider investing in both domestic and international stocks to capture global growth opportunities and reduce concentration risk. International investments can provide exposure to different economies, currencies and market cycles, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification and providing new opportunities for returns.\nRebalancing\nPeriodically review and rebalance your portfolio to uphold your preferred asset allocation and risk profile. Over time, your portfolio's asset allocation may drift from your target due to the performance of different asset classes. Rebalancing involves selling assets that have grown in value and reinvesting the proceeds into underperforming assets to realign with your desired allocation.\nConcluding Tips for Building Your Investment Portfolio\nInvesting in stocks is a journey that requires preparation, perseverance and a willingness to learn from your experiences. However, with discipline, patience and a solid understanding of the market, investment principles and analysis techniques, investing in stocks can be a powerful wealth-building tool.\nSuccessful investing is not about getting rich quickly; it's about consistently making well-informed decisions based on strong research and analysis skills, managing risk and allowing time and compound returns to work for you.\nStay committed to your investment plan, continue learning and adapting and don't let short-term market fluctuations deter you from your long-term goals. By embracing the challenges and opportunities that come with stock investing with the principles in this guide, you'll be well on your way to achieving your financial goals.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I buy stocks with $100?\nYes, you can buy stocks with $100 or even less. Many brokers allow you to open an account with a relatively small initial investment, and some even offer fractional share trading, allowing you to buy portions of expensive stocks.\nWhat type of stock is best for beginners?\nFor beginners, it\u2019s often recommended to start with well-established, large-cap companies with a proven track record of profitability and stability. These stocks tend to be less volatile and can provide a solid foundation for a portfolio. Additionally, index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major indexes like the S&P 500 can be a good starting point for diversification.\nWhat is the safest stock to buy?\nThere is no such thing as a completely safe stock, as all investments carry some level of risk. However, stocks of well-established companies with strong financials, consistent earnings, and a history of paying dividends are generally considered safer investments. Examples include blue chip stocks, consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare companies. Diversification across different sectors and asset classes is also crucial for mitigating risk.\nAbout Alison Plaut\nAlison Kimberly is a freelance content writer with a Sustainable MBA, uniquely qualified to help individuals and businesses achieve the triple bottom line of environmental, social, and financial profitability.

The platform is particularly suitable for those who need access to a broad range of asset classes and international markets.\nUnderstanding commissions and fees is important for anyone involved in financial transactions. Commissions are payments made to sales agents or brokers. They are usually a percentage of the total transaction value. This system encourages them to get better deals for their clients. Fees, on the other hand, are fixed charges for specific services. Examples include processing fees and service charges. Both commissions and fees can increase overall costs and affect returns. This knowledge helps consumers and investors make informed decisions. It can also improve negotiation strategies and lead to better financial outcomes.\nIBKR Lite\nIBKR Lite offers commission-free trading for U.S. exchange-listed stocks and ETFs, which makes it an appealing choice for residents interested in these markets. However, there are fees associated with non-exchange-listed U.S. stocks (including pink sheets and OTCBB), ETFs, warrants and other products that do not qualify under the Fixed Pricing model.\nIBKR Pro\nIBKR Pro is designed for more active and experienced traders, providing tiered and fixed pricing options so users can select a pricing model that suits their trading volume and preferences.\nTiered Pricing\nIn the tiered pricing model, costs decrease as trading volume increases. This creates an incentive for high-volume traders. For stocks and ETFs, rates vary from $0.0005 to $0.0035 per share. Higher trading volume results in a lower cost per share. This model appeals to frequent traders who want to reduce transaction costs. For options contracts, fees range from $0.15 to $0.65 per contract. The fee depends on volume and other factors. Futures contracts are priced between $0.25 and $0.85 per contract. This pricing structure allows traders to benefit from lower costs as their trading activity increases.\nFixed Pricing\nFor traders who prefer predictable fees, IBKR Pro offers a fixed pricing model. Stocks and ETFs cost $0.005 per share, no matter the trade size. This provides a simple option for those wanting consistent trading expenses. Options contracts are charged at a flat rate of $0.65 per contract. Futures contracts have a flat fee of $0.85 per contract. This pricing model is ideal for traders who value stability in their costs, even with changes in trading volume.\nSpot Currencies\nInteractive Brokers provides competitive pricing for spot currency trading. This is important for forex traders. The cost structure for spot currencies ranges from 0.08 to 0.20 basis points. This amount is multiplied by the trade value of each order. This pricing model ensures flexibility for both small and large traders. The platform also offers tight spreads. Some spreads are as narrow as 1/10 of a PIP (percentage in point). This enhances overall trading efficiency. Narrow spreads allow traders to capitalize on minimal market movements. Therefore, Interactive Brokers is a competitive option for forex trading.\nBonds\nInteractive Brokers offers a clear pricing model for bond trading. They charge 10 basis points for each trade. This is multiplied by the face value of each order. The pricing method aims to be transparent and cost-effective. It provides clarity on the fees linked to bond investments. Whether investing in corporate or government bonds, this fee structure is simple and competitive. It helps you manage the costs of your fixed-income portfolio more effectively.\nMutual Funds\nInteractive Brokers offers competitive pricing for mutual fund investments. Standard mutual fund trades have a fee of 3% of the trade value. However, this fee is capped at a maximum of $14.95 per transaction. This pricing is attractive for investors trading larger amounts. The platform also provides No Transaction Fee (NTF) Funds. These funds allow investors to trade select mutual funds without any transaction fees. This fee structure aims to reduce trading costs. It encourages long-term investment in mutual funds. Overall, it offers a cost-effective way to build a diversified portfolio.\nThis flexible pricing structure allows traders to choose the plan that best fits their trading style and volume, ensuring that they can minimize costs and maximize returns. Whether you're an active trader looking for tiered pricing benefits or a casual investor interested in commission-free trading, IBKR has a plan tailored to your needs.\nInteractive Brokers offers access to a wide range of assets, including:\n- Stocks and ETFs: Over 150 markets worldwide.\n- Options and futures: Global access with advanced tools.\n- Forex: 28 currencies available for trading.\n- Bonds: Access to 1.4 million bonds globally.\n- Cryptocurrencies: Trade popular cryptos via futures contracts.\nThis extensive range makes IBKR a versatile platform for diversified portfolios.\nMobile apps are now essential in our daily lives.

Robinhood's ease of use and low-cost structure appeal to users who may not have the time or interest to actively manage their investments but still want to participate in the market.\nRobinhood's simplicity can be a double-edged sword for more experienced traders. While it provides essential functionalities, the platform lacks advanced trading tools and in-depth research options that seasoned investors often rely on. For example, it doesn't offer comprehensive technical analysis tools, customizable screeners or access to a wealth of research reports and market data available on more sophisticated platforms. This makes Robinhood less suitable for active traders or those who require detailed market insights to inform their investment decisions. As a result, while Robinhood is an excellent entry point for novice investors, those looking for a more robust trading experience may need to look elsewhere for a platform that can meet their advanced needs.\nRobinhood offers commission-free trading on stocks, E\nETFs and options, making it a cost-effective choice for investors.

Despite these shortcomings, Robinhood's ease of use and accessibility make it an excellent platform for beginners and passive investors looking to confidently enter the market.\nRobinhood provides limited educational resources and research tools. While the platform offers basic news articles and analyst ratings for Robinhood Gold members, it lacks comprehensive educational content and in-depth market analysis.
