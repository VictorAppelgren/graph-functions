  "title": "China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd's (SGX:G92) Stock Is Rallying But Financials Look Ambiguous: Will The Momentum Continue?",
  "description": "China Aviation Oil (Singapore) (SGX:G92) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 51...",
  "content": "China Aviation Oil (Singapore) (SGX:G92) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 51% over the last three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Specifically, we decided to study China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. So, based on the above formula, the ROE for China Aviation Oil (Singapore) is: 7.9% = US$78m \u00f7 US$990m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each SGD1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made SGD0.08 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for China Aviation Oil (Singapore) What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROE At first glance, China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 10.0% either. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 2.6% seen by China Aviation Oil (Singapore) was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio. That being said, we compared China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for G92? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) which is pretty normal, China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline. Additionally, China Aviation Oil (Singapore) has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 30% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 8.2%. Overall, we have mixed feelings about China Aviation Oil (Singapore). While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

  "argos_summary": "China Aviation Oil (Singapore) (SGX:G92) has seen a 51% increase in its stock price over the past three months, but its return on equity (ROE) of 7.9% is below the industry average of 10.0%, raising concerns about its earnings growth potential. Despite a five-year decline in net income of 2.6%, analysts predict future earnings growth of 5.7% annually, although the company's high payout ratio and capital allocation issues may hinder this growth. Overall, while the company retains a good portion of its profits, its low ROE and declining earnings suggest a cautious outlook.",
