      "summary": "The article debunks the myth that iPhones are secretly listening to users, explaining that the seemingly relevant ads are the result of sophisticated data collection and ad‑targeting algorithms rather than covert microphone use. It details how platforms, advertisers, identity providers, and data brokers build profiles from in‑app behavior, location, and pre‑existing data to serve highly relevant ads. The piece also highlights legal and technical safeguards that prevent continuous audio recording, and cites studies and industry statements confirming the absence of hidden listening features. Overall, it reassures readers that the uncanny ad timing is due to data-driven prediction, not eavesdropping.",
