Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nCostco has opted not to dispense abortion pills after receiving demands from activists on both sides of the issue \u2014 and faith-based groups are celebrating the move.\n\nLast year, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander urged the retail giant to get a certification to be able to dispense mifepristone \u2014 one drug in a two-drug regimen for medication abortions \u2014 at its pharmacies. The following month a religious coalition pleaded with Costco not to sell the termination pill.\n\nThe FDA allows only certified prescribers to dispense mifepristone.\n\nCostco chose to forego pursuing this certification, the company said in a statement to Reuters emphasizing the decision was based on a lack of consumer demand. \"Our position at this time not to sell mifepristone, which has not changed, is based on the lack of demand from our members and other patients, who we understand generally have the drug dispensed by their medical providers,\u201d the company said. Bloomberg first reported Costco\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Costco for more information about its decision.\n\nRepresentatives on both sides of the abortion debate have battled over Costco\u2019s position in the form of letters. Last July, Lander penned a letter to CEO Ron Vachris demanding the retailer \u201cimmediately take the necessary steps to receive certification\u201d to sell mifepristone, following in the steps of CVS and Walgreens.\n\nThe comptroller also wrote letters to the leaders of Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, and McKesson. \u201cBy failing to become certified mifepristone dispensers, these pharmacy giants put both women\u2019s reproductive health care and investors' money at risk,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn August 2024, a coalition of religious activists wrote to Vachris, urging Costco to \u201ccontinue its current practice of not dispensing the abortion drug mifepristone.\u201d The group argued that dispensing the drug will reduce demand for the diapers and formula that the store sells and worsen the \u201cthe crisis of record low birth rates.\u201d\n\nThe letter also alleged the pill poses \u201cserious health risks.\u201d The FDA first approved the drug in 2000 to end pregnancy through 10 weeks of gestation, but anti-abortion activists have recently challenged its safety and FDA approval.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled to preserve access to the crucial drug, as nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. \u2014 63 percent \u2014 are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\u201cCostco\u2019s decision to refuse to dispense mifepristone is disappointing and short-sighted,\u201d a spokesperson for Lander told The Independent in a statement. Failure to provide access to proven safe and FDA-approved medication under the guise of \u2018weak demand\u2019 risks isolating customers and undermines the company\u2019s credibility. Putting customer needs before political ideology must remain Costco\u2019s priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe applaud Costco for doing the right thing by its shareholders and resisting activist calls to sell abortion drugs,\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Michael Ross said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThey have nothing to gain and much to lose by becoming abortion dispensaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have this momentum,\u201d Tim Schwarzenberger, director of corporate engagement at Inspire Investing, the world's largest faith-based ETF provider, told Bloomberg. \u201cNow there is a chance to turn to some of the other retailers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful that Costco\u2014a company that serves families, especially large ones\u2014has decided to remain a wholesale store, not become an abortion facility,\u201d Mary Szoch, director of the Center for Human Dignity at evangelical think-tank Family Research Council, said in a statement on X. \u201cWhat a win for America! Great job, @Costco!\"\n\nCVS and Walgreens, which both dispense the drug, have stood by their decisions in the wake of Costco\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of supporting and advancing women\u2019s health and we remain focused on meeting their unique health needs. This includes providing access to safe, legal, and evidence-based reproductive health services,\u201d CVS told The Independent in a statement, noting that the company fills prescriptions in states where it\u2019s legal.\n\nWalgreens declined to comment. Its website states: \"The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on mifepristone access allows Walgreens to continue to dispense mifepristone under the FDA guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe abortion landscape has been complicated after the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In January 2023, the FDA removed some restrictions around accessing mifepristone and added the pharmacy certification. Individuals living in states that have banned the procedure cannot access the drug at pharmacies; 12 states have total abortion bans, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe has opened the door for abortion opponents to argue fresh legal challenges.\n\nEarlier this year, anti-abortion activists pushed a report by right-wing think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center claiming serious complications from mifepristone use were 22 times higher than previously reported. Critics blasted the report as \u201cbogus.\u201d",

      "text": "Walgreens Statement on U.S. Supreme Court Ruling on Mifepristone\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on mifepristone access allows Walgreens to continue to dispense mifepristone under the FDA guidelines.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n1. Where is Walgreens dispensing mifepristone? Do you have a list of stores?\nAs part of our phased rollout, we are now dispensing mifepristone in select locations in more than 20 states consistent with federal and state laws. This phased approach allows us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members. Walgreens remains committed to providing access to women\u2019s reproductive health through education, medical services and filling FDA approved medications. Certified prescribers can contact the manufacturer, Danco Laboratories, for more information on locations.\nWalgreens has completed the FDA certification process to dispense mifepristone and is now dispensing, consistent with federal and state laws.\nWe are beginning with a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety, and privacy for our patients, providers, and team members.\nCertified medical providers will be able to direct patients to locations to pick up their prescriptions. But in the interests of pharmacist and patient safety, we will not disclose the number of sites per state nor identify the pharmacies that are dispensing.\n2. In which states have you chosen to begin dispensing mifepristone?\nTo ensure safety and privacy for our patients, providers, and team members we are not disclosing locations or specific states. Certified prescribers may locate pharmacies by contacting Danco Laboratories (brand manufacturer) at 1-877-4 Early Option (1-877-432-7596).\nAs part of our preparation to dispense mifepristone, Walgreens conducted a rigorous process to select the initial sites within legally permissible states.\nOur goals in identifying these locations were to meet patient demand and remain consistent with how we have provided access to other medications where a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n3. What is REMS?\nA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a drug safety program that the FDA requires for certain medications with safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of a medication outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA modified the mifepristone REMS program in January 2023 to remove the restriction that did not allow mifepristone to be dispensed from retail pharmacies.\nPlease find more information about REMS below in the \u201cWhat is the REMS Program?\u201d section of this page.\n4. Will you be expanding to additional states? When?\nYes. Our goal is to gradually expand availability to locations in all legally permissible states in a phased approach.\n5. What\u2019s the turnaround time from when a prescription is sent to Walgreens and then dispensed to a patient?\nAs with all Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) medications, Walgreens will dispense mifepristone to patients in a timely manner pursuant to the FDA\u2019s REMS requirements.\n6. How will my doctor know where to send my prescription?\nCertified prescribers may locate pharmacies by contacting Danco Laboratories (brand manufacturer) at 1-877-4 Early Option (1-877-432-7596).\nIf a prescription is received at a non-certified Walgreens in an active state, Walgreens team members will assist the patient to locate an alternate pharmacy that is able to dispense the medication.\n7. How do I get a prescription for mifepristone?\nA certified medical provider must provide Walgreens with a prescription for mifepristone in order for Walgreens to dispense it to you.\n8. Why did you choose to do an initial launch first? Why not just go nationwide?\nWe are beginning with a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety, and privacy for our patients, providers, and team members.\nOur goal is to gradually expand availability to locations in all legally permissible states in a phased approach.\n9. What is Walgreens doing to ensure patient privacy?\nWalgreens is committed to patient privacy and has a robust patient privacy program in place to protect our patients\u2019 pharmacy information for all medications. Our Notice of Privacy Practices outline how Walgreens may use or disclose their information in accordance with law.\nFor the dispensing of mifepristone, the FDA\u2019s Mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program requires additional patient and provider privacy standards that go beyond existing laws. As a result, Walgreens has worked hard to develop new processes designed to provide enhanced privacy protections for data covered by the program.\n10. Are you requiring all your pharmacists to dispense mifepristone? Can pharmacists request religious accommodations?\nWalgreens has strict policies in place to uphold federal and state laws that protect health care provider conscience rights so that any team member who is unable to perform a task due to moral, religious, and/or ethical objections can request an exemption/accommodation consistent with these laws.\nWe will engage in an interactive process with any team member making such a request to determine what accommodations can be offered while ensuring that patients\u2019 healthcare needs are met.\n11. How does Walgreens protect the personal data of patients who receive a prescription for mifepristone from cyberattacks and other risks?\nThe protection of our patients\u2019 privacy and personal data is our priority.\nWalgreens\u2019 processes and controls, our business and employees, contractors and third parties work every day to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems are maintained.\nWalgreens also partners with HITRUST, a third-party organization, to assess the security and privacy controls around Walgreens\u2019 patient data.\n12. Can any provider prescribe mifepristone? What steps must providers take to be able to prescribe it?\nMifepristone is a medication that must align with a specific U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.\nConsistent with several other medications that require a REMS program, mifepristone must be prescribed by a healthcare provider that meets certain qualifications and is certified under the mifepristone REMS program.\nProviders who are seeking to become certified should complete the latest Prescriber Agreement Form. This should be done through the medication\u2019s manufacturer, such as Danco Laboratories or GenBioPro. Please visit the FDA\u2019s website for the most up-to-date information.\n13. What must healthcare providers do to have their prescriptions filled at Walgreens?\nWhen sending a prescription for mifepristone to Walgreens for the first time, providers must provide Walgreens\u2014either via email or fax\u2014with a signed copy of the Prescriber Agreement Form issued after the most recent REMS update in January 2023. Walgreens must have this form on file at each individual certified pharmacy location in order for that Walgreens pharmacy to dispense the medication.\nIn the event Walgreens does not have a recent Prescriber Agreement Form on file, pharmacy team members will work directly with the provider, when a prescription is received, to ensure the appropriate information is received and will keep the patient informed throughout the process.\nAdditional resources related to mifepristone and certification:\nA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a drug safety program that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for certain medications with safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of a medication outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA determines that a REMS is necessary, specifies the requirements, and approves the specific programs based on the following considerations:\nWhether there is a particular risk(s) associated with the medication that, on balance, outweigh(s) its benefits;\nWhether additional interventions beyond FDA-approved labeling are necessary to ensure that the drug\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\nPotential burden of the REMS requirements.\nREMS are designed to instruct patients on the safe use of that medication and reduce the occurrence of any serious adverse event. For example:\nA REMS may be required for a drug that can cause a severe allergic reaction immediately after administration to ensure the drug is administered only in a healthcare facility with personnel trained to manage severe allergic reactions.\nA REMS may ensure certain lab testing is completed and the results are checked before a medication prescription is refilled.\nA REMS may educate healthcare providers about which patients may be at greatest risk of experiencing an adverse event and should therefore not be prescribed a medication.\nDrugs that require a REMS may not be available at every pharmacy location due to these specific requirements.\nExamples of Potential REMS Medications:\nPomalidomide (Pomalyst\u00ae), for treatment of multiple myeloma\nIsotretinoin (Accutane\u00ae), for treatment of severe recalcitrant cystic acne vulgaris (nodular acne) in patients with multiple inflammatory nodules with a diameter of at least 5 mm\nOnce the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a drug, the medication\u2019s manufacturer is responsible for developing and implementing the program, as well as determining if the REMS is meeting its goal. Pharmacies are bound by the guidelines set by the manufacturer.\nWithout a REMS, these medications would not be approved or would be withdrawn from the market because of known or potential serious risks associated with medication.\nThe REMS@FDA website includes information about the current approved REMS, or individuals may contact the FDA at (855) 543-3784 or (301) 796-3400, or by email at druginfo@fda.hhs.gov.\nMedia Resources is a one-stop shop for journalists.

      "text": "Questions and Answers on Mifepristone for Medical Termination of Pregnancy Through Ten Weeks Gestation\nGeneral Information\nWhat is mifepristone and how does it work?\nMifepristone is a drug that blocks a hormone called progesterone that is needed for a pregnancy to continue. Mifepristone, when used together with another medicine called misoprostol, is used to end an intrauterine pregnancy through ten weeks gestation (70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period). The approved mifepristone dosing regimen is:\n- On day one: 200 mg of mifepristone taken by mouth\n- 24 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone: 800 mcg of misoprostol taken buccally (in the cheek pouch), at a location appropriate for the patient\n- About seven to fourteen days after taking mifepristone: follow-up with the health care provider\nWhen did the FDA approve mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy?\nThe FDA first approved Mifeprex (mifepristone) in September 2000 for medical termination of pregnancy through seven weeks gestation, and this was extended to ten weeks gestation in 2016. FDA approved a generic version of Mifeprex, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, in April 2019. The agency\u2019s approval of this generic reflects the FDA\u2019s determination that Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, is therapeutically equivalent to Mifeprex and can be safely substituted for Mifeprex. Like Mifeprex, the approved generic product is indicated for the medical termination of an intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation. The labeling for the approved generic version of Mifeprex is consistent with the labeling for Mifeprex.\nWho should not take mifepristone, in a regimen with misoprostol, for medical termination of pregnancy?\nAn individual should not take mifepristone, in a regimen with misoprostol, for medical termination of pregnancy if it has been more than 70 days since the first day of their last menstrual period, or if they:\n- have an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the uterus)\n- have problems with the adrenal glands (the glands near the kidneys)\n- are currently being treated with long-term corticosteroid therapy\n- have had an allergic reaction to mifepristone, misoprostol or similar drugs\n- have bleeding problems or are taking anticoagulant (blood thinning) drug products\n- have inherited porphyria (a rare disorder that can affect the liver and other organs)\n- have an intrauterine device (IUD) in place (it must be removed before taking mifepristone)\nIs it safe to use mifepristone?\nYes. Mifepristone is safe when used as indicated and directed and consistent with the Mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. The FDA approved Mifeprex more than 20 years ago based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the scientific evidence presented and determined that it was safe and effective for its indicated use. As of 2016, it is approved for use for medical termination of pregnancy up to 70 days of gestation. The FDA\u2019s periodic reviews of the postmarketing data for Mifeprex and its approved generic have not identified any new safety concerns with the use of mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through 70 days gestation. As with all drugs, the FDA continues to closely monitor the postmarketing safety data on mifepristone for the medical termination of pregnancy.\nWhat are the possible side effects of using mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nThe possible side effects are described in the labeling and in the Medication Guide for mifepristone.\nWhat serious adverse events have been reported after the use of mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nAs with all approved drugs, when the FDA receives new information regarding adverse events, the agency reviews the new information and, as appropriate, takes necessary action. This could include, for example, providing updates to health care providers and their patients so that they have information on how to use a drug safely.\nIt is common for the FDA to receive reports of serious adverse events for prescription drugs after they are approved. Many drugs are associated with serious adverse events that are known at the time of approval and considered when the FDA makes its approval decision. The FDA continuously reviews reports of adverse events to, among other things, determine whether they are known risks or whether they are signals of emerging safety concerns.\nThe FDA has received reports of serious adverse events in patients who took mifepristone. As of December 31, 2024, there were 36 reports of deaths in patients associated with mifepristone since the product was approved in September 2000, including two cases of ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy located outside the womb, such as in the fallopian tubes) resulting in death, and several fatal cases of severe systemic infection (also called sepsis). The adverse events cannot with certainty be causally attributed to mifepristone because of concurrent use of other drugs, other medical or surgical treatments, co-existing medical conditions, and information gaps about patient health status and clinical management of the patient. A summary report of adverse events that reflects data through December 31, 2024, is here. The FDA has reviewed this information and did not identify any new safety signals. The FDA intends to update this summary report as appropriate.\nWhat should health care providers watch for in patients who have taken mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nHealth care providers should review the approved labeling for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. The signs and symptoms they should watch for are included in the labeling, available here.\nWhat is an ectopic pregnancy?\nAn ectopic pregnancy is a non-viable pregnancy that develops outside of the womb. It occurs in approximately two percent of all pregnancies. An ectopic pregnancy is usually located in one of the fallopian tubes. As the fetus grows, the tube cannot hold it, causing the tube to rupture (burst) and bleed. Unless they are discovered and treated early, almost 40 percent of ectopic pregnancies rupture suddenly, causing pain and bleeding in the abdominal cavity. The other 60 percent usually cause slow bleeding in the abdomen. Ruptured ectopic pregnancies can be fatal. The approved labeling for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, states that the use of mifepristone, in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation is contraindicated in patients with a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy.\nDoes the FDA endorse this drug product?\nThe FDA does not endorse any drug product. The agency evaluates all drug applications submitted by applicants to determine whether the data and information in an application support the approval of the application. The same standards are applied to the drug applications for Mifeprex and the approved generic Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, as are applied to all drug applications.\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program\nWhy is there a REMS for this product?\nThe FDA\u2019s determination as to whether a REMS is necessary for a particular drug is a drug-specific evaluation. The agency considers whether (based on premarketing or postmarketing risk assessments) there is a particular risk or risks associated with the use of the drug that, on balance, outweigh its benefits and whether additional risk mitigation measures beyond the FDA-approved labeling are necessary to ensure that the drug\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks.\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program is intended to mitigate the risk of serious complications associated with mifepristone when used for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation by, among other things, requiring that prescribers have the necessary qualifications to assess whether patients are appropriate candidates for the drug and to provide necessary intervention in case of complications (or have made plans to provide such care through others), ensuring that mifepristone is only dispensed by certified pharmacies or by or under the supervision of certified prescribers, and requiring that patients be informed of the risks of the treatment regimen.\nWhat are the restrictions on prescribing and dispensing mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nWhen the agency reviewed and approved the original new drug application for Mifeprex (mifepristone) in 2000, it concluded that certain restrictions were necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug. These restrictions were approved as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) in 2011 and have been modified since then.\nThese REMS requirements also apply to the approved generic version of Mifeprex. Mifeprex and the approved generic version of Mifeprex are subject to a single, shared system REMS, known as the Mifepristone REMS Program. This program sets the requirements that must be followed to ensure safe use of both Mifeprex and the approved generic version of Mifeprex.\nUnder the Mifepristone REMS Program, these requirements include, among others:\n- Mifepristone must be prescribed by a health care provider that meets certain qualifications and is certified under the Mifepristone REMS Program.\n- In order to become certified to prescribe mifepristone, health care providers must complete a Prescriber Agreement Form.\n- The Patient Agreement Form must be reviewed with and signed by the patient and the health care provider, and the risks of the mifepristone treatment regimen must be fully explained to the patient before prescribing mifepristone.\n- The patient must be provided with a copy of the Patient Agreement Form and the mifepristone Medication Guide (FDA-approved information for patients).\n- Mifepristone may only be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber.\n- To become certified to dispense mifepristone, pharmacies must complete a Pharmacy Agreement Form.\n- Certified pharmacies must be able to ship mifepristone using a shipping service that provides tracking information.\n- Certified pharmacies must ensure mifepristone is dispensed to the patient in a timely manner.\nEach REMS is required to have a plan for periodic assessments by the applicants, which are reviewed by the agency to determine whether the REMS is meeting its goals or whether certain goals or elements of the REMS must be modified. The FDA may require applicants to modify a REMS if the agency determines that an element is no longer necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks or to minimize the burden on the health care delivery system.\nHow does the Mifepristone REMS Program ensure safe use of the drug?\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program requires that in order for patients to receive mifepristone, it must be prescribed by a certified prescriber who has certain qualifications and agrees to follow certain guidelines for use. Under the Mifepristone REMS Program, mifepristone must be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber. The Mifepristone REMS Program is a closed system, meaning prescribers, pharmacies, and distributors are certified or authorized and verified under the REMS prior to distribution or dispensing of the drug. The Mifepristone REMS Program ensures that mifepristone is only distributed to health care providers and pharmacies that have agreed to the REMS requirements.\nHow does the Mifepristone REMS Program as modified in January 2023 differ from the previous REMS requirements?\nPrior to the modifications to the Mifepristone REMS Program approved in January 2023, the Mifepristone REMS Program required mifepristone to be dispensed in person in a clinic, medical office, or hospital. The requirement to dispense in person in one of these settings was referred to as the \u201cin-person dispensing requirement.\u201d There were periods when the in-person dispensing requirement was not being enforced. First, from July 13, 2020, until January 12, 2021, the FDA was enjoined from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement by an injunction issued in the ACOG v. FDA litigation, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. On April 12, 2021, the agency stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the in-person dispensing requirement during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\nIn 2021, after conducting a comprehensive review of the Mifepristone REMS Program, the FDA determined, based on the available data and information, that the REMS must be modified to reduce burden on the health care delivery system and to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. On December 16, 2021, the FDA announced that the modifications to the Mifepristone REMS Program would consist of:\n- Removing the \u201cin-person dispensing requirement\u201d\n- Adding a requirement that pharmacies that dispense the drug be certified\nConsistent with the typical process for REMS modifications, the FDA sent REMS Modification Notification letters to the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. Following receipt of these letters, the applicants prepared a proposed REMS modification and submitted it to their respective applications. After reviewing the applicants\u2019 submissions, the FDA approved the REMS modification on January 3, 2023. The REMS document and materials are available at:\nWhere can patients get mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nMifepristone must be prescribed by a certified prescriber who meets certain qualifications and agrees to follow certain guidelines for use. Under the Mifepristone REMS Program, mifepristone can be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber.\nWhat qualifications must health care providers have to become certified to prescribe mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nHealth care providers who would like to become certified to prescribe mifepristone must review the Prescribing Information for mifepristone and must have the ability to date pregnancies accurately and the ability to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. Health care providers must also be able to provide any necessary surgical intervention or have made arrangements for others to provide for such care. Health care providers must be able to ensure that patients have access to medical facilities for emergency care, and must agree to other responsibilities, including reviewing and signing the Patient Agreement Form with the patient and providing each patient with a copy of the signed Patient Agreement Form.\nSome states allow health care providers other than physicians to prescribe medications. Health care providers should check their individual state laws.\nUnder the Mifepristone REMS Program, are patients required to see a health care provider in person before obtaining mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program does not require patients to see a health care provider in person before obtaining mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation. Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, are indicated, in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination of an intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation and are contraindicated for certain patients, including those with an ectopic pregnancy. The FDA has determined that it is not necessary for the REMS to mandate how providers clinically assess patients for duration of pregnancy and for ectopic pregnancy. The prescription labeling for Mifeprex and the approved generic provide guidance to prescribers regarding how they can confirm the gestational age of the pregnancy and confirm that the pregnancy is located in the uterus. Aspects of a patient\u2019s medical history that may constitute contraindications to medical termination of pregnancy may be elicited without direct physical contact with the certified prescriber and can be done in different types of health care settings, thus certified prescribers are not necessarily required to be physically present with the patient when they prescribe mifepristone. As explained above (Question 15), health care providers certified under the Mifepristone REMS Program must also be able to provide any necessary surgical intervention or have made arrangements for others to provide for such care and must be able to ensure that patients have access to medical facilities for emergency care.\nWhat information did the FDA consider when it reviewed the Mifepristone REMS Program in 2021?\nTo determine whether a modification to the Mifepristone REMS Program was warranted, the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature, other relevant safety and adverse event data, and information provided by advocacy groups, individuals, and the applicants related to the modifications that were under consideration. Our review also included an examination of literature references provided by plaintiffs in the Purcell v. Becerra (previously Chelius v. Becerra) litigation.\nPrior to the FDA\u2019s action in January 2023, how was mifepristone dispensed to patients?\nPrior to the FDA\u2019s action on the REMS modification applications submitted by the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, in 2022, the Mifepristone REMS Program required that mifepristone be dispensed in person in a clinic, medical office, or hospital. The requirement to dispense in person in one of these settings was referred to as the \u201cin-person dispensing requirement.\u201d\nThere were periods when the in-person dispensing requirement was not being enforced. First, from July 13, 2020, until January 12, 2021, the FDA was enjoined from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement by an injunction issued in a lawsuit, ACOG v. FDA filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. On April 12, 2021, the agency stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the in-person dispensing requirement during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\nDuring the periods when the in-person dispensing requirement was not being enforced, the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, used mail order pharmacies to receive and hold mifepristone on behalf of the certified prescribers who purchased the product. Pursuant to a prescription for Mifeprex or its approved generic, the mail order pharmacy would ship the product to a named patient.\nWhat is the FDA\u2019s role in overseeing the Mifepristone REMS Program?\nAs with all REMS, the FDA monitors the applicants\u2019 compliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program, including by reviewing periodic assessment information from the applicants and conducting on-site inspections, and takes action as appropriate.\nWhat is pharmacy certification and why is it a requirement of the Mifepristone REMS Program?\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program requires all pharmacies that dispense mifepristone to be specially certified. The pharmacy certification requirement incorporates pharmacies into the REMS, ensures that pharmacies are aware of and agree to follow applicable REMS requirements, and ensures that mifepristone is only dispensed pursuant to prescriptions that are written by certified prescribers. Any pharmacy that meets the requirements of the Mifepristone REMS Program is eligible to be certified.\nWhat steps are required for pharmacy certification?\nThe pharmacy certification requirement ensures that pharmacies are aware of and agree to follow applicable REMS requirements and ensures that mifepristone is only dispensed pursuant to prescriptions that are written by certified prescribers.\nTo become certified to dispense mifepristone, pharmacies must: (1) be able to receive Prescriber Agreement Forms by email and fax; (2) be able to ship mifepristone using a shipping service that provides tracking information; (3) designate an authorized representative to carry out the certification process on behalf of the pharmacy; and (4) ensure the authorized representative oversees implementation and compliance with the Mifepristone REMS Program, which includes, among other requirements, the completion of a Pharmacy Agreement Form.\nIs mifepristone available at retail pharmacies?\nThe January 2023 modification to the Mifepristone REMS Program removed the restriction that did not allow mifepristone to be dispensed by retail pharmacies. While pharmacy certification is required, any pharmacy that meets the requirements of the Mifepristone REMS Program is eligible for certification.\nIs mifepristone available for over-the-counter use?\nNo. Mifepristone for medical termination of a pregnancy through ten weeks gestation is only available by prescription. An applicant seeking to switch mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation from prescription to nonprescription (also referred to as over-the-counter) status would need to submit this information to the FDA for evaluation. In order for a drug product to be approved for nonprescription use (including switching a prescription drug product to nonprescription marketing), the applicant must provide sufficient information demonstrating that the drug can be used safely and effectively by consumers without the supervision of a health care provider.\nWhat would be required to remove the REMS?\nThe FDA may release a REMS or remove certain components of a REMS if, after review of REMS assessments or other information, the agency determines that the REMS or certain components of the REMS are no longer necessary to ensure a medication\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks.\nAdditional Information\nIs it possible for an individual to become pregnant again after taking mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation?\nIt is possible for an individual to become pregnant again soon after a pregnancy ends. A patient should consult with their health care provider regarding any specific questions they may have.\nIs mifepristone approved in any other countries for medical termination of pregnancy?\nMifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy has been approved in France since 1988, and also is approved in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and approximately 100 other countries.\nDoes the FDA set the price of mifepristone and is the drug reimbursed by health insurance providers?\nThe FDA does not have the authority to regulate the prices of drug products in the United States. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers establish the prices. Additionally, the FDA does not have input into or legal control over whether an insurance company does or does not cover the cost of a drug. Insurance coverage is a decision made by an insurance provider. Individuals should contact their insurance provider if they have questions about whether a particular insurance provider will cover the cost of the drug.\nHas FDA ever taken action regarding the sale of mifepristone online?\nThe FDA has sent warning letters to websites selling unapproved and misbranded mifepristone and misoprostol over the internet, including AidAccess and Rablon.\nThere have also been several criminal cases related to the online sale of mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy. We are aware of three cases about which the Agency can speak publicly. The first is United States v. O\u2019Neil, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Information about two more individual prosecutions are available here: March 28, 2017: Former Atlantic County, New Jersey, Man Charged with Smuggling and Dispensing Misbranded Drugs | FDA and here: New York Woman Sentenced for Selling Abortion-Inducing Pills Illegally Smuggled Into US | USAO-WDWI | Department of Justice. The FDA also issued a Final Debarment Order for Ursula Wing, debarring her for a period of five years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. This debarment was based on her felony conviction related to her importation and distribution of unapproved and misbranded mifepristone and misoprostol over the internet.\nThe January 2023 REMS Modification\nWhat action did the FDA take on the Mifepristone REMS Program in January 2023?\nIn response to the REMS Modification Notification letters sent on December 16, 2021, to the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, the applicants submitted supplemental applications to modify the Mifepristone REMS Program to remove the in-person dispensing requirement and add pharmacy certification. The FDA reviewed the applicants\u2019 supplemental applications and approved a modification to the Mifepristone REMS Program. Under the Mifepristone REMS Program, as modified, Mifeprex and its approved generic can be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber.\nThe Mifepristone REMS Program continues to require the Patient Agreement Form and certification of health care providers who prescribe mifepristone.\nWhat was the process for approving the current REMS modification?\nIn 2021, in order to determine whether a modification to the Mifepristone REMS Program was warranted, the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature, other relevant safety and adverse event data, and information provided by advocacy groups, individuals, and the applicants related to the modifications that were under consideration. After conducting this review, the FDA determined that the REMS must be modified to remove the in-person dispensing requirement and add pharmacy certification. In accordance with the typical process for REMS modifications, the FDA sent REMS Modification Notification letters to the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. Following receipt of these letters, the applicants prepared a proposed REMS modification and submitted it to their respective applications.\nWhy did the FDA conduct a review of the Mifepristone REMS Program in 2021?\nThe agency\u2019s comprehensive review of the Mifepristone REMS Program, which led to the agency\u2019s December 16, 2021, decision that a modification was required, was related to the litigation in Purcell v. Becerra (previously Chelius v. Becerra). On May 7, 2021, the FDA and the plaintiffs in Purcell filed a joint motion to stay that litigation, which involves the single, shared system REMS for Mifeprex and its approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. The court granted the stay on May 7, 2021. The Purcell case was reopened on February 28, 2023, and the plaintiffs now challenge the modified Mifepristone REMS Program. The agency generally does not comment on pending litigation.\nWas there a change in the reported adverse events during the pandemic when the in-person dispensing requirement was not enforced?\nNo. There were periods when the in-person dispensing requirement was not being enforced. First, from July 13, 2020, until January 12, 2021, the FDA was enjoined from enforcing the in-person dispensing requirement by an injunction issued in the ACOG v. FDA litigation, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. On April 12, 2021, the agency stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the in-person dispensing requirement during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA analyzed postmarketing data to determine if there was a difference in adverse events between periods when in-person dispensing was and was not enforced. Based on this review, the agency concluded that there did not appear to be a difference in adverse events between periods when in-person dispensing was and was not enforced\nLitigation and Other Legal Issues\nWas the Mifepristone REMS Program modified in 2023 in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization?\nNo. The agency\u2019s comprehensive review of the Mifepristone REMS Program, which led to the 2021 decision that a modification was required, is related to the litigation in Purcell v. Becerra (previously Chelius v. Becerra). In accordance with the typical process for REMS modifications, the FDA sent REMS Modification Notification letters to the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg. Following receipt of these letters, the applicants prepared a proposed REMS modification and submitted it to their respective applications. The FDA reviewed the REMS modification supplements submitted by the applicants in the Mifepristone REMS Program and approved a REMS modification that removes the in-person dispensing requirement and adds pharmacy certification.\nWas the Mifepristone REMS Program modified in 2023 in response to state abortion laws?\nNo. See response to Question 33.\nWhat happens if a state refuses to allow mifepristone to be prescribed for medical termination of pregnancy?\nAny questions regarding the application of state law should be directed to the Department of Justice.\nWhat is the status of the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lawsuit about the approval of mifepristone?\nOn November 18, 2022, the FDA and HHS were sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and other plaintiffs. In June 2024, the Supreme Court held that the original plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA\u2019s actions, and the original plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims in November 2024. Several states (Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas) intervened in the case before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The agency generally does not comment on pending litigation."

      "text": "Information about Mifepristone for Medical Termination of Pregnancy Through Ten Weeks Gestation\nMifeprex (mifepristone) and its generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg (collectively mifepristone) are approved, in a regimen with misoprostol, to end an intrauterine pregnancy through ten weeks gestation (70 days or less since the first day of a patient\u2019s last menstrual period). The FDA first approved Mifeprex in 2000 and approved a generic version of Mifeprex, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, in 2019.\nRisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Information\nMifeprex and its generic, Mifepristone Tablets, 200 mg, are available under a single, shared system risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), known as the Mifepristone REMS Program, which sets forth the requirements that must be followed for prescribing and dispensing mifepristone for medical termination of pregnancy through ten weeks gestation.\nUnder the Mifepristone REMS Program, mifepristone must be prescribed by certified prescribers and must be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber. Under the Mifepristone REMS Program, mifepristone may be dispensed in person or by mail.\nMifeprex was first approved in 2000 with restrictions to assure its safe use. Mifeprex was deemed to have in effect an approved REMS under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. In 2019, at the same time the FDA approved the generic version of Mifeprex, the agency approved the Mifepristone REMS Program, a single, shared system REMS for mifepristone products for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation.\nIn 2021, after conducting a review of the Mifepristone REMS Program, the FDA determined that the available data and information support modification of the REMS to reduce burden on the health care delivery system and to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. After reviewing supplemental applications from the applicants for Mifeprex and the approved generic, the FDA approved a modification to the Mifepristone REMS Program on January 3, 2023. As modified, the Mifepristone REMS Program includes the following requirements, among others:\n- Mifepristone must be prescribed by a health care provider that meets certain qualifications and is certified under the Mifepristone REMS Program.\n- In order to become certified to prescribe mifepristone, health care providers must complete a Prescriber Agreement Form.\n- The Patient Agreement Form must be reviewed with and signed by the patient and the health care provider, and the risks of the mifepristone treatment regimen must be fully explained to the patient before mifepristone is prescribed.\n- The patient must be provided with a copy of the Patient Agreement Form and mifepristone Medication Guide (FDA-approved information for patients).\n- Mifepristone may only be dispensed by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or by a certified pharmacy on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber.\n- To become certified to dispense mifepristone, pharmacies must complete a Pharmacy Agreement Form.\n- Certified pharmacies must be able to ship mifepristone using a shipping service that provides tracking information.\n- Certified pharmacies must ensure mifepristone is dispensed to the patient in a timely manner.\nTo learn more, please see Questions and Answers on Mifepristone for Medical Termination of Pregnancy Through Ten Weeks Gestation.\nFDA Does Not Recommend Buying Mifepristone Online\nMifepristone prescribed under the Mifepristone REMS Program will be dispensed to you by your health care provider (or someone under the supervision of your health care provider), or by a pharmacy to which your health care provider has submitted your prescription. You can ask your health care provider whether they are certified in the Mifepristone REMS Program (or working under the supervision of someone who is). The FDA does not recommend purchasing mifepristone outside of the Mifepristone REMS Program \u2013 e.g. buying it online or personally transporting it from a foreign country. If a person does so, they would be bypassing important safeguards specifically designed to protect their health. Prescription medicines that are approved for use in the United States have been reviewed for safety, effectiveness, and quality by the FDA, and are subject to FDA-regulated manufacturing controls, including inspection of manufacturing facilities. Generally, prescription medicines purchased from foreign sources are not the FDA-approved versions. The FDA does not have regulatory oversight of prescription medicines from outside the legitimate U.S. drug supply chain; therefore, the FDA cannot ensure the safety, effectiveness, or quality of those medications.\nTo learn more about buying drugs safely, please see BeSafeRx: Your Source for Online Pharmacy Information\nRelated Information\n- Questions and Answers on Mifepristone for Medical Termination of Pregnancy Through Ten Weeks Gestation\n- Previous REMS\n- Historical Information on Mifepristone (marketed as Mifeprex)\nLabeling and Other Important Information\nMifeprex (mifepristone)\n- Mifeprex Prescribing Information\n- Mifeprex Medication Guide\n- Mifeprex Patient Agreement Form\n- Mifeprex Prescriber Agreement Form\n- Mifeprex Pharmacy Agreement Form\nMifepristone Tablets, 200 mg"

      "url": "https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020",
      "text": "New Guttmacher Institute research from the Monthly Abortion Provision Study shows that there were approximately 642,700 medication abortions in the United States in 2023, accounting for 63% of all abortions in the formal health care system. This is an increase from 2020, when medication abortions accounted for 53% of all abortions.\nMedication abortion using mifepristone was first approved for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and reliance on medication abortion has increased steadily as it has become more accessible over time. The two-drug combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is the most common medication abortion regimen offered by US providers, and decades of research have established that medication abortion using mifepristone is highly safe and effective. Increased access to and use of medication abortion is likely one reason why the overall number of abortions in the formal health care system increased 10% nationally between 2020 and 2023.\nThe medication abortion counts for 2023 do not include self-managed medication abortions that take place outside of the formal health care system or abortion medication mailed to people in states with total abortion bans. While there are no comprehensive data on the number of self-managed medication abortions in the United States, evidence suggests they have been increasing in the past several years. Therefore, the total count of medication abortions nationally is higher than our count of those offered within the formal health care system.\nUnfortunately, gains in access to and use of medication abortion are at risk. The US Supreme Court will hear a case on March 26\u2014Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA\u2014that uses low-quality science to challenge access to medication abortion using mifepristone. The Court could restrict the ability to mail mifepristone directly to patients and reinstate the requirement for the drug to be provided in person. If outdated and medically unnecessary restrictions are placed on the provision of mifepristone\u2014in contrast with the FDA\u2019s evidence-based protocol\u2014access to abortion across the country would be greatly impacted.\nMedication Abortion Has Become More Widely Available\nFor many people, medication abortion is more accessible than a procedural abortion. In 2021 (the most recent year with available data), 40% of facilities known to provide abortion care offered only medication abortion. And, starting in 2021, the FDA lifted medically unnecessary restrictions that had required in-person provision of mifepristone. That regulation change, which the FDA finalized in January 2023, meant that health care providers and online pharmacies could mail abortion medication to patients, including those who live far from a provider or are otherwise unable to make an in-person visit. In addition, brick-and-mortar pharmacies can now become certified to dispense and fill mifepristone prescriptions, so access is expected to continue growing.\nThe number of US providers offering a telemedicine consultation\u2014by video, phone call, text or online platform\u2014and mailing abortion pills increased from 7% of all providers known to offer medication abortion in 2020 to 31% in 2022. Online-only clinics, after first appearing as a new type of abortion provider in 2021, accounted for 8% of all abortions provided within the formal health care system in the first six months of 2023.\nMedication abortion provided via telemedicine is as safe and effective as provision in a health care facility. Offering options besides in-person care can reduce, or even remove, some of the secondary costs related to seeking an abortion, such as transportation, child care and missed wages from taking time off work. Like with other types of health care, having the option to access abortion care via telemedicine allows for more flexibility and can expand person-centered care by meeting patients where they want to be served.\nNot All People Prefer Medication Abortion Over Procedural Abortion\nWhile broader access to medication abortion has likely contributed to its increased use, it does not necessarily indicate that all people are getting their preferred method.\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision in June 2022 ended a right to abortion nationally, there has been an increase in patients at clinics in states where abortion continues to be available. Sixteen percent of abortion patients traveled out of state for an abortion in 2023, and there has been increased demand on providers in states that border one of the 14 states where abortion is totally banned. At the same time, abortion has also increased among residents in almost all of these bordering states. In some places, these developments have led to wait times of two weeks or longer for abortion care.\nSome individuals may opt to access care through telehealth options to avoid long wait times for appointments, even if they would have preferred in-clinic care. Even at brick-and-mortar clinics, wait times may be shorter for medication abortion than procedural abortion since the pills can be offered by methods such as \u201cquick pick-up.\u201d Finally, for some patients, the closest abortion provider may only offer medication abortion, limiting their access to a procedural abortion unless they can travel to a clinic where it is offered.\nWhen procedural abortion is harder to access relative to medication abortion, the impact of those restricted options falls hardest on groups of people historically marginalized within the health care system. For example, research suggests that Black individuals, people who have had a prior abortion and those with incomes below the federal poverty level are less likely than other groups to prefer, and to have, a medication abortion (vs. a procedural abortion).\nState Restrictions on Use of Medication Abortion\nAnti-abortion policymakers have been working to restrict access to abortion care on many fronts. Besides the 14 states that are enforcing a total ban on abortion, five states where abortion remains legal until at least six weeks\u2019 gestation have laws that restrict access to medication abortion via telemedicine. Arizona, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin require that a patient being prescribed medication abortion have an in-person visit with a physician, and Arizona and North Carolina also ban mailing medication abortion pills to a patient. Furthermore, 15 states require medication abortion to be provided by a physician, despite evidence that advanced practice clinicians can provide it safely, as they do in other states.\nIt Is Critical to Ensure Full Access to Medication Abortion\nMedication abortion has proven to be a game changer in expanding abortion care in the United States. Unfortunately, legal attacks and restrictive policies continue to challenge access. When the Supreme Court rules on the case challenging access to mifepristone this spring, it will have to decide whether to ignore the FDA and reimpose unnecessary barriers to access or to respect the scientific evidence that mifepristone is safe and effective.\nAny return to restrictions on medication abortion provision via telemedicine would be detrimental for people who either prefer or only have access to abortion using telemedicine. While the current court case only affects use of mifepristone\u2014and a misoprostol-only regimen is also a safe and effective method of medication abortion\u2014everyone seeking an abortion should have access to the full range of safe, effective options.\nMethodology\nData on medication abortion for 2023 are from Guttmacher\u2019s Monthly Abortion Provision Study, which produces national and state estimates of the number of abortions provided within the formal health care system in the United States based on data collected from samples of abortion providers. Questions about medication abortion were included in versions of the survey distributed to providers in August and September 2023 and in February 2024 (with the latter asking providers for annual medication abortion figures for 2023). Estimates include abortions provided at brick-and-mortar facilities (including those that use telehealth) and online-only providers. These estimates do not include abortions obtained outside of the formal health care sector or any abortions\u2014whether self-managed or provided by out-of-state clinicians\u2014involving medication mailed to states with total abortion bans."

      "text": "This fact sheet was written by Talia Curhan. It was edited by Peter Ephross.\nThe landscape of abortion access in the United States continues to shift rapidly in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion. Since then, many state legislatures have created new abortion restrictions and bans, and many have begun enforcing existing ones. Research has long indicated that abortion bans of all types have the greatest impact on people in marginalized groups. Individuals who face systemic racism and other forms of oppression may encounter compounding barriers to obtaining an abortion.\nMany state laws provide some limited exceptions to total bans and bans based on gestational duration. These exceptions are often described as compromises, but they obscure the harm of abortion bans. Most exceptions are designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements.\nThe abortion restrictions detailed below represent some of the ways state laws and policies may prohibit or restrict a person\u2019s access to abortion care. Guttmacher\u2019s interactive map on state abortion policies and state legislation tracker contain additional information about current state abortion laws and restrictions on access.\nDefinitions\nGestational duration: An estimate of the length of time a person has been pregnant. This is typically defined as the number of weeks since the person\u2019s last menstrual period (LMP), though some states define it as the number of weeks since conception. State legislation often uses gestational duration to define the arbitrary timelines of abortion bans and restrictions. Most state abortion statutes reference \u201cprobable gestational age,\u201d which is typically determined by LMP; the weeks listed in the table below refer to LMP unless marked otherwise.\nViability: A nonmedical term used to describe the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus, which is generally determined to be between 24 and 26 weeks LMP. Many statutory bans define limits on abortion based on the concept of viability.\nGeneral health: Determined by a health care provider licensed to provide abortions and may include a pregnant person\u2019s mental and emotional health.\nPhysical health: Applies only to the physical function of the patient\u2019s body and may even be restricted to major bodily functions.\nLethal fetal anomaly: Fetal condition likely to be fatal before or shortly after birth."

  "argos_summary": "Costco has decided not to dispense abortion pills, specifically mifepristone, after facing pressure from both pro-choice and anti-abortion activists. The company cited a lack of consumer demand as the reason for its decision, which has been met with mixed reactions from various groups. While some religious organizations praised Costco's choice, advocates for reproductive rights expressed disappointment, arguing that it undermines access to safe and effective healthcare options. This decision comes amid ongoing legal and political battles surrounding abortion access in the United States.",
