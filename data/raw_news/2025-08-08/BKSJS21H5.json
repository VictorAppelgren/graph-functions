  "title": "Why space (yes, outer space) is a much bigger business opportunity than you think",
  "description": "How to take advantage of the next transformative business frontier: space",
  "content": "Morgan Stanley projects the space economy will hit $1.8 trillion by 2035. Yet most companies still don\u2019t have a strategy for it. Last quarter alone, multiple space startups secured seven-figure funding rounds. NASA\u2019s Artemis program also hit a major milestone. This is a very real, trillion-dollar economy forming in real time, and the window to get in early is closing fast.\n\nCritically, space is the first truly infinite domain of commerce. Unlike Earth-based markets, it offers endless potential for new infrastructure, new services, and new economies to emerge. And while many are distracted by AI or supply chain chaos, the next massive growth platform is quietly taking shape above our heads. It\u2019s not just rockets and rich guys. It\u2019s agriculture, R&D, and your next competitor When most people think of space, they picture billionaires in zero gravity or cinematic sci-fi. But the reality is that it\u2019s becoming a critical infrastructure layer for future business, just as the internet did 30 years ago. The parallels are striking. In the early 1990s, many leaders saw the internet as a novelty. Today, it\u2019s the backbone of the global economy. Space is on the same path, but with even broader implications. From biotech to agriculture to cybersecurity, space is already critically transforming industries. Biotech companies like Redwire and Varda Space Industries are leveraging microgravity for drug development and bioprinting, enabling breakthroughs not possible in Earth-bound labs.\n\nAgriculture firms are using real-time satellite imagery to optimize water use, detect crop stress, and improve yield forecasting. Platforms like Planet Labs and Descartes Labs are making precision agriculture scalable and climate-resilient. Cybersecurity providers have also been looking beyond Earth for years, as satellite networks become part of critical infrastructure. Companies like SpiderOak are pioneering zero-trust security models for space assets. The market is heating up and capital is flowing in In 2023 investors poured $12.5 billion into space startups globally, despite broader tech market pullbacks. Startups focused on in-space manufacturing, small satellite constellations, and launch technologies are leading the charge. The Artemis program is unlocking new lunar and deep space opportunities, while commercial players like SpaceX and Rocket Lab are slashing launch costs.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are expanding rapidly. The Department of Defense is investing in space-based logistics and mobility. NASA is funding space-based solar power and commercial space stations. Private equity firms are acquiring ground infrastructure and launch supply chains. The smart money is building and pivoting, quickly. Four ways to make space part of your growth strategy Meanwhile, too many companies and policymakers remain tethered to earthbound thinking. The point of tapping into this market isn\u2019t to become a \u201cspace company.\u201d Most companies won\u2019t build satellites or spacecraft. Instead, they\u2019ll find new ways to leverage the unique conditions and infrastructure of space to improve their products, services, and operations on Earth. Or they\u2019ll take existing products and services and find ways to adapt them for space. Here\u2019s how to ensure you\u2019re positioned to lead in this rapidly expanding trillion-dollar market:\n\u2022 Start thinking like a space vertical. You don\u2019t have to build rockets to benefit from space, but you do need to understand how the industry works. Study space value chains and learn where your products, services, or capabilities might fit in. Even surprising players can break into the market. For example, a small watchmaker in Albuquerque was tapped to build components for space-bound hardware. This wasn\u2019t because they were in aerospace, but because they solved a unique precision problem.\n\u2022 Tap into satellite-enabled insights to optimize operations. If you\u2019re not already, look into ways your business can uniquely leverage satellite data for actionable insights, whether it\u2019s tracking supply chain bottlenecks, improving precision in agriculture, or identifying untapped markets with geospatial analysis.\n\u2022 Codevelop with space startups tackling niche challenges. Consider partnering with startups innovating in microgravity manufacturing, on-orbit servicing, or space-based energy solutions. Explore shared R&D that aligns with your industry\u2019s specific needs, like 3D-printed components or novel materials.\n\u2022 Train your teams on space-driven opportunities. Upskill your workforce by collaborating with universities or space-focused research institutions. Equip your employees to identify how advancements like quantum communications or hypersonic transport could create revenue streams in your sector. It\u2019s time to adapt, innovate, and lead. The companies that embrace space as a critical business opportunity will not only future-proof themselves but also define the next chapter of economic history. Every major technological revolution has created winners and losers. Space will be no different.",

      "text": "On March 23, 2025, NASA successfully completed a major milestone for the Artemis II mission with the integration of the core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This achievement marks another critical step toward launching the first crewed mission under NASA\u2019s Artemis program. The successful integration was reported in a post by NASA on March 24, 2025, showcasing the steady progress of the Artemis II mission (NASA, 2025).\nThis integration process brought the core stage together with the solid rocket boosters, which were stacked and secured in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The core stage, measuring 212 feet in height, is a significant component of the SLS rocket, which will carry the Orion spacecraft and its crew on their 10-day journey around the Moon as part of Artemis II. The Artemis II flight will not only test the mission\u2019s systems and hardware but also set the stage for NASA\u2019s future deep space exploration missions, including human missions to the Moon and eventually Mars.\nThe Core Stage: Backbone of the SLS Rocket\nThe core stage of the SLS rocket is the backbone of the entire launch system, serving as the central component that supports the launch vehicle stage adapter, interim cryogenic propulsion stage, Orion stage adapter, and the Orion spacecraft. The integration of this essential component is crucial to ensuring that all parts of the mission come together seamlessly.\nUsing one of the five overhead cranes at Kennedy\u2019s Vehicle Assembly Building, the team at NASA\u2019s Exploration Ground Systems Program, along with their primary contractor Amentum, lifted the core stage and carefully placed it between the solid rocket boosters, which had already been stacked atop the mobile launcher. This was a carefully coordinated operation that required precision and expertise, with the core stage now serving as the central unit holding all other critical components for the mission.\nOnce in place, the core stage will be prepared for the next phase of integration, including the addition of the Orion stage adapter, which will be lifted and secured atop the core stage in the coming weeks. This step is essential to complete the structure that will support the Orion spacecraft as it journeys to the Moon.\nThe Artemis II Mission: Paving the Path to Deep Space Exploration\nArtemis II represents the first crewed mission under the Artemis program, which aims to establish sustainable human exploration on the Moon by the mid-2020s and eventually send astronauts to Mars. Artemis II will take four astronauts on a mission that will orbit the Moon for 10 days, testing the essential hardware and systems that will support human missions to the lunar surface.\nThis test flight will help confirm the functionality and safety of the entire spacecraft and the launch vehicle, which will be critical as NASA moves forward with its plans for landing astronauts on the Moon. The mission\u2019s success will provide the foundational data necessary to ensure that future human space exploration missions are not only feasible but sustainable.\nThe SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft are central to NASA\u2019s vision for deep space exploration, and the integration of these critical components is just one step in the journey to send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit. The Artemis II mission is particularly important because it will test the spacecraft\u2019s performance in deep space and provide the first opportunities to evaluate human spaceflight beyond the Earth-Moon system.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Artemis II\nNow that the core stage integration is complete, the next steps involve further assembly and integration of the remaining components. The next significant task will be the addition of the Orion stage adapter, which will support the Orion spacecraft during launch. Following this, the rocket will undergo a series of tests to ensure that all systems are operating correctly before the launch.\nNASA engineers and ground systems teams will continue to work meticulously to prepare the spacecraft and rocket for flight. These preparations include finalizing the integration of the cryogenic propulsion stage, performing engine tests, and ensuring the performance of the SLS rocket\u2019s key systems. Once these steps are completed, the Artemis II mission will be ready for launch, marking a monumental step in humanity\u2019s efforts to return to the Moon and beyond."

      "text": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 The Space Development Agency has awarded SpiderOak, a leader in space cybersecurity software, an Other Transactional Authority agreement to research integration of the company\u2019s OrbitSecure software suite into the agency\u2019s contribution to the Space Force\u2019s Rapid Resilient Command and Control effort. SpiderOak\u2019s end-to-end zero-trust design can enhance the cybersecurity of command and control networks as the Space Force augments its traditional Satellite Control Network with commercial and allied networks.\nIn partnership with the Space Development Agency, SpiderOak will research integrating OrbitSecure software to enable expanded government use of commercial, civil, and allied ground infrastructure. By employing OrbitSecure\u2019s patented variable-trust mechanisms that allow data to travel securely on networks and infrastructure with different owners and variable-security protocols, the project will provide insight into how to attain more resilient command and control.\nAs its name suggests, OrbitSecure is also purpose-built for the limited size, weight, power, and connectivity constraints of orbital operations, and has been deployed to satellites. OrbitSecure is the zero-trust solution that offers complete ground-satellite-ground spaceflight heritage. SpiderOak demonstrated OrbitSecure on a Ball Aerospace prototype payload in June 2023 and on the International Space Station using Amazon Web Services\u2019 Snowcone edge computing device provided by Axiom Space in July 2023.\nSpiderOak\u2019s software secures any type of information transiting in or through space assets at the data level rather than the network level, allowing organizations like the Space Development Agency to securely employ commercial network and ground station options for command and control. This flexibility to dynamically augment the Satellite Control Network with non-government resources securely \u2013 called \u201chybrid-space architecture\u201d \u2013 also promises to reduce data latency and achieve greater resiliency against potential cyber and physical threats to satellites.\nRead More | PRNEWSWIRE"
