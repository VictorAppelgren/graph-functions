  "title": "Top Used Luxury Cars Worth Buying in 2025",
  "description": "These reliable, value-packed used luxury cars make the smartest buys for 2025.",
  "content": "Luxury cars don\u2019t always have to come with sky-high ownership costs. In 2025, the used market is full of premium models that balance comfort, advanced features, and standout styling with proven reliability and strong value retention.\n\nFrom sleek sedans to spacious SUVs, many luxury vehicles now offer the prestige and performance of high-end brands without the steep new-car price tag. The right used pick can deliver leather-lined cabins, advanced tech, and refined driving dynamics for less than you\u2019d expect.\n\nThese value-focused luxury cars prove you can enjoy upscale motoring without overspending, making them smart buys for drivers who want both reliability and sophistication.\n\nThe CT5 is Cadillac's compact luxury car, going up against the likes of the BMW 3-Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. While it may not be the most outright luxurious options, it has a ton of character and its optional twin-turbo V-6 is a ton of fun. You can pick up a 2020 CT5 for an average price of $31,844.\n\nCadillac is quietly one of the most reliable American brands there is, benefiting from years of tried and tested engineering at General Motors. While general reliability is good, there have been some serious recalls issued for this model, so make sure that they've been seen to before you drive one off the lot.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $9,819 (CarEdge)\n\nIf you're looking for something that oozes sophistication and is loaded with modern tech features, then Mercedes is the way to go. Thanks to some pretty heavy initial depreciation, you can get a C-Class that is less than five years old for an average price of $29,950. That's nothing considering the level of luxury you get.\n\nMercedes-Benz is a brand that doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to reliability. Some models stand out, though, including the C-Class. However, be aware that you're in for hefty maintenance bills, and you aren't going to want to skimp on any of them because that is when you start running into problems.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: N/A (CarEdge)\n\nGetting a mid-size luxury car, even one from a previous generation, for an average price of $19,499 is already a pretty attractive proposition. The A6 is a premium sedan that pretty perfectly walks the line between grown-up styling and engaging driving dynamics, offering the best of both worlds.\n\nReliability and Audi are not synonymous, with the brand's track record working against it in most cases. However, certain powertrain and model combinations work out better than others, with the 2018 A6 being a pretty sturdy model.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $10,015 (CarEdge)\n\nIt has always been said that the perfect premium sports sedan is the 3-Series, and we couldn't agree more. While everyone has their preferences over which generation is best, we think that you get a pretty good deal with the 2021 model year. It isn't too old and can still be had at a bargain, with an average list price of $29,465.\n\nWhere some still think of BMW as an unreliable brand plagued by oil leaks and the like, modern BMWs are actually among the most reliable cars you can buy according to reliability studies. Just note that taking care of these sedans is a costly affair, with CarEdge estimating its ten-year maintenance costs to be $4,369 above average for its segment.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $14,159 (CarEdge)\n\nVolvo is a luxury brand that often gets overlooked, with the perception being that they are somewhat boring. While they might not be the sportiest options, they feature luxury and technology that is on par, if not better, than most rivals. A 2020 S60 can be had for an average price of $22,644.\n\nOne of Volvo's biggest areas of focus is quality. To the Swedish brand, something built well is luxurious. Hence, the S60 is easily among the most reliable vehicles in its class. Some owners do report that you should look out for transmission issues when buying used, so be sure to test drive your model thoroughly.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: N/A (CarEdge)\n\nThe A4 sits sandwiched between the BMW 3-Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The BMW is the more playful and engaging sedan and the C-Class is more luxurious. For those looking for a happy medium, the A4 is the way to go. You can get a 2018 model for an average price of $17,786.\n\nOwners of the 2018 A4 have a lot of good things to say about the sedan, with the general consensus being that they are built to last. However, Audi is a brand that requires pretty vigilant maintenance if you want it to remain reliable.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $9,649 (CarEdge)\n\nThe 4-Series is the most popular non-SUV model in BMW's lineup, and it's not hard to see why. It takes the proven formula of the 3-Series and expands on it, coming as either a coupe or a sleek four-door fastback. They are a little more expensive that 3-Series sedans though, with the average 2021 4-Series listing at around $35,047.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BMW has come a long way when it comes to reliability, and modern models compete with the most sturdy vehicles on the road. While data regarding maintenance costs of the 4-Series is hard to come by, you can expect it to be pretty similar to the 3-Series considering they share most of their mechanical components.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: N/A (CarEdge)\n\nGenesis burst on to the scene, launching their first model back in 2019. Since then, we can say that they pretty easily compete with top brands, at least in terms of luxury and quality, while being much more affordable. The G80 is the sweet spot in our minds, and a 2022 currently lists at around $35,184.\n\nWhile many seem to have a grudge against Korean cars, data suggests that over the long term they experience fairly few issues on average. Genesis benefits from the corporate power of Hyundai, meaning that most of their mechanical components have spent years on the market in other cars.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $7,679 (CarEdge)\n\nIt's no surprise to find a Lexus this high up on this list, with the brand being praised as one of the most reliable out there and their value being undeniable. The ES may not be nearly as fun or sporty as other mid-size luxury sedans, but it is packed with luxury and comfort features. At an average price of $32,447, the 2021 model is a bargain, especially knowing they depreciate fairly slowly.\n\nAccording to a number of studies, Lexus is the most reliable car brand that you can buy today. They have even surpassed their mainstream sibling, Toyota. The ES benefits from this, ranking as one of the most reliable sedans on the road.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $5,945 (CarEdge)\n\nSmaller and lighter than the ES, the IS is by far the more popular car. This compact sedan is better able to compete with sportier rivals, with a great range of powertrains and the option of rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. At the same time, it delivers the plush accommodations that Lexus is known for. They hold their value well, with a used 2022 IS 350 costing an average of $37,137.\n\nLexus' reliability is undeniable, and the IS represents the best they have to offer, with multiple model years ranking among the most reliable vehicles ever built. Alongside peace of mind when it comes to longevity, Lexus also offers the most affordable maintenance costs of any luxury brand.\n\u2022 Est. Maintenance Cost During The First 10 Years: $5,901 (CarEdge)\n\u2022 Worst IS Year To Buy Used: 2006",

      "text": "There are few cars that consistently rank in the top spots of reliability lists. However, it's almost guaranteed to be a Japanese car. Lexus is one manufacturer that seems to get it right every time. Between official rankings and real owner satisfaction surveys, this brand has a strong history of building reliable cars. Now, these used Lexus models are luxury car bargains that require little maintenance.\nLexus\n- Founded\n- 1989\n- Founder\n- Eiji Toyoda, Toyota\n- Headquarters\n- Nagoya, Japan\n- Current CEO\n- Takashi Watanabe (President)\nAnother benefit of scoring highly in every category is that they stay desirable, meaning Japanese luxury vehicles offer great resale value. Well, it's a benefit for sellers. Some buyers might prefer the Lexus lifestyle on a budget.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various authoritative sources, including Lexus, J.D. Power, and Kelley Blue Book.

However, the 1993 Lexus GS is pure nostalgia. Though its engine required some TLC, its bulletproof design pulled through to keep this luxury Japanese sedan on the road for hundreds of thousands of miles. We were only able to find a 224,000-mile example, but there's bound to be someone driving one with a much higher odometer reading.\n1993 Lexus GS reliability\n- Highest Mileage Ever Recorded: 224,000 on LexusOwnersClub\n- Edmunds Owner Score: 4.5\n- Kelley Blue Book Consumer Score: 4.8\n2 2003 Lexus IS300\n2003 Lexus IS300 performance specs\n|\nEngine |\n3L inline-6 |\n|\nHorsepower |\n215 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n218 lb-ft |\nAs the smallest sedan in the Lexus stable, the Lexus IS is often underrated.

Despite only paying $1,400 to buy it, and around $4,000 to keep it roadworthy, Matt surpassed one million miles in his LS, proving that proper care goes a long way.\n1991 Lexus LS400 reliability\n- Highest Mileage Ever Recorded: over 1 million miles by Matt Farah\n- Edmunds Owner Score: 4.5\n- Kelley Blue Book Consumer Score: 4.7\n10 Japanese Luxury Cars That Define Elegance and Performance\nThese are 10 Japanese luxury cars renowned for their performance design, and exceptional craftsmanship.\n4 2007 Lexus ES\n2007 Lexus ES performance specs\n|\nEngine |\n3.5L V6 |\n|\nHorsepower |\n272 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n254 lb-ft |\nAnother reliable Lexus that has outlived most of its competition is the 2007 Lexus ES. Owners rave about how good their ES' are, and that's backed-up by J.D. Power and Kelley Blue Book ratings. What's more, RepairPal estimates annual maintenance costs as low as $380.

The RX wanted for nothing; it had the looks, the status, and an attractive price tag. Even now, there are lots of these, new and old, on the road with happy owners. The 3.5-liter V6 only produced 270 horsepower, but it's well-engineered.

Gaining modern tech on top of a lush interior and a power boost for its robust V6 makes it a must-have. Plus, it's low maintenance at just $415 per year, and should pass the 200,000-mile mark with minimal effort.

      "text": "If you want a luxury car that is just as fun to drive as it is comfortable, then the compact sedan segment is arguably the best place to look. Among the many fantastic sporty options available is a model that has been around for decades, consistently setting a benchmark for all others to live up to.\nCompact luxury sedans are meant to be performance machines with finely crafted interiors. To be successful in this segment, a balance between speed and opulence needs to be struck. One German brand is renowned for walking this line, and the car that made them famous easily rivals every other small sedan out there.\nWe take a look at the German sports sedan that continues to set the standard for the luxury compact segment in 2025. We explore how much it costs and how you should spec it to get the most for your money. We also detail how its interior and performance combine to make it the best in its class.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from BMW websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\n10 Luxury Sedans That Offer the Best Value for Your Money\nBlending premium comfort, performance, and features at prices that make sense.\nBMW's 3-Series Is The King Of Premium Compact Sedans\nIf you're looking for a mix of sporty driving dynamics and luxurious interior features, then the luxury compact car segment is definitely the sweet spot. It is incredibly competitive and new rivals are constantly popping up, but despite all this, the BMW 3-Series still sits at the top of the stack.\n2025 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModels |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\n330i |\n$45,950 |\n|\n330i xDrive |\n$47,950 |\n|\nM340i |\n$60,200 |\n|\nM340i xDrive |\n$62,200 |\nThe 3-Series is certainly not the cheapest option in its segment, with rivals from the likes of Acura, Volvo, and Lexus fighting it out for that title. Cheapest does not mean best, though, and the 3-Series sedan feels worth every penny. From an engaging drive to a plush cabin, it ticks all the right boxes.\nFor the 2025 model year, BMW has made some small enhancements to their compact sedan. One of the biggest upgrades is the fact that it now comes with the updated iDrive 8.5 infotainment software, which we'll get into later. A number of new paint options and wheel designs are also available, along with a reworked steering wheel and an updated dashboard. Finally, the plug-in hybrid 330e has been removed from the lineup.\nBest Value Model\nWe can't deny the allure of the M340i, with its intoxicating inline-six and fantastic body control. However, we think that the base 330i delivers enough power and excitement. Unless you really need the all-wheel drive system for its additional traction and control in slippery conditions, we'd stick with the rear-wheel drive model as it is simply more fun.\nTo get the ultimate 3-Series, though, we'd throw on some additional packages. First, start with the $2,550 M Sport Package. This adds some additional styling elements, a ton of interior upgrades, and a unique suspension tune. We'd also tack on the $2,450 Premium Package, which adds a ton of tech, including a heads-up display, a power-operated tailgate, a heated steering wheel and a number of additional driver-assist features.\nWarranty and Maintenance\n- Limited Warranty - Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Powertrain Warranty - Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Complimentary Maintenance - Three Years or 36,000 Miles\nWhile BMW doesn't have a class-leading warranty plan, it is good enough to compare with rivals like Audi and Mercedes-Benz. Rivals like Genesis do offer more comprehensive packages. What is most impressive, though, is that your first three maintenance visits are covered by the German brand, meaning that you don't have to worry about additional costs in your first three years.\n10 Affordable Luxury Cars That Are Loaded With Tech Features\nLuxury meets tech without the high price\u2014these sleek, feature-packed cars deliver premium experiences at a surprisingly affordable cost.\nYou Get a Choice Of Two Fantastic Engines In The 3-Series\nAt its heart, the 3-Series is a sports sedan. It comes in two different forms, the 330i and the racier M340i, but either way, you're going to get a car that is exceptionally rewarding to drive. When you're not pushing it hard, though, it offers a comfortable and refined ride that makes your daily commute a dream.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Six |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n386 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n398 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.2 Seconds |\n3.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n156 MPH |\n150 MPH |\nYou can either get a 330i with an overachieving turbocharged four-banger or an M340i with a smooth turbo inline-six. Both come fitted with one of the smoothest shifting automatic transmissions out there. You can get rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel drive, but we think the former is more enjoyable. Even if you live somewhere it snows, we'd go for the cheaper rear-drive model and get a set of winter tyres.\nRegardless of which model you go for, the 3-Series is quick, you just choose how quick you want it to be. Its ability to transition from smooth, quiet, and refined driving to raucous and playful fun in an instant is incredibly impressive. It really walks the line between comfort and performance better than any of its core competitors do.\nFuel Economy\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\n330i |\n28 MPG |\n35 MPG |\n31 MPG |\n|\nM340i |\n27 MPG |\n33 MPG |\n29 MPG |\n|\n330i xDrive |\n26 MPG |\n34 MPG |\n29 MPG |\n|\nM340i xDrive |\n26 MPG |\n33 MPG |\n29 MPG |\nDespite having such a hard focus on performance, the 3-Series is actually impressively efficient. This is especially true of the slick six-cylinder in the M340i, delivering much more power without sacrificing fuel economy by all that much. Every model other than the rear-wheel drive 330i is capable of 29 miles per gallon for combined highway and city driving.\nSafety and Driver Assists\n- Forward Collision Warning with Automatic Emergency Braking\n- Blind Spot Monitoring\n- Active Cruise Control with Stop and Go\n- Evasion Aid\n- Parking Assistant Plus\nThis is one of the few areas where BMW could make some improvements. The German brand is fairly stingy when it comes to standard equipment offered on the 3-Series. While things like automated emergency braking are standard, most of the desirable features are locked behind optional packages.\nThat being said, if you do equip the packages on your 3-Series, which we think is definitely the way to go, you do get some of the most high-tech features available right now. This includes semi-autonomous driving, a system that automatically steers to avoid accidents, and a self-parking function.\nThese Are the Best Used Luxury Sedans Under $25K (That Are Actually Worth the Money)\nThese used sedans under $25,000 blend luxury, performance, and value into one smart, stylish package.\nA Classy Yet Sporty Interior Awaits You In The 3-Series\nJust as the German brand likes to balance the driving dynamics of their cars, their interiors equally walk the line between performance and comfort. This knack for creating premium materials has always been a hallmark of the BMW brand, and the modern 3-Series demonstrates how they continue to lead the way.\nInterior Dimensions and Comfort\n|\nFront Row Headroom |\n38.7 Inches |\n|---|---|\n|\nFront Row Legroom |\n42 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Headroom |\n37.6 Inches |\n|\nSecond Row Legroom |\n35.2 Inches |\n|\nCargo Capacity |\n16.9 Cubic Feet |\nThe 3-Series is pretty spacious for the class that it competes in. Those in the front have tons of room to stretch their legs and will feel cradled by the comfortable sports seats. Those in the back might not be quite as comfortable, but you likely won't hear too many complaints either. Cargo capacity is on the large side for the compact segment as well, with most competitors offering less.\nThe modern design used throughout the BMW's cabin is sleek yet inviting. Build quality is exceptional and a ton of premium materials are used throughout. Heated front and rear seats are available, as are features like ambient interior lighting and a heated steering wheel. Three-zone automatic climate control is also on offer.\nInfotainment and Technology\n- Curved Display with BMW iDrive 8.5\n- Navigation with Real-Time Traffic Info\n- Voice Control with Natural Language Recognition\n- Available Gesture Control\n- Available 16-Speaker Harman Kardon Sound System\nAs is the case for most modern BMWs, the 3-Series makes use of a digital dashboard. This consists of a 12.3-inch digital gauge display and a 14.9-inch infotainment screen which share a single panel. The display is high resolution and response time is fast. The new iDrive 8.5 software is also very easy to navigate.\nTons of features come standard in the 3-Series. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is included, along with in-dash navigation. SiriusXM satellite radio and a 5G Wi-Fi hotspot are also standard kit. Wireless charging, a heads-up display, and a premium Harman Kardon sound system are optional extras."

      "text": "The luxury market is packed with tough competition. Put SUVs to the wayside and focus on cars, and BMW has decimated rivals like Lexus and Cadillac, with the 4-Series standing out as the best-selling luxury car in 2025.\nIf a compelling blend of performance, comfort, and brand prestige is what you're after, then there is no better option. With its balanced styling and enthusiast-driven dynamics, the 4-Series resonates with buyers who want luxury and thrilling performance. It also benefits from broad availability and competitive pricing within its segment.\nBMW continues to set standards in the luxury segment, defining what buyers want through a lineup of fantastic options. We explore the trajectory of the 4-Series to understand how it has set itsefl apart from other luxury cars to be crowned the most popular model in 2025 so far.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA. This article focuses on luxury car sales, excluding crossovers and SUVs.\nWhy This Luxury Compact Sedan Remains the Best Choice Today\nWith timeless design, refined performance, and unbeatable value, this luxury compact sedan continues to set the standard in 2025.\nBMW Tops the Charts, With the 4-Series Leading the Way\nWhen it comes to luxury cars, there are a ton of excellent brands to choose from. Legacy automakers like Lexus and Cadillac continue to dominate, while new players like Genesis continue to surge in popularity. However, only one can stand at the top, and BMW's 4-Series has claimed the spot of bestseller.\nBMW 4-Series Sales\n|\nModel |\nYTD 2025 |\nYTD 2024 |\nQ2 2025 |\nQ2 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\n4-Series |\n23,369 |\n19,935 |\n11,492 |\n11,088 |\nWhile the 3-Series and 5-Series have traditionally been the most popular sedans in BMW's arsenal, the introduction of the 4-Series definitely shook things up. The 3-Series and the 5-Series both have YTD sales just shy of 15,000 units each. Sales figures for the 4-Series do, however, include both the coupe and the four-door Gran Coupe, which does give it an edge over its sedan-only siblings.\nEver since its launch, the 4-Series has seen a steady increase in sales. This year, it saw the biggest increase in Q1, with Q2 showing small but steady growth. Compared to the same period last year, sales of BMW's brilliant machine increased by a whopping 17.2 percent.\nThe 4-Series manages to out-sell some pretty impressive competition. The only other luxury sedan that comes close to its sales figures is the Lexus ES, with 19,181 units of the mid-size Japanese car being sold so far in 2025. The 3-Series and 5-Series take third and fourth spots.\nSUVs Continue to Dominate Sales\n|\nModel |\nUnits Sold in 2025 (So Far) |\n|---|---|\n|\nLexus RX |\n52,888 |\n|\nLexus NX |\n38,253 |\n|\nBMW X5 |\n33,588 |\n|\nMercedes-Benz GLE |\n29,434 |\n|\nMercedes-Benz GLC |\n29,355 |\n|\nBMW X3 |\n29,092 |\n|\nBuick Envision |\n28,737 |\n|\nLexus TX |\n25,147 |\n|\nCadillac Escalade |\n24,375 |\n|\nAudi Q5 |\n22,914 |\nAbove is a list of the ten best-selling luxury vehicles, based on sales reports for the end of Q2; 2025 luxury sedan sales don't come close. While some mainstream sedans, like the Toyota Camry and the Honda Civic, are still selling in massive numbers, it seems that luxury buyers much prefer the SUV layout.\nThese Reliable Used Luxury Sedans Offer Proven Durability\nIf you're after long-term dependability without giving up luxury, these pre-owned sedans stand out for their proven reliability and lasting quality.\nNo Matter What 4-Series You Opt For, You're in For a Good Time\nBMW made a name for itself in the sporting world by delivering generations of sports sedan dominance through the 3-Series. Not that long ago, the brand decided to split the coupe and fastback-styled models from the nameplate, dubbing them the 4-Series. In our opinion, this upgrade in style is worth the premium.\n2026 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\n430i Gran Coupe |\n$50,600 |\n|\n430i Coupe |\n$52,600 |\n|\n430i Convertible |\n$60,600 |\n|\nM440i Gran Coupe |\n$64,400 |\n|\nM440i Coupe |\n$66,300 |\n|\nM440i Convertible |\n$74,400 |\n|\nM4 |\n$81,300 |\nThe 4-Series comes in three different body types. The Gran Coupe is the most affordable, and honestly the best value option in our eyes. A 2026 3-Series has a starting price of $47,500, meaning that you're not paying all that much more for the fastback styling. The coupe costs a bit more, but the markup on the convertible is by far the largest.\nWe think that you'd find the best value by sticking with the Coupe or the Gran Coupe. Deciding between the 430i and the M440i is an incredibly difficult choice and mostly comes down to personal preference. However, the more powerful and focused M440i setup does better suit the coupe in our opinion.\nIf you're looking for the most performance-oriented version of the 4-Series, you're obviously going to want the M4. It only comes in coupe or convertible body styles so as not to intrude on the M3's territory. This tack-focused beast demands a high price, but it delivers a unique driving experience that is hard to find elsewhere.\nWarranties and Maintenance\n- Limited Warranty: Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Powertrain Warranty: Four Years or 50,000 Miles\n- Complimentary Scheduled Maintenance: Three Years or 36,000 Miles\nThe 4-Series has a pretty standard warranty plan for the class in which it competes. It matches what is on offer by its key rivals, except for a few standouts, like the 10-year, 100,000-mile plan offered by Genesis. The German brand does, however, offer some of the best complimentary maintenance out there.\nThis Overlooked Mid-Size Luxury Sedan Oozes Sophistication\nWith sleek styling, a serene cabin, and understated elegance, this mid-size luxury sedan delivers refinement that rivals often overlook.\nIf High Octane Enjoyment is What You're After, the 4-Series Has You Covered\nWhile some other iconic sports sedans have become softer as we move into a new age in the automotive realm, the 4-Series continues to set standards. BMW perfectly walks the line between comfort and high-octane tomfoolery. It is no wonder the nameplate is the basis for the brand's best race cars.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nModel |\n430i |\nM440i |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Six |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n386 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n398 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.6 Seconds |\n4.2 Seconds |\nOpt for the 430i, and you get BMW's turbocharged inline-four, which definitely outperforms expectations. However, if you're chasing thrills, then the smooth yet raucous inline-six in the M440i is the way to go. Both come standard with one of the best automatic transmissions on the market. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and what we'd opt for, with all-wheel drive being optional.\nThe 4-Series is a sporting car first, which means that sometimes the suspension can feel a bit firm, particularly over uneven bits of pavement. You'll soon forget this shortcoming, though, when you put your foot down through twisting sections of road, which is where this finely tuned machine shines best.\nThe M4 Ramps Things Up Even Further\n|\nModel |\nM4 |\nM4 Competition |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nEngine |\n3.0-Liter Twin-Turbo Inline-Six |\n3.0-Liter Twin-Turbo Inline-Six |\n|\nTransmission |\n6-Speed Manual |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n473 HP |\n523 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n406 LB-FT |\n479 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n4.1 Seconds |\n3.4 Seconds |\nThe same roaring twin-turbocharged inline-six sits under the hood of every M4, though it puts out varying amounts of power. The base M4 comes standard with rear-wheel drive and a six-speed manual. The Competition comes in rear-drive or all-wheel drive, with the former putting out slightly less power, delivering 503 horses. Go with the competition, and you lose the option of a manual, instead only getting the eight-speed auto.\nCompared to the standard 4-Series, the M4 is a much more focused machine. Adaptive dampers, adjustable brakes, and an electronically controlled exhaust system are some of the upgrades you get here. Everything in the M4 is sharper, from a stiffer suspension tune to upgraded brakes, all serving the goal of better lap times.\nSafety and Driver Assists\n- Frontal Collision Warning with City Collision Mitigation\n- Active Cruise Control with Stop and Go\n- Blind Spot Detection\n- Surround View Camera System\n- Parking Assistant Plus\nWhat is so fantastic about sports sedans is that they're just as usable on a day-to-day basis as they are at the track on the weekend. Despite high-octane fun being the main goal of the 4-Series, it still comes with plenty of standard driver assists, including a host of collision detection and avoidance systems. More advanced features, like adaptive cruise control, are kept behind paywalls, though."

      "text": "Japanese car manufacturers are acclaimed for their reliability and are built to last. Luxury automaker Lexus is no exception, and we've ranked and sorted their most reliable models from the last decade so you can enjoy the Lexus experience at a discounted price.\nWhy focus on Lexus? Per Consumer Reports ranking, Lexus is ranked number one for used car reliability among car brands in 2025. For new car reliability, the Japanese automaker is ranked second, and for owner satisfaction, it ranked fifth.

      "text": "With the rise of SUVs dominating the American market, there aren\u2019t all that many sedans still built by U.S. automakers. The ones that are still around, however, are pretty alluring, taking the fight to their foreign competitors with muscular good looks and power engines under the hood.\nHowever, nobody wants to buy a car that is going to make constant visits to your local mechanic, and American brands don\u2019t have the cleanest reputation for reliability. Despite this, there are still a handful of choices which manage to deliver when it comes to classic red, white, and blue style and remain reliable at the same time.\nBy exploring the few American sedans left on the market, we\u2019ve found an option that has a better reputation for reliability than most of the cars in its class. It is a sporty, luxurious compact car that has a ton to offer, with a couple of sturdy powertrains to choose from. We also dive into its smaller sibling, which scores pretty close when it comes to reliability.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including J.D. Power, Consumer Reports, CarEdge, RepairPal, the EPA, and TopSpeed.\nThe Most Reliable American SUV in 2025\nThis American SUV stands out in 2025 with proven durability, strong resale value, and low maintenance costs, making it a top choice for reliability.\nThe Cadillac CT5 Scores Higher Than Any Other American Sedan\nThere are very few American automakers that still make sedans. Many of those that still do, make electric vehicles, which still haven't quite caught up to ICE vehicles when it comes to reliability. Cadillac, however, still produces more than one sedan, with their flagship CT5 being the sturdiest on offer.\nReliability Scores\nJ.D. Power is an authority on reliability, scoring vehicles based on the rating of verified owners. They collate data from a number of different sources to rate vehicles. The 2025 CT5 is one of the higher rated sedans on their site, with an 81 out of 100 overall and an 86 out of 100 for quality and reliability.\nFinding owners who have negative opinions of the current generation CT5 is a difficult task. Every model year since 2020 has scored above four out of five stars for reliability on Cars.com. Many owners are also repeat Cadillac buyers who have nothing but praise for the American brand.\nThis my 18th Cadillac and by far the best one yet. It has all of the modern conveniences. Very classy, stylish and responsive. When stopped for gas or at a stop light I get complimented on the beauty of the car.\nCars.com\nRecalls are usually something that you can't really get away from in a modern vehicle, unfortunately. However, there have been zero recalls issued for the 2025 and 2024 model years of the CT5. The 2023 model year has a minor recall for the daytime running lights, which may not turn off properly.\nMaintenance Costs\nIt is important to note that the CT5 is a luxury sedan, as you'd expect from Cadillac. While its reliability scores are impressively high, and it has an excellent reputation among owners, it is going to cost more than the average car when it comes to maintenance and repairs. No matter how reliable a car is, at some point it will need to be fixed.\nYou can expect maintenance costs on your CT5 to be about average compared to other luxury sedans. CarEdge estimates that you'll spend around $9,639 on maintenance in your first ten years of ownership. This is $86 lower than the average for its segment. There is also a 27 percent chance that it will need a repair costing more than $500 during the same period of time.\n10 Most Reliable Used American Cars Under $15,000\nThese 10 used American cars offer impressive reliability and value, proving you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune for a dependable ride under $15,000.\nThere Are a Number of Different Powertrains to Choose From With the CT5\nWhen choosing your CT5, there are four different options when it comes to engine output. These range from an overachieving four-cylinder to a supercharged V-8. Each engine delivers an impressive amount of performance, but some are considered to be more reliable than others.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n10-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n237 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n258 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n6.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n130 MPH |\nThe base engine available in the CT5 is the four-banger, detailed above. It performs pretty well, with an impressive amount of go when you put your foot down. You can instead upgrade to a three-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 if you like, which can make 335 horsepower. The more performance-oriented V model pushes the output of the V-6 up to 360 horsepower. Finally, a brilliant supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 is available in the CT5-V Blackwing model, making 668 horsepower.\nIf reliability is your number one priority, then you're going to want to upgrade to the twin-turbo V-6. The turbocharged inline-four has some reported issues of oil consumption and timing belt failures. The supercharged V-8 takes a lot of strain and requires much more vigilance when it comes to maintenance. The V-6 has the fewest reported issues and offers the best balance of reliability and performance.\nFuel Economy\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTurbo-Four RWD |\n23 MPG |\n32 MPG |\n26 MPG |\n|\nTurbo-Four AWD |\n21 MPG |\n30 MPG |\n25 MPG |\n|\nTwin-Turbo V-6 RWD |\n19 MPG |\n28 MPG |\n22 MPG |\n|\nTwin-Turbo V-6 V RWD |\n18 MPG |\n27 MPG |\n21 MPG |\n|\nTwin-Turbo V-6 AWD |\n18 MPG |\n26 MPG |\n21 MPG |\n|\nTwin-Turbo V-6 V AWD |\n17 MPG |\n26 MPG |\n20 MPG |\n|\nBlackwing Automatic |\n13 MPG |\n20 MPG |\n15 MPG |\n|\nBlackwing Manual |\n13 MPG |\n20 MPG |\n15 MPG |\nIf you value fuel efficiency, then you're going to want to stick with the turbocharged four-cylinder. It is much more efficient than models equipped with the V-6 or V-8. However, if you crave the performance of the V-6, you'll find that there is little difference between the V and non-V models.\nThe CT5-V Blackwing is the only model that can be fitted with a manual transmission, while all others get the ten-speed automatic. The V-8 absolutely guzzles gasoline, but models with the manual and automatic perform identically to one another.\n10 Most Reliable Used German Cars Under $15,000\nThese 10 reliable used German cars offer premium engineering and solid dependability\u2014all for under $15,000.\nCadillac Offers Plenty Of Value Through Their Warranty Package\nHaving a car that is reliable is super important, knowing that you won't have to deal with too many issues in its first couple of years on the road. However, there is always a chance that something will go wrong, which is where warranties come into play. Luckily, Cadillac has you covered in this department.\nWarranties and Complimentary Maintenance\nCadillac offers a pretty comprehensive warranty plan, giving you peace of mind when you drive off the dealership floor. Your limited warranty, which covers general parts, covers the CT5 for four years or 50,000 miles. The powertrain warranty extends for longer, covering you for six years or 70,000 miles. This is more generous than the plans offered by German competitors, especially in the powertrain department, beating some rivals by two years or 20,000 miles.\nCadillac also offers your first scheduled maintenance visit for free. This may not seem like a lot, but at least you won't have to fork out too much for maintenance in your first year.\nCadillac's CT4 is The Second Most Reliable American Sedan\nIt is impressive that Cadillac holds the top spot when it comes to reliability. Even more impressive is that their smaller sedan, the CT4, sits just below the CT5 when it comes to reliability. If you're looking for a sturdy sedan built by an American company, it is clear that Cadillac is the way to go.\nReliability and Performance\nThe CT4 scores exceptionally high on J.D. Power, with an 82 out of 100 overall and an 85 out of 100 for quality and reliability. The next closest American sedan is the Chevrolet Malibu, which scores 84 out of 100 for quality and reliability.\nCadillac's smaller sub-compact CT4 comes standard with the same turbocharged four-cylinder engine as the CT5. If you're looking for a boost in performance, you can upgrade to a turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder instead. The latter engine makes 310 horsepower. You can also get a twin-turbo V-6 that makes 472 horsepower in the CT4-V Blackwing.\nIf reliability is your top priority, then the base four-cylinder or the twin-turbo V-6 are the options you should stick to. The LSY four-cylinder is widely used in General Motors vehicles and is considered super robust. The LF4 V-6 is just as sturdy but requires more maintenance. The 2.7-liter L3B engine is known to have some issues with oil consumption and carbon buildup."

      "text": "With the price of vehicles constantly going up, and some big increases potentially on the horizon, it is more important than ever to look for value when buying cars. This is especially true in the luxury segment, where you\u2019re spending much more of your hard-earned cash.\nWhile there aren\u2019t as many options out there as there maybe once was, there are still plenty of luxury sedans on the market. With the downsizing of the automotive industry as a whole and the entry of some new players, luxury automakers have put more of an emphasis on value, which has only made their upscale sedans more alluring.\nTaking a look at all the high-end sedans on the market, we\u2019ve found ten options that get you the most bang for your buck. We\u2019ve tried to include options from different size segments, ranking them based on their affordability. We outline what makes them stand out in their loaded segments, as well as the power and driving dynamics they deliver.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed. Models are ranked based on their MSRP, from most affordable to least.\n10 2025 Acura Integra\nStarting MSRP: $33,000\nAfter a long hiatus, Acura finally brought the Integra back for the 2023 model year. This is the most affordable entry-level luxury sedan that money can buy. It may not match its rivals for straight-up opulence, but it features plenty of upscale features and materials that justify the price increase from the Civic and comes in thousands of dollars cheaper than its main competitors.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n1.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\nCVT or 6-Speed Manual |\n6-Speed Manual |\n|\nHorsepower |\n200 HP |\n320 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n192 LB-FT |\n310 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD |\nFWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7 Seconds |\n5.1 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n135 MPH |\n167 MPH |\nThe Integra comes standard with a small 1.5-liter four-banger. It may not be as quick as its rivals, but its finely tuned chassis and responsive steering make it an absolute blast to drive. If you're looking for something sportier, the Type S features a two-liter turbocharged engine as well as other performance-oriented features, such as a limited-slip differential. The Type S will set you back $52,900, though.\n9 2025 Audi A3\nStarting MSRP: $38,200\nIf you're looking for a luxury car from Germany's big three automakers, then the A3 is the most affordable option on the market. The subcompact sedan may be affordable, but it comes packed with plenty of features that more than justify its price. It is fun to drive and features a cabin that is decked out with the most modern tech that Audi has to offer.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n7-Speed Auto-Shift Manual |\n|\nHorsepower |\n201 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n221 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n127 MPH |\nAudi offers a single powertrain setup on the 2025 A3. On paper, it may not seem like the most powerful option out there, but there is a lot more to this little car than meets the eye. Standard all-wheel drive gives you a ton of traction and the chassis is tuned for fun, making the A3 a monster in the corners. When you're not pushing it, the subcompact delivers a smooth ride worthy of the luxury badge it wears.\n8 2025 Genesis G70\nStarting MSRP: $42,500\nGenesis has defined itself as the value-oriented brand in the luxury segment, much like Lexus. However, the Korean brand has established that, despite its affordable price tags, they are still aiming to be the best in every segment they compete in. The compact G70 is proof of this, taking the fight to legacy brands without breaking the bank.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.3-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n300 HP |\n368 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n311 LB-FT |\n376 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.9 Seconds |\n4.5 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n155 MPH |\n160 MPH |\nGenesis offers the G70 with two distinct powertrains under the hood. The base four-cylinder engine is an overachiever, pumping out a ton of power and getting the G70 up to speed at an impressive rate. The twin-turbocharged V-6 is even more powerful. The option of rear-wheel drive on all models is also something we appreciate. The G70 walks the line between comfort and performance in a way that very few of its competitors can.\n10 Most Reliable Luxury SUVs You Can Count On in 2025\nThese 10 luxury SUVs offer top-tier reliability in 2025, combining premium comfort with proven durability for a worry-free ownership experience.\n7 2025 Alfa Romeo Giulia\nStarting MSRP: $43,995\nWith the Quadrifoglio off the market for the 2025 model year, many have decided to count the Giulia out. However, we believe that the base Giulia is more than enjoyable and still puts up a fight against other luxury compact sedans. Beyond its soulful driving dynamics, it also features a curb appeal unlike anything out there right now and a rich and comfortable interior.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n280 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n306 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n149 MPH |\nFour-cylinders does not mean less fun when it comes to the Giulia. The gutsy engine punches out plenty of power to keep it quick and fun to drive. The sound that it funnels out of its exhaust is brilliant, and this Italian machine feels ready to pounce at a moment's notice. It can be quiet and comfortable but is also easy to drive quickly and aggressively, making it pretty beginner-friendly.\n6 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class\nStarting MSRP: $44,400\nThe CLA is currently the most inexpensive model in the Mercedes stable. The compact four-door sedan does a pretty excellent job of offering an experience worthy of the three-point star it wears on its grille despite its agreeable price tag. At this price point, finding a more opulent cabin is a difficult task. It may be worth waiting for the next generation model to come out for the 2026 model year, though.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Auto-Shift Manual |\n|\nHorsepower |\n221 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n258 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n130 MPH |\nThe CLA utilizes a mild-hybrid setup, combining its four-cylinder engine with a 48-volt belt-driven starter. It manages some pretty decent acceleration, but comfort is definitely the name of the game with this Mercedes. Everything from the ride to the handling feels extremely polished, delivering refinement over roudy corner-carving.\n5 2025 BMW 3-Series\nStarting MSRP: $45,950\nThe 3-Series is one of the most iconic premium compact sedans. Since its inception, it has been the benchmark that every other option in this segment strives to beat. In 2025, we believe that remains the case. The German brand has developed a car that perfectly walks the line between comfort, practicality, and sportiness, making the 3-Series the total package.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Six |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n386 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n398 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.2 Seconds |\n3.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n156 MPH |\n150 MPH |\nBMW's iconic 3-Series comes in two distinct flavors, excluding the M3. The base 330i comes fitted with a rowdy four-cylinder which feels like it puts down more power than its figures might suggest. The M340i is the step-up, featuring a tantalizing turbocharged inline-six that sounds absolutely fantastic when you put your foot down. Both make use of a 48-volt mild-hybrid setup.\nThe Best Value For Money Luxury EV in 2025\nThis 2025 luxury EV blends performance, tech, and range at a price that undercuts rivals, making it the best value for money in its class.\n4 2025 Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nStarting MSRP: $48,450\nMercedes' offering in the compact segment is the distinguished C-Class sedan. It aims to deliver the same upscale experience that you'd find in the E-Class and S-Class in a smaller and more affordable package. It may not be as sporty as its competitors, particularly the BMW 3-Series or the Audi A3, but it instead opts for sophistication and contemporary technology.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n9-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.3 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n129 MPH |\nIn terms of performance, the C-Class isn't anything to get particularly excited about, especially compared to the plethora of sporty options available in this class. Instead, it offers you a plush cabin and a smooth ride. It accelerates quick enough, but steering feel and handling just aren't up to snuff. In contrast, its ride is beyond smooth and so is its power delivery.\n3 2025 BMW 4-Series Gran Coupe\nStarting MSRP: $49,650\nIf you're looking for a car that delivers similar driving verve to the 3-Series but with a different approach to styling, the 4-Series Gran Coupe is the way to go. The 4-Series is just as sporty and fun to drive as the 3-Series but features fastback styling, and it has gotten a light refresh this year. Not only does this offer a more attractive silhouette, but it also means that the 4-Series has a more spacious cargo area.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Six |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n386 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n398 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or AWD |\nRWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.8 Seconds |\n3.9 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n155 MPH |\n155 MPH |\nJust like the 3-Series, BMW's 4-Series Gran Coupe comes either with a turbocharged four-cylinder or a turbocharged inline-six. The former is dubbed the 430i and the latter the M440i. Both come standard with rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive, or xDrive as BMW calls it, being an optional extra. The suspension can be a bit firm at times, but the fantastic handling it delivers more than makes up for this.\n2 2025 Genesis G80\nStarting MSRP: $57,100\nThe mid-size segment is filled with some pretty heavy hitters, but this is where things begin to get fairly expensive. However, the Genesis G80 continues the brand's trend of offering more for less. In fact, the G80 is probably the best value-for-money option in the Korean brand's stable. It is cheaper than its rivals while being both larger and, in some ways, more plush.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.5-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n300 HP |\n375 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n311 LB-FT |\n391 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.5 Seconds |\n4.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n140 MPH |\n155 MPH |\nGenesis' mid-size luxury sedan offers either a turbocharged four-cylinder or twin-turbo V-6. While the six-cylinder definitely offers more power, neither model feels exceptionally sharp. However, there are few options in this class anymore that do. Instead, the Genesis aims to be a comfortable cruiser, which is something it achieves effortlessly, feeling more refined than most luxury sedans.\nYou Could Own Infiniti\u2019s Largest Luxury Sedan for Less Than a New Toyota Corolla\nSure, you can score an Infiniti luxury sedan for a low price\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a smart buy.\n1 2025 Mercedes-Benz E-Class\nStarting MSRP: $62,450\nThe E-Class does its best impression of an S-Class, with a cabin that is packed full of cutting-edge technology, all designed to make you feel like a VIP. It may be one of the most expensive options in this segment, but it justifies its price tag well, coming loaded with everything you'd want in a luxury sedan. Refinement like this is hard to come by.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n3.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Six |\n|\nTransmission |\n9-Speed Automatic |\n9-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n255 HP |\n375 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n295 LB-FT |\n369 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.8 Seconds |\n4.4 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n130 MPH |\n129 MPH |\nThe E-Class comes in two forms, with the four-cylinder dubbed the E350 and the six-cylinder the E450. Neither try too hard to incorporate sportiness into the recipe, despite their more than ample levels of power. Both are exceptionally smooth, though the six-cylinder is on another level. Ride quality and comfort are the top priorities here, with things like optional adjustable air suspension only amplifying this."
