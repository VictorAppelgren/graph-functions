      "title": "Is empathy a sin? Some conservative Christians argue it can be",
      "summary": "The article discusses how some evangelical leaders, notably Allie Beth Stuckey and Joe Rigney, argue that empathy has become a tool of the political left, co‑opting Christian compassion to support progressive causes such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigration. They claim that unchecked empathy can validate sin and justify harmful policies, and their views have gained traction among Trump‑aligned Christian voters. The piece contrasts these critiques with historians and other clergy who defend empathy as a core Christian value, noting that the debate often centers on semantics and the perceived misuse of empathy in contemporary politics.",
