      "summary": "Bond yields have spiked worldwide, with 30‑year Treasury and European sovereign yields hitting multi‑year highs, prompting a global sell‑off in fixed income. In contrast, gold has rallied to record levels, as investors view it as a hedge against fiscal excesses, potential debt crises, and political interference in central bank policy. The shift reflects growing fears of inflation, debt sustainability, and dollar debasement, driving safe‑haven flows away from bonds toward the physical asset.",
