      "feedback": "Strong points to preserve: grounding in ACMR’s Q2 results (revenue $215m, net income $30m) and guidance ($850–$950m 2025), the Ultra C cleaning-tool upgrade (N2 bubbling), and the 36% Qtr‑over‑quarter move amid rate‑cut optimism; and the macro thread tying policy path to capex and semicap cycles (rate‑cuts, Fed trajectory) plus the small‑cap vs large‑cap rotation narrative. Actionable edits to reach world‑class, 3–6 month rigor:\n\n- Build a tight 3–6 month scenario map with a timed catalyst grid: specify triggers (Sept 50bp cut as a potential start; path to 150–175bp cumulative cuts; IPO rebound trigger; ACMR product-cycle ramp and international expansion milestones) and explicit invalidations (e.g., if Fed cuts are delayed beyond Sept and macro liquidity tightens, if ACMR’s Q3/Q4 ramp misses guidance, if export controls escalate or U.S.–China friction worsens materially). Attach concrete timing windows (Sept, Oct, Nov) and map them to ACS (ACMR) earnings cadence and capex cycles.\n\n- Quantify base case with defensible numbers: anchor on ACMR’s reported Q2 figures and guidance, and translate into near‑term path (e.g., 2025 revenue raise vs. 850–950m baseline; implied 2025–26 growth implied by the 1.4b 2028 reference if the ramp persists; use gross margin ~49% and net margin ~13–14% as downside/upside anchors). Explicitly show how a rate‑cut‑driven risk‑appetite uplift could compress discounting and expand multiple for niche equipment names, with sensitivity ranges (e.g., +1.5x to +2.0x multiple if rate cuts materialize vs. flat/multiples compressing if macro stays tight).\n\n- Strengthen the causal chain and keep it policy‑to‑pricing: clearly connect the rate‑cut timetable (C22MKA9VY) to semiconductor capex and ACMR’s tooling demand, and reconcile small‑cap regime signals from Q7VVGNSQE with ACMR‑specific drivers; avoid treating them as interchangeable catalysts—describe how macro regime changes would translate into ACMR order velocity, ASPs, and margin trajectory.\n\n- Sharpen catalysts/triggers/invalidation with minimal fluff: list 2–3 explicit catalysts (Q3 product ramp progress, export‑control clarity, IPO activity momentum and Russell 2000 earnings visibility) and 2–3 invalidation signals (APAC/US policy shock, ACMR misses Q3; IPO slowdown; sustained high rates).\n\n- Refine watch list and risk indicators with numeric cues: include (1) ACMR Q3 trajectory vs. guidance, (2) rate‑cut timetable shifts (timing and magnitude), (3) IPO counts and Russell 2000 performance relative to S&P 500, (4) U.S.–China policy shifts that could alter capex risk; tie each to a specific conviction level and a probabilistic sensitivity note.\n\n- Improve valuation framing and reconciliation: explicitly separate relative‑outlook (small caps vs large caps) from absolute ACMR upside; mention current price ~$30.5 and consensus target ~$34.8 from SK994CBWR to calibrate the downside/ upside; avoid generic statements—provide a single, testable path‑to‑target with an optional upside case if the N2 bubbling and S&E (semiconductor equipment) cycle accelerates.\n\n- Tighten citations and ensure coverage of critical facts: attach SK994CBWR to all ACMR numbers and catalysts, Q7VVGNSQE for the small‑cap regime IPO/valuation signal, and C22MKA9VY for the rate‑cut pathway; ensure any assertion about IPO counts (95 in 2025, $12.9b) aligns with Q7VVGNSQE; explicitly reconcile any minor discrepancies (e.g., product terminology) to avoid over‑claiming.\n\n- Format alignment with the section focus: present as a concise, end‑to‑end 3–6 month plan that ends with base case, 1–2 alts, clearly stated risks, and watch‑list signals, each tied to timing windows; ensure the write‑up is compact but numerically explicit and decision‑oriented.",
