Keep citations only in the Driver/Mechanism and What to watch fields (e.g., “AI‑driven tech demand expansion (H86O3XRUJ)”). Shorten the driver phrases if they exceed one clause (e.g., “EPAM AI platform roll‑out” instead of “EPAM AI platform roll‑out & client expansion”) and keep the watch phrases concise (e.g., “EPAM Q3 earnings, AI adoption metrics (H86O3XRUJ)(KNWKYIQ1W)”).
