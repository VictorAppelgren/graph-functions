  "title": "Artivion stock price target raised to $50 from $45 at Needham By Investing",
  "description": "Artivion stock price target raised to $50 from $45 at Needham",
  "content": "Investing.com - Needham has raised its price target on Artivion Inc. (NYSE: ) to $50.00 from $45.00 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The company\u2019s shares have shown remarkable strength, delivering a 69% return over the past year and currently trading near its 52-week high of $43.97. According to InvestingPro data, analysts maintain a bullish consensus on AORT, with multiple upward earnings revisions for the upcoming period.\n\nThe price target increase follows positive developments with Endospan\u2019s NEXUS stent graft system, which Artivion has a distribution agreement for since 2019. The agreement includes an option for Artivion to purchase Endospan, a private company.\n\nEndospan\u2019s NEXUS, an endovascular aortic arch repair system currently available outside the United States, recently showed positive 30-day results in its TRIOMPHE pivotal trial, which is intended to support FDA approval.\n\nEndospan plans to submit its PMA to the FDA after 12-month data from the trial becomes available, putting the product on track for potential FDA approval in late 2026.\n\nNeedham expects that if NEXUS receives FDA approval and Artivion acquires Endospan, the U.S. launch would be accretive to Artivion\u2019s revenue growth, which factored into the firm\u2019s decision to raise its price target.\n\nIn other recent news, Artivion Inc. reported strong second-quarter performance with revenues reaching $113 million, surpassing consensus estimates of $108 million. This represents a significant year-over-year growth of approximately 14% to 15.3%, driven by the successful launch of its AMDS stent and stent-graft products in the United States. The company also reported adjusted EBITDA of $24.8 million, exceeding both Canaccord\u2019s projection and the consensus estimate. Following these results, multiple analyst firms have adjusted their price targets for Artivion. Stifel raised its price target to $40, while Needham increased it to $45, and Canaccord adjusted it to $41, all maintaining a Buy rating. Oppenheimer also revised its target to $40, maintaining an Outperform rating. These adjustments reflect the analysts\u2019 positive outlook on Artivion\u2019s growth trajectory. Additionally, Artivion has increased its 2025 revenue and EBITDA guidance, further reinforcing investor confidence in the company\u2019s future performance.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
