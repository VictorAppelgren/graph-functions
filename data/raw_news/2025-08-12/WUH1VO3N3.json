Generate Key Takeaways\n\nTuesday night into Wednesday morning will be the best time to view the Perseid meteor shower as it reaches its peak.\n\nThe meteor shower is known for producing dozens of bright meteors which leave long streaks in their wake, per CNN.\n\nAccording to ABC News, the Perseids are caused by the Earth traveling through trails of debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle.\n\nThe meteor shower is active every year between mid-July and late-August, but Tuesday night will be the best time to view the shower.\n\n\u201cThe Perseids are known for producing consistent meteors and occasional fireballs \u2014 \u2018shooting stars\u2019 that blaze more brightly than Venus in the sky,\u201d according to Space.com. \u201cThe Perseids peak as Earth passes through the densest and dustiest area of the comet\u2019s trail.\u201d\n\nThis meteor shower has been drawing attention from people ever since it was first recorded by Chinese astronomers nearly 2,000 years ago in 36 A.D., per ABC News. It gets its name because it appears as though the meteors shoot out from near the Perseus constellation.\n\nThe best time to view the Perseids\n\nAccording to Space.com, the best time to view the meteor shower is between 3 and 4 a.m. local time.\n\nThose watching in person should find a dark spot away from city lights with a wide view of the sky. It is also recommended for people to allow around 30 minutes for their eyes to adjust to the dark.\n\nThe Perseids are visible to the naked eye, so telescopes and binoculars are not needed.\n\nLight from the moon will impact viewing of the meteor shower. In previous years it produced around 40-50 visible meteors per hour but because it is so soon after a full moon people may see around 10 to 20 meteors per hour, per CNN.\n\nHere is a list of peak dates of other meteor showers that are anticipated through the end of 2025, according to Earthsky and the American Meteor Society:",

      "text": "It\u2019s finally time to watch one of the best meteor showers of the year: the brilliant display known as the Perseids.\nThe Perseid meteor shower, which is known for producing dozens of bright meteors that leave long streaks in their wake, is set to peak at 4 p.m. ET Tuesday.\nIn previous years, it produced around 40 to 50 visible meteors per hour, but sky-gazers likely won\u2019t see as many this year, said Bill Cooke, the lead for NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environments Office. This is due to the fact that the Perseid shower is occurring shortly after August\u2019s full moon.\nThe moon will be in a waning gibbous phase and at around 85% illumination, which means the light from the moon will make meteor-spotting more difficult. According to experts, you may see around 10 to 20 meteors per hour.\nWhen to watch for meteors\nWhile the peak of the Perseids will happen well before sunset in the US, there are two windows of time between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning during which stargazers should aim to be outside for the best chance of glimpsing a meteor.\n\u201cBetween dusk and moonrise on the evening of August 12, there\u2019s going to be a one-hour gap before the moon rises,\u201d when you can look for Perseid activity, said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society.\nThese meteors shoot out in all directions from the constellation Perseus, which is located in the northern sky. Lunsford noted, however, that, due to Perseus appearing low on the horizon at this time, much of the meteor activity will be blocked from view.\n\u201cAny meteors you do see at that time are going to be called Earth grazers because they can just graze the upper atmosphere,\u201d he said. While most Perseid meteors are visible for mere milliseconds, the few earth grazers you might spot \u201cwill be very long and will last two or three seconds,\u201d he added.\nThe last couple of hours before daybreak on Wednesday is the other window during which Lunsford recommends trying to see the shower. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a bright moon up in the southern sky, but if you turn your gaze northward and look kind of toward the constellation Perseus, you can still see the brighter meteors.\u201d\nLook up for planets\nThe peak of the Perseids is occurring just after the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, and the two planets will still be close together and shining brightly. The best views will be in the eastern sky before sunrise.\n\u201cThese are the two brightest planets,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cThis (conjunction) happens about once a year, but it\u2019s still spectacular when you get the two brightest planets really close to each other.\u201d\nSaturn will also be joining the night\u2019s celestial display in the late evening hours on Tuesday. It will appear near the moon and will rise before midnight, according to EarthSky.\nUpcoming meteor showers\nHere are the peak dates of other meteor showers anticipated in 2025, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky.\n- Draconids: October 8-9\n- Orionids: October 22-23\n- Southern Taurids: November 3-4\n- Northern Taurids: November 8-9\n- Leonids: November 16-17\n- Geminids: December 13-14\n- Ursids: December 21-22\nUpcoming full moons\nLook out for four more full moons this year, with supermoons occurring in October, November and December. Their dates are:\n- September 7\n- October 6\n- November 5\n- December 4\nLunar and solar eclipses in 2025\nTwo eclipse events will take place as summer draws to a close.\nA total lunar eclipse will be visible in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica on September 7 and 8, according to Time and Date.\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly into Earth\u2019s shadow as the sun, Earth and the moon line up. This causes the moon to appear darker or dimmed.\nWhen the moon sits in the darkest part of Earth\u2019s shadow, the sun\u2019s rays peek out from behind Earth and the light refracts, giving the moon a reddish hue, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Some people call the result a \u201cblood moon.\u201d\nTwo weeks later, on September 21, a partial solar eclipse will be visible in parts of Australia, the Atlantic, the Pacific and Antarctica.\nSolar eclipses occur when the moon moves between the sun and Earth. In the case of a partial solar eclipse, the moon does not fully block out the sun. It creates a crescent \u2014 as if the moon took a bite out of the sun.\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

      "text": "A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky called Radiant. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. The Meteor Data Center of the IAU lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established.\nThe meteor showers listed below are the easiest to observe and provide the most activity. Particular attention should be noted to the time and moonlight conditions. All these showers are best seen after midnight. Some are not even visible until after midnight. Showers that peak with the moon\u2019s phase greater than one half illuminated (first quarter to last quarter) will be affected by moonlight and difficult to observe.\nWhile the time each shower is best seen remains much the same year after year, the moonlight conditions change considerably from one year to the next. As we approach the date of each shower's maximum, be sure to consult the latest AMS article about Meteor Showers, which will provide in depth information on each shower and how to best view it.\nWhen is the next meteor shower?\nWell, first of all you need to know that the Perseids are currently active until Saturday 23rd August 2025.\nThe Perseids will peak on Wednesday 13th August 2025 .\nOn this night, the moon will be 84% full.\nHere is the list of the next major meteor showers that will occur after that:\nSouthern Taurids\nStatus: Active from October 13th to November 27th\nPeak: Nov 3-4 2025 (Moon 96% full.)\nAug 12-13, 2025\nPerseids\nCurrently activeActive from July 17th to August 23rd, 2025\nThe Perseids are the most popular meteor shower as they peak on warm August nights as seen from the northern hemisphere. The Perseids are active from July 14 to September 1. They reach a strong maximum on August 12 or 13, depending on the year. Normal rates seen from rural locations range from 50-75 shower members per hour at maximum. The Perseids are particles released from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle during its numerous returns to the inner solar system. They are called Perseids since the radiant (the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate) is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus the hero when at maximum activity. In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity. Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:17 +58.1\u00b0 - ZHR: 100 - Velocity: 37 miles/sec (swift - 59km/sec) - Parent Object: 109P/Swift-Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Perseids will next peak on the Aug 12-13, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 84% full.\n***Oct 22-23, 2025\nOrionids\nNext period of activity: October 2nd, 2025 to November 12th, 2025The Orionids are a medium strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity. In a normal year the Orionids produce 10-20 shower members at maximum. In exceptional years, such as 2006-2009, the peak rates were on par with the Perseids (50-75 per hour). Recent displays have produced low to average displays of this shower. In 2025, a waning crescent moon will rise near dawn and will not affect the shower at all..\nShower details - Radiant: 06:25 +15.8\u00b0 - ZHR: 20 - Velocity: 41 miles/sec (swift - 66km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\nNext Peak - The Orionids will next peak on the Oct 22-23, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 2% full.\n***Nov 3-4, 2025\nSouthern Taurids\nNext period of activity: October 13th, 2025 to November 27th, 2025The Southern Taurids are a complex shower made up of two main components, the annual component which peaks on October 14th and the fireball swarm component which peaks on November 4th. Since 2025 is a swarm year, we will list November 4th as the peak. The Taurids (both branches) are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:34 +14.5\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 17.7 miles/sec (slow - 28.5km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\nNext Peak - The Southern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 3-4, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 96% full.\n***Nov 8-9, 2025\nNorthern Taurids\nNext period of activity: October 13th, 2025 to December 1st, 2025This shower is much like the Southern Taurids, just active a bit later in the year. When the two showers are active simultaneously in late October and early November, there is sometimes a notable increase in the fireball activity.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:53 +22.2\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 17.6 miles/sec (slow - 28.3km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\nNext Peak - The Northern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 8-9, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 83% full.\n***Nov 16-17, 2025\nLeonids\nNext period of activity: November 3rd, 2025 to December 2nd, 2025The Leonids are best known for producing meteor storms in the years of 1833, 1866, 1966, 1999, 2001 and 2002. These outbursts of meteor activity are best seen when the parent object, comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, is near perihelion (closest approach to the sun). Yet it is not the fresh material we see from the comet, but rather debris from earlier returns that also happen to be most dense at the same time. Unfortunately, it appears that the earth will not encounter any dense clouds of debris until 2099. Therefore, when the comet returns in 2031 and 2064, there may not be any meteor storms, but perhaps several good displays of Leonid activity when rates are in excess of 100 per hour. Each passing year also presents new possibilities from old debris fields. In 2024, the waning gibbous moon will rise during the late evening hours and will spoil the best viewing hours for this shower.\nShower details - Radiant: 10:16 +21.8\u00b0 - ZHR: 15 - Velocity: 43.5 miles/sec (swift - 69.7km/sec) - Parent Object: 55P/Tempel-Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Leonids will next peak on the Nov 16-17, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 9% full.\n***Dec 13-14, 2025\nGeminids\nNext period of activity: December 1st, 2025 to December 21st, 2025The Geminids are usually the strongest meteor shower of the year and meteor enthusiasts are certain to circle December 13 and 14 on their calendars. This is the one major shower that provides good activity prior to midnight as the constellation of Gemini is well placed from 22:00 onward. The Geminids are often bright and intensely colored. Due to their medium-slow velocity, persistent trains are not usually seen. These meteors are also seen in the southern hemisphere, but only during the middle of the night and at a reduced rate. In 2025, the moon will have a waning crescent phase on December 13/14, which rises near 2am local standard time. Observations prior to this time will be moon-free. Observations after moon rise can still be successful by facing westward with the rising moon at your back. .\nShower details - Radiant: 07:33 +32.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 150 - Velocity: 21 miles/sec (medium - 33.8km/sec) - Parent Object: 3200 Phaethon (asteroid)\nNext Peak - The Geminids will next peak on the Dec 13-14, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 30% full.\n***Dec 21-22, 2025\nUrsids\nNext period of activity: December 16th, 2025 to December 26th, 2025The Ursids are often neglected due to the fact it peaks just before Christmas and the rates are much less than the Geminds, which peaks just a week before the Ursids. Observers will normally see 5-10 Ursids per hour during the late morning hours on the date of maximum activity. There have been occasional outbursts when rates have exceeded 25 per hour. These outbursts appear unrelated to the perihelion dates of comet 8P/Tuttle. This shower is strictly a northern hemisphere event as the radiant fails to clear the horizon or does so simultaneously with the start of morning twilight as seen from the southern tropics.In 2024, a half-illuminated moon will be present in the morning sky and will obscure the fainter meteors.\nShower details - Radiant: 14:38 +75.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 10 - Velocity: 20.5 miles/sec (medium - 33.1km/sec) - Parent Object: 8P/Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Ursids will next peak on the Dec 21-22, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 3% full.\n***Jan 3-4, 2026\nQuadrantids\nNext period of activity: December 26th, 2025 to January 16th, 2026The Quadrantids have the potential to be the strongest shower of the year but usually fall short due to the short length of maximum activity (6 hours) and the poor weather experienced during early January. The average hourly rates one can expect under dark skies is 25. These meteors usually lack persistent trains but often produce bright fireballs. Due to the high northerly declination (celestial latitude) these meteors are not well seen from the southern hemisphere. Predictions for 2026 show a peak near 00:36 UT on January 4th. This timing favors Asia..Activity will be severely compromised in 2026 as a full moon occurs on January 3rd. The bright moonlight will obscure all but the brightest meteors therefore the best hourly rates are expected to be less than 10.\nShower details - Radiant: 15:20 +49.7\u00b0 - ZHR: 120 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40.4km/sec) - Parent Object: 2003 EH (Asteroid)\nNext Peak - The Quadrantids will next peak on the Jan 3-4, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***Apr 21-22, 2026\nLyrids\nNext period of activity: April 17th, 2026 to April 26th, 2026The Lyrids are a medium strength shower that usually produces good rates for three nights centered on the maximum. These meteors also usually lack persistent trains but can produce fireballs. These meteors are best seen from the northern hemisphere where the radiant is high in the sky at dawn. Activity from this shower can be seen from the southern hemisphere, but at a lower rate. Maximum is predicted to occur near 13UT on April 22nd. The waning crescent moon will slightly interfere with viewing these meteors in 2025.\nShower details - Radiant: 18:08 +33.3\u00b0 - ZHR: 18 - Velocity: 29 miles/sec (medium - 46.6km/sec) - Parent Object: C/1861 G1 (Thatcher)\nNext Peak - The Lyrids will next peak on the Apr 21-22, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 27% full.\n***May 5-6, 2026\neta Aquariids\nNext period of activity: April 19th, 2026 to May 28th, 2026The Eta Aquariids are a strong shower when viewed from the southern tropics. From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn. Activity is good for a week centered the night of maximum activity. These are swift meteors that produce a high percentage of persistent trains, but few fireballs. In 2025, a first quarter moon will set long before the radiant rises so circumstances are excellent for viewing this shower. No abnormal activity is expected in 2025.\nShower details - Radiant: 22:32 -1\u00b0 - ZHR: 50 - Velocity: 40.7 miles/sec (swift - 65.4km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\nNext Peak - The eta Aquariids will next peak on the May 5-6, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 84% full.\n***Jul 29-30, 2026\nSouthern delta Aquariids\nNext period of activity: July 18th, 2026 to August 12th, 2026The Delta Aquariids are another strong shower best seen from the southern tropics. North of the equator the radiant is located lower in the southern sky and therefore rates are less than seen from further south. These meteors produce good rates for a week centered on the night of maximum. These are usually faint meteors that lack both persistent trains and fireballs. In 2025, a waxing crescent moon will set before the radiant is high in the sky. Therefore circumstances are favorable for viewing this shower during the morning hours..\nShower details - Radiant: 22:40 -16.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 25 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40km/sec) - Parent Object: 96P/Machholz?\nNext Peak - The Southern delta Aquariids will next peak on the Jul 29-30, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***Jul 29-30, 2026\nalpha Capricornids\nNext period of activity: July 12th, 2026 to August 12th, 2026The Alpha Capricornids are active from July 12 through August 12 with a \"plateau-like\" maximum centered on July 30th. This shower is not very strong and rarely produces in excess of 5 shower members per hour. What is notable about this shower is the number of bright fireballs produced during its activity period. This shower is seen equally well on either side of the equator.\nShower details - Radiant: 20:22 -9.3\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 14 miles/sec (slow - 22km/sec) - Parent Object: 169P/NEAT\nNext Peak - The alpha Capricornids will next peak on the Jul 29-30, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***"

      "text": "Watch the 2025 Perseid meteor shower peak tonight in free webcast\nThe Perseids put on one of the best sky shows of the year.\nOne of the year's most dazzling sky shows is about to peak as the annual Perseid meteor shower lights up the night \u2014 and you can enjoy the event live online.\nThe Perseid meteor shower is expected to reach peak activity on Tuesday evening (Aug. 12) through the early morning hours of Wednesday (Aug. 13). The Virtual Telescope Project will host a free livestream on Tuesday beginning at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), offering skywatchers real-time views of dozens of shooting stars every hour.\nDark skies in central Italy allow the Virtual Telescope Project to capture wide-field views of the meteor shower using its robotic telescopes. The livestream event will also feature commentary from astrophysicist Gianluca Masi. The stream will be available via the project's WebTV page, YouTube channel and here on Space.com, courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project.\nThe Perseids are known for producing consistent meteors and occasional fireballs \u2014 \"shooting stars\" that blaze more brightly than Venus in the sky \u2014 as Earth passes through debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. The Perseids peak as Earth passes through the densest and dustiest area of the comet's trail.\nThe Perseid meteor shower is active every year from mid-July to late August. Under clear skies and low light pollution, this year's shower could deliver between 50 and 100 meteors per hour at its peak. However, a waning gibbous moon will rise before midnight, potentially washing out some of the fainter meteors with its bright light.\nStill, the brightest Perseids should shine through, especially during the predawn hours when the constellation Perseus \u2014 from which the meteors appear to radiate, hence the shower's name \u2014 climbs high in the northeastern sky.\nThe best time to view the meteor shower will be between 3 and 4 a.m. local time. Observers watching in person are encouraged to find a dark spot and allow time for their eyes to adjust. The meteor shower is visible to the naked eye, so no telescopes or binoculars are needed.\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\nWhether you're outside under the stars or viewing the Virtual Telescope Project's live webcast, the Perseids remain one of the most remarkable meteor showers of the year.\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

      "text": "Up next is the Perside meteor shower, they\u2019re most active around August 12. And don\u2019t forget to check out the conjunction of Venus and Jupiter that morning!.\nMid-July to mid-August 2025 meteors \u2026 the Perseids\nPredicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 20 UTC on August 12, 2025. So the mornings of August 11 and 12 are probably your best bets. August 13 might be good as well, but be aware that the Perseids tend to fall off rapidly after their peak.\nWhen to watch: The moon will be a waning gibbous during 2025\u2019s peak of the Perseid meteor shower. Many Perseids are bright, so if the moon is up, try blocking it out to enhance your viewing. This shower rises to a peak gradually, then falls off rapidly. And Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into the wee hours before dawn. The shower is often best just before dawn.\nRadiant: The radiant rises in the middle of the night and is highest at dawn. See chart below.\nNearest moon phase: The full moon falls at 7:55 UTC on August 9.\nDuration of shower: July 14 to September 1. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, skywatchers frequently report 90 meteors per hour, or more. In 2025, due to moonlight, the American Meteor Society, suggests you might see about 25% of the expected peak rate of 60 an hour. The August Perseid meteor shower is rich and steady, from early August through the peak. The meteors are colorful. And they frequently leave persistent trains. All of these factors make the Perseid shower perhaps the most beloved meteor shower for the Northern Hemisphere.\nRead more: All you need to know about Perseid meteors\nEarly October meteors \u2026 the Draconids\nPredicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 19 UTC on October 8, 2025.\nWhen to watch: The best time to watch the Draconids in 2025 is as darkness falls on the evening of October 8 through the wee hours of the morning on October 9. However, the thick waning gibbous will light up the sky. So try to block out the moon when watching for meteors.\nOverall duration of shower: October 6 through 10.\nRadiant: Highest in the sky in the evening hours. See chart below.\nNearest moon phase: Full moon is 3:48 UTC on October 7.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, you might catch 10 Draconid meteors per hour.\nNote: The Draconid shower is a real oddity, in that the radiant point stands highest in the sky as darkness falls. That means that, unlike many meteor showers, more Draconids are likely to fly in the evening hours than in the morning hours after midnight. This shower is usually a sleeper, producing only a handful of languid meteors per hour in most years. But watch out if the Dragon awakes! In rare instances, fiery Draco has been known to spew forth many hundreds of meteors in a single hour. That possibility keeps many skywatchers outside \u2013 even in moonlight \u2013 during this shower. Since the parent comet of this shower \u2013 Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner \u2013 was at perihelion in March of 2025, does that mean we\u2019ll see a storm of Draconid meteors this year? Possibly.\nRead more: All you need to know about Draconid meteors\nLate October meteors \u2026 the Orionids\nPredicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 00 UTC on October 21, 2025.\nWhen to watch: Watch for Orionid meteors on the morning of October 21, starting after midnight through the wee hours before dawn.\nOverall duration of shower: September 26 to November 22. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nRadiant: The radiant rises before midnight and is highest in the sky around 2 a.m. See chart below.\nNearest moon phase: The new moon falls at 12:25 UTC on October 21. So, at the Orionids\u2019 peak, there\u2019ll be dark skies for observing the meteor shower.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, the Orionids exhibit a maximum of about 10 to 20 meteors per hour.\nNote: These fast-moving meteors occasionally leave persistent trains. The Orionids sometimes produce bright fireballs.\nRead more: Everything you need to know Orionid meteors\nOctober into early November \u2026 the South and North Taurids\nPredicted peak: The South Taurids\u2019 predicted** peak is for 13 UTC on November 5, 2025. The North Taurids\u2019 predicted** peak is for 12 UTC on November 9, 2025. Both the South and North Taurids don\u2019t have very definite peaks. They ramble along in October and November and are especially noticeable from late October into early November, when they overlap.\nWhen to watch: Best around midnight, and on the days before November 5 after the waxing gibbous moon has set or is lower in the western sky.\nOverall duration of shower: The South Taurids run from about September 23 to November 12. North Taurids are active from about October 13 to December 2. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the Southern Taurid meteor stream in space! And time period is when we\u2019re passing through the Northern Taurid meteor stream in space!\nRadiant: Rises in early evening, highest in the sky around midnight. See chart below.\nNearest moon phases: In 2025, the full moon falls at 13:19 UTC on November 5. The last quarter is at 5:28 UTC on November 12. So moonlight will interfere with most Taurid meteors in 2025. You\u2019ll catch Taurid meteors throughout October and November. Visit Sunrise Sunset Calendars to see moon rising times for your location. Be sure to check the moon rising time box.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under dark skies with no moon, both the South and North Taurid meteor showers produce about five meteors per hour (10 total when they overlap). Also, watch for fireballs.\nNote: Taurid meteors tend to be slow-moving but sometimes very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs, which made their cyclical reappearance in 2022. The American Meteor Society pointed to \u201ca seven-year periodicity\u201d with Taurid fireballs. 2008 and 2015 both produced them. 2022 did as well. The Taurid fireball display, in 2015, was really fun! Photos and video of 2015 Taurid fireballs here.\nRead more: All you need to know about the Taurid meteors\nMid-November meteors \u2026 the Leonids\nPredicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 18 UTC on November 17, 2025.\nWhen to watch: Watch late on the night of November 16 until dawn on November 17. The morning of November 18 might be worthwhile, too.\nDuration of shower: November 3 through December 2. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nRadiant: Rises around midnight, highest in the sky at dawn.\nNearest moon phase: In 2025, the new moon falls at 6:47 UTC on November 20. So the slender waning crescent moon will not interfere with meteors in 2025.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, you might see 10 to 15 Leonid meteors per hour.\nNote: The famous Leonid meteor shower produced one of the greatest meteor storms in living memory. Rates were as high as thousands of meteors per minute during a 15-minute span on the morning of November 17, 1966. That night, Leonid meteors did, briefly, fall like rain. Some who witnessed it had a strong impression of Earth moving through space, fording the meteor stream. Leonid meteor storms sometimes recur in cycles of 33 to 34 years. But the Leonids around the turn of the century \u2013 while wonderful for many observers \u2013 did not match the shower of 1966. And, in most years, the Lion whimpers rather than roars.\nRead more: All you need to know about Leonid meteors\nEarly to mid-December meteors \u2026 the Geminids\nPredicted peak: is predicted** for 3 UTC on December 14, 2025.\nWhen to watch: Since the radiant rises in mid-evening, you can watch for Geminids all night on December 13-14. The days before and after might be good as well. A waning crescent moon will rise a few hours after midnight on December 14, so it won\u2019t interfere with meteor watching. Plus, the bright planet Jupiter is nearby.\nOverall duration of shower: November 19 to December 24. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nRadiant: Rises in mid-evening, highest around 2 a.m. See chart below.\nNearest moon phase: In 2025, the last quarter moon falls at 20:52 UTC on December 11. So there will be a waning crescent moon rising several hours after midnight around the peak of the 2025 Geminid meteor shower and won\u2019t interfere with Geminid meteors.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, you might catch 120 Geminid meteors per hour.\nNote: The bold, white, bright Geminids give us one of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s best showers, especially in years when there\u2019s no moon. They\u2019re also visible, at lower rates, from the Southern Hemisphere. The meteors are plentiful, rivaling the August Perseids.\nRead more: All you need to know about Geminid meteors\nMeteor shower around the December solstice \u2026 the Ursids\nPredicted peak: is predicted** for 11 UTC on December 22, 2025.\nWhen to watch: Watch for Ursids on the evening of December 21st through dawn. You\u2019ll have a dark sky for watching meteors.\nDuration of shower: Ursids range from December 13 to 24, so you might see some intermingling with the Geminids\u2019 peak. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nRadiant: Circumpolar at northerly latitudes.\nNearest moon phase: A new moon occurs at 1:23 UTC on December 20. So the moon will not interfere with the Ursids in 2025.\nNote: This low-key meteor shower \u2013 which always peaks around the solstice \u2013 is somewhat overlooked due to the holiday season. Its hourly rate is lower than that of the Geminid shower, which peaked over a week before. In 2025, you\u2019ll have dark skies to watch for them all night. And the Ursids are worth a look!\nRead more: Ursid meteors peak around December solstice\nEarly January 2026 meteors \u2026 the Quadrantids\nWhen to watch: The best time to watch for the 2026 Quadrantids is the hours before dawn on January 4. (The predicted peak** is 00:36 UTC on January 3).\nNearest moon phase: A full moon will come at 5:03 UTC on January 3, 2026, so the light of a full moon will interfere with the Quadrantid meteors.\nRadiant: Rises in the north-northeast after midnight and is highest before dawn. The radiant point for the Quadrantids is in a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant. Nowadays, we see the radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism. Because the Quadrantid radiant is far to the north on the sky\u2019s dome, this is mostly a far-northern shower, not as good for the Southern Hemisphere.\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky, the Quadrantids can (briefly) produce over 100 meteors per hour. In 2026, find a way to block out the moon so you can see the brighter Quadrantids.\nDuration of shower: The Quadrantid meteor shower runs from mid-November through mid-January each year, according to this 2017 article in the journal Icarus. You might see a Quadrantid streak by any time during that interval. But most activity is centered on the peak. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nNote: The Quadrantid shower is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak (the other three are the Lyrids, Leonids, and Ursids).\nRead more: All you need to know about Quadrantid meteors\nApril 2026 meteors \u2026 the Lyrids\nWhen to watch in 2026: After midnight and through dawn on the morning of April 22. The predicted** peak is 19:15 UTC on April 22. The peak of the Lyrids is narrow (no weeks-long stretches of meteor-watching, as with some showers). In 2026, the first quarter moon falls at 2:32 UTC on April 24. So meteor watching after midnight and before dawn on April 22 will be under a dark and moonless sky.\nRadiant: Rises before midnight, highest in the sky at dawn.\nNearest moon phase: First quarter moon falls at 2:32 UTC on April 24. So a fat waxing crescent moon \u2013 that sets after midnight \u2013 won\u2019t interfere with the peak morning of the 2026\u2019s Lyrid meteor shower. The best time to watch is after midnight and before dawn on the morning of April 22.\nDuration of shower: April 15 to April 29. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the meteor stream in space!\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: In a dark sky with no moon, you might see 10 to 15 Lyrids per hour. The Lyrids are known for uncommon surges that can sometimes bring rates of up to 100 per hour! Read more about Lyrid outbursts.\nNote for Southern Hemisphere: This shower\u2019s radiant point is far to the north on the sky\u2019s dome. So the Southern Hemisphere will see fewer Lyrid meteors. Still, you might see some!\nMeteor train possibilities? In a moonless sky, a few Lyrid meteors can leave persistent trains. That is, they leave a trail of ionized gases that glow for a few seconds after the meteor has passed. Lyrids are known to produce fireballs.\nRead more: All you need to know about Lyrid meteors\nMay 2026 meteors \u2026 the Eta Aquariids\nWhen to watch: The best morning to watch is May 5, 2026, in the hours before dawn. The American Meteor Society is listing 3:51 UTC on May 5 as the shower\u2019s predicted** peak time. The fact is that the peak of this shower stretches out over several days. So you can expect elevated numbers of meteors a few days before and after the peak time. The mornings of both May 4 and May 6 are also good times to watch!\nNearest moon phase: The last quarter moon will fall at 21:10 UTC on May 9. So, there will be a waning gibbous moon in the post-midnight sky, that sets after sunrise. So the sky before dawn on the mornings around the predicted peak for the 2025 Eta Aquariids will compete with a bright gibbous moon. Find a way to block out the moon for a better view of the sky.\nThe radiant: will rise in the wee hours, climbing toward its highest point at dawn. That\u2019s why the hours before dawn will be the best time to watch this shower.\nDuration of shower: April 15 to May 27. This time period is when we\u2019re passing through the Eta Aquariid meteor stream in space!\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of this shower (the rate at the shower\u2019s peak, under a dark sky, with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky) is 60. But be aware that the shower is best for latitudes like those in the southern half of the U.S. or even farther south, in the Southern Hemisphere.\nNote: The Eta Aquariids\u2019 radiant will be on the ecliptic, which will ride low in the sky on spring mornings as seen from far northerly latitudes. This shower favors more southerly latitudes (like those in the southern U.S. or the Southern Hemisphere), where the radiant appears higher in the morning sky. It\u2019s often the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s best meteor shower of the year.\nRead more: All you need to know about Eta Aquariid meteors\nJune 2026 daytime meteor shower \u2026 the Arietids\nMost meteor showers are easy to observe. Just find a dark sky, and look up! But what about meteor showers that happen in the daytime, when the sun is up? The Arietids are sometimes said to be the most active daytime meteor shower. In 2026, their predicted** peak will be around the mornings of June 10. You might catch some Arietids around that morning in the dark hour before dawn.\nWhen to watch: Watch from May 22 to July 3. There\u2019s a predicted** peak for the mornings around June 10, 2026. Watch for them in the sunrise direction in the dark hour before dawn breaks.\nNearest moon phase: In 2026, a 3rd quarter moon occurs at 10:00 UTC on June 8. So on the mornings around June 10, a thick waxing crescent moon will interfere with watching for meteors. Watch from a place that\u2019s in the moon shadow or find a distant object to block out the light of the moon.\nRadiant: The shower\u2019s radiant point \u2013 the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to radiate \u2013 is in the constellation Aries. You\u2019ll find this constellation in the east before sunrise.\nDuration of shower: May 22 to July 3.\nExpected meteors at peak: This is tricky for daytime meteor showers because once the sun comes up, you won\u2019t be able to see them. But the Arietids have a strong zenithal hourly rate (ZHR)! Meteor counts with radar and radio echoes have indicated a rate of 60 meteors per hour, and perhaps as high as 200 meteors per hour.\nNote: The Arietids are sometimes said to be the most active daytime meteor shower.\nRead more: Arietids, most active daytime meteor shower\nLate July to mid-August 2025 meteors \u2026 the Delta Aquariids\nPredicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 10 UTC on July 30, 2026. But this shower doesn\u2019t have a noticeable peak. It rambles along steadily from late July through early August, joining forces with the August Perseids.\nWhen to watch: Watch late July through early August, mid-evening to dawn.\nDuration of shower: July 18 to August 21.\nRadiant: Rises in mid-evening, highest around 2 a.m. and low in the sky by dawn. See chart below.\nNearest moon phase: In 2026, the full moon falls at 14:36 UTC on July 29. Take advantage of the moon-free mornings \u2013 after midnight \u2013 the week before for watching the Delta Aquariids (and the early Perseids).\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: The Delta Aquariids\u2019 maximum hourly rate can reach 15 to 20 meteors in a dark sky with no moon. You\u2019ll typically see plenty of Delta Aquariids mixed in with the Perseids, if you\u2019re watching in early August.\nNote: Like May\u2019s Eta Aquariids, July\u2019s Delta Aquariids favors the Southern Hemisphere. Skywatchers at high northern latitudes tend to discount it. But the shower can be excellent from latitudes like those in the southern U.S. Delta Aquariid meteors tend to be fainter than Perseid meteors. So a moon-free dark sky is essential. About 5% to 10% of the Delta Aquariid meteors leave persistent trains, glowing ionized gas trails that last a second or two after the meteor has passed.\nRead more: All you need to know about Delta Aquariid meteors\nMeteor shower-watching resources\nLearn how to shoot photos of meteors\nHow high up are meteors when they begin to glow?\nFind a Dark Sky Place, from the International Dark Sky Association\nHeavens-Above: Satellite predictions customized to your location\nStellarium Online: Star maps customized to your location\nDark Site Finder, from astrophotographer Kevin Palmer\nEarthSky\u2019s tips for meteor-watchers\nWhy do meteor showers have a radiant point?\nMeteor shower guide: photos from the EarthSky community\nMeteor shower words of wisdom\nA wise person once said that meteor showers are like fishing. You go, you enjoy nature \u2026 and sometimes you catch something.\nBottom line: Up next is the Perseid meteor shower. They\u2019ll be most active around the mornings of August 12, although the bright gibbous moon will reduce how many meteors you\u2019ll see. Watch before dawn and check out the Venus and Jupiter conjunction while watching for meteors.\n**Peak times for meteor showers provided by Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society.

      "text": "Perseid meteor shower 2025: Best times and locations for viewing\nScientists predict up to 50 meteors per hour during peak viewing times.\nThe much-anticipated Perseid meteor shower, one of nature's most dazzling sky shows, is set to peak Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, lighting up skies across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\"The Perseids are caused by Earth running into trails of debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle,\" Bill Cooke, lead for NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office, told ABC News.\nThe shower has been captivating humans since it was first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 36 A.D., nearly 2,000 years ago.\nFor the best view of this celestial spectacle, timing is everything.\n\"The best time to see the Perseids would be in the wee hours of [Wednesday] morning, around 2 to 4 a.m.,\" Cooke said.\nIf you want to catch the show you won't need a telescope, Cooke said.\n\"You definitely do not want to use a telescope or binoculars, as the best way to see a meteor shower is to take in as much sky as possible,\" Cooke advised. \"Just use your eyes and enjoy the show!\"\nWhile this year's display will be affected by moonlight, determined sky-watchers can still catch plenty of meteors.\n\"The average person under dark skies could see somewhere between 40 and 50 Perseids per hour,\" Cooke said. \"Instead, you're probably going to see 10 to 20 per hour or fewer.\"\nThese \"shooting stars\" are actually space debris from Comet Swift-Tuttle, which last visited our cosmic neighborhood in 1992, according to NASA press release. (The comet is named for the two scientists who discovered the comet in 1862, Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle).\nWhen these pieces hit Earth's atmosphere, they create brilliant streaks of light across the night sky. The shower gets its name because the meteors appear to shoot out from near the Perseus constellation, NASA said.\nFor the best viewing experience, find a safe, dark spot away from city lights with a wide view of the sky. The shower will remain active until Sept. 1, though Tuesday night offers peak viewing opportunities. Just remember to dress warmly, bring a comfortable chair and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.\n\"You're not going to see Perseids around suppertime,\" Cooke said. \"You're going to have to go out later.\"\nBut for those willing to stay up late, the celestial show promises to be worth the wait."

  "argos_summary": "The Perseid meteor shower is set to peak on the night of August 12 into the early morning of August 13, 2025, with optimal viewing times between 2 and 4 a.m. local time. This annual event, caused by Earth passing through debris from Comet Swift-Tuttle, typically produces 40 to 50 meteors per hour, but this year, moonlight may reduce visibility to about 10 to 20 meteors per hour. Observers are advised to find dark locations away from city lights and allow their eyes to adjust to the darkness for the best experience.",
