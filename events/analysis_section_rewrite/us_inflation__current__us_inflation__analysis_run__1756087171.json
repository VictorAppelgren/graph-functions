      "feedback": "This draft is a solid, cross‑source synthesis but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter, decision‑oriented 0–3 week framework with explicit causal links, crisp thresholds, and fully sourced specificity. Improvements to implement in one pass: (1) sharpen the causal chain from immediate drivers to market reaction: use Powell’s rate‑cut hint and the 85% Fed‑cut odds to explain the risk‑on rally, then anchor Nvidia as the AI‑cycle proxy and specify how AI capex and semis data drive breadth of gains; cite 17F49LURJ and 218AGGUXB for the timing and the Intel/Trump policy headlines; (2) formalize a 3–4 scenario structure with explicit triggers and invalidation points (base/bull/bear and a policy‑risk upset). Triggers should include: Nvidia earnings trajectory, August jobs and inflation prints, and policy headlines around Intel/trump‑era investments; invalidate if the data miss or policy risks surge; (3) embed first‑principles grounding: articulate a brief framework (inflation dynamics vs. disinflation path, Fed reaction function, and risk premia) and show how tariff/deportation risks could re‑entrench pricing power (as Krugman argues) versus AI‑led productivity (as a growth offset) (cite 218AGGUXB); (4) quantify with precision from sources: pull concrete numbers (dividend yields such as JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ at ~11% yield; PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund PDI ~14% yield; Pacaso growth 21% YoY and EBITDA gains; 10× inflows into dividend ETFs per Purpose Investments) and reference them explicitly (S23W0Q0AW, 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z, CDBMWIUTB); (5) strengthen citation discipline and conflict handling: explicitly acknowledge rival views (inflation inertia vs. tariff‑driven inflation, as discussed by Krugman vs. Cuban) and present them as alternative pathways with probabilistic weights; (6) key levels/thresholds: state concrete monitoring levels (e.g., Fed‑cut odds >80–85%, Nvidia earnings surprise threshold, August payrolls CPI print bands) and clear invalidation points; (7) tighten format to satisfy horizon focus: present an inverted pyramid around immediate drivers, near‑term catalysts, and the near‑term reaction function, culminating in the precise next data points to monitor; (8) reconcile content breadth: if including alternative income plays (Gameflip, Pacaso, Mogul) and Fed‑policy headlines, tie them to the main transmission channel and avoid over‑fitting unrelated stories; (9) maintain strictly the IDs from SOURCE MATERIAL and ensure every factual claim is traceable to those IDs (S23W0Q0AW, 17F49LURJ, 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z, CDBMWIUTB) and note any material conflicts between sources. With these edits, the analysis will deliver a disciplined, numerically grounded, probability‑weighted, horizon‑constrained view that meets the SECTION FOCUS and provides actionable levels, triggers, and next‑step monitoring.",
