Generate Key Takeaways\n\nDanielle Spencer, a former child actor best known for her role as Dee in the 1970s sitcom \"What's Happening!!\", has died, a publicist for her family confirmed to ABC News.\n\nSpencer died Aug. 11, due to gastric cancer and cardiac arrest. She was 60, according to Sandra Jones, a family friend who is serving as the family's spokesperson.\n\n\"This untimely death is really hard to process right now,\" Jones told ABC News Tuesday. \"She is a sweet and gentle soul and she is going to be missed very, very much.\"\n\nSpencer starred in 65 episodes of \"What's Happening!!\", an ABC sitcom about three teenage boys growing up in the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, according to IMDb.\n\nSpencer played Dee Thomas, the boys' younger sister. She also appeared in 16 episodes of the show's sequel, \"What's Happening Now!\"\n\nIn 1977, Spencer survived a fatal car crash that killed her stepfather and manager, Tim Pelt, according to her biography on her website.\n\nAfter recovering from her injuries, Spencer went onto earn a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine in 1993.\n\nShannen Doherty's mother talks grief: 'A child should never go before a parent'\n\nShe moved from California to the Richmond, Virginia, area in 2014.\n\nAt the time of her death, Spencer, who previously battled breast cancer, lived with her mom in an area outside of Richmond, according to Jones.\n\nIn addition to her mom, Cheryl Pelt, Spencer is also survived by her younger brother, jazz musician Jeremy Pelt.\n\nIn an email Tuesday, Jeremy Pelt told ABC News that Spencer was, \"a very loving spirit who fought courageously until the very end.\"\n\nJeremy Pelt also shared a tribute to his sister on Instagram Tuesday, writing, \"Many of you knew her as 'Dee,' but she was more than a child actress.\"\n\n\"She was a friend, an auntie to my three children who adored her, she was a daughter- and in many ways, my mother's best friend, she was a veterinarian, she was someone who always remained positive even during her darkest days fighting this disease,\" he continued. \"And she was MY sister and protector.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"thankful\" to be with his sister when she took her last breath and was \"gutted\" by her death, writing, \"I love you, forever.\"\n\n'Three's Company' stars have mini reunion at benefit for John Ritter: See the photos\n\nIn a 2016 interview with a local Richmond TV station, Spencer reflected on her acting career being featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I seriously can't even digest it,\" Spencer said. \"I mean, first of all, that the show is remembered from 40 years [ago], but then also to be featured in this museum along with other shows that have been trailblazers.\"\n\nSpencer said that her late stepfather brought her into the world of acting. At age 9, she said she got the call that she had won the role of Dee in \"What's Happening!!\"\n\n\"A month later I got a phone call, and they said, 'Fly out to California. You have the role.' And it was just like my life changed,\" she said.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. is the parent company of ABC and ABC News.",

      "text": "Shannen Doherty's mother talks grief: 'A child should never go before a parent'\nShannen Doherty's mother, Rosa Doherty, is speaking out about the experience of losing her daughter to cancer in July.\nThe mother of the \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" actress shared her grief on the Monday episode of \"Let's Be Clear with Shannen Doherty\" podcast which was formerly hosted by Shannen Doherty herself.\n\"A parent should never go, you know, last longer than a child,\" said Rosa Doherty.\n\"A child should never go before a parent, and it's things we have no control of,\" she added on the episode with Doherty's good friend Chris Cortazzo.\nOf her daughter's death, Rosa Doherty said she was leaning on her faith.\n\"My faith just tells me it's all in God's hands. And that's how Shannen felt, and that's how she lived her life,\" she said.\nRosa Doherty also reflected on the final weeks she was able to share with her daughter, calling them \"a gift.\"\n\"She moved me into a room next to her, closer to her, and then eventually... one night she said, 'Mom, will you come sleep with me,\" she said.\n\"That was such a gift for me, that I had in those final weeks,\"she said. \"It's like I could lay there, I could hear her breathing, and I could feel her.\u201d\n\"It was a gift. It's like a gift she gave to me,\" she said.\nShannen Doherty died at the age of 53 on July 13 after a years-long battle with cancer.\n\"The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie,\" a representative said in a statement at the time of her death.\nIn January, Doherty, who often shared updates on her cancer battle publicly, said on her podcast that she'd recently begin a new, unspecified cancer treatment infusion, saying it had begun \"breaking down the blood-brain barrier,\" enabling the treatment to get to her brain.\n\"I don't want to die,\" Doherty told People magazine in December 2023. \"I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating. I'm not done with hopefully changing things for the better. I'm just not -- I'm not done.\""

It was the creative brainchild of producer Eric Monte(who also co-created and produced \"Good Times\"),and produced under Saul Turtletaub, Bernie Orenstein and Bud Yorkin(of \"Sanford and Son\",and \"All In The Family\"),\"What's Happening!\" premiered on ABC as a summer replacement for \"Barney Miller\" on August 5,1976 but returned on November 13,1976 as a regular series running three seasons and 65 episodes until April 28,1979.\nThis was one of my fondest memories of childhood back in the day,coming home and watching the antics of Roger,Dewayne,and Rerun getting into all sorts of trouble only to get Roger's smart-mouth sister Dee and Roger's mother get them out of unsuspected situations. Interesting note on \"What's Happening!!\",though.....it got the idea from a 1975 film \"Cooley High\"(on which the show was based)about three Chicago kids who were having fun and getting into all sorts of trouble......The show(getting back to \"What's Happening\"!!) was based in the residental section of Los Angeles where the mom was the single parent with two children in the household. The show itself was side-splitting hilarious indeed catching the gang down at the soda stop coming up with some crazy scheme or another,and catching Rerun and Shirley(the waitress) battling it out,or getting some girl to go out with them. The show was a major top ten hit for the ABC network(which started off as a trial run,but returned in the fall as a weekly series). The theme score to the show was done by the great Henry Mancini,and its a classic. Some of the cast members reunited for a spin off called \"What's Happening Now!!\",with Roger getting married off,and Rerun and Dewayne having a business of their own,and the waitress Shirley who brought Rob's Place and is the owner. Rumor has it that two of the cast members of that show Dewayne,(played by Haywood Nelson),and Dee(played by Danielle Spencer) are living in North Carolina now,and Roger(played by Ernest Thomas)is doing feature films(notably seen in Denzel Washington's movie \"The Hurricane\") nowadays.

Great show,as it celebrates it Golden 40th Anniversary!!! Happy Anniversary Roger, Dewayne and Rerun!!!\nThis was one of my favorite tv shows growing up! as other users commented, it was the first thing i would turn on after school! it was not only the funniest show, but it dealt with a single parent home, and i was raised in a single parent home, so i related to it. i miss seeing Raj make a fool out of himself, by being so nerdy and Dee, with all the sarcasm, you never stopped laughing....and Shirley, anything she said, made you laugh. i think if more people posted their comments, than maybe it will impact someone to syndicate the show! as you can see, the cast of the show never really made it, perhaps this could help their careers, so bring us RERUNS of \"What's Happening\"! we miss Rerun and all his dance moves....\"Hey Hey Hey\"!\nI have to say that I grew up on these reruns. I was surprised to see and remember how much I enjoyed the show during the recent TV Land marathon. The show was still groundbreaking too. I never understood why Mabel King who played Mama so beautifully left. I still remember Rerun, Dwayne, Raj, Dee, and Shirley as a happy group of people in working class Los Angeles, California. I'm not black but I can relate to the financial struggles that they held despite maintaining a happy suburban life. They provided many memorable moments for me over the weekend. It was nice to see Irene Cara in a guest appearance and Alice Ghostley and others too many to mention. The sitcom was probably criticized in its day but today, I can see it as a brilliant piece of realistic comedy touching on subjects tactfully and carefully like teenage pregnancy, marriage, divorce, single-parent home and of course, financial problems like all families share. I believe it was the first sitcom in my memory to feature divorce in a positive light rather than negative. Enjoy it!\nBelieve me, WHATS HAPPENING came out on a perfect time. There was'nt a better TV show to grow up on! Who could ever forget 1)Raj, the wise, bird-cracklin nerdish dude who could never sit in a chair the right way! 2) Rerun, the round, always-in-step party mover 3) Dwayne, the not so smart, heckling nervous breakdown \"They cut off your fingers and your toes, man!\" 4) And good ol' bratty sister Dee, who reminded you of everyone's sister!\nWHATS HAPPENING is really missed by this commentator. Come on TVLAND, give us some RERUNs! RERUNs!\nWHATS HAPPENING is really missed by this commentator. Come on TVLAND, give us some RERUNs! RERUNs!\nWhat's Happening was loosely based on the movie \"Cooley High\". It is sometime shown in reruns along with its vastly inferior sequel, What's Happening Now.\nThe heart of the show was the relationship among the three high school buddies, studious Roger, dim bulb Dwayne, and clownish Rerun. The late Shirley Hemphill got off some good zingers as the surly waitress of the malt shop the guys hung out in. Dee was the perfect snide and bratty kid sister to Roger, and Mama dished out discipline and love.\nOne of the best episodes was a two-parter that is seldom shown in reruns. Roger, Rerun and Dwayne were forced into illegally taping a Doobie Brothers concert (the rock group appeared as themselves) by some criminals. The tape recorder is discovered when it falls out from underneath Rerun's coat, and one of the musicians sees it. The Doobie Brothers then work with the three buddies to catch the criminals.\nThe heart of the show was the relationship among the three high school buddies, studious Roger, dim bulb Dwayne, and clownish Rerun.

Shirley Hemphill, Haywood Nelson and Danielle Spencer carried the show through the duration of the walkout. Their demands were not met. After the third season, Berry and Thomas engaged in another walkout demanding more money. Even though the show ranked 29th in the 1978-79 season, ABC canceled it rather than deal with their demands.\n- GoofsThroughout the entire series, it is made very clear that neither Mama nor Raj have a car, as often indicated by Mama needing to ride the bus to work and Raj always needing rides from other people (or walking) to his many adventures and escapades. Yet, in the very first scene of the opening credits, Raj is seen exiting his house with two cars parked in the driveway.\n- Quotes\nFred 'Rerun' Stubbs: I can't help it if I'm fat! It runs in my family.\nDee Thomas: Nobody runs in your family... they all waddle!\n- Alternate versionsDuring its syndicated run, the tag sequences that were included in the original ABC network versions were removed.\n- ConnectionsFeatured in ABC's 50th Anniversary Celebration (2003)\n- How many seasons does What's Happening!! have?Powered by Alexa\nDetails\n- Release date\n- Country of origin\n- Language\n- Also known as\n- \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f!!\n- Filming locations\n- 1147 Tamarind Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA(The Thomas House - Opening Credits - Replaced by Apartments 2023)\n- Production companies\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content"
