      "feedback": "Overall verdict: the draft provides a plausible multi‑year cloud/AI narrative but lacks a rigorous, first‑principles, regime‑based framework and a tightly scoped, testable transmission from macro/tech fundamentals to market pricing. It leans on single‑stock anecdotes (MSFT/SHOP) and a few levered software peers (PRGS) without anchoring to invariant anchors, regime conditions, or explicit catalysts that would survive a 3–5+ year horizon. To lift to world‑class, you should reframe around a concise, three‑pillar structure: (i) invariant anchors and regime map, (ii) a clear causal transmission from productivity/IT capex to cash flow, valuations, and capital allocation, and (iii) a multi‑scenario, trigger‑driven path to valuation outcomes with explicit watchpoints.\n\nActionable edit instructions (concrete, source‑anchored edits): \n- Add first‑principles anchors and regime definitions grounded in the sources: set a multi‑year productivity/IT‑capex anchor (e.g., the cloud/AI growth regime) using the cloud CAGR and allocable cash flows in MSFT/SHOP as proxies (cite Grand View Research 21.2% CAGR to 2030 for cloud, source 2; cite MSFT Azure growth 39% and Q4’25 revenue growth 18% from 0G3A676BP). Explicitly link these to a regime map: (A) secular cloud/AI growth with durable cash flow and balance‑sheet strength, (B) growth‑to‑valuation re‑rating risk if cash conversion deteriorates or rates surprise, (C) downside if AI adoption or cloud spend slows and cash generation compresses (cite PRGS ROE and debt load as a canary for leverage risk, source  DBFSBGOEX). \n- Turn the transmission into a concrete chain with explicit numbers: from AI productivity shock → cloud/AI revenue growth (MSFT), to free cash flow growth and dividend capacity (MSFT 33.6% payout, 0.7% yield) → capital returns and moat reinforcement; for Shopify, from price/inventory/logistics changes to higher gross margins and FCF (restate 31% revenue growth, $2.7B revenue, $906M net income, $422M FCF; >12% US GMV share) to platform moat (source 0G3A676BP). Tie cloud ecosystem momentum to ETFs and peer group demand (SKF/CLOU/SKYY) as market‑pricing signals (cite source 2 for cloud ETFs and the cloud stock list). \n- Sharpen catalysts, triggers, and invalidation points with explicit thresholds tied to sources: e.g., Azure growth sustaining mid‑30s% YoY versus deceleration toward the mid‑20s% range, Shopify sustaining high‑20s% revenue growth and FCF expansion; SLB’s high shareholder yield (65% in Validea) as a cash‑return lever in energy cycles; Progress Software’s ROE ~13% with debt/Equity ~3.22 and earnings decline as a risk flag; use these as indicators of regime shifts (cite 9X7XOLXMH and DBFSBGOEX). \n- Explicitly structure the base case, upside, and downside with quantified paths drawn from the sources (e.g., base case: cloud/CAGR remains intact with MSFT/SHOP cash generation supporting modest multiple expansion given durable moat; cite MSFT and SHOP metrics; base case probability not stated in sources; instead describe scenarios and their drivers). \n- Improve “what to watch” and “invalidation” items: list concrete metrics and event risks (Azure growth rate, contracted revenue, FCF margin trajectory for megaclouds; SLB cash returns; PRGS earnings trajectory; cloud ETF flows) with citations after each line (cite 0G3A676BP for MSFT/SHOP, 2 for cloud‑growth frame and ETF signals, 9X7XOLXMH for SLB, DBFSBGOEX for PRGS). \n- Reconcile and tighten citation density: ensure every factual claim has at least one source citation, reconcile the two copies of the same Motley Fool piece by citing 0G3A676BP (and its alternate variant 48JXC9VDP) once per factual point to avoid duplication; ensure critical assertions about cloud/AI scale, megacloud economics, and energy cash returns map to the named sources (2, 0G3A676BP, 9X7XOLXMH, DBFSBGOEX, and the related Fool cloud/ETF references in source 2).\n\nExpected tightening outcomes: a multi‑year, regime‑aware narrative with an explicit causal chain from AI/cloud productivity to cash flows and pricing, explicit base/macro scenarios with measurable watchpoints, and a disciplined use of numbers and citations (2; 0G3A676BP; 9X7XOLXMH; DBFSBGOEX; plus cloud/ETF references in source 2). This will produce a coherent base case, clearly defined risks and triggers, a concrete watch list, and a quantified sense of confidence aligned with SECTION FOCUS.",
