      "feedback": "Strong, world‑class feedback you can act on: reframe the piece as a formal, multi‑year structural thesis with explicit invariant anchors (define productivity impulse from AI as a parameter p, real rates as r, terms of trade and external positions as T, and policy reaction functions as π; treat BoP/external balance as a constraint on cap‑allocation), then map regime shifts and transition conditions, and close with a clearly defined base case, risks, and watch items. Concrete edits: (1) Anchor the argument in first principles and data you actually cite; after the Brookings/“25% exposed to automation” line, quantify how p and the resulting potential output (without claiming a fixed growth rate) would alter demand and investment via household income, debt, and savings channels, and tie to the UBI debate (NL5YYTLF2). Bring in Finland UBI results as an invalidation test for the demand/participation channel, not just employment effects, and spell out why identity costs could tilt consumption even if employment recovers (NL5YYTLF2). (2) Build a regime map: Regime A (AI productivity accelerates with adaptable labor markets); Regime B (labor displacement dominates, triggering demand for safety nets); Regime C (policy tightening/remediation or tariff/taff delineation affects inflation and real incomes); with explicit transition triggers: e.g., a threshold exposure y>25% or a measured deterioration in unemployment/consumption despite rising productivity (NL5YYTLF2); tariffs/inflation shocks (as discussed in Mark Cuban/Trump tariff pieces in YVQU6QCY4 and IGP1Q4ZEJ); EV/auto profitability pivots in 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW. (3) Make the causal chain explicit and testable: AI supply‑side gains feed potential output; demand/sentiment constrained by labor displacement and identity costs; policy choices (UBI, social insurance, retraining) shift actual demand, durable goods/healthcare spending, and capital allocation, which then price risk premia and steer equity/credit pricing. (4) Quantify the transmission with sourced numbers: cite the 25% automation exposure (NL5YYTLF2); Finland UBI results being employment‑neutral at best (NL5YYTLF2); Ford’s EV losses and cyclicality (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW); Ford’s dividend yield ~5.18% and low forward P/E around 8 as a cash‑flow anchor (W2622L6WW, IGP1Q4ZEJ); UNH/LULU case study as contrarian, cash‑rich names with moat despite near‑term headwinds (IGP1Q4ZEJ); the retirement caveats on safe withdrawal rates (~3.7%), healthcare cost growth, and inflation risk (11, 9, 16—Morningstar/GoBankingRates pieces); and the long‑term retirement planning framework (15; 12). (5) Tighten sourcing and reconciliation: explicitly note any conflicts (UBI optimism vs. caution from NL5YYTLF2) and harmonize the narrative so the base case leans on a balanced read of the set of sources rather than cherry‑picking one thread. (6) Improve the writing and format for horizon/style: present the base‑case narrative as a narrative plus a concise, numerically bounded sensitivity table (even a one‑paragraph table would help), and insert explicit “watch” bullets (policy pilots, AI deployment pace, tariff announcements, insurer margins, EV profitability, demographic cost trajectories) anchored to the cited sources. (7) Ensure minimal extrapolation beyond what is in the sources: commit to ranges/qualitative judgments only where the sources warrant them (automation exposure, UBI outcomes, Ford/UNH/LULU dynamics, retirement costs). (8) For coverage, add a concise closing: a base case with a qualitative probability band, key upside/downside risks, and a 12–24 month read‑through on policy/tech signals; maintain a disciplined ending that speaks to SECTION FOCUS: regimes, transition conditions, causal chain to pricing, base case, risks, watches, and confidence (NL5YYTLF2, YVQU6QCY4, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, IGP1Q4ZEJ). This will turn the piece into a rigorous, signal‑rich, world‑class multi‑year thesis rather than a thematic collage.",
