  "title": "Gen-Z's Social Media Addiction May Have Ironically Led to an Indie Cinema Revival",
  "description": "Social media is typically accused of killing the film industry but is it possible it could save it?",
  "content": "During the pandemic, movie theaters notably struggled, as social distancing restrictions all but temporarily killed their business model. Many smaller, independent theaters went out of business permanently. However, since the pandemic has ebbed, the film industry has slowly recovered. Attendance in theaters is not exactly where it was prior to the pandemic, but attendance is significantly higher than it was during Covid, and continues to climb.\n\nA new article published by The Guardian suggests that slowly climbing audience numbers in Europe may be driven, in part, by the affluence of film access provided by the internet. The article provides some data (as well as anecdotal evidence) that suggests the social media soaked landscape in which young people were raised during Covid may have led to a resurgence of interest in cinema with a capital \u201cC.\u201d Ticket sales in Britain are obviously up, post-2020 (there was a pandemic), and many independent theaters are where the ticket sales spikes have been highest, the report says. At those locations, young people appear to be driving much of the new sales, it adds. Many indie theaters notably show older movies (if you\u2019re an NYC resident, think the Film Forum). The report notes:\n\nAt independent theaters, the trend is much the same:\n\nThe article notes that the access to classic, indie, and arthouse movies provided by the internet may be driving a surge of interest in independent theaters. A programmer at the Watershed is quoted as saying that many of the young viewers are \u201cquite adventurous with their taste, especially when it comes to older films and rereleases,\u201d and seem to enjoy cult classics and indie favorites. This may be because they\u2019ve gained access to them online. \u201cWe\u2019re Letterboxd fiends. That\u2019s the first thing I do after a movie, I go to Letterboxd,\u201d Isiah Robinson, 22, was quoted as saying.\n\nIn other words, Britain\u2019s Gen-Z kids appear to have discovered the cinema, and they seem to like it quite a bit. On top of that, the youth appear to appreciate an environment in which they\u2019re not constantly tempted by their phones. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to switch off,\u201d Sophia Crothall, 23, told The Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t touch my phone the whole time I\u2019m in the cinema. At home, I\u2019m probably scrolling.\u201d\n\nA movie theater screen is still a screen, but damn if it isn\u2019t a drastic improvement over the small cylindrical one that millions of us carry with us everywhere we go (and which constantly begs for our attention). It\u2019s also really nice to see the young people of the world realizing that movies are awesome. If Netflix and Letterboxd are to thank for rising theater sales, well, good on them.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this kind of youth-driven renaissance has been taking place in America as well, although theater attendance domestically has followed a similarly redemptive trajectory. According to IMDb\u2019s sales metrics page, Box Office Mojo, tickets sold in the U.S. plummeted between 2019 and 2020 (dropping from $11 billion to $2 billion), but rebounded somewhat in 2021 and 2022 (climbing from $4 billion to $7 billion). In 2023 and 2024, box office sales hovered between $8.9-8.5 billion. This year got off to a slow start, but the summer months have made up for it somewhat, thanks to some unconventional hits. A swell of prestige releases in the latter months may also prove profitable.",

      "text": "The movie industry hasn\u2019t caught many breaks in recent years, even after rebounding from the Covid-19 pandemic. Studios were faced with a writers\u2019 strike, blockbusters that fell well below expectations and dilemmas over when to release movies into theaters before having them stream online.\nThe domestic box office continued a trend of getting the year off to a slow start, as January lacked a strong carryover movie from the holiday season or a surprise audience pleaser, renewing fears the industry faces long-term financial woes.\nThe box office for January 1 to April 3 was down 13% compared to the same time last year, which in turn was down 7.6% compared with 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a hard-and-fast rule that the first three months are typically slow. Sometimes they can be huge if you have a big holdover movie and a couple of breakout hits,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Comscore.\nThe first major release of 2025 was Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which opened in February to more than $100 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend, only to see its earnings plunge 68% in the second week.\nThings didn\u2019t improve much from there. In March, the box office was down nearly 50% compared with the same month last year, according to Comscore data. Ticket sales certainly weren\u2019t buoyed by Disney\u2019s \u201cSnow White,\u201d which opened to a meager $43 million amid polarizing reactions about casting and politics.\nA Hollywood comeback\nBut then came the turnaround.\nApril brought a wide variety of movies that drew in nostalgic audiences and moviegoers following positive buzz.\nCarrying much of the load for the month was Warner Bros. Pictures. The studio\u2019s \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d debuted to nearly $163 million, while Ryan Coogler\u2019s highly acclaimed \u201cSinners\u201d has exceeded expectations with over $275 million in domestic sales. Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.\nFollowing the strong performance from \u201cMinecraft,\u201d the industry had a record Memorial Day weekend that saw the box office up 22% compared with 2024.\nIt was led by Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d remake opening to a record $183 million. \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d has so far grossed over $380 million domestically and may soon overtake \u201cMinecraft\u201d ($423.9 million) as this year\u2019s biggest earner. Other May winners include the big-budget Disney/Marvel movie \u201cThunderbolts\u201d ($189 million), Paramount\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning,\u201d ($173 million) and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\u201d ($133 million).\nThe momentum has carried over into June with \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon.\u201d Universal\u2019s live-action remake has already grossed nearly $135 million since opening last weekend.\nThe overall box office is closing in on $4 billion for all of 2025 \u2014 an 18% gain compared to this time last year, according to Comscore data.\n2023 marked the first post-pandemic year to earn more than $4 billion between the first Friday of May and Labor Day, according to Comscore.\nGreg Durkin, founder of entertainment research firm Enact Insights, attributes the industry\u2019s comeback to a rise in quality films.\nAnd high-potential movies are about to be released. Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 \u201cF1\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d are set to open Friday. July will include Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cSuperman,\u201d which Durkin said will be \u201ctremendous\u201d hits at the box office. He added that Disney\u2019s July release of \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d will also do well.\n\u201c\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Fantastic Four\u2019 and maybe to a degree \u2018Jurassic World,\u2019 will be big players\u201d to nearly reach $4 billion this summer, said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory.\nIt\u2019s still a \u2018risky business\u2019\n\u201cWe\u2019re not selling Frosted Flakes or Coca-Cola \u2026 This is a product that reinvents itself every week,\u201d said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Boxoffice Pro.\nMovies have \u201cfortunately\u201d connected better with audiences, but it\u2019s still a \u201crisky business,\u201d Loria added.\nHaving a diverse movie slate can be helpful. Since April, moviegoers have had the choice of children and family movies (\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d), action flicks (\u201cMission Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d), horror (\u201cSinners\u201d) and romantic comedies (\u201cMaterialists\u201d).\n\u201cThe lineup goes on hot and cold streaks. Something can look good on paper but not work in release, and vice versa,\u201d said box office analyst David A. Gross, who publishes FranchiseRe.\nGross noted that even superhero movies, such as \u201cCaptain America\u201d and \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d haven\u2019t consistently performed well compared to pre-pandemic years.\nAnd while April and May helped this year\u2019s box office bounce back from a slow start, June will be down about 6.5% compared to last year and down almost 26% compared with the pre-pandemic average, according to estimates from Gross.\n\u201cThe \u2018recovery\u2019 compared with last year is slipping, so it\u2019s not time to pop the champagne just yet,\u201d Gross said.\nMovies are recession-proof\nIn times of broader political and economic uncertainty, Americans have shown they will pull away from expensive commitments and seek smaller pleasures. For some, that means trading in vacations and indulging in less expensive purchases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cheap to go to a movie, relative to going to rent a house and get on a flight, or rent a car,\u201d said Durkin. \u201cYou still need that escapism.\u201d\nThe movie theater is a social experience, Durkin said, which makes it fulfilling and worthwhile.\nIn Clarksdale, Mississippi \u2014 the town which inspired the setting of \u201cSinners\u201d \u2014 a special screening was hosted to allow locals in the theater-less town to watch the film together.\nMoviegoers are still \u201cprice sensitive,\u201d Loria said. Although premium offerings can price a single ticket as high as $25 in cities like New York and Los Angeles, theater chains such as AMC offer discount screenings on Tuesdays. On July 9, AMC will start offering 50% discounts on Wednesdays.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively inexpensive way to escape the outside world for a couple of hours,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that PG-rated films have been \u201cbooming\u201d as families head to theaters.\n\u201cLooking at 2025 in a vacuum \u2014 what a great recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all product-based. It\u2019s the movies that determine the box office, not the month.\u201d"

      "text": "Movie theaters have been reopening at the start of summer 2021 after being closed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This caused independent theaters such as Holiday Cinemas in Wallingford, Connecticut, to struggle with selling tickets and popcorn.\n\u201cI was one of the last people working here when we got the information (pandemic closing theaters),\u201dAustin Washington said, manager of Holiday Cinemas. \u201cIt was a little disappointing, but at the same time it was for the best, for like safety reasons.\u201d\nHoliday Cinemas closed during the pandemic in March 2020 when the state told business to close down to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Holiday Cinemas later reopened on August 21, 2021, only allowing less than half of the theaters capacity of people to enter.\nOther independent theaters however had to close permanently due to the lack of revenue. Of the 5,798 theaters in the U.S., 23% of independent and chain cinemas have stayed closed since March 2020.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything to prepare for the end (of the pandemic),\u201d said Alan Soffur, manager of Cine 4 in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping people can come here, but as you see we\u2019re all masked up\u2026 We\u2019re hoping more people get vaccinated and more people come to the theater.\u201d\nTheaters like Cine 4 will have four to five people watching a movie in a theater that can fit over a hundred, have a concession stand filled with candy and popcorn that will never be sold, and employees that will sit around until their shift is over.\nWith COVID cases dropping throughout the country, more theaters began to reopen. In order to stay safe, theaters began to make new rules for employees and customers when entering the theaters. These rules include theaters being completely cleaned down after every film, everyone must wear a mask when they enter, limiting the amount of customers to enter the theaters, and customers buying food and drinks online with their tickets.\n\u201cWe do everything, clean, take tickets, concession, there\u2019s no real one job,\u201d said Josh Marks, employee at Holiday Cinemas. \u201cWe all alternate. If someone needs help doing something, we go over there.\u201d\nWhile major chain cinemas began opening again in the summer of 2020, Independent theater had only begun to reopen in the spring and summer of 2021. This is due to film directors and major theater chains wanting to movie back in theaters and not on streaming services. The first film that was in theaters was \u201cGodzilla vs. Kong\u201d in March 2021, getting 32.2 million dollars in the opening week.\n\u201cWe think about where films will go in the future,\u201d said Frederick K. Staudmyer, chair and assistant professor of Film, Television and Media Arts at Quinnipiac University. \u201cIf studios have these picture in home and in the theater, you\u2019re going to have a fraction of the population who stay at home\u2026 Now with the distribution modal, you can see new releases on Paramount Plus, on Disney Plus, on Netflix.\u201d\nDespite theaters opening their doors and dusting off their projectors, people were unaware and even surprised that independent theaters were up and running. Holiday Theaters would usually have there theaters filled halfway to full, but now they only get two to five people in a theater.\n\u201cIt was a slow reopening,\u201d said Washington, the Holiday Cinemas manager. \u201cWe had six hour shifts, which is basically four movie times\u2026 the first couple of months were really rough, especially considering people didn\u2019t think we were open.\u201d\nTheaters get 40% of each ticket sold, but since people choose to go to larger theater chains to watch movies, Independent theaters are unable to make enough money to stay in business. The National Association of Theater Owners stepped in to help keep theaters and cinemas in business.\nIn September 2020, the association sent a letter to Congress to give a lifeline to small and mid-sized theater companies. Congress passed legislation on Dec. 27, 2020 and provided $15 billion in grants to help the theaters. Despite the help, theaters like Cine 4 still have a hard time selling tickets and candy.\n\u201cBy mid June, maybe forth of July, we were actually doing half the business we used to do. Then the delta variant took over and everyone ran away from us,\u201d said Soffur, manager of Cine 4. \u201cTicket money goes to the film companies in the states more than is goes in our pockets, way less than half nowadays.\u201d\nAs months went by, more people began to come to the independent theaters because of films beginning to be played only in theaters and not on streaming services. \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\u201d \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d and \u201cEternals\u201d are films that premiered in theaters. Marvel\u2019s Shang-Chi made $430 million in the box office, making it the highest grossing film of 2021.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been slow in the beginning, but now it\u2019s starting to pick up,\u201d said Lia Amadon, another employee at Holiday Cinema. \u201cI feel like they miss the experience. You come to the movies, you get your popcorn, you get your seats. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\nWith the support given to independent Cinema through customers and the National Association of Theater Owners, it will still take a lot of time to make back the money lost because of the pandemic."

      "text": "With 5,700 Movie Screens Shut Down and the Box Office in a Slump, Theaters Are Still Waiting for a Post-Pandemic Comeback\nFor more than a century, B&B Theatres has brought movies \u2014 from \u201cCasablanca\u201d and \u201cPsycho\u201d to \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d \u2014 to audiences across the South and the Midwest. The family-owned and-operated cinema chain isn\u2019t just a business \u2014 it\u2019s a way of life for the Bagbys, who have provided escapism for their customers through wars, recessions and terrorist attacks.\nYet the coronavirus reoriented the Bagbys\u2019 company in ways those other catastrophes did not. Now, on any given weekend, patrons at B&B Theatres aren\u2019t just catching the newest release \u2014 they\u2019re stopping by the multiplex to bowl, play pickleball and arcade games or grab a cocktail at the bar. These changes to the American institution of moviegoing are startling, but they\u2019ve helped keep the lights on post-pandemic, when studios began producing fewer and fewer films and people fell out of the habit of going to theaters.\n\u201cThe pandemic made us realize that we need to diversify,\u201d says Bob Bagby, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe can\u2019t just depend on studios to provide us with what we need to drive our business.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nSo far, B&B Theatres, which serves audiences in states such as in Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas and Florida, has opened four of these venues and plans to add another four this year. The goal is getting patrons to \u201clinger longer,\u201d Bagby says, so they\u2019re spending money whether or not they take in a movie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to run; it\u2019s more like you\u2019re overseeing a cruise ship than a movie theater,\u201d says Brock Bagby, Bob\u2019s son and the company\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s also a bigger risk; they\u2019re much more expensive to build. But we need to create a better mousetrap to get people to come.\u201d\nSo far, B&B Theatres is attracting crowds. But many of its competitors aren\u2019t so lucky. Five years after COVID, the movie theater industry is smaller in terms of attendance and box office returns. It\u2019s also less relevant and more imperiled, forced to compete with an endless array of streaming services. There\u2019s a sense that a few bad breaks could extinguish an art form that\u2019s been built over generations.\n\u201cThe recovery has been much slower than people hoped,\u201d says Eric Handler, an exhibition industry analyst with Roth Capital Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle. You\u2019ve had companies go out of business, and most of the major chains closed locations.\u201d\nWith fewer people stopping by the box office, Regal Cinemas, Pacific Theatres, Alamo Drafthouse and others filed for Chapter 11. Some of these companies have reemerged after bankruptcy; others have dimmed their marquees forever. As a result, North America has 5,691 fewer screens compared with pre-COVID times, according to research by media consultancy Omdia.\nBox office grosses haven\u2019t rebounded either. Ticket sales in 2024 fell to $8.7 billion, a 23.5% drop from pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s a far cry from the nearly $11 billion the industry was generating before the global health crisis. Theater owners maintain their business is about to regain its footing, but this year is off to a lousy start, with franchise fare like \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d falling short and ambitious bets like \u201cMickey 17\u201d failing to pay off.\nBut there are signs the situation is about to improve. Over the summer and into the holiday season, new installments of popular properties such as \u201cJurassic World,\u201d \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d will land in multiplexes. In all, studios are unveiling roughly 110 movies this year, at least 15 more than they did in 2024. That alone is reason to celebrate for cinemas, which have been desperate for more movies to put on their screens.\n\u201cRecovery isn\u2019t at hand, but it\u2019s just around the corner. You can reach out and almost touch it,\u201d predicts Adam Aron, CEO of AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain. \u201cAnd as good as the back half of this year looks, 2026 seems even stronger.\u201d\nBut movie theaters need more than a few splashy sequels and a consistent influx of studio releases to shift their fortunes. Studios and exhibitors estimate that between 15% and 20% of moviegoers stopped going to cinemas after the lockdown ended, and it\u2019s not clear what, if anything, will entice them to return.\n\u201cWe need to find a way to get people back into the habit of going to theaters,\u201d John Fithian, co-founder of consulting firm The Fithian Group. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay stuck in a 100-year-old way of doing business \u2014 that\u2019s not going to work anymore.\u201d\nMany theater owners are trying to do things differently. They\u2019re selling a wider array of snacks, sprucing up musty auditoriums and enhancing loyalty programs to reward loyal customers. Some exhibitors are even experimenting with variable pricing, charging more for blockbusters than for less popular genres like dramas and comedies. A few films, such as 2023\u2019s octogenarian comedy \u201c80 for Brady,\u201d have offered discount tickets to appeal to cost-conscious patrons. However, several theaters have been hesitant to more broadly embrace these initiatives, citing their already thin profit margins.\n\u201cThe No. 1 barrier to entry for movies is price,\u201d says a veteran studio executive. \u201cThere should be no limit to what you charge for an \u2018Avengers\u2019 or \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 or \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 but exhibitors need to give audiences an incentive to see other kinds of movies.\u201d\nStudio sources say they are ramping up production but note that they can\u2019t produce tentpoles 52 weeks a year. If theaters want to boost attendance, they need to find a better way to get people to\nsee movies that don\u2019t feature dinosaur attacks or Tom Cruise stunts.\nCinema operators, for their part, would rather have a range of different-sized films to show each week rather than hold out for the occasional blockbuster.\n\u201c[Tentpoles] are important, but quantity is more important,\u201d says Chris Johnson, CEO of Classic Cinemas, which has 16 locations across Illinois and Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019ll take six movies that are doing reasonable business over a giant movie that creates a vacuum.\u201d\nExhibitors have other grievances. During the pandemic, they agreed to let studios dramatically shrink the theatrical window. Before, films couldn\u2019t debut on home entertainment until 90 days after opening on the big screen. Now, that period has been shortened to as little as 17 days. Cinema operators would like\nto expand it again. Aron, whose chain was among the first to negotiate shorter windows, now wants to relitigate their length so that movies won\u2019t become available to rent or buy until at least 60 days after their theatrical release.\n\u201cThis is going to be front and center of all our conversations with studios,\u201d Aron says. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken our business five years to come back. Shorter windows are the reason. You have to conclude that all this experimentation has failed. Hollywood is leaving money on the table.\u201d\nPrivately, Hollywood executives are irritated that theater owners are harping on an issue they believe has been resolved. Still, they understand how necessary theaters are to their bottom line. Traditional studios spent much of the pandemic launching streaming services to elbow in on Netflix\u2019s business, believing that was the best way to remain relevant and monetize their content.\nHowever, these companies came to realize the films made exclusively for streaming failed to break into the zeitgeist like theatrical movies sometimes do. After all, there\u2019s no Netflix equivalent of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d So some studios are devoting more resources to making movies for cinemas or, in the\ncase of Disney, retrofitting something like \u201cMoana 2\u201d \u2014 which was originally setting sail on Disney+ \u2014 as a theatrical release.\nMichael O\u2019Leary, the head of Cinema United, the exhibition industry lobbying group, believes that studios\u2019 and theaters\u2019 interests are more aligned today than they were in 2020, when they first came to an uneasy truce on windowing.\n\u201cPeople have come to understand the importance of keeping movies in theaters longer,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you cut that period down and put things on demand, it creates customer confusion, it harms studios and it harms exhibition. You end up cannibalizing ticket sales.\u201d\nOne thing that both studios and theater owners are thrilled about is the surge in popularity of premium screens like Imax, Dolby and 4DX. (\u201cTwisters\u201d was a huge hit in the latter format, an exercise in sensory overload that adds moving seats, strobe lighting and rain machines to the cinematic experience.) These screenings sell out fast, with patrons sometimes crossing state lines to seek out the biggest and brightest presentations. That demand has been further fueled by Imax fanatics like Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve, who rhapsodize about the power of watching \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d in those auditoriums.\n\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing more studios advertising \u2018See it in Imax,\u2019\u201d notes the company\u2019s CEO, Richard Gelfond. Imax has spawned plenty of copycats, with Regal and Cinemark among those creating in-house knockoffs such as RPX and XD. Gelfond believes those offshoots are diluting the experience, since Imax takes painstaking steps to enhance a film\u2019s resolution rather than just blowing up the image. \u201cThe world does need more premium screens, but they need to be real premium, not just your normal screens with \u2018X\u2019 in their name,\u201d he says.\nTickets for Imax and other premium formats are more expensive than those for standard screens, which has increased revenues, offsetting the downward trend in attendance. \u201cPremium formats have become more important since COVID. Their share of the box office has really increased,\u201d says Cin\u00e9polis CEO Alejandro Ram\u00edrez Maga\u00f1a.\nOf course, building more 4DX and Imax screens or improving outdated theaters takes money. Given that what\u2019s being written about cinemas these days focuses on the box office downturn or the bankruptcies of major chains, lenders are skittish about providing financing for theaters looking to make improvements. At Cinema United, O\u2019Leary has spent a lot of time talking to Wall Street analysts and financial institutions, hoping to change the conversation.\n\u201cThe cost of running theaters keeps going up and the access to capital has become more difficult, so it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe commitment to keep building our theaters is definitely there on the ground, but we need to keep putting out a positive message. We\u2019re in a place where we are finally able to focus on the future. That means not just looking ahead two or three years, but really asking ourselves, \u2018What does going to a theater look like for the next 20 to 30?\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s been hard to have those kinds of far-reaching discussions, exhibitors say. The past few years have been spent hustling to stay alive. But for families like the Bagbys, who were born into the movie theater business, running a cinema feels almost like a genetic imperative.\nBoth father and son started working at B&B Theatres as teenagers, mopping floors and selling tickets, before rising through the ranks to run the company. Even with the grueling hours and the eternal struggle to fill seats, it\u2019s a job they love.\n\u201cWhat makes this different than owning a Target or hardware store is that every week the movies change and we\u2019re selling something new,\u201d says Bob Bagby. \u201cThe merchandise is always different, and that makes this a magical place to work.\u201d"

      "text": "A new generation of film lovers is helping to drive an increase in cinema attendance across the UK. As the industry slowly recovers from the decline of audiences during the pandemic \u2013 there were 126.5m admissions in 2024 compared with 176.1m in 2019, the rise in younger people returning to cinema may be due to a newfound love for film developed during the lockdown years. Although figures are yet to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, admission rates are continuing to increase, and it is younger audiences in particular who are showing significant enthusiasm, with figures from the Cinema Advertising Association suggesting that under-35s make up 50% of cinemagoers across the board.\nThis is a proportion, which includes all cinemas including mainstream multiplexes, has held steady over the last few years but the effect appears particularly marked on the independent cinema circuit. Curzon, which operates 16 venues across the UK, reports there has been a clear shift over the past six years in young people overtaking older audiences. In 2019, the biggest age demographic of Curzon attendees was 65+, followed by 55-64. In 2025, however, the dominant age group is 25-34 \u2013 rising from 16% in 2019 to 31% in 2025 \u2013 followed by 18-25 (growing from 17% to 24% over the same period).\nThe same goes for Bristol independent venue the Watershed, where the percentage of tickets sold to under 25s went from 19% (at reopening after lockdown in 2021) to 27% in 2024. (For comparison, the share of tickets sold to over 60s also increased, but by only by a single percentage point.)\nSteph Read, programmer at Watershed, says: \u201cWe find young people are quite adventurous with their taste, especially when it comes to older films and rereleases.\u201d This year, Chungking Express from 1994 and 2004\u2019s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did well with younger audiences. \u201cOver 50% of the audiences for both of those films were 24 and under,\u201d Read says.\nPaul Gallagher, programme manager at Glasgow Film Theatre, attributes this new generation of filmgoers to \u201ca growing appetite for cinema in general\u201d that took off during lockdown. \u201cStreaming became such a lifeline for lots of people, and there was definitely a younger audience who discovered the depth of the history of cinema at that moment.\u201d\n\u201cGradually, in the years since then, this younger audience is now starting to join the dots and see that there are cinemas around that play stuff from the history of cinema. It\u2019s not just new films, but that whole rich history of cinema.\u201d\nSocial media has clearly played its part. Gallagher says that screenings of films such as 1995 French social message thriller La Haine, as well as the works of directors such as C\u00e9line Sciamma and Wong Kar-Wai, have garnered much interest for their visual style and Instagram-friendly aesthetic. \u201cWe showed a couple of screenings of La Haine, and it was hugely popular, it sold out both of our biggest screens, which have just under 400 seats, and there was a visibly younger audiences.\u201d\nFilm-dedicated apps such as Letterboxd have opened up access to a rich history of cinema, once the preserve of older film buffs, to a younger generation. \u201cWe\u2019re Letterboxd fiends. That\u2019s the first thing I do after a movie, I go to Letterboxd,\u201d says Isiah Robinson, 22.\nMicha, 20, prefers to watch reruns of older films. \u201cI don\u2019t really go to the cinema to watch blockbusters, I want to watch films that already interest me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe independent cinemas are usually cheaper anyways.\u201d\nThe cost of going to the cinema is another thing that young people factor in when deciding whether to see a film on the big screen. \u201cWe\u2019re balancing the cost of living as well, so it\u2019s a bit of a luxury,\u201d says Isaiah Robinson, 22.\nAccording to the UK Cinema Association, the average price of a cinema ticket in the UK is \u00a37.73, only a slight increase on 2018, when the average price was \u00a37.22. Adjusted for inflation, the price is actually cheaper today than it was seven years ago.\nAdele Agwu-kalu, 20, isn\u2019t dissuaded by the cost as she says it is similar to what she would spend going out for a drink. \u201cA ticket is basically the same price as a drink,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the price is not really a factor.\u201d\nFor other younger people, the cost is worth it as the big screen provides a \u201cno-distractions zone\u201d, as opposed to the experience watching a film at home. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to switch off,\u201d says Sophia Crothall, 23. \u201cI don\u2019t touch my phone the whole time I\u2019m in the cinema. At home I\u2019m probably scrolling.\u201d\nGreg Walker, cinema manager and programmer at Manchester\u2019s Cultplex suggests that \u201ccinema etiquette\u201d is one of the reasons that smaller venues in particular benefiting from the rise in younger people going to see films. \u201cMore often than not, independent cinema audiences are the ones who are more respectful. They\u2019re not on the phones constantly, they\u2019re not talking.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of young people get pigeonholed into being those kind of people at cinemas, but I think a lot of them are actually the ones who want to go and watch the film. It\u2019s not just a social area.\u201d\nHowever, Ben Luxford, director of UK audiences at the British Film Institute, says that this new wave of film fanaticism is \u201cstill quite a small pocket of people ultimately\u201d.\n\u201cIt might be fuelling a change in the audience at places like the BFI Southbank or in cinemas in university towns across the country, but it\u2019s not happening everywhere,\u201d he says.\nCinemas are also benefiting from the rising popularity of music films by big-name artists whose fanbase is typically younger.\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which was released in 2023, has become the highest-grossing concert film of all time.\n\u201cTaylor Swift was a gamechanger,\u201d says Eduardo Leal, group director of screen content at Vue. \u201cThe Eras Tour completely reset the ceiling for what a music film can do theatrically. Since then, we\u2019ve had a bunch of successful K-pop titles such as J-Hope: In the Box and Seventeen: Power of Love.\u201d\n\u201cSocial media has played a really big role in driving younger audiences to the cinema,\u201d says Susie Bould, director of marketing at Curzon. \u201cFilms just spark and go viral. Saltburn, a few years ago, had a huge social virality, which gave it a life that it might not otherwise have had. I think people want to be part of the conversation.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The pandemic severely impacted movie theaters, leading to permanent closures of many independent cinemas. However, attendance is gradually recovering, particularly among younger audiences who have developed a renewed interest in cinema during lockdowns, often driven by access to classic films online and social media influences. In the UK, under-35s now make up a significant portion of cinema-goers, with independent theaters seeing notable increases in ticket sales as young people seek out unique film experiences. Despite ongoing challenges, the industry is hopeful for continued recovery as new films and formats attract audiences.",
