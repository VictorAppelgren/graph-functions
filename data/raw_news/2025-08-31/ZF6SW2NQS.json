  "description": "Even Jonathan Nolan can't believe the lengths the creative team at Universal Studios Hollywood has gone to for the 'Fallout' attraction at Halloween Horror Nights 2025.",
  "content": "Following the success of The Last of Us in 2023, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood is bringing the legendary gaming IP-turned-hit Amazon series Fallout to life. The result of this real-world reimagining is so impressive that it has even surpassed the expectations of the team behind the Amazon series.\n\n\"The costumes alone on this experience are crazy,\" enthuses John Murdy, HHN's Creative Director and Executive Producer at Universal Studios Hollywood. \"I was walking Fallout's executive producer, Jonathan Nolan, the production designer, and a bunch of other people from the production through this house last week, and the art director goes, 'Oh, you have one of our suits?' and I was like, 'No, we don't. This is one of our suits.' He couldn't tell the difference, and Jonathan was digging it.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Vaulters suits, they're so complicated that again we actually reached out to the production and we were like, 'Can we borrow one?' They were in production on season two while we were designing this, so we hooked up with their costume designer, and they gave us one of the suits so we could really study it and figure out all the different materials that go into making it.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a massive compliment for Murdy and his team at the Hollywood theme park. However, they didn't stop there.\n\n\"There's also the Pip-Boy gadget that they wear on their wrist,\" he continues. \"We reached out to Amazon, and they made an amazing consumer product that is a one-for-one replica of what is on the show, so we were like, 'We need a lot of those.' If they're sold out, it's probably our fault, as we bought a large quantity of them. They made it like an alarm clock on a base, so we took them, disassembled them, and remodeled them so they were wearable. It was amazing. All our performers will be wearing them. It's about all the details that go into creating this particular world.\"\n\nHere\u2019s What You Need To Know About \u2018Fallout\u2019 At Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nFallout, located on the Upper Lot in the space previously occupied by A Quiet Place, is set in 2277 and takes place two hundred years after a nuclear war destroyed civilization. All that is left is \"a highly violent hellscape\" known as The Wasteland, inhabited by mutated creatures, and the underground, where people live in luxury fallout shelters or Vaults. \n\n\n\n The seasonal attraction, also featuring at Universal Studios Orlando, places fans in iconic scenes and face-to-face with their favorite Fallout characters on a journey that begins beneath the surface in Vault 33. Among the familiar faces fans will encounter are the heroine, Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus, as well as a gaggle of mutating and robotic foes.\n\n\"When we first started talking about working on Fallout, we watched the entire series, and what hit me initially was that this universe is enormous,\" Murdy laughs. \"It goes everywhere, and there are three different story lines you're following, so what we ultimately landed on for our approach is that we're following in Lucy's footsteps, so we're going to begin in the wedding just like the series began. That's the point where the raiders break in and start killing everybody, and then we're going to follow Lucy's journey as she leaves the vault and goes into the wasteland.\"\n\n\"We also wanted to see one of the big creatures that has been affected by the radiation exposure, and the Super Duper Mart sequence. To me, that\u2019s a haunted house finale right there with all the feral ghouls running around.\"\n\nTransport From Universal Studios Hollywood To The Vaults Of \u2018Fallout\u2019\n\nRight out of the gate, Murdy and his team faced a considerable challenge replicating the look of the Vaults, the first area guests experience when entering the house.\n\n\n\n \"Everything is custom, right down to each little bolt,\" he laments. \"We enter Vault 33, where Lucy will have just gotten married. There will already be dead bodies of some of the Vaulters scattered around, including their poor wedding officiant, who got impaled on the wall. Still, guests are going to be put right in the middle of Lucy and Monty, her arranged marriage husband, who is trying to kill her.\"\n\n\"Lucy's in her wedding dress, she's already been stabbed and is bleeding, and she's got a broken shard of glass that she has used to carve up Monty's face. The sirens will be going off, something has gone horribly wrong in here, and then we keep going and run into another raider.\"\n\nBecause of the amount of detail in almost everything, the Fallout set decorating pushed the creative team to their limits.\n\n\"Even with the vault doors, I can't even remember how many layers of what we would call CNC, which stands for Computer Numerical Control, cutting this out layer by layer. That's not one piece, so it's all sandwiched together from individual layers. It's a huge scenic piece unto itself,\" Murdy explains as we walk through. \"Another one of the raiders has a Vaulter, and we watch as he slashes his throat, showering you with blood, and then we keep going through a curtain of hanging bodies, skeletal figures, and you're having to push your way through them.\"\n\nIt Took Four Months To Construct The \u2018Fallout\u2019 House At Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nWork started on the Fallout build right after Fan Fest Nights concluded in the spring, giving Murdy and his team just four months to complete construction. Days ahead of the event, the final technical touches are being installed, while set dressings are being completed. Among the spaces that are a flurry of activity is the Wasteland scene, another close collaboration with the producers of the Prime Video show.\n\n\n\n \"There's a massive cyclorama going all the way around the room, and then we have big foreground set pieces, with the bodies that were obliterated during the nuclear blast,\" he explains. \u201cThere will be actual sand on the ground and up against the edges of everything, so then when you step out, it should feel like Lucy did when she walked into the wasteland. Ahead of you is a ruined shack from which you hear the sound of somebody turning into a feral ghoul. In the other window, there are radroaches. We got the 3D model for the shack from the production. We asked for a lot of the assets because some of these things are so complicated, we really needed that to reproduce them as accurately as possible, and that was the only way to be sure.\u201d\n\nWhile Fallout at Halloween Horror Nights is based on the first season of the wildly popular TV show, unlike The Last of Us, which was based on the video game, Murdy and his crew made sure to explore and draw inspiration from the entire franchise.\n\n\"I wrote this house in December 2024, so I was researching the series, and even though we're doing the show, I feel beholden to the video game franchise, and Fallout goes way back,\" he recalls. \"I wanted to try to understand it from the gamer perspective, as well as just the people who watch the Amazon series. It's a rich world and everything means something.\"\n\nWhile the Fallout houses in Hollywood and Orlando are broadly similar, the most significant difference comes in the next area of the seasonal attraction. Subtle localized changes are something both Murdy and his Orlando counterpart, Michael Aiello, have leaned into in recent years.\n\n\"The next stop we're going to make on this journey is to the Ghoul's graveyard. This is where we differ between Orlando and Hollywood,\" he confirms. \"We have certain things in common, like the vaults, but here we wanted to introduce you to where the Ghoul made his entrance in the series. We're doing this scene while Orlando is doing different scenes, such as the Philly sequence that we're not doing.\"\n\n\"Mike and I were on stage at Midsummer Scream. I asked the audience how many people attend both parks for Halloween Horror Nights, and it was shocking how many do. That shows how Halloween Horror Nights has evolved. It's become a horror tourism phenomenon, where people take their vacation they've been saving up and spend it during the Halloween season. They'll travel around the country, and sometimes to other countries, to see all of the content they can.\"\n\nHe continues, \"They're just different, and audiences are different. Orlando is very much a theme park town. I lived there for two and a half years when I was with Creative, and I grew up in LA, so I know both very well.\"\n\nFrom there, the Fallout house hits several fan favourite beats from the show, including a cave featuring Maximus in his fully armored T-60 suit, Titus, and a jaw-dropping encounter with a bear.\n\n\n\n \"The T-60 itself is about seven feet tall, and the bear is huge,\" Murdy exclaims. \"It's weird showing it to somebody, submitting it to the show's producers, or whatever, and saying, 'Here are pictures.' I always make somebody stand next to it because you have to understand how big this is. It's just massive.\"\n\nEventually, Lucy and her fellow traveler guests arrive at the iconic Super Duper Mart for the terrifying grand finale involving Snip Snip and other nefarious characters.\n\n\"Fans love Snip Snip,\" Murdy enthuses. \"He's the incredibly polite English robot that Lucy encounters when she goes into the Super Duper Mart. When she reaches this stage, she walks in, and a large robot emerges, saying, 'Oh, let me help you.' She's like, 'Oh my God. He's so nice,' and then he casually goes, '... and then we're going to harvest your organs,' and obviously she freaks out.\"\n\n\"Inside the building, there is a big rear projection where you see Snip Snip putting Lucy on an operating table, and one of his hands turns into a blade, and he's about to cut her open. She's struggling with him, zaps him with defibrillator paddles, and he shorts out. She then comes out of a door, paddles in hand, but stops. Then we get into the feral ghouls. Martha, who is becoming a ghoul but is trying to hold on to her humanity, is a distraction, and as soon as you turn the corner, four ghouls come out and attack you. This is the finale sequence, but it's not the end of the scares.\"\n\nWhile many will come to be frightened by their favorite franchises, just as crucial to Murdy is the attention to detail. It\u2019s always been important, but in recent years, Halloween Horror Nights have become even more keen on incorporating elements like screen-matching carpets and enveloping environmental details to further immerse guests in the worlds they love.\n\n\"We\u2019re getting more and more into that as we go along,\" the Universal Studios Hollywood creative concludes. \"In the Fallout house, we have a real drop ceiling in the Super Duper Mart to replicate the look and feel of the show. It\u2019s about trying to immerse our fans in the world of their favorite property as deeply as possible. At the end of the day, no matter how good what we create in any given year is, we then have to top it. We always have that mentality where as soon as the event is over, it's done, it's gone for us, because we're already into the next one, and then you're thinking, 'Well, what can we do now to top that?' and we love that.\"",

      "text": "Even the most skeptical among us will find it hard not to be impressed with the immersive experience served at the first-ever Fan Fest Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood. Headlined by a trifecta of huge IPs, including Star Trek and Dungeons and Dragons, the jewel in the crown when it comes to execution is Back to the Future, reimagined and brought to life in a whole new way as Destination Hill Valley. However, like Marty McFly\u2019s mission in the movie, things could have turned out very differently.\n\"The script was rejected over 40 times,\" recalls Back to the Future co-writer and producer Bob Gale on the Fan Fest Nights red carpet. \"We didn\u2019t know it was going to be a hit, and if we hadn't recast Eric Stoltz and put Michael J. Fox as the lead in the movie, it might not have been. The difference between success and failure is right on the edge of a razor blade.\"\nBack to the Future was released 40 years ago this summer and went on to gross $388.8 million against a $19 million budget and was the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. It\u2019s being released in movie theaters later this year. In the meantime, Destination Hill Valley at Fan Fest Nights invites guests to time travel back to 1955 to experience a celebratory recreation of Courthouse Square in the space where it was first created: the backlot at Universal Studios Hollywood. Among the elements are a complete recreation of the Enchantment Under the Sea prom and an environmental recreation of the classic film's epic finale involving the DeLorean getting Marty home.\n\"We had no idea what Back to the Future was going to become because, at the time, people didn't want to make that movie,\" Gale continues. \"It's a time travel movie, and they were saying that time travel movies don't make any money. That was a true statement in the early 1980s. Bob Zemeckis has said many times that if we had known it was going to be so successful and that there'd be two sequels, we would have never put Jennifer in the car at the end of the first film because when we sat down to do part two, we said, 'Oh, what are we going to do about Jennifer?'\"\n\u2018Back To The Future\u2019 And \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Find New Frontiers\nThe 1985 sci-fi classic continues to evolve and wow fans, and Back to the Future: Destination Hill Valley is no exception. The original film became a pop culture phenomenon and spawned a multimedia franchise, including theme park rides, an animated television series, and an award-winning stage musical that premiered in 2020.\n\"Back to the Future, the first movie, is the gold standard, but the musical exceeded all of our expectations,\" Gale enthuses. \"We just opened it in Tokyo, and I was over there to see it in Japanese. It has a Japanese cast, and the audience goes crazy. It doesn't get much better than that.\"\nStar Trek: Red Alert, another huge draw for those who want to experience their fandom in a way similar to how horror fans do with Universal Studios' annual Halloween Horror Nights, takes guests into the heart of the franchise where guests embark on an out-of-this-world adventure aboard the legendary starship U.S.S. Enterprise-D as a mysterious entity wreaks havoc through the ship's systems. Fan Fest Nights runs select nights through Sunday, May 18, 2025.\nThe Fan Fest Nights red carpet brought out a galaxy of stars from the beloved Star Trek franchise, including Star Trek: The Next Generation\u2019s Wil Wheaton and LeVar Burton, who also starred in Star Trek: Picard, his daughter Mica and their Picard co-star Michelle Hurd, Deep Space Nine's Nana Visitor and Star Trek: Lower Decks voice actors Tawny Newsome, Eugene Cordero and Jerry O'Connell.\n\"A lot of people are not prepared,\" Wheaton explains as we discuss the importance of Star Trek to fans and the responsibility that comes with being part of that world. \"They just don't know what to expect. I was fortunate when I was a kid because George Takei prepared me. He told me this means so much more than just TV if you want it to be, and he inspired me to be one of the people who wants to protect Star Trek and nurture it, care for it, and carry the torch of what Star Trek is really about.\"\n\"The folks that are on Star Trek shows now, I've been watching them like, I'm like, 'Who am I going to be able to hand the torch to? Who's going to get it? I have a person in mind. I don't know if they want it, but I won't tell you who it is.\"\nWheaton, also known for Stand by Me, The Big Bang Theory, and Toy Soldiers, continued, \"I had a great conversation with Jack Quaid, and I said, 'There is a day in your future. It hasn't happened. There's a day in your future where suddenly, you realize how big it is, and you realize what it means and what it means to people, and how valuable that is.' About a year later, I saw him at an unrelated thing, and he came out and grabbed me. He was like, 'What you told me would happen has happened. I was at a Star Trek convention, and they came up and were so excited, and I was ready for it because you had prepared me.' People care about it the way they do because Star Trek has been relentlessly optimistic through some of the absolute worst times in world history.\"\nLeVar Burton, who reprised his Star Trek: The Next Generation role as Geordi La Forge in Picard, adds, \"Becoming part of this universe was a big deal to me because I was a huge Star Trek fan. We watched the original series in my house when I was a kid in the 60s and early 70s. For me and our cast, it was great to give that speech to every succeeding cast. When Deep Space Nine came on the air, we had that conversation with Nana and that group, then with the Voyager cast, Enterprise, and so on. It\u2019s a tradition.\"\nFan Fest Nights And \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Work To Create Better Experiences\nBurton\u2019s daughter Mica, who also stars in Star Trek: Picard, interjects, \"Michelle Hurd gave us the speech on Picard. I listened to things my Dad said, but it was a big deal coming from Michelle, and it was on the day a lot of us wrapped filming. I\u2019m so glad that somebody got it on video somewhere because I was a mess. I was crying. Michelle was crying. It's a beautiful moment. I wasn't expecting it. I didn't know this was a tradition, but I will remember it for the rest of my life.\" The father and daughter, who have a close relationship, would drive to the Star Trek: Picard set together every day and watch each other work.\nThe power of Star Trek is echoed by Hurd, also known for another huge IP, Law and Order.\n\"Sci-fi has a fantastic way to write really strong, interesting characters for women and for women of color,\" she says. \"There\u2019s something about that that I never realized before. I love Law and Order, the stories ripped from the headlines, and telling those stories. I'm a native New Yorker, so it really speaks to me. Those things are important because they also spotlight those issues that are happening. Still, sci-fi and Star Trek explicitly enable women to have a strong voice, a presence, and a purpose, and we move the stories forward, not just set dressing. Law and Order tackles important stories and topics; I didn't realize that under the awning of sci-fi, we get to tell those same stories, but people don't realize that we're talking about immigration, racism, and all the other isms. That's powerful and necessary.\"\nLeVar Burton is particularly grateful that Star Trek: Red Alert features a screen-used version of the bridge of the Enterprise-D seen on Picard.\n\"I'm excited to see it,\" he confirms. \"We felt very much at home on that bridge when we were on it. It's a very emotional moment in the series, in season three, when it is revealed. For fans of The Next Generation, that ship is home.\"\nWith Star Trek, Back to the Future, Dungeons and Dragons, One Piece, and Jujutsu Kaisen all represented in the inaugural Fan Fest Nights, is there another classic IP any of the VIP guests would like to see represented at future events? Star Trek: Lower Decks\u2019 Jerry O'Connell doesn't hesitate.\n\"Sliders,\" the Scream 2, Kangaroo Jack, and Stand by Me actor says, \u201cMy wife, Rebecca Romijn, is also in Starfleet, goes to conventions semi-often, and I go with her. I have a little valise and collect the money and stuff, but many people bring stuff for me to sign from Sliders. It\u2019s a science fiction show I did in the 1990s. I don\u2019t talk about it because I mentioned it to my agent about six years ago and said, 'Hey, I was in a show called Sliders,\u2019 and my agent went, 'Dude, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019 and I was embarrassed. Everyone brings these things for me to sign, and I\u2019m just the money guy at a convention for my wife, but they always bring Sliders stuff. I can tell you here at Fan Fest Nights that I'm actively trying to reboot Sliders. It hasn't happened yet. No one has returned my call, but outgoing calls are happening.\""

      "text": "When the creative team behind Halloween Horror Nights set out to bring the 2023 movie Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s to life at Universal Studios, they didn't hold back.\n\"Fans have been asking for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s for a long time,\" reveals John Murdy, HHN\u2019s Creative Director and Executive Producer at Universal Studios Hollywood. \"It started way before the film came out. They\u2019ve been hitting us up about it on social media for years.\" Now, months before the sequel lands in theaters, it's happening with groundbreaking eight-foot-tall animatronics taking center stage.\nHoused in the Lower Lot soundstage that has previously been home to houses inspired by Stranger Things and The Weeknd, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s will allow fans to follow in the footsteps of Mike, played by Josh Hutcherson in the movie, after he takes a job as the night security guard in the rundown themed entertainment center, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. It was abandoned after several children disappeared there. The haunted venue has been recreated to resemble the iconic fa\u00e7ade through which guests enter.\n\"The first time I walked in here and saw that, I was like, 'It's the movie.' It really is,\" Murdy, now approaching his 20th year of overseeing the event, enthuses. \"I have a lot of behind the scenes images from the movie that we studied in depth in terms of how we were doing the scenic elements and that is spot on.\"\n\"The film is visually very dark, but they did really well with scouring behind-the-scenes content where a bunch of influencers went on set when they were making the movie. In all of those YouTube videos, you could see it with all the lights on. We used a lot of that, along with all the assets we get from Blumhouse, to piece it all together.\"\nBlumhouse\u2019s Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie, based on another widely popular videogame IP that inspired a hit movie, grossed $291.49 million at the worldwide box office in 2023. The sequel will land in theaters on Friday, December 5, 2025.\nInside \u2018Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s\u2019 At Halloween Horror Nights\nAs soon as ticketholders step inside, the attention to detail blows you away, right down to the gumball machines and the carpet.\n\"It\u2019s different from a lot of our houses because there are a lot of bright colors but that is the world of Freddy Fazbear. As you enter the house, there is a training video giving you the little back story about the venue and then we go into the showroom pf the restaurant and there is a giant Freddy,\" the creative teases.\nStanding on a podium, the titular towering animatronic springs into action, and it\u2019s showtime. The creation is a joint project between the team at Universal, who created the mechanics, and Jim Henson's Creature Shop, who recreated the outer bodies to almost screen-match what they made for the movie.\n\"You walk in and you hear Talking in Your Sleep by The Romantics,\" Murdy explains, referencing the 80s tune synonymous with the Five Nights at Freddy's, or FNAF for short, franchise. \"Freddy is the most sophisticated animatronic that we've ever built for Halloween Horror Nights. It features a multitude of functions, including moving eyebrows, ears, a mouth for lip-syncing, a head, arms, and a torso that twists and bends. The power cuts out, and he slumps forward. Freddy cocks his head, and then his eyes start glowing; he's looking at you. We got another curtain where we see the silhouette of Foxy and his glowing eye, and you hear his trademark song that he hums. That's when you get scared by the first of a series of ghost kids in this attraction.\"\nMoving through to the kitchen area of the complex, fans will be greeted by Chica and find themselves in the middle of \"terrifying chaos\" as their ghost kid rushes through the space, clattering pots and pans, directing everyone past the fridge where it sounds like someone, or something, might be trapped. From there, it\u2019s on to the classic security station.\n\"There are actually no performers in here. It's all a visual nod to the classic security room scene from both the film and the original games. On the monitors, you're seeing different shots of the facility, except there's nobody there,\" Murdy reveals. \"It's all empty, and the cameras are cycling through that, then the room changes. A power light turns red, someone throws the switch, and all of a sudden, you see all of the characters looking at you on the security monitors.\"\nIt\u2019s another example of where hardcore FNAF content creators helped drive the creative teams at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando Resort.\n\"I watched a lot of fan videos and noticed things like the tin foil ball and the red and white striped cup,\" he continues, \"When they were walking onto the set for the movie, they were like, 'Oh my God, they\u2019ve got the tin foil ball,' and it's a reference to the games. I was like, 'Okay, we've got to have the tin foil ball and the red and white striped cup.' We got a note from FNAF creator Scott Cawthon's people, and they were like, 'Can we have all the clocks be it ten minutes to six?' It's because in the world of Five Nights at Freddy's, what starts at night ends at six o'clock.' So, you'll notice, all the clocks in the attraction are set to that time.\"\n\"In the next space, there's an Employee of the Month board. All the employees, I've been told, are Five Nights at Freddy's influencers. They did a thing where they put them in the movie. We were originally going to include our crew's images, but then they said, 'No, we really want to use the thing from the movie,' so he obtained permission to use that. It's a tiny detail, but it's cool.\"\nThe Level Of Detail In \u2018Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s\u2019 Is Wild\nThat space is also where fans get to come face-to-face with Foxy, a corridor encounter that is almost certain to frighten many people.\n\"We were doing the Ecto-1 for Ghostbusters and making it move on a track system, we decided to apply that to Foxy in the scene,\" Murdy says. \"When you come in, he's all the way tracked back, it's dark, and you can't really see what's going on, and he comes to life and starts tracking towards us. It's lit with really quick, precise strobe flashes to try to get that moment in the movie where you see him moving closer each time.\"\nFrom there, it\u2019s through to what the creative team calls the Tech Room, a place where things get gory, and anyone who has made it this far comes face to face with Freddy Fazbear, animated in a way that makes every interaction unique.\n\"A few years ago, we did a Chucky house and had this crazy idea about a mega Chucky figure. He was this giant Chucky that took a couple of steps towards you. We applied the same idea, took that further, and then took that to the team at Jim Henson's Creature Shop,\" the producer confirms. \"There's actually a performer in this, and it's on an overhead track, so they can take some steps and look like Freddie is walking towards you.\"\nFrom there, it\u2019s into the final space in the house where, no spoilers, all bets are off, and Chica, Foxy, Mr. Cupcake, and more go full throttle. Over a year in the making, Five Nights at Freddy's is the biggest attraction at Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood, and Murdy is satisfied they have delivered a blockbuster experience that will blow fans away.\n\"Since we\u2019re smack dab in the middle of Hollywood, we have the benefit of all of the resources of being at a movie studio,\" he concludes. \"The folks who physically constructed this set are the same people who build sets for movies and television shows. Even the people that do the design drawings, we use individuals that are film and television people.\"\n\"We can utilize all that great talent here in Los Angeles to bring our sets to life in movie quality. Five Nights at Freddy's is a great example of that.\"\nThis year\u2019s Halloween Horror Nights line-up also includes Terrifier, Poltergeist, Fallout, Jason Universe, and WWE Presents: The Horrors of the Wyatt Sicks, as well as a bunch of original houses and the return of Terror Tram and The Purge live action show. Halloween Horror Nights kicks off at Universal Studios Hollywood on Thursday, September 4, 2025. Tickets are now on sale."

      "text": "\"If you're going to do Terrifier, you've got to really do Terrifier,\" exclaims John Murdy, Creative Director and Executive Producer of Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood. \"We approached it with that mindset, because that's what the fans of this franchise love.\"\nThe all-new haunted house, versions of which appear at the seasonal event in both the Los Angeles theme park and Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, is inspired by the Terrifier film franchise. The face of the already iconic series is the enigmatic Art the Clown, a demonic serial killer who butchers the inhabitants of the fictitious Miles County, New York.\nCould it be the most intense attraction Murdy and his compatriots, including Michael Aiello, Senior Director, Entertainment and Creative Development at Halloween Horror Nights in Orlando, have created in the event\u2019s decades-long history?\n\"I think ultimately our fans decide that,\" he muses. \"What was interesting when we announced the house, a lot of fans were like, 'You're not doing the hacksaw kill, are you?' They thought like we would soft pedal it, but we're really not, so I think that will surprise the fans.\"\nThe Terrifier house is groundbreaking in multiple ways. Writer-director Damien Leone, the brainchild of the franchise, told me, \"Mike and John completely embraced what Terrifier is. They came to us and said, 'You guys are known for gore. We want to make this the bloodiest house in the history of Halloween Horror Nights. We want to have the most bodies that have ever been involved in any of these houses.' They were speaking my language, so it was a no-brainer.\"\n\u2018Terrifier\u2019 Icon Will Be On The Loose At Universal Studios\nFor the first time, the creatives are adding an extra dimension to the terror and taking Terrifier\u2019s Art the Clown beyond the walls of the experience and into the real world of the theme park.\n\"It's kind of like a Where's Waldo? Thing,\" Murdy explains. \"Art is going to be outside of the house and in the park. You might be in a store, and he'll show up next to you. You might be enjoying a bite to eat, look up, and he's sitting across from you, staring at you. We've intentionally created these disruptions to put our guests off guard. You don't know where Art is going to show up.\"\n\"I called our Vice President in charge of retail, and I went, 'Hey, I know we never let characters go in stores because it's the one safe spot when you're at the park. I want to break that rule, and I need your help.' She was cool and down with it. It's all a wild experiment, and we don't really know what's going to happen.\"\nAiello continues, \"Art encounters will pop up in various places, all across the studios. We're not publicizing it. We're not giving out times or anything. Art is all about engaging in everyday spaces, so that's what we're doing with him. We want him to make people uncomfortable. If they're sitting down to eat somewhere or shopping in a store.\"\n\u2018Terrifier\u2019 Water Effect Will Be \u2018Like A Car Wash\u2019\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for Halloween Horror Nights guests to get a 4D-type experience in mazes with a splash of \"blood\" here or a heat effect there, but Terrifier takes that up multiple notches.\nTowards the end of the walkthrough, ticket holders at both the Hollywood and Orlando parks potentially could get drenched.\n\"In Hollywood, people will go through a tree hedge maze, and above you, we're making it rain blood,\" Murdy reveals. \"There is a whole array of water nozzles backlit red, and then there's special flooring to drain all the water and pump it out. We're really messing with our fans with this notion, and it's driving them crazy right now. They keep asking us, 'How wet am I going to get?' Mike and I won't tell them. We're leaving it to their imagination.\"\nAiello adds, \"Our water moment in Orlando is a decision point for the guests, because we\u2019re using more water than we've ever done in a haunted house before. We're doing rain curtains; there's a drip line, but it's at 100 percent. We're usually at 20 percent. The floor is actually a graded floor that allows the water to pass through it, because it's a steady stream, and can be filtered out. That's our blood bath. It's like a car wash.\"\n\"You can opt to do the dry path, and we created that because of the amount of water that we're using. We wanted to ensure guests had the choice, but Art's is on a secondary level before you make that call at the decision point. There's a waterfall of blood in front of him, and he's conducting his symphony of blood as we're making that choice.\"\n\u2018Terrifier\u2019 Achieves Something The Movies Couldn\u2019t\nBoth Terrifier houses start with guests entering the experience through a Fun House fa\u00e7ade.\n\"Our entrance in Hollywood is pretty much Terrifier 2,\" Murdy says. \"Some of the things we do when we work with IP filmmakers is to ask for the assets they used. We asked for graphics for the Fun House, and they were like, 'It was a miniature. It was like Stonehenge in Spinal Tap.' So our artists recreated all the graphics, which means this is the first time this has ever been life-size.\"\n\"We have our queue line in front of the house, we designed this so there is a huge light box with the Terrifier logo and we'll be playing the Terrifier theme song and then somebody changes the channel, and you hear little snippets of the Clown Cafe theme before it lands on a news report and you're hearing a reporter explaining that tragedy struck in Miles County and a tall, thin man in a black and white clown costume carrying a black plastic bag was seen walking away. As the news reporter is saying that, someone matching that description appears in the doorway where the devil is, he opens it, and he comes out, does a very choreographed series of bits, then he disappears.\"\nAiello adds, \"In Orlando, we wanted to sell the fact that this entire house and experience is a world that Art the Clown has created, so instead of the very Jack the Clown looking character in the Hollywood mural, we had Art paint his own image in that spot where that other clown is featured. Hollywood uses the fa\u00e7ade as an entrance for the character, whereas we have a media moment where you see shadow play of Vicky and Little Pale Girl and move parallel into the house.\"\n\u2018Terrifier\u2019 Aims To Gross Out From The Get-Go\nIn both locations, the nightmares begin once guests step into the Fun House. In Hollywood, walls covered by newspaper clippings and photos with glowing eyes lead attendees to their first encounter with Art the Clown.\n\"He\u2019s behind a theatrical scrim, and we're doing an effect that we actually brought over from Orlando, which is called a drop window. It will look like a wall, and while you're distracted, a whole section slams to the ground, making a hell of a noise, and there's a surprise behind it. You're driven through a curtain and then you're hit by a Giant Art that will come screaming out at you,\" Murdy reveals.\nAiello interjects, \"We're immediately in the Fun House in Orlando, and we have an animatronic, but it's one of his victims. It's a body that's been put on a spring and bobs back and forth, and Art has painted his own face onto the corpse. You round a corner, and the first appearance of Art himself is actually through a split body that is on hinged doors. Art literally opens it up, splitting the body in half and barrelling through it at the guest.\"\nThe first official space in both haunted houses is called Silly Saws and is inspired by the hacksaw kill in the original Terrifier film.\n\"We wanted to reference all the iconic kills in the series, but since we're setting everything in the fun house, that meant that in some cases, we needed to bring in kills that didn't happen in the Fun House and find a reason for why it would happen here,\" Murdy clarifies. \"In the first movie, Tara is in a warehouse, but we brought her in here to this crazy scene. Saw blades are coming through all the walls. Art the Clown is the performer in this space, and when he activates his trigger, he starts up the saw blade and pushes a body through. When it splays open, guests get showered with blood. It's the first time in the house that you're going to get hit with blood, but it will not be the only one.\"\nThe version in Orlando takes it even further.\n\"We've got a corridor and above the guests, on motors, are hacksaws moving back and forth, slicing bodies that are upside down attached to the wall,\" Aiello confirms. \"As the guests are going through the corridor, they're getting sprayed the entire way through. So it was an exercise, this being an example of the kill, but how do we expand it and make it feel like the guest is surrounded in it?\"\nNext up is a scene that Murdy calls Barrels of Fun.\n\"For each film, we tried to pick the most iconic kill. In Terrifier 2, Art kills Allie. In the movie, it\u2019s set in a bedroom. He hacks her to bits, leaves, and then comes back with a bottle of bleach and salt. It's one of the most extreme kills in the whole franchise. Mike and I, when we were talking and our team members, we were like, 'We want to physically affect the guests. We want them to feel like bleach is spraying all over them.' That's why we have this scene.\"\n\"The scent of bleach is being pumped in the air, we have Art the Clown with a Tommy gun, and he shoots holes in barrels, and it feels like you\u2019re blasted with what you think is bleach.\" The scene then continues with Art, salt in one hand and bleach in the other, rubbing them all over her wounds. Sienna Shaw, who is the final girl in the Terrifier franchise, comes busting through that curtain dressed in the warrior princess cosplay costume with the sword, and challenges Art.\"\nAgain, Orlando serves up a different experience.\n\"We are trying to up the water effects,\" Aiello confirms. \"The flooring in this scene for us is created so it can capture liquids, and we're giving our characters bleach jugs filled with water that they'll be pouring on the body and splashing the guests with.\"\nThe \u2018Terrifier\u2019 Bathroom Scene Will Push Some People To Their Limits\nMoving through gruesome scenes called Dolly Molly, featuring Art the Clown, the Little Pale Girl, and into the Clown Cafe, which is featured in the second Terrifier movie and is very similar in both the Hollywood and Orlando versions.\n\"You\u2019re in a carnival Fun House, so there would be a place to eat, so we decided that should be the Clown Cafe, where all the kids have been killed,\" Murdy says. \"We're pumping in a scent in this scene, but it's actually not an awful one. It's hot, buttered popcorn. We have a kid sitting and eating Art's cereal, and we got Damien to give us all the graphics for that. Also in this scene, there's a severed heart covered in maggots in a hatbox.\"\n\"Art gave it to Sienna in a dream sequence in the second movie, and we wanted to recreate that. With Halloween Horror Nights, we put our guests right in the middle of the action, so they're really close to everything and want to touch stuff. If they try to touch this, it's going to blast them with blood. We built the whole food truck and everything.\"\nThe next section is one that guests with more sensitive stomachs might hit a wall. After passing through curtains of dirty underwear, they enter an area called Naughty Potty.\n\"We have easter eggs to other kills in the franchise in the stalls of this restroom,\" Murdy confirms. \"From Terrifier, there\u2019s the guy in the pizza parlor whose head Art cuts off and turns it into a human jack o' lantern. There's the mashed potato kill from the second movie, and the construction worker that Art peels the skin off his face from Terrifier 3. Vicky, who was the final girl in the first movie, but has become Art's compatriot in the third movie, appears behind a mirror, and then she's able to open it up like a window and come after us.\"\n\"Art is writing his name in poop on the wall, and he's covered in it. As soon as you come in, he hits his lighting audio trigger, and he comes at you with his poopy hands. I haven't done a poop scene since 2006, and I swore I'd never do another one. We pump into the scent too, and I used to come home from Halloween Horror Nights and my wife would be like, 'Why do you smell like poop?' And I was like, 'Oh my God, it's my clothes.'\"\nThere is also a special surprise in the sink.\n\"This is a mysterious thing,\" Murdy laughs. \"Mike and I both screencap these films, taking hundreds of pictures when we're going through them, and this was in the sink. I didn't really know what the heck it was, because it's got teeth and it's got eyeballs, but we gave it to our props team and said, 'Make this.' According to Damian, it's the Poop Monster. That was all he said.\"\n\u2018Terrifier\u2019 Gets Creative With Original Scares Alongside Classic Kills\nAfter having a bite to eat and visiting the bathroom in Art\u2019s world, things switch up again with the Chamber of Horrors, which is not a scene from the movies but more of a play on the franchise and the event itself, playing with the concept of House Hosts who usher people through the attractions.\nIn Orlando, there is a Tunnel of Love, Terrifier-style.\n\"Basically, it\u2019s where Art has taken over, and we're taking through basically a sequence where he's displayed all of his victims, and the tunnel looks as if it's on fire. We're using fire projection on the tunnel and smoke effects,\" Aiello reveals.\nBefore the haunted house takes remaining guests to the final scene, which is set in Art\u2019s workshop, the penultimate scene is another fan favorite kill scene from Terrifier 3.\n\"In the movie, Art visits a mall, and there's a Santa photo opportunity. We've created that. All of the workers who are playing the elves have either been killed in horrible ways or beheaded, and their heads are used as tree toppers, and their intestines are strung on the Christmas trees. He has even killed the mall Santa,\" Murdy gushes. \"We are playing the Terrifier Christmas Carol, we're pumping in the smell of freshly baked gingerbread cookies, and then Art, dressed as Santa, comes busting through the curtain with a chainsaw.\"\nWith a killer line-up that also includes Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, Poltergeist, Fallout, Jason Universe, and WWE Presents: The Horrors of the Wyatt Sicks, 2025 is set to be a classic year for Halloween Horror Nights. However, Terrifier is something the creatives are particularly proud of.\n\"If you\u2019ve seen all three of those movies, you're still going to walk through and see some things you haven't seen before,\" Aiello muses.\nMurdy concludes, \"The very last thing we do in our process is blood. We have our own recipe for it, whether it\u2019s scenic blood or blood on performers. It makes a hell of a mess, so our crew comes through a couple of days before we open, and in this case, they\u2019re going to bring a lot of blood. Terrifier is absolutely soaked in it.\"\nHalloween Horror Nights kicks off at Universal Studios Hollywood on Thursday, September 4, 2025. Universal Orlando Resort gets the ball rolling a little earlier on Friday, August 29, 2025. Tickets are now on sale."
