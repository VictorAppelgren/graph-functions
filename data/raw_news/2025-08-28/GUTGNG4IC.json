  "description": "CNN\u2019s 5 Things AM brings you the news you need to know every morning.",
  "content": "There are only two northern white rhinos left on Earth. Due to the constant threat of poachers, they are protected 24/7 by armed guards. Now, a new documentary chronicles the fight to save these creatures from extinction.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.\n\nThe CDC has been left leaderless after Director Dr. Susan Monarez was ousted by the White House on Wednesday. Although she had only been working at the CDC since July 31, Monarez was \u201cnot aligned with the President\u2019s agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in a statement. According to people familiar with the situation, Monarez recently clashed with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his team over vaccine policies and personnel matters. Following her departure, three other high-level veteran agency officials resigned. \u201cWhen CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda,\u201d Monarez\u2019s attorneys said in a statement. Morale was already low at the agency due to mass layoffs in the spring and a deadly shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month.\n\nInvestigators are working to understand what may have motivated a shooter to open fire on the Annunciation Catholic Church and School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, killing two children. Three elderly parishioners and 14 other children were wounded in the attack. The shooter, who had no prior criminal history and died of a self-inflicted wound, posted a \u201cmanifesto\u201d online that authorities are reviewing. According to a CNN analysis, it was the 44th school shooting in the US this year. After visiting the scene, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a call to action. \u201cThis has happened in other countries and guess what, they do something about it. We gotta do something about it here,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. Frey\u2019s message was echoed by Annunciation principal Matthew DeBoer: \u201cWe as a community have a responsibility to make sure that no child, no parent, no teacher ever has to experience what we\u2019ve experienced today \u2014 ever again.\u201d Several Democratic leaders have also renewed calls to address gun violence.\n\nRussia\u2019s latest attack on Kyiv overnight killed at least 15 people, including four children, and wounded dozens of others. There may be additional victims trapped under the rubble; some 500 rescuers and 1,000 police officers have been tasked with searching multiple locations for survivors. The missile and drone strike is the latest in a series of assaults Russia has conducted on Ukraine and comes just over two weeks after President Donald Trump held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. That summit was followed by planning for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but that has not taken place, and diplomatic efforts to end the war seem to have stalled. \u201cThese Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,\u201d Zelensky said on X.\n\nThere appears to be a major disconnect happening in Israel between many of its citizens and the country\u2019s leadership. As hundreds of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets, demanding a ceasefire and the return of the hostages held by Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been speaking about \u201cthe unity of the people\u201d and proclaiming that Israel is on \u201cthe path to victory\u201d as it moves to escalate the 22-month war in Gaza. In response to the rallies, Netanyahu and his allies have denounced the protesters \u2014 including the families of the hostages \u2014 and accused them of aiding Hamas. Israel is facing international condemnation as well for its assault on the biggest hospital in southern Gaza, a back-to-back attack that killed at least 22 people. New video obtained by CNN provided more details about the bombing, including the fact that there was a third strike.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to pull millions in federal funding from sex education programs for merely mentioning gender identity or transgender people. A division of the Department of Health and Human Services told 40 states, five territories and the District of Columbia that they \u201care now on notice.\u201d \u201cFederal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas,\u201d Acting Assistant HHS Secretary Andrew Gradison said. Although the federal government had already approved the curriculum before the funds were granted to the states or territories, the Administration for Children and Families later identified program materials that it said fell \u201coutside of the scope\u201d of the State Personal Responsibility Education Program. The affected states and territories have 60 days to remove the inclusive language.\n\nOne of them even belonged to royalty.\n\nSuch observations could shed light on one of the most mysterious cosmic phenomena ever studied.\n\nMIT researchers are buzzing about new robot\n\nThe machine weighs less than a paperclip, can fly 6.5 feet per second and may someday work on other planets.\n\nYet a recent study showed 26% of men under the age of 45 are participating in it.\n\nGreen it like you mean it\n\nSimple changes can make a profound difference in creating a sustainable college campus. Here are five to try.\n\n6 in 10\n\nThat\u2019s how many teachers used an AI tool for work in the 2024-2025 school year, according to a study from the Walton Family Foundation and Gallup.\n\nMalick is a coordinator at a \u201cschool for husbands\u201d in Senegal. The UN-backed initiative helps respected male community members learn about \u201cpositive masculinity\u201d in health and social issues and promote it in their communities.\n\n\ud83c\udf24\ufe0f Check your local forecast to see what you can expect.\n\nHowever, the building-sized object\u2019s revised trajectory is drawing attention to another possible target.",

      "text": "Dr. Susan Monarez, who was sworn in as director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on July 31, has been removed from the position, the White House said Wednesday.\nHer departure was quickly followed by the resignation of several high-level veteran agency officials, leaving the CDC leaderless at a perilous time.\nMorale, which was already low after deep staff cuts this spring, plummeted after a gunman opened fire on the agency\u2019s main campus in Atlanta on August 8, pocking the buildings with hundreds of bullet holes and killing DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose. Shortly afterward, a further 600 employees got official termination notices.\n\u201cSusan Monarez is not aligned with the President\u2019s agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cSince Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.\u201d\nMonarez\u2019s attorneys, Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell, said they rejected the notification their client had received.\n\u201cOur client was notified tonight by White House staff in the personnel office that she was fired. As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her,\u201d Zaid and Lowell said in a statement. \u201cFor this reason, we reject notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our position.\u201d\nIn a statement earlier Wednesday, the attorneys disputed the White House\u2019s version of events and said, \u201cAs a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.\u201d\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said in a post on X on Wednesday, \u201cSusan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. [HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.\u201d\nHHS has not named an acting director to lead the CDC.\nThe ouster was first reported by the Washington Post.\nOther high-level leaders depart\nShortly after Monarez\u2019s departure was confirmed Wednesday, three other top CDC officials also announced that they were leaving. Dr. Debra Houry, the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director of programs and science; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, were agency veterans whom staffers said were well-liked and trusted.\n\u201cFor the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses and interpretations,\u201d Houry wrote in a resignation email to staff that was shared with CNN.\n\u201cVaccines save lives \u2013 this is an indisputable, well-established scientific fact,\u201d she said. \u201cInformed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks, but also on the true lifesaving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities.\u201d\nWhile it is important to question and analyze research, \u201cthis must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence,\u201d she wrote.\nHoury then said that misinformation has already cost lives, citing the record high number of measles cases in the US this year.\nDaskalakis shared his resignation email to Houry in a post on X.\n\u201cIt is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function.\u201d\nDr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, also left the CDC on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to share the information.\n\u201cOur agency is crumbling,\u201d said a source within the CDC who is not allowed to speak to the news media and did not want to be identified for fear of retribution. \u201cAll of our top people who kept us protected \u2026 from the new administration. From twisting science for their agenda. Science is data and facts. We\u2019re simple people that way \u2026 we trust numbers and facts.\n\u201cThe bullet holes aren\u2019t even repaired on our buildings.\u201d\nClashes with Kennedy\nMonarez\u2019s ouster followed days of internal pressure led by Kennedy\u2019s deputy chief of staff and close confidante, Stefanie Spear, according to two people familiar with the situation. It also came soon after Kennedy summoned Monarez to Washington and demanded that she fire Houry, Jernigan and Daskalakis, according to two people familiar with the matter. Monarez refused, angering Kennedy and triggering his move to remove her.\nMonarez also clashed with Kennedy and his team over vaccine policies, including an impending announcement that could draw links between immunizations and autism, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nKennedy suggested in a Tuesday meeting of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet that HHS would reveal research in September showing that \u201ccertain interventions now are clearly, almost certainly, causing autism.\u201d Trump responded that \u201cthere has to be something artificially causing this, meaning, a drug or something.\u201d\nThe CDC is readying to announce a new slate of appointees to its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the coming weeks, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kennedy dissolved the panel of independent vaccine advisers in June and days later named eight new members, many of whom have cast doubt on the safety of vaccines and public policy around vaccination. One member later dropped out during the required financial review.\nAttorneys Zaid and Lowell said in their statement that \u201cSecretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.\u201d\n\u201cWhen CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is not about one official. It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science.\u201d\nUS Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, called for Kennedy\u2019s own ouster on Wednesday.\n\u201cSusan Monarez\u2019s willingness to stand up for science and protect the integrity of the CDC is commendable and deeply important \u2013 however, it only further underscores the reality at HHS: Director Monarez is not the problem, RFK Jr. is. If there are any adults left in the White House, it\u2019s well past time they face reality and fire RFK Jr.,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cHe is a dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation \u2013 leaving us unprepared for the next deadly pandemic and snuffing out potential cures while he\u2019s at it.\u201d\nMonarez was President Donald Trump\u2019s second pick to lead the CDC; the nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon was withdrawn in March after White House officials privately voiced concerns about his comments expressing skepticism about vaccines.\nShe was the first CDC director to be confirmed by the Senate, and her tenure was the shortest of any in the agency\u2019s history.\nMonarez was principal deputy director and acting director at the CDC from January to March. She has a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology but is not a medical doctor, making her the first CDC director since the 1950s not to have a clinical background.\nMonarez\u2019s tenure in government spans Republican and Democratic administrations. Before coming to the CDC, she was deputy director for the Advance Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, and was founding director of the Center for Innovation at the Health Resources and Services Administration. She held other leadership positions at the Department of Homeland Security and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nIn a news release the day of her swearing-in, Kennedy said that Monarez had \u201cunimpeachable scientific credentials\u201d and that he had full confidence in her ability to restore Americans\u2019 trust in the agency.\n\u201cIt is a great honor to join Secretary Kennedy and his HHS leadership team,\u201d Monarez said in the news release. \u201cI consider it a privilege to work alongside the public servants at CDC. Together we will strengthen and modernize the nation\u2019s public health preparedness and response through science and innovation. We will work every day at CDC to Make America Healthy Again.\u201d\nThe public health world was stunned by Wednesday\u2019s shakeup.\n\u201cFor 80 years, CDC has been a beacon of health protection for the United States and the world,\u201d former agency Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cThat beacon is now in grave danger of being extinguished, endangering all of our health. Eroding health protection capacity at the top further undermines trust at a time when it is most needed.\u201d\nJennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, told CNN that \u201cif these reports are true, the firing of Susan Monarez represents a very dangerous turn for American health.\n\u201cIt is essential that the director of CDC yielded to evidence and not political whims and disinformation. If the CDC director was fired because she would not embrace Secretary Kennedy\u2019s lies about vaccines, then we have entered a truly dangerous time for US health and security,\u201d she said. \u201cContinuing to dismantle our evidence-based public health system exposes America to dangerous threats, including the possibility of a biological attack. Our adversaries are watching.\u201d\nFormer CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah told CNN on Wednesday that Monarez\u2019s ouster \u201cis another example of the chaotic leadership we\u2019ve seen under Secretary Kennedy, and in times of increasing public health threats, stable leadership matters.\u201d\n\u201cThe instability we\u2019re seeing at CDC will not help making Americans healthy again.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Michelle Krupa contributed to this report."

      "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\nAt a nature reserve in central Kenya, the last two northern white rhinos in existence live under the 24/7 protection of armed guards.\nThe subspecies has been driven to near extinction by decades of poaching and civil war in its range of central Africa.\nA new documentary, \u201cThe Last Rhinos: A New Hope,\u201d which premiered on National Geographic on August 24, and is now streaming on Disney+ and Hulu, chronicles the fight to save the northern white.\nThe film opens with the last, ragged breaths of a male rhino named Sudan. In 2018, the animal was euthanized at the age of 45 due to poor health, leaving the now 36-year-old female Najin and her 25-year-old daughter Fatu as the last members of their subspecies on Earth.\nOver 40-some minutes, photographer Ami Vitale, who has been documenting the rhinos since 2009, highlights their plight, the scientists who have dedicated their lives to trying to revive the subspecies, and the caretakers that spend more time with the animals than their own families.\nThe high-stakes process to save them includes in vitro fertilization (IVF) combining sperm collected from males before they died, and oocytes, egg cells, collected from Fatu. Najin is no longer healthy enough to provide eggs to the program.\nThis year, BioRescue, a consortium working to save the rhinos, has performed three oocyte collections from Fatu. In total, the team has produced 38 northern white rhino embryos.\nNeither Najin nor Fatu can carry babies for various health reasons, so the team is using closely related southern white rhinos as surrogates. \u201cNone of this has ever been done before,\u201d says Vitale, in the movie. \u201cIt\u2019s a scientific first.\u201d\nThe film also sheds light on some of the project\u2019s triumphs and heartbreaks. In late 2023, a 13-year-old southern white rhino named Curra died from a bacterial infection. A postmortem investigation found a 70-day-northern-white-fetus in her womb \u2013 the world\u2019s first IVF rhino pregnancy.\n\u201cIt perfectly captures the pressure that we work under,\u201d says Jan Stejskal, the main coordinator of BioRescue and the director of communication and international projects at Safari Park Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 in the Czech Republic.\nHe adds that it\u2019s difficult to convey some elements of the effort, like how much collaboration is required.\nToday, there are five surviving rhino species across Africa and Asia. Only about 17,000 southern white rhinos remain, mostly in South Africa, and they\u2019re classified as \u201cnear threatened\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nOthers face worse prospects. In Indonesia, for example, there are about 50 living Javan rhinos, according to the International Rhino Foundation. The hairy, two-horned Sumatran rhino isn\u2019t faring better, with less than 50 individuals in the wild.\nStejskal says the IVF project could prove valuable for working with other species in the future.\nBut there are immense challenges in carrying out a complicated medical process in creatures that weigh thousands of pounds \u2013 including getting the dosage of anesthesia right when collecting eggs and making sure the scientists don\u2019t get hurt.\nStejskal adds that the thawing of an embryo needs to be timed to match when the female rhino can be sedated for implantation. \u201cSometimes the animal is sedated in seven minutes,\u201d he says, \u201csometimes it takes 47 minutes.\u201d\nNo northern white rhino embryos have yet developed into a successful full-term pregnancy. Still, Stejskal says that he is hopeful that will happen in the foreseeable future.\nIn the meantime, he hopes the documentary helps raise awareness of the advancing reproductive technology getting closer to becoming a reality. \u201cWe have to try to involve these approaches into wider conservation efforts,\u201d he says.\nBut he\u2019s careful to add that advancing technology should not be used as an excuse to continue depleting nature.\nAnna Tunkova contributed to this story."

      "text": "What we're covering\n\u2022 Minneapolis is in mourning after a shooter fired on praying students through the windows of a church yesterday, killing two children. Seventeen others were wounded, most of them are children who were marking the first week of classes at Annunciation Catholic School. It\u2019s unclear when classes will resume.\n\u2022 The shooter, now dead, was identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman. Westman shared a \u201cmanifesto\u201d on social media that is being investigated, police said. The shooter graduated from the school in 2017.\n\u2022 The attack is the latest in a string of deadly shootings in Minnesota. It is also the 44th school shooting in the US this year, according to a CNN analysis. It has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control.\nWatch: Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Minneapolis shooting\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school Mass on Wednesday that left two children dead and 17 people wounded.\nWatch the full report for details:\nPrayer services and news conference set for today\nAs investigators in Minneapolis continue to comb through evidence in Wednesday\u2019s shooting at Annunciation Catholic School and school officials weigh how to move forward, there are several opportunities Thursday for community members to come together.\n- Noon CT: A prayer service of peace and healing will be held at the Cathedral of St. Paul.\n- 1 p.m. CT: A news conference will be held at Minneapolis City Hall. Minnesota lawmakers, gun violence prevention advocates and clergy members are expected to attend.\n- 5:30 p.m. CT: An interfaith service will be held at the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis.\nHere are some of the heroes who helped during the Minneapolis shooting\nYesterday\u2019s shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school Mass terrified the community, but people still acted bravely to protect each other.\nHere are some of the ways in which people helped others during the crisis:\nAdults and children protected others: Teachers and older children helped shield others as bullets zipped through the air, preventing the situation from becoming \u201csignificantly worse,\u201d Annunciation Catholic School principal Matt DeBoer. A fifth grader at the school, Weston Halsne, said his friend shielded him from gunfire. His friend was wounded and taken to the hospital, he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed gratitude for school staff, who he said \u201cthrew their bodies on top of children\u201d to protect them.\nNeighbor ran to help: Pat Scallen, who lives down the street from the church, ran the second he heard gunfire. When he got there, the shots had stopped, but three children came out of the church, two of them badly wounded, he recounted. Scallen helped comfort the kids while they waited for an ambulance. \u201cI felt it was important to calm them down and let them know that someone was with them and help was on the way,\u201d he said.\nOfficer cared for student shot in the stomach: A 13-year-old boy shot in the stomach was helped by a police officer who \u201crendered aid, hugged him, reassured him, and prayed with him before getting into the ambulance,\u201d his mother Danielle Gunter said. The 13-year-old was taken to the hospital and is out of surgery, Gunter said.\nBeat officer went after shooter: An officer responding to the shooting left the church to chase after the suspect, parent Shea McAdaragh recounted. The officer had \u201cno special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,\u201d he said. McAdaragh was sitting with his second-grade son, who was not wounded.\nFather whose daughter witnessed shooting says she does not feel safe after attack\nChef Vincent Francoual told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates his daughter, who was in Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, is traumatized after surviving the deadly shooting.\nNo timetable for school to resume as investigators comb shooting scene\nIt\u2019s unclear when classes will resume at Annunciation Catholic School after the deadly shooting attack during students\u2019 first week of class.\nPrincipal Matthew DeBoer and Pastor Dennis Zehren mourned the loss of two \u201cbeloved students\u201d killed in Wednesday\u2019s attack and called for prayers in an update to the school and Annunciation Church community. The message said the school and church were working with \u201ca myriad of professional agencies\u201d and that it would take time for the community to get back on its feet.\nSchool officials will also announce available support services in coming days, according to the message, which stressed unity as students, parishoners and their families endure \u201can impossible situation together.\u201d\nMinneapolis is mourning two children shot dead alongside their classmates at church. Here's what we know\nYesterday, a shooter opened fire through the stained-glass windows of a Minneapolis church, where children were attending a Mass to mark the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.\nThe shooter killed two children, aged 8 and 10 years old, and wounded 17 others \u2013 including 14 kids and three parishioners in their 80s. All of the wounded are expected to survive, officials said.\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders encouraged people to move beyond platitudes toward action to curb gun violence in America, a call echoed by Minneapolis\u2019 mayor.\nThe attack adds to a string of deadly shootings in Minnesota and was the fourth in 24 hours. It is also the 44th school shooting in the US this year, and has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control.\nHere\u2019s the latest from Minneapolis:\n- The shooting: As people were filing into church, a shooter dressed in black approached the outside of the sanctuary and shot through the windows toward children in the pews. The shooter had placed wooden two-by-fours through the door handles of two exits of the church. Police said locked doors during Mass may have hampered the attack.\n- The victims: Fifth grader Weston Halsne said his friend, who shielded him from gunfire, was wounded in the back as they hid under the pews. Children also described helping others take cover, as they had practiced during training drills, police said. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said the daughter of one of her former employees watched her friends get shot.\n- The shooter: 23-year-old Robin Westman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound behind the church after the shooting, officials said. The shooter graduated from Annunciation in 2017, and Westman\u2019s mother worked at the school from 2016 to 2021. Five years ago, the shooter\u2019s name was changed from Robert to Robin because Westman identified as female, a judge wrote. Westman\u2019s uncle is Bob Heleringer, a former Kentucky lawmaker, who called the attack \u201can unspeakable tragedy.\u201d\n- The weapons: Westman was armed with a legally and recently purchased rifle, shotgun and pistol. Authorities believe all three weapons were fired. In Minnesota, a permit is needed to purchase firearms and also to carry them in public.\n- The investigation: Westman had no prior criminal history and police believe the shooter acted alone. The FBI said the agency was investigating the attack as \u201can act of domestic terrorism and hate crimes targeting Catholics,\u201d and police are investigating a \u201cmanifesto\u201d Westman shared on YouTube. Read more about the manifesto here.\nMayor calls for Minneapolis to become \"a city united in action\" to stop gun violence\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is urging his city\u2019s residents to take action against gun violence after yesterday\u2019s deadly shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church, telling attendees at a candlelight vigil last night that \u201cwhile thoughts and prayers are great, they are not adequate.\u201d\nThe Democratic mayor echoed lawmakers in his party who have renewed calls for stronger gun control measures after the attack.\n\u201cWhat we know is that far too often people are robbed of (their kids\u2019) childhood because of this senseless gun violence,\u201d Frey said."

      "text": "A division of the US Department of Health and Human Services told 40 states, five territories and the District of Columbia on Tuesday that they \u201care now on notice\u201d: Some federally funded sex ed programs need to remove any mention of gender identity or transgender people, even in passing, or risk losing potentially millions of dollars\nThe letter from the Trump administration says the programs need to remove \u201cgender ideology content\u201d from sex ed materials paid for through the State Personal Responsibility Education Program, which was created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cAccountability is coming,\u201d Acting Assistant HHS Secretary Andrew Gradison said in a news release Tuesday. \u201cFederal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas.\u201d\nBegun in 2010, PREP\u2019s ultimate goal is to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, according to the US Family and Youth Services Bureau, an office of the Administration for Children & Families within HHS. Programs are meant to target groups including homeless youth, kids in foster care, people living in rural areas or areas with high teen birth rates, and young people who identify as being from \u201cminority groups (including sexual minorities).\u201d\nIndividual program details vary by state, but to get funding through the Personal Responsibility Education Program, they must design curricula that teach young people about abstinence and contraception.\nThe federal government had already approved the curriculum and program language before the funds were granted to the states or territories. But in April, ahead of a \u201cmedical accuracy review,\u201d the letters said, the Administration for Children and Families identified program materials that \u201cfall outside of the scope\u201d of PREP: Most of the programs mention gender identity or transgender people in some fashion. According to the new letter, even a mere mention puts federal funds at risk.\nIn Alabama, for example, the administration pointed to three examples in which \u201csubjects and language are outside the scope of the authorizing statute and all references to it must be removed.\u201d\nTwo of Alabama\u2019s \u201cMaking Proud Choices!\u201d facilitator curricula instruct the teacher to explain why some people use pronouns that don\u2019t align with their appearance.\nWhen people introduce themselves and share their pronouns, the facilitator is instructed to explain, it \u201cis a way of creating a safe space for transgender or gender nonconforming youth.\u201d\n\u201cThe simple act of requesting pronouns sends the message that transgender and gender nonconforming youth are welcome and respected in the group,\u201d the curricula say.\nThe Trump administration also says that the curricula\u2019s \u201cRespect Diversity\u201d section needs to change. That section explains that people have different family backgrounds and come from different racial and cultural groups and different living situations.\n\u201cSome may identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or straight. Some may identify as male, female or transgender. All of these differences make us unique. Regardless of how you see yourself, your background, previous relationships or experience, each of you has a place in this group. This will be (a) safe place for everyone,\u201d the Alabama program says.\nMaking such a sex ed program inclusive of transgender people is, the administration\u2019s letter says, \u201cirrelevant to teaching abstinence and contraception and unrelated to any of the adult preparation subjects.\u201d The letter further states that \u201cgender ideology is outside the scope\u201d of such programs and that any expenditure associated with it is not \u201callowable, reasonable, or allocable.\u201d\nAlabama\u2019s Department of Health told CNN that it got the information from HHS on Tuesday morning. \u201cAt this time, no educational programs using any of this curriculum are being conducted or planned in the state of Alabama,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cADPH will continue to promptly review any information received from the federal level and make adjustments as advised.\u201d\nThe states and territories were given 60 days to remove inclusive language or face the suspension or termination of the federal award.\nNew York stands to lose the most money \u2013 more than $6 million \u2013 if it does not comply with the Trump administration demands. Pennsylvania gets more than $4.6 million in PREP funding, Georgia gets more than $4.5 million, Ohio gets more than $4.2 million, and Alabama would be at risk of losing more than $2 million if it doesn\u2019t comply with the changes laid out in the new letter.\nThe administration separately terminated California\u2019s grant, worth about $12.3 million, last week after HHS said the state \u201cfailed to meet its demand to remove gender ideology from all its education materials.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said in a statement that it has \u201creceived the letter and is reviewing the information\u201d and that the department\u2019s mission remains the same. \u201cWe will continue to promote and protect health and well-being for all, building on a foundation of health equity.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Human Services said in an email, \u201cWe are reviewing and will immediately instruct the PREP contractors to update the curricula and materials to ensure full compliance as we remove sections required under the prior administration.\u201d\nOnly 2.8 million people ages 13 and older identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute, but the Trump administration has prioritized limiting the community\u2019s rights and even denying its existence.\nFederal initiatives have included removing trans people from hate crime surveys, kicking them out of the military and removing any mention of trans people on government websites.\nRemoving transgender people from sex ed programs will be damaging, said Debra Hauser, president of Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit that creates programs to educate young people about their sexual health, who has designed sex ed programs and national standards for decades.\n\u201cFor young people \u2013 any young people \u2013 to feel engaged and for them to learn from a program like this, they need to feel reflected and included and affirmed,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThat\u2019s super important for helping young people to actually not just delay sexual initiation and adolescent pregnancy but to also thrive and become sexually healthy adults.\u201d\nHauser notes that the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association all support educating young people about gender identity. Eliminating even the smallest mention of transgender people in these programs is \u201cunconscionable,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is not a decision based on science, this is really about politics, this is about their ideology. It\u2019s not what young people need\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating and so unconscionable, to take a group of young people that are some of our most vulnerable and to further demonize them, and to get that message from the federal government, it\u2019s absolutely outrageous, and it leaves me speechless.\u201d"

      "text": "If you told me four years ago that I\u2019d be living a sustainable life, I wouldn\u2019t have known what that meant.\nWith the planet getting warmer and more people viewing global warming as a serious threat, there is no better time to act than now. At least, that\u2019s the message we keep getting.\nBut as an incoming college student, what can you do?\nFor the past four years, I\u2019ve been living on a green campus surrounded by recycling and composting cans and \u201cwhat to do\u201d signage. But it can still be hard to navigate all the guidance, especially coming from a household that didn\u2019t know much about sustainable living.\nI turned to my university\u2019s top sustainability official, who told me that taking steps to go green doesn\u2019t have to be difficult.\nSimple changes can make a profound difference in creating a sustainable campus, and now that students are going back to school, it\u2019s a great time to think about what you can do, said Ciannat Howett, Emory University\u2019s vice president of resilience, sustainability and economic inclusion.\nThe impact of a college campus \u201cis very much like a small city,\u201d Howett said. \u201cIt\u2019s energy, water, waste, transportation, food, the built environment \u2014 but what we\u2019re doing is bringing together the research, the teaching and the operational part to create \u2026 a living laboratory sort of experience (on campus). And that\u2019s not unique to Emory. Other campuses are doing it as well.\u201d\nTo make our world greener, here are five easy things you can do to start living sustainably in college \u2014 or really, anywhere.\n1. Choose a reusable bottle\nPlastics make up at least 232 million tons of planet-warming emissions, so switching to a refillable, reusable water bottle or tumbler is an easy way to do your part in reducing waste.\n\u201c(It is) a great way to eliminate single-use plastic and is a really smart conservation measure,\u201d Howett said. Not only does it save students money, but keeping hydrated is a healthy lifestyle choice.\nMost college campuses, including Emory and Pennsylvania State University, also have water refill stations in every building to encourage students to bring their own bottles.\nWorried you\u2019ll forget in the morning? \u201cGo ahead the night before and put in the refillable water bottle and the refillable coffee mug in your backpack pockets, and then you\u2019ll have it for the day,\u201d Howett said.\n2. Stick to a \u2018green\u2019 dorm theme\nStudents can do a lot to conserve energy in their residence hall or dorm room, Howett said.\nThis can be as simple as turning off the lights when you leave, limiting the number of electronics you bring to campus, and decorating with posters instead of Christmas or fairy lights.\n\u201cJust minimizing that plug load makes a big difference for us in terms of saving energy,\u201d she added.\nYou don\u2019t have to give up your electronics entirely \u2014 which is also unreasonable given how schools work now \u2014 but you can maximize energy saving by using devices that are Energy Star certified.\n\u201cEnergy Star is a program through the United States Environmental Protection Agency that certifies appliances and electronics to be the most energy saving, and they do that for computers \u2014 it\u2019s called EPEAT \u2014 and then Energy Star for other appliances like refrigerators, so that all of that goes to really saving energy just in your residence hall,\u201d Howett said.\n3. Plan your commute\nA sustainable commute to, from or on campus is also important. \u201cThat could mean bringing a bike from home or renting a bike while you\u2019re on campus, getting familiar with the campus shuttle schedule and the local public transportation schedule,\u201d Howett said.\nTaking public transportation, such as buses or campus shuttles, reduces carbon emissions by 45% and decreases the amount of vehicles on the road.\nShuttles can also run on cleaner, green forms of energy. Emory\u2019s shuttles have been running on biodiesel fuel since 2006, and the campus has conserved fuel energy by recycling old cooking oil used in the dining halls.\n\u201cMany colleges don\u2019t allow first-year students to bring a car to campus,\u201d Howett said. \u201cRight out of the gate, many first-years start learning that kind of sustainability practice, which when they leave our campus gates, they may continue wherever they move to.\u201d\n4. Get your steps in\nAnother tip that\u2019s both healthy and conserving is taking the stairs rather than the elevator, Howett said. \u201cYou save energy, and you get your steps in.\u201d\nElevators contribute to 27.18 kilograms (almost 60 pounds) of carbon emissions per year and affect energy conservation at every stage, starting from the time they\u2019re manufactured through the time they are demolished. As many residence halls and academic buildings have elevators, it\u2019s important to practice these conscious acts of sustainability.\n\u201cStudents collectively make a big impact in terms of the amount of waste they generate,\u201d so these smaller acts of sustainability add up, Howett said.\nAnd research has shown that walking has health benefits, like reducing the risk of premature mortality and cancer, so you can improve your health as well as the planet.\n5. Eat \u2018green\u2019\nThe idea of reducing or cutting out meat can scare a lot of people, but it\u2019s not as difficult as you might think.\n\u201c(E)at meals that are locally or sustainably sourced, and generally, if you eat more plants than meat, you\u2019re making a more sustainable choice because the production of meat is so carbon-intensive,\u201d Howett said.\nYou can eat the Mediterranean way or try dishes from countries that have low rates of meat consumption, like India, Indonesia, Ethiopia and Nigeria.\nIf that\u2019s still intimidating, an easy way to lean into a green diet is to gradually substitute beef with high-protein vegetarian foods, like beans or quinoa.\nMaking this swap also has health benefits, as eating more fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of kidney and heart disease.\nYou probably already do some of these things, which means you\u2019re already living somewhat of a green life. But by adding even one of these practices to your day-to-day routine, you can affect meaningful change.\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Greener newsletter.

      "text": "Astronomers have spotted the brightest fast radio burst yet coming from a nearby galaxy. Observations of this phenomenon, a powerful flash of radio waves that lasts only about a millisecond, could shed light on one of the most mysterious cosmic phenomena ever studied.\nFast radio bursts, or FRBs, were first discovered in 2007, but their exact sources remain unknown. Since their identification, astronomers have been tracing the bursts\u2019 origin in the hopes of gathering clues about what unleashes them and sends them across the cosmos.\nAstronomers observed FRB 20250316A, nicknamed \u201cRBFLOAT\u201d for \u201cRadio Brightest FLash Of All Time,\u201d on March 16.\nThe signal was traced to the galaxy NGC 4141 about 130 million light-years away from Earth. The details of the detection, made with the FRB-hunting Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, or CHIME, and its newly operational, smaller array of telescopes, called Outriggers, were published Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\u201cWith the CHIME Outriggers, we are finally catching these fleeting cosmic signals in the act \u2014 narrowing down their locations not only to individual galaxies, but even to specific stellar environments,\u201d said lead study author Amanda Cook, a Banting postdoctoral fellow at the Trottier Space Institute and Physics Department at McGill University, in a statement.\nAfter the burst was detected, scientists used the James Webb Space Telescope to zoom in on where it originated. The observations add evidence to a leading theory that magnetars, or the highly magnetized remnants of dead stars, could be a source of fast radio bursts. A study about Webb\u2019s follow-up observations was also published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\u201cThis was a unique opportunity to quickly turn JWST\u2019s powerful infrared eye on the location of an FRB for the first time,\u201d said Peter Blanchard, lead author of the Webb study and research associate in the Harvard College Observatory at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in a statement. \u201cAnd we were rewarded with an exciting result \u2014 we see a faint source of infrared light very close to where the radio burst occurred. This could be the first object linked to an FRB that anyone has found in another galaxy.\u201d\nThe new insights from both studies could also be used to help astronomers solve another key mystery surrounding fast radio bursts by determining whether they have a repetitive pattern, like a cosmic heartbeat, or whether there are different flavors of radio bursts that release a singular bombastic signal before falling silent.\nA CHIME in the nick of time\nThe CHIME radio telescope near Penticton, British Columbia, at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, has enabled astronomers for the past seven years to spot thousands of fast radio bursts when they arrive at Earth after traveling across the cosmos.\nWork was completed earlier this year to get Outriggers up and running at sites in British Columbia, West Virginia and California with the goal of tracing fast radio bursts to their specific locations with enhanced precision. The Outriggers combine pinpointing capabilities with a large field of view, said Wen-fai Fong, coauthor on the CHIME study and associate professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University\u2019s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.\nAstronomers had their chance to test the array\u2019s \u201cgame-changing\u201d capabilities in March, just a couple of months after the Outriggers came online, Fong said.\nThe RBFLOAT released as much energy as the sun produced in four days \u2014 but in less than a second.\nThe Outrigger telescopes enabled the team to pinpoint the fast radio burst\u2019s point of origin to a region measuring about 45 light-years across, an area smaller than a cluster of stars. The precision of the location is like spotting a quarter from about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, Cook said.\nPrior to the Outrigger telescopes\u2019 capability to triangulate a fast radio burst to its source, \u201cit was like talking to someone on the phone and not knowing what city or state they were calling from,\u201d said study coauthor Bryan Gaensler, dean of the University of California, Santa Cruz science division.\n\u201cNow we know not only their exact address, but which room of their house they\u2019re standing in while they\u2019re on the call.\u201d\nZooming in on a galactic arm\nFollow-up observations made with the 6.5-meter MMT telescope in Arizona and the Keck II telescope\u2019s Cosmic Web Imager in Hawaii revealed that RBFLOAT came from the spiral arm of a galaxy, which is full of star-forming regions. But it originated near, and not inside, a star-forming region.\nSome previous fast radio bursts appear to have come from magnetars, or highly magnetized rotating neutron stars that release radio waves. Scientists have long hypothesized that neutron stars, ultradense core remnants left behind after massive stars explode, might be the origin of fast radio bursts.\nMagnetars typically form when gravity triggers a gigantic star to collapse on itself. And star-forming regions are where young magnetars can be found.\nThe fact that the burst was traced to a region outside a star-forming clump could suggest that the \u201cmagnetar was kicked from its birth site or that it was born right at the FRB site and away from the clump\u2019s center,\u201d said study coauthor Yuxin (Vic) Dong, graduate student and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the department of physics and astronomy at Northwestern University.\nWebb\u2019s powerful gaze\nBlanchard\u2019s team used the Webb telescope to search for a signal in infrared light that may have originated at the same cosmic location as RBFLOAT.\nWebb\u2019s data revealed an object, named NIR-1, which could be a massive star or a red giant \u2014 a sun-like star at the end of its life that has brightened significantly. Neither star is considered a candidate for the direct cause of a fast radio burst. But an unseen companion like a neutron star could be siphoning material away from the larger star \u2014 and that may have been enough to release a burst of radio waves, Blanchard said.\nIt\u2019s also possible that the infrared light that Webb detected was a reflection of a flare caused by the same object that released the radio burst, such as a magnetar.\n\u201cWhether or not the association with the star is real, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the burst\u2019s origin,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cIf a double star system isn\u2019t the answer, our work hints that an isolated magnetar caused the FRB.\u201d\nTo repeat or not to repeat\nStudying the immediate surroundings where both repeating and non-repeating fast radio bursts occur can help astronomers determine what causes the signals to repeat in the first place, Fong said.\nWhile many fast radio bursts are known to repeat pulsations over several months, the RBFLOAT did not release any repeat signals in the hundreds of hours after it was initially observed.\nRBFLOAT is the first non-repeating burst to be localized to such precision, said Sunil Simha, coauthor on the CHIME study and a Brinson postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University\u2019s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics and the University of Chicago\u2019s Astronomy and Astrophysics Department.\n\u201cSince this represents the first non-repeating FRB with its local environment fully mapped out, it remains to be seen if others will follow suit, or if this was an oddball,\u201d Fong said.\nThe results of both studies provide insight into the question of whether all fast radio bursts eventually repeat, said Liam Connor, assistant professor of astronomy at Harvard University. Connor has studied the phenomenon before but was not involved in either study.\n\u201cBefore detecting FRB 20250316A, CHIME had been unknowingly monitoring the source every day for seven years, because CHIME sees the whole Northern Sky once per day,\u201d Connor wrote in an email. \u201cSomehow, zero bursts were detected in thousands of transits, until one of the brightest events of all time suddenly went off. If all FRBs are repeaters, then clearly some are extremely sporadic and unpredictable.\u201d\nPreviously, cataclysmic theories, like the collision of massive objects, have been ruled out for repeating fast radio bursts since the source would be destroyed while producing the first burst, Dong said.\n\u201cWe can reopen the door to those more explosive theories for RBFLOAT and its kin,\u201d she said.\nSimha wants to build a database that shows where fast radio bursts have originated, which could reveal what may be responsible for creating them \u2014 and if they are all created equally. More data could show if there are multiple ways to produce fast radio bursts, Blanchard said.\nThe CHIME telescope and its Outriggers continue monitoring the sky to see whether other non-repeating fast radio bursts release another signal. The telescope array is anticipated to help localize hundreds of fast radio bursts a year. And the team will continue to monitor RBFLOAT in case it has another outburst.\n\u201cAlternatively, maybe we never detect another burst from this source, and start to see additional seemingly one-off bursts, potentially in similar environments,\u201d Cook wrote in an email. \u201cThen we\u2019re trying to solve the mysteries of the origins of at least two different populations. In either case, we are really excited to uncover the mysteries the universe has in store for us.\u201d\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

      "text": "On a recent evening in Senegal\u2018s capital of Dakar, an imam named Ibrahima Diane explained to a group of men why they should be more involved in household chores.\n\u201cThe Prophet himself says a man who does not help support his wife and children is not a good Muslim,\u201d the 53-year-old said, as he described bathing his baby and helping his wife with other duties.\nSome of the 14 men chuckled, not quite sold. Others applauded.\nDiane was taking part in a \u201cschool for husbands,\u201d a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about \u201cpositive masculinity\u201d in health and social issues and promote them in their communities.\nIn Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health.\nWomen may need their permission for life-changing decisions on accessing family planning or other reproductive health services, along with hospital deliveries or prenatal care.\nFollowing his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV.\n\u201cMany women appreciate my sermons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say their husbands\u2019 behavior changed since they attended them.\u201d He said some men have told him the sermons inspired them to become more caring husbands and fathers.\nHabib Diallo, a 60-year-old former army commando, said attending the sermons and discussions with the imam taught him about the risks of home births.\n\u201cWhen my son\u2019s wife was pregnant, I encouraged him to take her to the hospital for the delivery,\u201d Diallo said. \u201cAt first, he was hesitant. He worried about the cost and didn\u2019t trust the hospital. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed.\u201d\nNo more barking orders\nThe program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality.\n\u201cWithout men\u2019s involvement, attitudes around maternal health won\u2019t change,\u201d said 54-year-old Aida Diouf, a female health worker who collaborates with the program. Many husbands prefer their wives not be treated by male health workers, she said.\nThe classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women\u2019s access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants.\nDiscussions for men also have focused on girls\u2019 rights, equality and the harmful effects of female genital mutilation.\nThe program now operates over 20 schools in Senegal, and over 300 men have been trained.\nIn some communities, men who once enforced patriarchal norms now promote gender equality, which has led to a reduction in the number of forced marriages and more acceptance of family planning, according to Senegal\u2019s ministry of gender.\nMen join the groups after being recruited based on trust, leadership and commitment. Candidates must be married, respected locally and supportive of women\u2019s health and rights.\nAfter training, the men act as peer educators, visiting homes and hosting informal talks.\n\u201cMy husband used to not do much around the house, just bark orders. Now he actually cooks and helps out with daily tasks,\u201d said Khary Ndeye, 52.\nStill too many dying in childbirth\nWhile maternal and infant deaths in Senegal have declined over the past decade, experts say it still has a long way to go. It recorded 237 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2023, while 21 newborns out of every 1,000 died within their first month. The U.N. globally wants to reduce maternal deaths to 70 deaths per 100,000 live births and newborn deaths to under 12 per 1,000 by 2030.\nOne key problem was that many women have been giving birth at home, said El Hadj Malick, one of the Senegal program\u2019s coordinators.\n\u201cBy educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital and helping with domestic work at home, you\u2019re protecting people\u2019s health,\u201d Malick said.\nHe said he still experiences difficulty changing mindsets on some issues.\n\u201cWhen we just talk to them about gender, there is sometimes tension because it\u2019s seen as something abstract or even foreign,\u201d Malick said. Some men mistakenly believe such talk will promote LGBTQ+ issues, which remain largely taboo in much of West Africa.\n\u201cBut when we focus on women\u2019s right to be healthy, it puts a human face on the concept and its becomes universal,\u201d Malick said."

      "text": "An inscription above the doors of the Church of Annunciation in south Minneapolis proclaims its sanctuary to be \u201cthe House of God and the gate of Heaven.\u201d\nBut on Wednesday, the sense of tranquility that parishioners and students have long found in the heart of the church and Catholic school was literally shattered when a shooter opened fire through its stained-glass windows.\nWeston Halsne, 10, told reporters he was sitting two seats away from the windows that surround the sanctuary celebrating the start-of-school Mass, when shots began.\n\u201cIt was like right beside me \u2026 I think I got gunpowder on my neck,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first one, I was like, \u2018What is that?\u2019 and then I heard it again and I just ran under the pew.\u201d\nThe fifth grader said he covered his head as his friend dove on top of him.\n\u201c(He) saved me though because he laid on top of me, but he got hit,\u201d Weston said, adding the boy was hit in the back.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really brave, and I hope he\u2019s good in the hospital.\u201d\nAt least two children have been killed and 17 others \u2013 including 14 kids and 3 parishioners in their 80s \u2013 were injured during what police have described as a \u201cdeliberate act of violence.\u201d\nThe shooter, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, had lawfully purchased the weapons \u201crecently\u201d and did not appear to have a criminal history, authorities have said.\n\u2018Can you just please just hold my hand?\u2019\nPatrick Scallen still lives in the house he grew up in, about a block away from Annunciation. He attended the school as a child \u2013 just as his father did before him \u2013 and he told CNN he\u2019s proud of the century-old church and school\u2019s legacy in the community.\nJust this morning, Scallen said he saw a family of kids who go to the school.\n\u201cI thought to myself in that moment, \u2018What a wonderful thing Annunciation is,\u2019\u201d he said.\nScallen was working at his desk later in the morning, when he heard what sounded like gunshots. He took off running toward the school.\n\u201cIt was eerily quiet when I got to the church,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a (gun) magazine on the sidewalk \u2026 and then people were starting to pour out.\u201d\nImmediately, Scallen said, he saw three children who were \u201cobviously hurt.\u201d A bullet had grazed one girl on the forehead, he said. Another girl had been shot in the neck.\n\u201cCan you just please hold my hand?\u201d one of the girls asked, Scallen told CNN.\nAlthough they were alert and talking, he said he tried to offer the kids any comfort and reassurances that he could until the EMTs arrived.\n\u201cI just kept telling them, \u2018I\u2019m going to call your Mom and Dad, I\u2019m going to let them know. You\u2019re going to be OK,\u201d he said.\nAs they tried to process what they\u2019d witnessed, Scallen said the kids began asking him questions: \u201cWhy did this happen? How could this happen?\u201d\nHe, like so many of us, did not have answers.\nAn act of cruelty \u2018beyond comprehension\u2019\nChurch bells rang out mournfully in the distance as Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara described the \u201cunthinkable tragedy\u201d at a news conference later that morning.\nThe shooting began just before 8:30 a.m., O\u2019Hara said, minutes into a worship service to mark the first week of school.\nSuspect Robin Westman, 23, graduated from Annunciation Catholic\u2019s grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook obtained by CNN.\n\u201cThe gunman approached on the side of the building and began firing a rifle through the church windows towards the children sitting in the pews at the Mass,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\nThe shooter was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, O\u2019Hara said, later adding that authorities believe all three weapons were fired.\nAlthough the investigation is ongoing, O\u2019Hara said most of the shooting appeared to have taken place from outside of the building and some of the doors to the church had been barricaded with two-by-fours from the outside.\n\u201cThe sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Children, ages 8 and 10, were \u201ckilled where they sat in the pews.\u201d\n\u201cThis deliberate act of violence is just a sign of cruelty that is beyond comprehension,\u201d he said.\nFrantic parents raced toward the reunification site and tearfully clung to their children as they escorted them off the school grounds. The shooting comes after a wave of active shooter hoaxes across the country brought panic to the start of the school year.\nAfter arriving on the scene, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey ran toward the sanctuary and was later seen clasping his hands outside on the church steps.\n\u201cIt was the first week of school \u2013 they were in a church,\u201d Frey said Wednesday morning.\n\u201cThese are kids that should be learning with their friends. They should be playing on the playground. They should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence.\u201d\nBeyond \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019\nAnnunciation began the school year this week with the theme \u201cA future filled with hope.\u201d\nIt is a reference to a Bible verse in which God says: \u201cFor I know full well the plans I have for you, plans for your welfare and not for your misfortune, plans that will offer you a future filled with hope.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about today that can fill us with hope,\u201d Annunciation principal Matthew DeBoer said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe as a community have a responsibility to make sure that no child, no parent, no teacher ever has to experience what we\u2019ve experienced today \u2013 ever again.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an African proverb that says, \u2018When you pray, move your feet.\u2019 So I beg you,\u201d he said, his voice breaking, \u201cI ask you to please pray, but don\u2019t stop with your words.\u201d\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz also encouraged the community \u2013 and the nation \u2013 to move beyond platitudes toward action to curb gun violence in America.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Minnesota\u2019s day today,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask the rest of folks around the country who are watching, keep us in your thoughts and prayers, but also keep us in the thoughts for action, keep us in the ideas that we can work together.\u201d\nIn a video posted to the church\u2019s Facebook page, Father Brian Park explains the symbolism of the stained-glass tableau that spills light into the sanctuary.\nPart of the scene, he says, depicts the Biblical Adam hiding his face in shame at the \u201cfall of humanity,\u201d which Catholics believe ushered in a period of suffering and death.\nBut the Annunciation \u2013 the church\u2019s namesake \u2013 celebrates the moment the Virgin Mary was told she would become the mother of Jesus. For Catholics, Park says, it symbolizes that \u201cthe Lord is with you.\u201d\nThe Virgin Mary now gazes down from the stained-glass window at the senseless carnage wrought by man as Annunciation becomes yet another school torn apart by the all-too-common tragedy of gun violence in America.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just say this is about \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 right now,\u201d Frey, who was visibly emotional, said Wednesday morning.\n\u201cThese kids were literally praying.\u201d\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of people injured in the shooting. At least 17 people were wounded.\nCNN\u2019s Dakin Andone, John Miller, Mark Morales and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report."

      "text": "Worlds away from the public outrage and cries of protest echoing through Tel Aviv\u2019s packed streets on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu beamed from the podium in Jerusalem, his words greeted with laughter and applause.\nThe contrast was unmistakable.\nIn Tel Aviv, tens of thousands of protesters demanded a ceasefire and the return of the hostages held in Gaza. In Jerusalem, Netanyahu spoke of \u201cthe unity of the people.\u201d\nOn the streets, mothers and fathers of hostages cried for their release, begging the government to take the ceasefire deal on the table. But at a posh restaurant outside the Old City of Jerusalem, Netanyahu promised Israel was on \u201cthe path to victory\u201d with a plan to widen the 22-month war in the battered enclave.\nProtesters spoke of a country that needs to heal. Netanyahu celebrated the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.\nThey called for accountability. He spoke of \u201ca bright future ahead.\u201d\nThe juxtaposition reflects the general attitude of Netanyahu and his government toward the broad Israeli consensus demanding an end to the war and the return of the remaining hostages: indifference and detachment.\nNearly two years into the war in Gaza, polls have repeatedly shown a clear majority of Israelis favoring any sort of deal that would bring the remaining 50 hostages home and end the fighting. Week after week, tens of thousands of protestors gather at Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostages Square and at major intersections nationwide to support the families of the hostages and their struggle to secure the release of loved ones captured by Hamas on October 7, 2023.\nFollowing Netanyahu\u2019s decision to escalate the war with a massive takeover of Gaza City, protests have intensified, drawing hundreds of thousands into the streets.\nThe scale of public mobilization and participation is difficult to ignore. On August 17, the hostages\u2019 families spearheaded an unprecedented grassroots strike that organizers say drew nearly 500,000 people. That\u2019s equivalent to 17 million in the United States.\nAnd they keep coming out week after week.\nOn Tuesday, as part of an ongoing effort to pressure the government, the hostages\u2019 families launched another day of protest which, according to organizers, assembled some 300,000 demonstrators in Tel Aviv for the concluding evening rally. \u201cEnough!\u201d shouted Sylvia Cunio, mother of the hostage brothers David and Ariel Cunio.\nSolidarity is the driving force energizing the masses, says Haim Rubinstein, strategic consultant and one of the founders of the Hostages Families\u2019 Forum.\n\u201cPeople come to the rallies to tell the families: This battle is not only yours, it\u2019s every Israeli\u2019s battle, over the character and spirit of the country, over the value of mutual responsibility upon (which) Israel was founded, Rubinstein said.\u201d\n\u201cIsraelis understand we are now at a decisive juncture \u2013 conquering Gaza or releasing the hostages. They come here to tell the government (to) end the war and bring our brothers and sisters back home.\u201d\nProtests \u2018aiding Hamas\u2019\nNetanyahu appears unmoved by the groundswell of public pressure as he pushes forward with plans for a massive assault on Gaza City, disregarding the hostage families\u2019 fears that the offensive could endanger their loved ones, 20 of whom are still believed to be alive. Moreover, he and his allies have slammed the protests, accusing them of aiding Hamas.\n\u201cThose who call for ending the war are pushing off the hostages\u2019 release and guaranteeing the horrors of the massacre will return,\u201d Netanyahu said last week, after the first day of mass protests.\nThe government\u2019s apparent disconnect from the street doesn\u2019t seem to deter the demonstrators. It is an essential part of what spurs them on.\n\u201cWe come, first and foremost, to support the families and to shout about what is happening in our country,\u201d Batya Aviram, one of the protestors, told CNN. \u201cIt gives me a chance to meet with amazing empathetic people who care and are willing to act so that Israel stays a sane country.\u201d\nShe notes the messaging the demonstrations sends to the world: \u201cWe come so that people outside, in the world, see and hear us, so they know that the people of Israel are not their leadership, and know to distinguish between us and our government,\u201d\nAttention span war\nThe latest protests have already achieved tactical victories in the attention span war , bringing the hostage families\u2019 struggle back to the top of the news agenda. The families vow to continue ramping up pressure as they believe it is the only way to force Netanyahu \u2013 and the White House \u2013 to move toward a deal.\n\u201cWe are the water drops that wear down the stone, and something will eventually happen because we\u2019re fighting for our future,\u201d said Yael Adar, mother of deceased hostage Tamir Adar. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t believe we could make a difference, we wouldn\u2019t be here. This is the only way to bring them back home\u201d.\nDespite Netanyahu\u2019s hardline and dismissive comments, apparent diplomatic openings emerged last week. After weeks of stalemate, Hamas accepted the latest Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated ceasefire proposal. However, over a week has passed since then, and Israel has yet to respond.\nThe prime minister\u2019s priorities became starkly evident on Tuesday when he convened the security cabinet for the first time since the Gaza City operation was approved, and since Hamas accepted the new truce proposal.\nThe meeting coincided with mass protests in Tel Aviv. Butit was cut short due to Netanyahu\u2019s scheduled celebration with the leadership of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. As protesters hit the streets, Netanyahu went out to dinner."

      "text": "Ludrick Cooper, an eighth-grade teacher in South Carolina, didn\u2019t always like the idea of using artificial intelligence \u2013 in the classroom or otherwise. But he eventually came around.\n\u201cThis is the new encyclopedia,\u201d said Cooper, who loved reading encyclopedias growing up.\nCooper is just one of many teachers now incorporating AI into lesson plans, another sign that AI-powered tools are becoming more commonplace in the classroom even as the technology\u2019s advantages and risks are still developing.\nSix in 10 teachers said they used an AI tool for work in the 2024-2025 school year, according to a study from the Walton Family Foundation and Gallup.\nOn Tuesday, First Lady Melania Trump announced the Presidential AI Challenge, a push to encourage students in grades K-12 use AI to \u201caddress community challenges.\u201d Just last month, OpenAI launched a \u201cstudy mode\u201d for ChatGPT and announced a partnership with Instructure, whose learning platform is used by millions of students. OpenAI, Microsoft and Anthropic also teamed up with the national and New York American Federation of Teachers unions to invest approximately $23 million for AI training for 400,000 K-12th grade teachers.\nAI can offer benefits to education, like more engaging lessons or easier access to information. However, some experts worry about the risks, like making cheating easier, widening education inequalities or worsening students\u2019 mental health.\n\u201cAI is a little bit like fire. When cavemen first discovered fire, a lot of people said, \u2018Ooh, look what it can do,\u2019\u201d Sarah Howorth, an associate professor of special education at the University of Maine, told CNN. \u201cAnd other people are like, \u2018Ah, it could kill us.\u2019 You know, it\u2019s the same with AI.\u201d\nAI in the classroom\nInstructure, the company behind learning platform Canvas, is collaborating with Open AI on a new tool called the \u201cLLM-Enabled Assignment\u201d which allows teachers to create customized, interactive AI-powered lessons while tracking student progress.\nLLM is short for \u201clarge language model,\u201d the underlying technology behind ChatGPT and other chatbots. With the tool, teachers can instruct the AI to create a \u201cpersona\u201d that can be incorporated into a lesson plan by typing in a prompt. For example, a history teacher could tell the AI to take on the role of a president, politician or other historical figure.\nMelissa Loble, Instructure\u2019s chief academic officer, told CNN the partnership underscores \u201cthat people want to learn differently and engage in learning differently.\u201d\nLike Kayla Jefferson, a New York City high school social studies teacher who says she uses AI to keep students engaged, help them learn from each other and strengthen their global literacy skills.\nOne of her assignment\u2019s involves summarizing and reflecting on a news article using the AI-powered Padlet bulletin board, where the students can engage with each other\u2019s posts, Jefferson told CNN.\nMany AI-powered tools can also aid in accessibility, Howorth said, such as talk-to-text and text-to-speech tools that help those with visual impairments or dyslexia.\nHowever, Matthew Rascoff, the vice provost for digital education at Stanford, said that AI companies need to develop more technology that fosters learning as a social exercise, rather than the current model in which AI tools tend to help one person at a time.\nTools that promote social learning \u2013 learning as a group, for example \u2013 develop collaboration skills that kids can then use in their own communities.\n\u201cGreat classrooms create a sense of mutual responsibility for everybody\u2019s learning,\u201d Rascoff explained.\nAI brings certain risks\nIntegrating AI technology and education comes with certain risks.\nThe New York City Public Department of Education (NYC DOE) initially banned ChatGPT on district-issued devices and networks over concerns students could use the tech to cheat.\nThe city later reversed course after then-NYC DOE Chancellor David Banks said ChatGPT had initially \u201ccaught NYC schools off guard.\u201d Instructure said its LLM-Assignment pushes back on students asking for answers, describing the tool as a \u201cguided experience that keeps students accountable and learning authentically.\u201d\nCheating isn\u2019t the only risk \u2013 AI\u2019s effects on mental health are still poorly understood, including in children.\nOne mother, for example, alleged startup Character.AI was responsible for her 14-year-old son\u2019s suicide; she and other families have sued the company.\nAn Instructure spokesperson said the technology in Canvas will be used in a \u201ccontrolled environment,\u201d with safeguards managed by the institution to make sure conversations stay relevant to the coursework.\nAnd while some AI tools are helpful for people with different needs, the technology still doesn\u2019t have solutions for certain disabilities.\nTalk-to-text features, for example, can still get tripped up by people with stutters or accents, Howorth said.\nPoorer school districts could also struggle to access the latest AI technology, widening the gap with areas that are better-off, Robin Lake, director of Arizona State University\u2019s Center on Reinventing Public Education, told CNN.\nIn two rounds of a nationwide survey of school districts, the center found disparities in which districts were providing AI training for teachers, Lake said. High poverty districts reported lower numbers.\n\u201cWe should be doing things to make sure that more disadvantaged schools and school districts students are getting access to the advantages of AI,\u201d she said. \u201cMore advantaged kids tend to have better access to tools and opportunities and great instruction.\u201d\nSome urban and rural school districts reported that they\u2019re overwhelmed with current needs, which makes it hard to think about future tools like AI, she added.\nEven when AI is available, not all educators are convinced it belongs in a classroom.\nLauren Monaco, a New York City pre-K and kindergarten teacher with more than 20 years of experience, described AI as a crutch that keeps people from learning for themselves.\nUnlike using AI, teaching involves more than \u201cjust a transactional information input-output\u201d and takes personal analysis that computers can\u2019t do, Monaco told CNN.\n\u201cOur profession has been under attack,\u201d Monaco said. \u201cI just want to keep asking the question: Who benefits from this?\u201d\nBut ASU\u2019s Lake said there\u2019s another factor \u2013 AI is already being used in the workforce.\n\u201cWhat are students going to need to be successful in an AI economy once they get out there?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s another issue that educators should be grappling with.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: CNN\u2019s Nick Watt explores the booming sports gambling industry in America in a new episode of \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper\u201d airing at 10pm on Sunday, August 24.\nWhen Ethan lost $11,000 on a single hockey game this past March, it was the last straw.\nEthan, who declined to share his last name out of fear of losing his job, bet \u201cthe spread\u2019\u201d on a Hurricanes-Flames hockey game. That means a team doesn\u2019t just need to win \u2013 they must win by more than a certain number of points. The Hurricanes did come out on top \u2013 but by only one point, not the two-plus Ethan needed.\nEthan, 27, broke down and cried in front of his girlfriend. He couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\nWhat started as a casual hobby in college with his fraternity brothers had somehow escalated into a severe, years-long gambling addiction. And Ethan wanted out.\nAlthough his story is extreme, Ethan is an example of an increasingly concerning trend.\nA recent national survey of registered voters in the US conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University found a quarter of men under 30 bet on sports online \u2014 and 10% of men ages 18-30 have a gambling problem, compared to just 3% of the overall population.\nIn that survey, 68% of people who bet on sports online reported at least one gambling behavior that\u2019s considered harmful, such as borrowing money to gamble or saying the gambling has caused financial or emotional problems.\nDr. Timothy Fong, a UCLA psychiatry professor who is board-certified in addiction psychiatry, told CNN\u2019s Nick Watt young people are particularly vulnerable to sports betting because their frontal lobes cannot yet handle impulsivity and risk-taking. Watt explores further on \u201cThe Whole Story with Anderson Cooper\u201d airing at 10pm on Sunday, August 24.\n\u201cWe know that the younger you start betting on sports, that leads to a higher likelihood of developing a gambling problem when they\u2019re older,\u201d Fong said.\nThat\u2019s what happened to Ethan.\n\u2018Anxious frenzy\u2019\nWhen Ethan was in college, sports gambling wasn\u2019t yet legal, so he and his fraternity brothers used illegal sites to place bets.\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that states should decide whether to legalize sports betting. That marked a turning point for the industry, and it\u2019s now legal in 38 states and Washington, D.C.\nSuddenly, Ethan and others like him had access to several legal apps. That quickly escalated his addiction: He quit his near-six-figure sales job last August, determined to make sports betting his full-time gig.\nLast September, he was doing what he did every morning, drinking coffee with his girlfriend and reviewing daily game predictions. This time he came across a sports betting influencer who boasted about winning game after game \u2013 and though Ethan didn\u2019t usually fall for this type of content, he was intrigued by what seemed like hard proof. The influencer advertised his picks for five games that day.\n\u201cI bet $2,000 on each game and I lost every single one,\u201d Ethan tells CNN.\nEthan spiraled into an \u201canxious frenzy.\u201d The next day he placed a risky $10,000 bet on a Chicago Bears game and tried to hide the paralyzing fear from his girlfriend. Ethan managed to win $20,000 and get out of the red. He was relieved\u2014and back in the game. The next few months were a blur of ups and downs, wins and losses.\nSlowly, he realized he couldn\u2019t even enjoy the wins amid all the anxiety.\nThe $11,000 loss on the Hurricanes-Flames hockey game in March was the end. He chose to officially \u201cself-exclude\u201d \u2014 banning himself from all sports betting through the apps, meaning he wouldn\u2019t be able to log back in.\nShifting industry\nTwenty years ago, the word \u201cgambling\u201d called to mind slot machines in Las Vegas and poker tables in Atlantic City: mostly older people, and maybe the occasional bachelorette party, playing in person.\nNow, online gambling and sports betting have expanded that definition significantly. While casinos still represent most of the gambling industry\u2019s profits, sports betting is exploding quickly: Revenue in that sector reached $13.7 billion in 2024, a 25% increase in just a year, according to the American Gaming Association.\nMuch of this activity happens on sports betting apps. FanDuel\u2019s site says the app has 12 million registered users, while Draft Kings confirmed to CNN they have 10 million users.\nBetting has also become deeply intertwined with the leagues themselves, with advertisements during games and sports announcers discussing different odds. Fanduel\u2019s website boasts partnerships with most of the major American professional leagues and several teams.\nThe shift to app betting brings a shift toward younger bettors. FanDuel and DraftKings declined to share the age breakdown of their users, but several polls indicate a younger demographic of bettors.\nThe Fairleigh Dickinson study showed online sports betting is concentrated among young men: Only 10% of the voters they surveyed overall bet on sports or racing online in the last year. But for men under 45, that figure jumps to 26%.\nFor some of those young men, wider economic trends come into play.\nTheir betting spirals into an addiction in part because they feel they can\u2019t buy homes or pay off student loans with their current salaries, says Jonathan D. Cohen, Ph.D, author of \u201cLosing Big: America\u2019s Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling.\u201d\n\u201cThis is why you see all these people betting on these crazy (situations),\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about having $10,000. They\u2019d rather have a distant chance at $100,000.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear whether sports betting has infected a new generation with a gambling problem, as the data available typically come from self-reported surveys like FDU\u2019s. Gamblers Anonymous also doesn\u2019t track members\u2019 information for privacy reasons, but the group says it has seen an increase in younger addicts.\n\u201cWe saw a big push. A lot of young people come in\u2026 it\u2019s a much higher number than in the past,\u201d according to the public relations chair of Gamblers Anonymous, who prefers not to use their name as the group\u2019s leadership is made up of members.\nOne method of measuring addiction is data on self-exclusion: how many people ban themselves from gambling, like Ethan. In Pennsylvania, one of the few states to keep public comprehensive data on the program, only 6% of the people who self-excluded from all gambling in 2015 were ages 21-34 \u2014 a decade later, that figure is now 28%.\nJoe Maloney, a spokesperson for the American Gaming Association, doesn\u2019t believe self-exclusion necessarily indicates addiction. It may simply mean a bettor wants to take a break.\nHe also cited a recent survey from the National Council on Problem Gambling that showed problematic gambling hasn\u2019t increased much since the Supreme Court decision, and that the number of people betting on sports also remained similar, regardless of its legal status.\nA social thing\nKevin Vo, now 25, had never gambled before placing his first bet on basketball games through FanDuel three years ago. He had just secured his first job, in finance, and he had some money to play with.\n\u201cI honestly fell into the peer pressure of my friends: like, literally all of them posting their parlays (on social media),\u201d Vo said.\nA parlay combines two or more individual bets into one, and all conditions must be met for the bettor to win money \u2014 a high-risk, high-reward strategy Vo found compelling.\nLike Ethan, he watched games with friends who had all bet on the outcome and participated in group chats dedicated solely to the bets of the day. Vo\u2019s casual pastime escalated in a matter of months.\n\u201cEvery single day I would have a parlay,\u201d Vo tells CNN.\nVo originally bet only on sports he knew well, but as he got deeper into the betting apps, he began putting money on options he knew nothing about. At one point he dove into Polish basketball, betting on games he couldn\u2019t even watch.\n\u201cI was down a couple grand at one point. I was able to make it back. And then that all kind of fell down,\u201d Vo said.\nVo spent months up and down with his wins and losses \u2013 and finally walked away when he was down only a few thousand and had just moved into his own apartment.\nIn an email to CNN, FanDuel outlined several ways it acts to prevent harmful gambling: the ability to set deposit limits and alerts, sending users a monthly statement with their financial status in the app, a review system triggered by activity like too many hours spent on the site or attempting to come back from big losses, and self-exclusion programs that include the offer of a free mental health assessment.\n\u201cWe work to identify signs of harm and engage with the user to prevent that harm from happening,\u201d said Cory Fox, FanDuel\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Sustainability.\nDraftKings has similar safety measures in place, and it invites users to set limits with a pop-up page immediately when creating an account.\n\u201cThese resources are introduced at sign-up and reinforced throughout the customer journey,\u201d Lori Kalani, DraftKings Chief Responsible Gaming Officer, said in an email to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun when it\u2019s for fun\u2014and that\u2019s the experience we aim to deliver.\u201d\n\u2018Plastered in your face\u2019\nFanDuel, too, told CNN it views sports betting as a form of entertainment.\n\u201cWe want our customers to think of their time and budgets on our platform the same way they might think about going to see a movie,\u201d said Fox at FanDuel.\nBut at least some bettors try to leverage it into income \u2014 like Colby Aaron Wells, now 33, who began sports betting in Tennessee nearly a decade ago to make extra money. (The state legalized certain daily fantasy sports contests on apps in 2016.)\nHe said he was \u201cworking his butt off\u201d at a landscaping job at the time, and he thought he could make a little extra money to pay the bills.\nIn Wells\u2019 years of app betting, including after sports betting was legalized more widely, there were months when he did win thousands of dollars. Twice, the app company BetMGM even comped him free rooms in Las Vegas for betting so much.\nBut there were also many losses. Wells says he could have bought and paid off a house in Tennessee with the amount of money he lost, and he has since quit playing altogether. BetMGM declined CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nAll three young men interviewed for this story believed they had a competitive edge because of their knowledge of different sports, viewing it differently from a slot machine or lottery ticket.\nAnd though they\u2019ve stopped gambling, they say the incessant advertising for sports betting is difficult to avoid. They see promotions like \u201cbet $5 and get $150,\u201d and they know just how easy it is to get sucked in.\n\u201cThe amount of advertisements and commercials you see everywhere,\u201d said Vo, \u201cit\u2019s literally plastered in your face.\u201d"

      "text": "Kyiv was struck by a \u201cmassive attack\u201d from Russia overnight with drones and missiles killing at least 15 people, including four children, according to officials.\nAmong those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. At least 10 children were also injured, he said.\nUkraine\u2019s Air Force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.\nRussia\u2019s defense ministry said it struck \u201cmilitary-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine\u201d using \u201chigh-precision weapons.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a \u201chorrific and deliberate killing of civilians\u201d in a post on X.\n\u201cThese Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,\u201d he said in an earlier post.\nUkrainian authorities said some 500 rescuers and 1,000 police officers were responding to incidents in multiple locations, including a building of the European Union mission to Ukraine.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was \u201coutraged\u201d by the attack, calling it \u201canother grim reminder of what is at stake.\u201d\n\u201cIt shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,\u201d she said.\nVon der Leyen said that the EU is \u201ckeeping maximum pressure on Russia,\u201d including by tightening its sanctions regime.\nThe bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.\nA British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201ckilling children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.\u201d\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Russia of targeting diplomats \u201cin direct breach of the Vienna convention\u201d and called for \u201cworldwide condemnation\u201d in a statement on X.\nThe bureau of Radio Liberty, a network funded by the US government, was also impacted in the strike, according to the organization. No staff members were hurt, but windows and equipment were damaged, it said.\nResidents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.\n\u2018I looked up \u2013 the roof was gone\u2019\nVitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.\nThe couple were getting ready to go to their building\u2019s bomb shelter when there was an \u201cexplosion,\u201d Protsiuk said.\n\u201cI was buried,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up \u2013 the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.\n\u201cAs of now, my wife hasn\u2019t been found. Her phone doesn\u2019t respond. She\u2019s not listed anywhere. I don\u2019t know\u2026 we\u2019re still searching,\u201d Protsiuk added.\nAgency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to \u201cstay in shelters\u201d during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.\nThe major attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.\nBut momentum around peace talks has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.\nOn Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky\u2019s office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister to discuss an end to the war.\nA delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.\nMeanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia\u2019s Robert Fico.\nThe attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of assaults across Ukraine this week, as Kremlin troops intensify their offensive amid stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war.\nUkrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.\nRussian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.\nUkraine\u2019s outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.\n\u201cRussia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,\u201d Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. \u201cIt chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.\u201d\nIn his analysis of Russia\u2019s latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical \u201csignature\u201d which involves \u201ccombined attacks from different directions\u201d and targeting \u201cordinary residential buildings.\u201d\nDecoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.\nSeveral high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.\n\u201cIn total, the number of damaged facilities in Kyiv will again reach hundreds, with thousands of broken windows, and a shopping center in the city center was damaged,\u201d Tkachenko added.\nUkraine\u2019s State Emergency Service sent aircraft to help extinguish fires across the city with the affected neighborhoods including Darnytskyi, Desnianskyi, Dniprovskyi, Holosiivskyi, Obolonskyi, Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi, which is home to several cultural and religious landmarks.\nCNN\u2019s Anna Chernova and James Frater contributed to this report."

      "text": "Jacob Frey clasped his hands together as he sat on the steps of the Catholic church where hours earlier a shooter opened fire on young children gathered in the pews inside.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just say, this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying,\u201d the Minneapolis mayor said at a press conference on the scene on Wednesday. \u201cThey should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence, and their parents should have the same kind of assurance.\u201d\n\u201cThese are the sort of basic assurances that every family should have, every step of the day, regardless of where they are in our country,\u201d he added.\nFrey\u2019s plea was echoed by several Democratic leaders in Minnesota who renewed calls to address gun violence in the wake of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church and School. They argued the horrific scene \u2013 a shooter opening fire through a stained glass window as students celebrated their first week of school with worship \u2013 should prompt people to demand action.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my strongest desire that no state, no community, no school, ever experiences a day like this,\u201d said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \u201cKeep us in your thoughts and prayers, but also keep us in the thoughts for action. Keep us in the ideas that we can work together.\u201d\nRep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis accused elected leaders of being \u201cmore concerned with appeasing the gun lobby than keeping our children safe.\u201d\nAnd Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, \u201cIf a bunch of kids praying in church and shot down through the windows of that church and and locked into that by a madman isn\u2019t enough to make people move, I just don\u2019t know what is anymore.\u201d\nBut their calls for greater action may soon meet political reality. In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no signs of opening a push for new gun measures next week when lawmakers return from their August recess.\n\u201cOur prayers are with the victims, their families, and first responders on the scene,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip in the US House, wrote on X.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said the country was \u201cheartbroken over the tragic violence,\u201d adding, \u201cOur prayers are with the children, families, civilians, law enforcement, and all those impacted by this evil attack.\u201d\nCongress last passed gun safety legislation in 2022 following the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The bipartisan gun safety law, which surged millions of dollars to mental health and school safety programs and changed the process for when individuals ages 18 to 21 go to purchase a firearm, was the first meaningful gun measure enacted in decades.\nWhile the investigation into the shooting remains underway, law enforcement officials said the 23-year-old shooter legally purchased the weapons used in the attack, which included a rifle, shotgun and pistol. The shooter killed two children, ages 8 and 10. Fourteen students, all between the ages of six and 15, and three adults were injured.\nKlobuchar said lawmakers could do more to strengthen background checks and address assault weapons, but she also acknowledged any legislative pushes would require additional buy-in.\nThe US House last voted to ban assault-style weapons in 2022, when the chamber was controlled by Democrats, even though the bill would not clear a Republican filibuster in the Senate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing we can do to make this better and stop the angry rhetoric. Start working on solutions that we know have worked in other countries or could work here and it\u2019s not just one size fits all,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to be willing to do it, and especially my colleagues who\u2019ve been afraid to do it.\u201d\nAnother deadly shooting in the state\nThe church and school shooting bookended a summer of tragedy in Minnesota.\nTwo months earlier, former state Rep. Melissa Hortman was assassinated at her home along with her husband. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were targeted in a shooting that same night but survived.\nThe acts of political violence sent shockwaves through Minnesota and its political community. Walz, who eulogized Hortman at her funeral and served as a pallbearer, seemed to reference the June shooting when he spoke at a press conference in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cameras here and unfortunately we\u2019ve been through these types of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be gone some point, but what happened here today will not be gone. Minnesotans will not step away. We\u2019ll stand with this community.\u201d\nThe Hortmans\u2019 family said Wednesday the Catholic school shooting was a \u201csenseless act of violence\u201d and called on elected officials to act on \u201ccommon-sense measures.\u201d\n\u201cMark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that families should be safe in their homes,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWe hope this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common-sense measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.\u201d\nThe June attacks were top of mind for Democrats this week, when the national party gathered in Minneapolis for its summer meeting. During the meeting\u2019s opening session, Walz, Klobuchar, DNC chair Ken Martin and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison all reflected on Hortman\u2019s legacy.\n\u201cWe have not moved on from it,\u201d Walz told Democrats Monday. \u201cWe are forever changed by it. But we are a hearty people \u2026 and we\u2019ve seen these things happen. But I think the thing I\u2019m most proud of is that legacy that Melissa Hortman leaves was one about improving lives.\u201d\nShortly after Frey addressed a DNC committee Wednesday morning, Martin announced that the shooting had occurred and urged anyone with medical training to help if they could.\nThe meeting\u2019s closing session, which was scheduled to last three hours, ended after less than 12 minutes. Martin, a native of Minnesota, began the shortened session by saying Democrats were heartbroken.\n\u201cThis is a tragic day for our city, and a tragic day for Minnesotans, on the heels of a tragic year, where we already lost our friends Melissa and Mark Hortman, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just far too common place. Folks, we need your prayers, we need your faith, and we need leadership to stop this evil.\u201d\nAfter a short prayer, the committee voted to unanimously approve the reports from all committees and adjourn early.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "Politically engineered chaos is destabilizing the top of America\u2019s vital public health institutions, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s tenure challenges the historic role of government in widening access to vaccines.\nThe ouster Wednesday of Dr. Susan Monarez as director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 less than a month after she was sworn in \u2014 deepened concerns about the role of Kennedy, who has a history of vaccine skepticism. It will fuel fresh concerns the Trump administration is politicizing medicine, rejecting science and creating new risks to public health.\nSeveral other top CDC officials also announced they were quitting Wednesday, sending shock waves through an agency long regarded as the global gold standard that has been seriously diminished by the Trump administration.\nTop health experts described the loss of senior staffers as \u201creckless,\u201d a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and ruinous to evidence-based public health policy \u2014 leaving the country more vulnerable.\nCNN reported that Monarez\u2019s firing comes after days of pressure from Kennedy\u2019s deputy chief of staff and confidante Stefanie Spear, according to two people familiar with the situation. Monarez also clashed with Kennedy and his team over vaccine policies, including an impending announcement that could draw links between immunizations and autism, a person familiar with the situation told CNN.\nThe latest drama at the CDC follows an attack by a gunman on the agency\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, which killed a police officer. The horror further fractured morale at an agency devastated by mass layoffs by RFK Jr.\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.\nCombined with vast changes to health guidance and policy being pushed through by the Trump administration, and huge cuts to federal health funding at elite research universities that have forged lifesaving breakthroughs, the latest shocks are plunging American public health into deep uncertainty.\nThe administration has also made massive reductions to US-funded health programs worldwide, including with the demolition of the US Agency for International Development, tarnishing the country\u2019s reputation as a global health superpower.\nAll of this raises the risk that an administration devoted to \u201cMaking America Healthy Again\u201d could end up complicit in many unnecessary deaths in years to come.\n\u2018Destructive chaos\u2019 and an \u2018absolute disaster\u2019 for public health\nRFK Jr.\u2019s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary owes much to the synergy between his past vaccine skepticism and the distrust of public health agencies among Trump\u2019s conservative base that ballooned during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHis tenure is already precipitating transformations in top health agencies that would take many years to reverse under future administrations.\n\u201cOusting the first Senate-confirmed CDC director weeks into the start of her tenure makes absolutely no sense and underscores the destructive chaos at RFK Jr.\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services,\u201d said Dr. Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.\n\u201cTo make matters even worse, there are reports of additional resignations of critical high-ranking CDC staff,\u201d Steinbrook said. \u201cThe CDC is being decapitated. This is an absolute disaster for public health.\u201d\nDr. Tina Tan, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, warned that politically motivated attacks on the country\u2019s public health system must end.\n\u201cThe mass resignations of CDC expert leaders present a clear and present danger to Americans of all ages and leave our nation extremely vulnerable to a wide range of public health threats from outbreaks to bioterror attacks,\u201d Tan said. \u201cAs we near respiratory virus season, it is imperative that our country have expert public health leadership for effective surveillance, communications and responses.\u201d\nTam added, \u201cThe administration\u2019s current trajectory for destroying the public health system is reckless and cannot continue.\u201d\nMonarez\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that \u201cSecretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.\u201d They also made clear that she had not resigned nor received notice of her dismissal from the White House as of late Wednesday.\nThe White House responded with a statement explicitly firing Monarez. \u201cAs her attorney\u2019s statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President\u2019s agenda of Making America Healthy Again. Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Wednesday night.\nThe fact that Monarez has been ousted just weeks after she was confirmed by the Senate underscores the administration\u2019s contempt for the legislative branch and its constitutional oversight role at a time when Trump is dismantling constraints on presidential power every day.\nMonarez, a longtime government scientist, wasn\u2019t even the president\u2019s first choice to run the CDC. His initial pick, Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Florida lawmaker, was withdrawn in March amid concerns in the White House about his public comments expressing skepticism about vaccines.\nNews of Monarez\u2019s departure broke after Kennedy announced changes that will narrow access to Covid-19 vaccines. He celebrated the move, on X, claiming that emergency use authorizations had been used by the Biden administration to justify \u201cbroad mandates\u201d on the population. His comment underscored how the lingering politics of the pandemic are a motivating force for Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThe FDA approved updated vaccines for Covid-19 but constrained criteria for their use. The dose is permitted for adults 65 and older and younger people at higher risk from Covid-19. At a time when Covid-19 cases are spiking, it is now likely to become harder for the general population and especially younger children to get the vaccines.\nThis decision comes a few weeks after Kennedy announced that the government would terminate investments in 22 mRNA vaccine projects, claiming that they \u201cfail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu.\u201d This is despite the role of such vaccines in preventing severe disease and ending the Covid-19 pandemic. Such inoculations can be developed quickly and produced at a massive scare during an emergency and were demonstrated to be safe.\nKennedy has also fired the entire 17-member panel of outside vaccine experts who sit on the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that reviews vaccine data and replaced them with his own selections, some of whom have expressed anti-vaccine views in the past.\nSenators had hoped Monarez would be a brake on RFK Jr.\nMany observers expected divisions between RFK Jr. and Monarez to emerge \u2014 but perhaps not quite so soon.\nDuring her confirmation hearing in June, Monarez described vaccines as \u201clifesaving\u201d and pledged to prioritize vaccine availability. She said that she had no prejudices against the mRNA platform. And she said she had seen no \u201ccausal\u201d link between vaccines and autism.\nKennedy\u2019s boss, President Donald Trump, claimed Tuesday that his first-term Operation Warp Speed, which helped push out mRNA Covid vaccines, was \u201cone of the greatest achievements ever in politics.\u201d But Trump is also leery of highlighting the vaccines since the Republican Party\u2019s base is laced with vaccine skepticism and hostility toward US health institutions that developed it.\nAt the same Cabinet meeting, Kennedy promised announcements in September and mentioned \u201ccertain interventions now that are clearly, almost certainly causing autism.\u201d Trump replied that \u201cthere has to be something artificially causing this, meaning a drug or something.\u201d The CDC has previously published several studies looking at a possible link between vaccines and vaccine ingredients and autism. None has found any evidence to suggest that vaccines increase the risk of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nKennedy\u2019s moves on vaccines in recent months and his comments on autism are heightening anxiety among his critics that vital public health decisions are now being overly influenced by political goals.\nIt was clear during Monarez\u2019s confirmation hearing that some senators on both sides of the political aisle were hoping that she would emerge as a constraint on Kennedy, who once described the Covid-19 inoculations as \u201cthe deadliest vaccine ever made.\u201d Several senators extracted promises from Monarez to follow science. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said that while he had no concerns about her qualifications, he had questions about \u201cyour willingness to follow through on your values.\u201d\nIn the event, Monarez\u2019s lawyers said Wednesday that she \u201crefused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, (and) she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda.\u201d\nIn his own confirmation hearing earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly denied he was anti-vaccine \u2014 even though his denials contradicted on-the-record comments he\u2019d made in the past.\nWhile his record on vaccines at HHS appears to be validating the fears of many Democrats who voted against him \u2014 and some Republicans who trusted his undertakings \u2014 his views on other issues enjoy more support. Kennedy\u2019s warnings that unhealthy food and lifestyles are making many people sick are based in fact. But his recent implications that some conditions are purely the result of lifestyle and that some victims of Covid-19 might have died because of other health conditions have been disputed by numerous health experts.\nFollowing Kennedy\u2019s purges at HHS, CDC and other agencies, such views will get less pushback.\nAnd with Monarez\u2019s departure, RFK\u2019s control over the government\u2019s public health infrastructure \u2014 and by extension, the treatment and health-care options of tens of millions of Americans \u2014 is more unchallenged than ever."

      "text": "A bee-like robot currently under development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is part of a new generation of bots inspired by creepy crawlies.\nThe machine, which weighs less than a paperclip, can flap its wings up to 400 times a second and has achieved a maximum speed of two meters (6.5 feet) per second. It can also flip and hover.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to mimic these amazing maneuvers that bumblebees can achieve,\u201d says Yi-Hsuan \u201cNemo\u201d Hsiao, a fourth-year PhD student who is working on the robots.\nResearchers hope that it could someday help with tasks like artificial pollination, maybe even on other planets.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to grow something on Mars, you probably don\u2019t want to bring a lot of natural insects to do the pollination,\u201d says Hsiao. \u201cThat\u2019s where our robot could potentially come into play,\u201d he adds.\nKevin Chen, an associate professor at MIT and the principal investigator at its Soft and Micro Robotics Lab adds that the team doesn\u2019t want to replace bees, but put the robots to work in scenarios where the insects can\u2019t.\nThey could be used in warehouse farms with rows of crops stacked high and ultraviolet lighting, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for bees to survive in that environment.\u201d\nAcross the world, technologists are taking lessons from nature to create robots that might perform better at complex tasks or in difficult environments than traditional technology.\nAt Yale University, researchers developed a gecko-inspired robot that can amputate its own limbs \u2013 a capability that could be helpful in search and rescue missions in dangerous rubble, according to its creators.\nAnd researchers at South Korea\u2019s Chung-Ang University recently unveiled a soft robot that can bend and crawl like a caterpillar.\n\u201cMillions of years of evolution has helped to give (insects and animals) the best solution, especially for any type of locomotion,\u201d says Hsiao, who writes the algorithms that tells the bee robots how to move.\nThe robot bee flies using soft artificial muscles that elongate and contract to flap the wing, developed by PhD candidate Suhan Kim. The robot\u2019s laser-cut wings, and its tiny internal mechanisms, similar in size to watch components, are also made in-house.\nThe team is also working on a grasshopper-like robot. The machine, smaller than a human thumb, can hop 20 centimeters (almost 8 inches) into the air and take on terrains ranging from grass to ice to a leaf. Hsiao says that the jumping robot is more energy efficient than a flying robot.\nThe small size of the bee and grasshopper-like robots means they could be useful for search and rescue missions or exploring places like the inside of a pipeline or a turbine engine.\nHsiao says the next step in taking the technology into the real world is to add sensors that can feed information to the robots, and batteries to power them. The machines currently rely on a wire to power them. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to put a small energy source onboard tiny robots,\u201d adds Chen.\nThe ability to deploy a fully autonomous robot in the field could be 20 to 30 years away, he estimates.\nBut studying insects\u2019 natural abilities will give his team a jumpstart. \u201cThey have evolved for millions of years\u201d says Chen. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be learned from insect motion, behavior and structure.\u201d"

      "text": "France has returned three skulls to Madagascar more than a century after they were taken, including one believed to be that of a 19th-century Malagasy king who was beheaded by French troops.\nThe repatriation of the skulls to the island nation off the southeastern coast of Africa marks the first time France has implemented a 2023 law enabling the return of human remains to a country for funeral purposes.\nFrance conquered the kingdoms of the Sakalava people in western Madagascar in the 1890s and integrated the Sakalava into a newly formed French colony.\nOne of the three Sakalava skulls returned to Madagascar, which gained independence from France in 1960, is presumed to be that of King Toera, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement Tuesday. He was executed by French troops in 1897.\nThe other two skulls belonged to two generals who fought with the king, Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of Communications and Culture said in a statement Tuesday announcing the return of the \u201cheroes.\u201d\nThe skulls had been kept in collections held by France\u2019s National Museum of Natural History until they were formally handed over at a ceremony at the culture ministry on Tuesday.\n\u201cI welcome the return of these three skulls, including that of King Toera of the Sakalava people, an origin shared by nearly a third of the Malagasy population,\u201d Fetra Rakotondrasoava, permanent secretary of Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of Culture, who co-chaired the Malagasy-French Committee of Researchers working on the identification of the skulls, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\u201cThis is not only the repatriation of human remains, but the return of a part of our history and memory,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will now be able to honor these remains as they should be. This moment carries significance for the Malagasy people and for all nations engaged in the restitution of their heritage.\u201d\nMadagascar\u2019s Communication and Culture Minister, Volamiranty Donna Mara, said at the ceremony that the human remains, including that of \u201cour great, indeed very great, King Toera,\u201d are \u201cnot mere objects in a collection\u201d but the link, \u201cinvisible and indelible, which binds our present to our past.\u201d\n\u201cTheir absence, for more than a century, 128 years, has been an open wound at the heart of the Great Island (Madagascar), and especially for the Sakalava community of Menabe,\u201d she continued.\nMadagascar\u2019s culture ministry said the skulls will be reburied in Menabe, in the west of the island.\nSpeaking at the handover, French Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the ceremony \u201cmarks a historic event between France and Madagascar.\u201d\nShe added that the joint Scientific Committee, established in October to examine Madagascar\u2019s request for restitution, \u201chas once again enabled us to appreciate the significance of the figure of King Toera, for your fellow citizens as a whole and for the Sakalava people in particular: for their identity, their dignity, their self-awareness, and the bond they wish to forge between past and future.\u201d\nIn 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech in Burkina Faso that \u201cwithin the next five years, I want to see the conditions put in place so as to allow for the temporary or definitive restitution of African cultural heritage to Africa.\u201d\nHe then commissioned a report released in 2018 that recommended that thousands of African artifacts looted during the colonial era be pulled out of French museums and returned to the continent.\nA similar push for restitution is being made in the United Kingdom, where lawmakers and campaigners released a report in March calling for an end to the display of human remains in museums and the sale of human body parts in auction houses."
