  "content": "BOSTON, August 11, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elucid, an AI medical technology company focused on providing physicians with a more precise view of atherosclerosis to drive patient-specific therapeutic decisions, announced that United Healthcare has updated its cardiac imaging guidelines to fully align with recent recommendations from radiology benefit manager EviCore. United Healthcare\u2019s new guidelines now include coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) plaque quantification (see page 520), specifically encompassing Elucid\u2019s PlaqueIQ\u2122 technology. The coverage will apply to all United Healthcare plans beginning October 1, 2025.\n\nPlaqueIQ is the first and only FDA-cleared, non-invasive plaque analysis based on objective histology. PlaqueIQ delivers automated quantification and classification of plaque morphology, and is uniquely capable of identifying and quantifying lipid rich necrotic core, a plaque type strongly linked with cardiovascular risk.1,2 The software is designed to help physicians prioritize and personalize treatment based on actual coronary artery disease, rather than population-based risk. This technology supports physicians in evaluating treatment of patients\u2019 symptoms and risk of future cardiac events, such as heart attack and stroke, and enables the development of personalized care pathways informed by each patient\u2019s individual plaque characteristics.\n\n\"United Healthcare\u2019s new e guidelines further underscore the need for better tools to help clinicians get ahead of heart attack and stroke,\" said Elucid CEO Kelly Huang, PhD. \"With its basis in CT Virtual Histology\u2122, we believe that PlaqueIQ is poised to make a meaningful difference towards this goal.\"\n\nUnited Healthcare\u2019s updated guidelines align with recently issued guidelines by radiology benefit manager EviCore. In addition to the recent coverage decision by United Healthcare, a new CMS rule went into effect on January 1, 2025, which doubled the amount paid to hospitals and outpatient clinics who perform cardiac CT scans from $175 to $357.13. This has allowed more hospitals, particularly those in non-urban areas, to be able to offer this service, reducing disparities in care. In late 2024, five of the seven Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) issued decisions to extend coverage of Elucid\u2019s PlaqueIQ, making it available to over 70 percent of eligible Medicare patients across the United States. The newly assigned Category I code for coronary plaque analysis, which goes into effect on January 1, 2026, complements the recent coverage decisions by United Healthcare and EviCore, allowing for expanded patient access and personalized treatment for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).",
