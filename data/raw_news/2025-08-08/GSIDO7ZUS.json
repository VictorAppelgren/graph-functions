  "title": "Get ready for NBN speed boosts with a major discount on our favourite mesh Wi-Fi system",
  "description": "The Google Nest WiFi Pro is a perfect mesh system for fast NBN speeds \u2013 and the three-pack is just AU$325.84",
  "content": "As you\u2019ve probably heard, the NBN is getting a major speed upgrade come September, with the NBN 100 plan being boosted to 500Mbps speeds for those with FTTP and HFC connections. Not to mention, even faster speeds being introduced, such as NBN 750 and NBN 2000, plus improvements to minimum speeds for NBN 1000.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant time for Australian internet \u2013 but you need to be prepared with a capable router. Enter the Google Nest WiFi Pro, our pick for the best mesh Wi-Fi system in Australia , which is currently 53% off.\n\nThe Google Nest WiFi Pro strikes a nice balance between solid features and a fairly decent price, with Wi-Fi 6E compatibility making it perfect for handling both upcoming NBN speed increases and future improvements to the network. With this discount dropping the price to cheaper than Prime Day (OK, OK, by one whole cent), it\u2019s pretty hard to ignore.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to talk about routers without getting into the nitty gritty, but I\u2019ll make it as easy to understand as I can.\n\nThe Google Nest WiFi Pro offers simultaneous tri-band networking over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz and 6GHz frequencies, with dual gigabit Ethernet ports in each node making it perfect for most NBN tiers (but not quite good enough to get the best speed from NBN 2000 plans).\n\nThe router is capable of up to 5,400Mbps of throughput, so in real-world use it\u2019s perfect for supporting sub-1000Mbps speeds across a wireless network, though you\u2019ll want to ensure the mesh nodes are placed evenly around your home to get the best possible experience.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant mesh system if you, like us here at TechRadar, have a constant need for speed and crave the best home Wi-Fi possible. Sure, maybe it\u2019s a little overkill for NBN 50 plans, or for a small home that doesn't have any dead zones, but it\u2019s worth considering as a peace-of-mind solution to internet speed woes.\n\nWhile you\u2019re shopping for a new mesh system, you might also be interested in getting an early upgrade to those upcoming faster NBN speeds, with some internet providers offering 500Mbps a lot earlier than the September upgrade date.\n\nExetel hit the ground running with its shift toward a single plan, offering 500Mbps for AU$80p/m \u2013 a great deal if ever we\u2019ve seen one \u2013 but a handful of other providers have also jumped onboard with early speed bumps:\n\u2022 Tangerine: 700Mbps (until September 14) for AU$68.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$88.90p/m)\n\u2022 Spintel: 500Mbps for AU$74p/m (first 6 months, then AU$84.95p/m)\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 NBN speed upgrades: launch date, new tiers, eligibility and everything else we know about the September 2025 changes\n\u2022 Best NBN 500 plans: jump the queue with these expert-rated picks\n\u2022 No Starlink, thanks: NBN Co is teaming up with Amazon for future satellite internet services",

      "text": "Want NBN 500 right now? Exetel's not waiting for NBN Co and has just unlocked the speed upgrade two months early\nExetel's radically revamping its NBN plans, and now offers just a single 500Mbps plan at a very nice price\nWe\u2019re still technically a couple of months out from the official rollout of NBN 500 plans in Australia, but Exetel \u2013 one of our favourite providers here at TechRadar \u2013 has jumped the gun early, introducing a brand-new plan with 500Mbps download speeds.\nAvailable from today for anyone looking to supercharge their home internet \u2013 provided you\u2019re on a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coax (HFC) NBN connection \u2013 Exetel is claiming its new One plan is the only one you should consider \u2013 and it's so confident of this that it's made the radical move of ditching all its other NBN plans.\nPrice is right\nPrice can be a huge contributing factor when deciding on a new NBN plan. Shop around and you\u2019ll find that the high price \u2018premium\u2019 providers are charging for their plans can often be nabbed from smaller ISPs \u2013 with nearly identical service \u2013 for a lot less.\nThe Exetel One plan absolutely adheres to this philosophy \u2013 not only is it the first consumer NBN 500 plan to come to market, but it\u2019s also incredibly competitively priced at just AU$80 a month.\nTo put this into context, the current average monthly cost of an 100Mbps NBN 100 plan \u2013 which is 5x slower than what Exetel\u2019s offering \u2013 is just over AU$90. And, going further, Telstra\u2019s NBN 25 plan, which is 20x slower than Exetel\u2019s One plan, will set you back AU$93 a month. Exponentially more speed for less money is a win in our book.\nAnd, while there might not be an introductory discount \u2013 something we\u2019ve come to expect from the best NBN plans \u2013 we\u2019d argue that the cost-per-megabit on offer here is such exceptional value that it doesn\u2019t even need one.\nExetel One | NBN 500 | AU$80p/m\nThe first of its kind, Exetel's NBN 500 plan is taking advantage of the incoming changes to the NBN network early. Promising download speeds of up to 500Mbps (even during the busier evening hours) and speedy uploads of up to 50Mbps, it offers homes a great balance of speed and price. Whether you want to stream to multiple devices without interruption or download large game files, the Exetel One plan is one to consider.\nExetel is a TechRadar preferred partner (What does that mean?)\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nA plan that works for you\nExetel is also introducing some new perks with this NBN 500 plan, including an evolution of its Speed Boost Days feature and the ability to save some cash by temporarily \u2018downgrading\u2019 the plan while you\u2019re away from home.\nOn the boosting front, if you find you need faster speeds for a short period (to download a massive new-release video game, for example,) you can upgrade your NBN 500 plan to achieve NBN 1000 speeds \u2013 which Exetel says is around 811Mbps typical evening speeds \u2013 for AU$1 per day. The telco calls this \u2018Warp Speed\u2019 and has, for a long time, offered a Speed Boost feature across its now-discontinued NBN plans that works in much the same way.\nThe other new feature, which Exetel is calling Hibernate, allows you to drop the speed of your plan down to the equivalent of NBN 12 (with 12Mbps maximum downloads) and save AU$1 off your monthly bill for each day it\u2019s active.\nWe can see this being particularly useful if you\u2019re going to be away from home for an extended period of time, say, when you go on holiday. There's no limit on how long you can keep Hibernate active for, so if you go away for a month, for example, you could save up to AU$31.\nBoth Warp Speed and Hibernate can be activated and deactivated directly in the the Exetel app, which is available for iPhone or Android.\nFriends with benefits\nAnother new feature being introduced with the Exetel One NBN plan is a friend-referral program. It\u2019s not a new concept, but it is the first time Exetel has adopted one. Through this, if you refer a friend to Exetel \u2013 and that friend signs up for NBN \u2013 you\u2019ll both receive AU$1 off your plan each month for as long as you both remain connected.\nThere\u2019s no limit to the number of people you can refer and, as it\u2019s stackable, you could theoretically get your Exetel service for free each month \u2013 though you'll obviously need to have a very large circle of friends.\nHow does Exetel compare to other NBN providers?\nWe keep a close eye on NBN retail service providers (RSPs) here at TechRadar, and use a combination of plan pricing and official recorded speed data from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) to identify which providers are most worth your time and money.\nExetel has been at the top of the list on many metrics for some time now, as it\u2019s long offered competitive pricing and regularly overdelivers when it comes to typical evening download speeds.\nIn fact, in the ACCC\u2019s most recent Measuring Broadband report, published in June 2025, Exetel was found to achieve 104.5% of plan download speeds during all hours of the day and an impressive 103.7% during the busier evening hours. Only Telstra, the country\u2019s largest (and most expensive) provider, was found to deliver faster speeds, and even then, only by a small margin of less than 1%.\nBased on its performance with other plans and what Exetel's claiming on itself, we\u2019d expect this new NBN 500 tier to achieve its theoretical maximum 500Mbps download speeds in many circumstances \u2013 although we\u2019ll need to wait for the ACCC to weigh in (which usually takes at least several months) to have confirmation.\nNext steps\nNBN Co has big hopes for the NBN 500 tier generally, and even though we don\u2019t have any direct competitors to judge it against, the Exetel One plan does present itself as a good option for most homes, promising high-speed downloads for a price that\u2019s cheaper than many NBN 50 and NBN 100 options.\nIf you want to sign up, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have a FTTP of HFC connection at your premises \u2013 to confirm either way, simply head to the Exetel website to check your address and sign up. The telco has confirmed that, for now at least, you won't be able to activate the free fibre upgrade to take advantage of this plan.\nAnd if you\u2019re already an Exetel customer with an FTTP or HFC connection, you can easily migrate over to the new One plan via the Exetel app.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "NBN speed upgrades: launch date, new tiers, eligibility and everything else we know about the September 2025 changes\nGet high-speed ready with our in-depth guide to the changes coming to the NBN network\nYou may have seen our recent articles regarding the upcoming September 2025 NBN speed upgrades, which are set to affect fast NBN plans from 100Mbps up. If you haven\u2019t, and you\u2019re landing on this page for the first time, then here\u2019s a quick rundown.\nWhat are the NBN speed upgrades?\nIn short, NBN Co is introducing a new speed tier known as NBN 2000, which will offer up to 2Gbps download speeds \u2013 double that of the current fastest gigabit NBN 1000 tier.\nAlongside this new tier, NBN Co has also announced some speed upgrades to a selection of the current NBN tiers:\n- NBN 100 plans will see a 5x speed upgrade and become NBN 500, with a maximum download speed of 500Mbps\n- NBN 250 plans will get a 3x speed boost and become NBN 750, with a maximum download speed of 750Mbps\n- NBN 1000 plans will be upgraded to a minimum guaranteed speed of 750Mbps, but still max out at 1,000Mbps. They\u2019ll also receive a bump in upload speed, from 50Mbps to 100Mbps. We imagine they\u2019ll still be referred to as NBN 1000.\nWhen are the NBN speed upgrades happening?\nNBN Co has penned 14 September, 2025 as the date the upgrades will be made available to retail service providers (RSPs) at a wholesale level. We don\u2019t yet have confirmation as to when they\u2019ll be rolled out to customers, which is up to the RSPs to decide.\nSome providers will almost certainly throw the switches on (or shortly after) that 14 September date, however others may take longer. We\u2019d expect that, in most cases, there\u2019ll be a gradual rollout that occurs over September and October 2025.\nWho can access these NBN speed upgrades?\nBecause of the higher speeds involved, these speed upgrades will only be available to households and businesses that connect to the NBN via either a fibre to the premises (FTTP), or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection type.\nCurrently, NBN 250 and NBN 1000 plans already require these types of connection, however NBN 100 plans are available to virtually everyone who connects to the fixed-line NBN network. Therefore, only customers with an NBN 100 plan and who connect via FTTP or HFC will be eligible to receive the speed boost to 500Mbps.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHow can I get the NBN speed upgrade?\nIf you already connect via FTTP or HFC and you\u2019re signed up to an NBN 100 plan or higher, then in theory, you may not need to do anything, as we expect many RSPs will automatically push the speed increases out to you once they\u2019ve done any required back end tinkering. You may also need a new modem-router to achieve the new maximum speeds of your plan, which we\u2019ve detailed a little more below.\nIf you want to upgrade to the brand new NBN 2000 tier, however, then you\u2019ll need to sign up for a plan via an NBN provider when these become available. Most customers signing up for NBN 2000 will also require a new network termination device (NTD), which requires a technician to visit your premises to install and will be arranged after ordering the plan from your selected RSP.\nIf you currently connect via a fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC) connection, then you will need to have the equipment upgraded to FTTP to access any of these upgraded speeds. Many FTTN and FTTC connections can access this upgrade for free thanks to NBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program, as long as you live in an eligible suburb.\nThe majority of suburbs in Australia where a fixed-line NBN connection is available should now be eligible, and NBN Co has previously stated it intends to make the program available to 10 million households by the end of 2025.\nIf you don\u2019t know what connection type is at your address, you can use the NBN\u2019s free address checker to find out.\nIf you\u2019re already signed up for an NBN 100 plan, come 14 September you may be able to ask your provider to activate the upgrade for you. If you\u2019re signed up to a slower plan \u2013 NBN 50 or lower \u2013 then you\u2019ll need to switch tor at least an NBN 100 plan in order to receive the free FTTP upgrade.\nHow much will the upgraded NBN plans cost?\nIn theory, for those on NBN 100, 250 and 1000 plans, the improvements shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly fee, or if there is a price rise it should only be minimal.\nNBN Co has instituted new wholesale costs for its current plan line up as of 1 July 2025, which will likely see small increases across the board prior to the speed upgrade rollout. However, NBN Co has stated it won\u2019t be charging RSPs a higher wholesale cost when the upgraded speeds come into effect \u2013 so, for example, the wholesale cost of an NBN 500 plan will be the same as an NBN 100 plan.\nThere\u2019s one key unknown when it comes to costs, however, and that\u2019s to do with a part of accessing the internet that\u2019s out of NBN Co\u2019s hands \u2013 international bandwidth. Because the National Broadband Network infrastructure only operates within Australia, it\u2019s up to each provider to organise its own international connections.\nThese are required to reach any sites or services that do not have servers located in Australia. While many major brands and platforms (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft and PlayStation) do have Australian servers, there are some notable exceptions \u2013 TikTok being a key one \u2013 and traffic to these does theoretically come at an additional cost to RSPs.\nSo, while we would love to say categorically that the faster plans won\u2019t cost more from September, RSPs do have costs beyond the wholesale fees NBN Co charges. In particular, if providers believe the increased speeds will strain their current capacity to serve international traffic \u2013 and they\u2019ll therefore need to purchase more bandwidth to cope \u2013 they may pass on a small increase to customers\u2019 monthly fees.\nWill my current modem-router still work with the new speeds?\nThe main recommendation we can make regarding the upcoming speed boosts is, if you do get them, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a suitable Wi-Fi router at home that can support the faster speeds.\nMore specifically, we mean you should arm yourself with at least a Wi-Fi 6 modem, or to futureproof yourself even more, Wi-Fi 7. Both of these Wi-Fi technologies are able to support greater overall bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi 5 routers, and much faster download speeds than Wi-Fi 4 routers. It should be stressed that an older Wi-Fi 4 router will likely struggle to provide the full bandwidth of an NBN 500 plan, so if you\u2019re using an aging router on this plan, consider upgrading it.\nA Wi-Fi 5 router is theoretically fast enough for up to an NBN 1000 plan in a perfect environment, but few of us live in one. So, to compensate for potential interference (like walls or other nearby routers) and the natural drop in speed that happens as you get further away from your router, it\u2019s wise to upgrade to a model that will provide significantly more overall bandwidth than your NBN connection itself offers.\nConsidering more and more connected devices now integrate at least Wi-Fi 6, opting for a router that can match them is a good place to start.\nWhat NBN plan should I get before the upgrades?\nIf all this talk about NBN speed upgrades has you giddy with excitement, but you're not yet on an eligible plan to take advantage of them \u2013 or if you simply want to get faster internet today \u2013 we've got some excellent recommendations for you below, including some NBN 500 and NBN 750 plans that are already live.\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nExetel was one of the first to market with an NBN 500 plan and, on paper at least, it's a doozy. You're promised the full 500Mbps during the busier evening hours, along with some added perks such as boosting the speed and dropping the cost a little when you're away from home. It's also highly affordable, costing less than some plans that are 20x slower!\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nSpintel | 750Mbps | AU$80p/m (first 6 months, then AU$90.95p/m)\nSpintel's NBN 750 plan used to be its gigabit plan, but considering the fact it maxes out at 750Mbps, we're now calling moving it down a category. It's remarkable value, costing the same as the slightly slower Exetel plan above for the first 6 months. The ongoing cost is still competitively priced, undercutting slightly faster NBN 1000 plans.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,025.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,091.40 ongoing yearly cost\nSuperloop | 860Mbps TES | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109p/m)\nPromising some of the fastest speeds right now in Australia, this Superloop NBN 1000 has been a favourite of ours for some time. And the good news is, a previous EOFY deal is still live, making it especially affordable, with AU$144 in total savings over the first half-year. While the 860Mbps typical evening speed claim is already higher than the promised upgrade in September, there's a chance you'll be able to achieve closer to gigabit speeds in just a few months time.\n\u2022 Total minimum cost: AU$85\n\u2022 First year cost: AU$1,164\n\u2022 Ongoing yearly cost: AU$1,308\n\u2022 View more of the best NBN 1000 plans\nYou might also like\n- View our current pick of the best NBN plans\n- Find out who we rate as the best NBN provider\n- Check out the best NBN 100 plans in line for the speed upgrade\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

Google Nest Wifi Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Nest Wifi Pro is the most recent iteration of the company\u2019s popular mesh Wi-Fi system, replacing the Nest Wifi. So, what does the \u2018Pro\u2019 take on Google\u2019s formula do differently? Well, the most obvious upgrade is support for Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E has been brought in, beefing up performance (compared to Wi-Fi 5 with the previous Nest Wifi).\nOn top of that, the Nest Wifi Pro boasts tri-band Wi-Fi as an upgrade over dual-band, offering not just 2.4GHz and 5GHz, but also a 6GHz band, delivering better coverage as well as faster speeds.\nOther than a slightly tweaked design \u2013 these remain smart-looking devices that\u2019ll fit unobtrusively into your home \u2013 the mesh router units are much the same otherwise, except that they\u2019re now standalone devices. This means each unit is identical and has a pair of Ethernet ports \u2013 whereas previously, the satellites didn\u2019t. However, on the other hand, something has been dropped \u2013 namely the integrated smart speaker functionality that the Nest Wifi had onboard.\nMind you, not everyone will miss that feature, and the better news is that smart home fiends are well-catered for here given the support for Matter which Google has introduced with the Pro version.\nOkay, so the Nest Wifi Pro has notched up the pricing somewhat on the Nest Wifi, but overall it does a sterling job of giving you a better level of mesh Wi-Fi coverage, and more grunt on the performance front too, which is always welcome. And, if you\u2019re tired of the color white, this also comes in Linen, Fog and Lemongrass colors. As far as the best mesh Wi-Fi routers go, this Google system is still the one to beat.\nThe best budget mesh Wi-Fi system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to spread Wi-Fi throughout your home without having to spend a lot of dough, then look into the TP-Link Deco M5. It\u2019s not as speedy as some of the other best mesh Wi-Fi system on this list. This system is focused more on coverage than high-throughput. However, it did improve our throughput significantly during testing.\nPlus, if you\u2019re not too concerned about getting the maximum theoretical throughput, which you probably won\u2019t be able to take full advantage of anyway, this shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. Setup, similar to the other devices here, is a breeze, even if you\u2019re not tech-savvy. The TP-Link Deco M5 is among the best wireless mesh routers for those who don\u2019t want to get too technical. And, as it is much cheaper than the rest of the options here, it's also the best mesh Wi-Fi system for budget-minded households.\nRead our full TP-Link Deco M5 review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system with 6E\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade your mesh router, chances are you care about one thing above all others: performance. Here, the Linksys Velop Pro 6E is an excellent option. In our testing, it provided consistent 150Mbps download speeds, even when we placed it 30 feet away and behind three partition walls. In fact, it\u2019s capable of hitting speeds of up to 5.4Gbps, making it a seriously speedy router for your home setup. It can easily cover your entire house or office if required, making it ideal for when you really need that stable connection.\nIt's something of a \u201cno frills\u201d mesh system, and it lacks some of the high-end features provided by some of its rivals. Yet it\u2019s not totally devoid of additional utility. Each Velop router can handle up to 200 connected devices, for example, making it perfect for homes with hordes of internet-enabled devices. It\u2019s also competitively priced among other mesh routers, so if all you need is rock-solid performance, it\u2019s an attractive option.\nRead our full Linksys Velop Pro 6E review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus ZenWiFi AX (XT8) is a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router, and while it's among the more expensive options out there, and limits you to two router units, this Asus system offers blazing fast speeds as well as plenty of flexibility in its setup \u2013 such as the option to set up one or two networks using the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.\nDuring our tests, it manage to push our 50Mbps internet connection all the way, even squeezing it up to 60Mbps at one point. It also held download speeds steady at 7.3MB/s even on the slower 2.4GHz band in an area in our space with previously low connectivity issues.\nSetup isn't quite as straightforward. However, with excellent security features to boot, this is a fantastic choice if you\u2019re looking at the best mesh Wi-Fi systems.\nRead our full Asus ZenWiFi AX (XT8) review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system for homes\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEero has always been excellent at releasing affordable, reliable routers, and the latest addition to its line, the Eero 6+ doesn\u2019t fall far from the best value tree. It\u2019s competitively-priced and an improvement over its predecessor with its fast and reliable coverage that\u2019s good enough for larger homes.\nDespite sticking with dual-band Wi-Fi 6, it\u2019s almost twice as fast as its predecessor with its 3.0Gbps top speed. It, of course, performs beautifully in practice, reaching the maximum speed supported by our office broadband connection on Ookla and Steam during testing. Included in the price are new features, such as some additional Ethernet ports, support for the latest smart-home technologies, and support for Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 and the new low-power wireless technology called Thread.\nSadly, parental controls require a paid subscription and the Eero app feels a little limited in functionality. But, you\u2019re getting a lot of value for your money here.\nRead our full Eero 6+ review\nThe best value mesh Wi-Fi with easy setup\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Linksys Velop WiFi 6 AX4200 is proof that Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems can be affordable and accessible. It gives big households on a budget an excellent option that still delivers admirable performance and ease of use.\nIf you want to improve your home network\u2019s speed and connectivity, this state of the art mesh system is an ideal solution. During our tests, it smoothly handed the Wi-Fi signal over to the second node that we placed closer to a harder-to-reach area in our space while maintaining the same speeds seamlessly.\nThose who aren\u2019t as computer savvy will also appreciate that easy-to-use Linksys app. It explains everything from connecting to your existing broadband router in order to use its Internet connection to where to place any additional nodes in order to get the best Wi-Fi reception.\nRead our full Linksys Velop WiFi 6 AX4200 review\nThe best 6E mesh Wi-Fi for large spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLarger homes and offices need a much more robust mesh system like the Asus ZenWiFi Pro ET12. This Wi-Fi 6E mesh system might be a bit of an overkill for most users, but there are still many that will benefit from the level of performance and range it brings \u2013 particularly those that have massive spaces and high network demands to cover.\nWith it, you're getting a top speed of 11Gbps as well as a 6,000-square-foot range (if you get the router and a node set). It delivers in practice as well. During our testing of the two-pack set, the first ET12 gave us the maximum speeds provided by our office broadband service and the second unit allowed us to maintain those speeds, even in the hard-to-reach areas.\nRead our full Asus ZenWiFi Pro ET12 review\nThe best value mesh Wi-Fi for large homes\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus ZenWifi XT9 may be an expensive proposition for smaller homes and budget users, but those who have larger areas to cover and a much busier network, this tri-band Wi-Fi 6 router is a wise investment. Its impressive range and strong performance should see larger homes through their bigger demands.\nThe 7.8Gbps speed will meet the demands of most of the bigger households, and its 2.5Gbps Ethernet is just as future-proof. We were able to get smooth, steady speeds of 150Mbps and 19Mb/s for Ookla and Steam, even on the slower 2.4GHz band, during testing. And, that's in an area where our regular router typically struggles to deliver.\nAs a bonus, it comes with free parental controls - something many of its rivals actually charge a monthly subscription for. That makes it an even great value for families with kids.\nTo save money on Asus products, check out our Asus promo codes.\nRead our full Asus ZenWifi XT9 review\nThe best Powerline mesh Wi-Fi system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Magic 2 WiFi 6 Mesh absolutely smashes through thick walls and massive obstructions by using Powerline technology to break through those obstacles. This mesh Powerline system allows you to enjoy robust and uninterrupted connectivity throughout your space even when you're dealing with an older space that regular mesh Wi-Fi routers cannot handle.\nOf course, if you\u2019ve got a large house or building with a number of rooms to cover, that mesh technology via plug-in adapters also ensures that there aren\u2019t any dead zones or weak areas.\nPerformance-wise, it slays as well. It had no trouble cruising along at 110Mbps and delivering a rock-steady 12.5MB/s for Steam downloads. Its Wi-Fi speeds are relatively modest, but it\u2019s more than enough for what most general users and households need. And, if you require an even more solid and faster connection, two Ethernet ports per device are on hand.\nRead our full Devolo Magic 2 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh review\nThe best mesh system for Wi-Fi 7\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWi-Fi 7 can provide a significant boost to your home Wi-Fi, but most routers offering this connectivity cost a pretty penny. While we wouldn\u2019t call the Netgear Orbi 770 \u201ccheap,\u201d it\u2019s still reasonably priced considering all of the fantastic features you get (especially compared to Netgear\u2019s other very expensive routers).\nIt boasts performance that should eliminate Wi-Fi dead spots in all but the most expansive of homes. Our testing saw it eat up a pesky dead spot that has tripped up other routers in the past, blasting the full 150Mbps our broadband provided to all corners of the home. And with its ability to hit speeds of almost 11Gbps, it should be more than enough for any home user (and a fair few businesses, too).\nThe Netgear Orbi 770 supports some useful extras, too, including the ability to set up a dedicated internet of things (IoT) network for your smart home accessories, keeping your regular network free for everything else. And it features multi-link operation too, which lets it combine the 5.0GHz and 6.0GHz bands together in order to improve performance (provided your devices support Wi-Fi 7). That all makes it a premium mesh router system that should last for years to come.\nRead our full Netgear Orbi 770 review\nHow to choose the best mesh Wi-Fi system for you\nWhen choosing the best mesh Wi-Fi system for you, there are a few important considerations starting with the size of your coverage area and the speed you require depending on your daily average needs and the amount of devices that regularly use your network. Based on that, you need to take a look at the mesh Wi-Fi system's range and performance.\nAlso take a look at the design, setup process, and ease-of-use for when you need to adjust settings during use. Other features like security protocols and parental controls are important as well, and gaming-focused extra if there are gamers in the family.\nOf course, the price is a major factor. Remember that many of the best mesh Wi-Fi routers tend to be expensive. However, you will find more affordable options if you know where to look.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat does mesh Wi-Fi do?\nIn simple terms, a mesh setup combines a main Wi-Fi router with several additional satellites. These act as separate hubs that beam Wi-Fi signal around your home. This means that instead of relying on a single router that must reach every corner of your house, you have a team of routers, each responsible for a different area.\nAs you move around your home, your connected devices will automatically connect to whichever mesh satellite is providing the strongest signal. In many cases, these satellites all appear as a single network, making it simple to connect to the mesh system without having to manually select the strongest signal. It also means that you don\u2019t have a host of devices clogging up a single router, and this can help to improve your connection strength and speed.\nGenerally speaking, mesh Wi-Fi systems are overkill for small homes and apartments, where a regular router should be enough to cover every corner. But if you have a large home or business \u2013 or frequently suffer from Wi-Fi dead spots that lack proper internet signal \u2013 one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems can be an excellent solution.\nWhat is the best mesh Wi-Fi brand?\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi systems include several different brands, each with its own particular strengths, and the best brand for you will depend on your specific needs. For instance, Google and Netgear provide rock-solid connectivity and are ideal for whole-home coverage or for small business use.\nIf gaming is your jam, brands such as Asus deliver the best mesh Wi-Fi systems, as they are specifically designed with online gaming in mind. For beefed-up security, brands like TP-Link, Netgear, and Asus all offer robust solutions to safeguard you and your data.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than a traditional router?\nThe short answer is yes if you happen to live in a larger home, as a mesh Wi-Fi system is better at covering a large area than a traditional router.\nIf your home has large square footage or is built on several stories, a mesh system can help keep coverage constant and reliable across the whole space.\nHowever, gaming-heavy households may prefer to install one of the best gaming routers instead, as these supply speeds that most mesh Wi-Fi systems aren\u2019t capable of delivering. And if you're in a smaller apartment or office, then a regular router should be more than enough coverage, and a mesh Wi-Fi system will not give you much benefit, if any, for the extra expense.\nHow we test mesh Wi-Fi systems\nWe test every mesh Wi-Fi router that lands on our desk before we can recommend it to you. Much like with any peripheral or device we test, we check everything from its design and features to its performance.\nWe take a look at its design, of course, because if you\u2019re going to have several routers spread around your space, they should blend in with your home or office aesthetics. We also check its ports and any extra features it might have \u2013 like the ability to create a guest network and set up family controls \u2013 as well as ease of initial setup and use.\nThen we move on to its performance. We check its range and strength of coverage as well as perform the Ookla speed test and our file download test, jotting down any information we collect. Naturally, we also test it against our everyday network usage to give you a glimpse on its real-world performance.\nWe then take everything we\u2019ve learned and measure all that against its price tag to see if it\u2019s a great value to consumers.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff Writer who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well as reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and trends.

      "text": "No Starlink, thanks: NBN Co is teaming up with Amazon for future satellite internet services\nProject Kuiper has been chosen to spearhead the country's rural internet efforts\n- NBN Co has announced a partnership with Amazon Project Kuiper\n- Launching in mid-2026, it promises to bring faster satellite internet to rural Australia\n- It will initially launching in Tasmania before moving north through the country\nAs we edge ever closer to the impending NBN speed upgrades across the fixed-line network, NBN Co has today (August 5) announced a partnership with Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper satellite internet service, to improve connectivity for Australians in rural, regional and remote areas.\nThis would be an upgrade to the current Sky Muster service offered by NBN Co to rural and regional Australia which, at present, has about 307,000 premises within its geostationary footprint.\nThe satellites currently in use are nearing their end-of-life period, although NBN Co says there's plenty of time to ensure smooth transition for its Sky Muster customers.\nRead on to find out more.\nWhat is Project Kuiper?\nAmazon began research and development for Project Kuiper some seven years ago, back in 2018. The first two prototype satellites were launched in October 2023, and a full-scale deployment kicked off in April 2025 with 27 production satellites. The Project Kuiper internet service will eventually see roughly 3,200 low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites deployed at a height of around 600km.\nNBN Co has said early signs show great promise and has earmarked mid-2026 as when satellite internet plans (aka Sky Muster) will become available to customers, starting with Tasmania.\nIt\u2019s expected that, following a launch in the southern areas of the country, a further rollout will take place moving north over a period of weeks to months.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWho can get Project Kuiper?\nThe Project Kuiper satellite internet service will be available to all current Sky Muster and Sky Muster Plus customers, along with anyone in the current geostationary satellite footprint \u2013 approximately 300,000 homes \u2013 all of whom will either eventually migrate over to the new service, or be offered the chance to sign up.\nIt won\u2019t be an immediate change, as NBN Co says its two Sky Muster satellites will remain in operation until \u201capproximately 2032\u201d to help make the transition as smooth as possible.\nFollowing today\u2019s announcement, NBN Co will begin further conversations with Project Kuiper and retail service providers (RSPs) to determine pricing and the speeds customers can expect.\nHow fast is Project Kuiper?\nWhile exact speeds have yet to be determined, NBN Co says customers serviced by satellite internet can expect \u201ccity quality broadband\u201d. Sky Muster services currently max out at 100Mbps, and Project Kuiper claims its service can achieve up to 400Mbps download speeds for residential customers, or up to 1Gbps for enterprise customers.\nAnything else?\nOf the partnership, NBN Co CEO Ellie Sweeney said, \"LEO satellite broadband, supplied by NBN Co and powered by Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, will be a major leap forward for customers in parts of regional, rural and remote Australia.\n\u201cAustralians deserve to have access to fast, effective broadband regardless of whether they live in a major city, on the outskirts of a country town or miles from their nearest neighbour\u2026 By upgrading to next generation LEO satellite broadband powered by Project Kuiper, we are working to bring the best available technology to Aussies in the bush.\"\nYou might also like\n- In the wrong place?

      "text": "Best NBN 500 plans: jump the queue with these expert-rated picks\nCould an incoming speed increase make this the perfect NBN plan?\nBuckle up, folks \u2013 we\u2019re now less than a month away from one of the biggest shake-ups to the NBN in years, which will see the introduction of all-new NBN 500 plans.\nThe new tier is set to officially arrive in September as a speed upgrade to the current NBN 100 plans, and as the name suggests, should offer theoretical maximum download speeds of 500Mbps. The better news is that eligible customers currently signed up to an NBN 100 plan should receive the upgrade for free.\nThere are some caveats, however. Firstly, in order to sign up for an NBN 500 plan, you'll need to connect to the fixed-line NBN network via a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection, as only these two utilise the necessary technology to support the faster speeds. Now would be a great time to check to see if you're eligible for the free NBN fibre upgrade.\nSecondly, while we say current NBN 100 customers should receive the upgrade for free (those with the aforementioned connection type) we have seen some providers, such as Spintel, offering an NBN 500 plan for less than its 100Mbps option, so you may find switching to a different plan is the best course of action. We expect most providers will continue to offer 100Mbps plans for customers without the required connection type.\nWhile NBN 500 plans don't officially launch until September, some providers have dropped their plans early, and we've compared them all below.\nBest NBN 500 plans\nBest overall\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nWe rate Exetel's NBN 500 plan as the best option for anyone wanting to experience the faster speeds right now. The telco has scrapped all other plan options, leaving just the single plan you see here. In doing so, it's enabled Exetel to be incredibly competitively priced. Promising download speeds of up to 500Mbps (even during the busier evening hours) and speedy uploads of up to 50Mbps, it offers homes a great balance of speed and price. Whether you want to stream to multiple devices without interruption or download large game files, the Exetel One plan is one to consider.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nCheapest first-year cost\nTangerine Speedy Max | 700Mbps TES until 14/09/25 | AU$68.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$88.90p/m)\nTangerine's plan is an interesting proposition, with a couple of things to note. Firstly, it's technically a gigabit plan at the moment, but will migrate to an NBN 500 plan on September 15th. Until then, you're promised 700Mbps typical evening speeds, making this is a great one to take advantage of. Fast speeds for a low introductory cost makes for great value in our opinion.\n\u2022 AU$68.90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$946.80 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,066.80 ongoing yearly cost\nFan-favourite provider\nSpintel Home Turbo | 500Mbps | AU$74p/m (first 6 months, then AU$84.95p/m)\nSpintel's NBN 500 plan is an equally compelling option, claiming maximum download speeds during the busier evening hours, and an attractive introductory cost. The first year cost is slightly less than the Exetel plan above, but the ongoing cost will set you back around AU$60 more. There aren't any extra features with Spintel's option either, so you'll want to weigh up what's most important to you before signing up.\n\u2022 AU$74 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$953.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,019.60 ongoing yearly cost\nNBN 500 FAQ\nHow fast will NBN 500 plans be?\nAs is the case with all speed tier naming conventions, NBN 500 plans will offer a theoretical maximum download speed of 500Mbps \u2013 five times the current maximum of the NBN 100 plans they\u2019ll replace. Upload speeds will also increase from the current maximum of 20Mbps to 50Mbps.\nIndeed, both Exetel and Spintel claim 500Mbps typical evening speeds on their respective plans, which, considering some providers of slower plans don't even promise maximum speeds, is exceptional.\nAs with all fixed-line NBN speeds over 100Mbps, NBN 500 plans will only be available to customers who connect to the network via a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection. If you currently connect via fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC), then you won\u2019t have the technology to support the faster speeds.\nIf you\u2019re not sure what connection type you have at home, you can use NBN Co\u2019s address checker. If you find you do connect via either of the inferior technologies (FTTN/C), then you may be eligible for NBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program, which provides a full fibre FTTP installation at your address.\nIf your home isn\u2019t currently in an eligible upgrade location, or you choose not to upgrade, then following the introduction of the new tiers, you\u2019ll likely still see NBN 100 as your fastest possible option and not NBN 500. If you can take advantage of the upgrade as soon as possible, you\u2019ll be in the best position come September when the increased speeds take effect.\nHow much will NBN 500 plans cost?\nAside from the major speed increase, the best part of the proposed speed upgrade is that it should, in theory, not cost you extra each month.\nWe say \u2018in theory\u2019 because, while NBN Co has said the extra speed benefits will be made available at no additional wholesale cost, RSPs will still be free to price them as they see fit.\nAs you can see from the plans above, however, they represent exceptional value. Consider the fact all three cost less than some NBN 25 plans that are 20x slower (looking at you, Telstra) and an NBN 500 plan makes for a compelling option.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes peeled for any new NBN 500 plans as soon as they hit the market, so we can then formulate a more concrete idea of which offer the best value.\nShould I get an NBN 500 plan?\nIn some ways, this is a tricky question to answer. If you\u2019re already signed up to an NBN 100 plan and you connect via FTTP or HFC, then in theory you\u2019ll automatically be moved over to an NBN 500 plan at no extra cost.\nHowever, there\u2019s a strong case to be made for everyone else \u2013 even those who are signed up to one of the best NBN 1000 plans \u2013 to switch to a NBN 500 plan once they\u2019ve launched. This is because we believe the combination of fast speeds (500Mbps should service the majority of Australian homes more than adequately) and the great value already offered by NBN 100 plans (which generally cost less than AU$10 p/m more than slower NBN 50 plans), makes for a potent combination.\nWe\u2019d even go as far as saying we reckon they could become the most popular NBN plan of them all \u2013 a position currently held by NBN 50 plans, which make up around two-thirds of fixed-line NBN subscriptions at the time of writing.\nIf you\u2019re currently signed up to one of the best NBN 250 plans, then you will also receive a speed increase to a 750Mbps NBN 750 plan. If you think this might be a bit of overkill, then dropping down to an NBN 500 plan will likely save you some money \u2013 depending on the provider you choose, of course.\nOn the other hand, if you're happy to wait, this NBN 100 plan from Mate is also a great option, and it should see an upgrade to NBN 500 later this year.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

Then you're after Wi-Fi 7, and the Netgear Orbi 770 supplies it at a competitive price point.\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi systems 2024\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system overall\n1. Google Nest Wifi Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Nest Wifi Pro is the most recent iteration of the company\u2019s popular mesh Wi-Fi system, replacing the Nest Wifi. So, what does the \u2018Pro\u2019 take on Google\u2019s formula do differently? Well, the most obvious upgrade is support for Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E has been brought in, beefing up performance (compared to Wi-Fi 5 with the previous Nest Wifi).\nOn top of that, the Nest Wifi Pro boasts tri-band Wi-Fi as an upgrade over dual-band, offering not just 2.4GHz and 5GHz, but also a 6GHz band, delivering better coverage as well as faster speeds.\nOther than a slightly tweaked design \u2013 these remain smart-looking devices that\u2019ll fit unobtrusively into your home \u2013 the mesh router units are much the same otherwise, except that they\u2019re now standalone devices. This means each unit is identical and has a pair of Ethernet ports \u2013 whereas previously, the satellites didn\u2019t. However, on the other hand, something has been dropped \u2013 namely the integrated smart speaker functionality that the Nest Wifi had onboard.\nMind you, not everyone will miss that feature, and the better news is that smart home fiends are well-catered for here given the support for Matter which Google has introduced with the Pro version.\nOkay, so the Nest Wifi Pro has notched up the pricing somewhat on the Nest Wifi, but overall it does a sterling job of giving you a better level of mesh Wi-Fi coverage, and more grunt on the performance front too, which is always welcome. And, if you\u2019re tired of the color white, this also comes in Linen, Fog and Lemongrass colors. As far as the best mesh Wi-Fi routers go, this Google system is still the one to beat.\nThe best budget mesh Wi-Fi system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to spread Wi-Fi throughout your home without having to spend a lot of dough, then look into the TP-Link Deco M5. It\u2019s not as speedy as some of the other best mesh Wi-Fi system on this list. This system is focused more on coverage than high-throughput. However, it did improve our throughput significantly during testing.\nPlus, if you\u2019re not too concerned about getting the maximum theoretical throughput, which you probably won\u2019t be able to take full advantage of anyway, this shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue. Setup, similar to the other devices here, is a breeze, even if you\u2019re not tech-savvy. The TP-Link Deco M5 is among the best wireless mesh routers for those who don\u2019t want to get too technical. And, as it is much cheaper than the rest of the options here, it's also the best mesh Wi-Fi system for budget-minded households.\nRead our full TP-Link Deco M5 review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system with 6E\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade your mesh router, chances are you care about one thing above all others: performance. Here, the Linksys Velop Pro 6E is an excellent option. In our testing, it provided consistent 150Mbps download speeds, even when we placed it 30 feet away and behind three partition walls. In fact, it\u2019s capable of hitting speeds of up to 5.4Gbps, making it a seriously speedy router for your home setup. It can easily cover your entire house or office if required, making it ideal for when you really need that stable connection.\nIt's something of a \u201cno frills\u201d mesh system, and it lacks some of the high-end features provided by some of its rivals. Yet it\u2019s not totally devoid of additional utility. Each Velop router can handle up to 200 connected devices, for example, making it perfect for homes with hordes of internet-enabled devices. It\u2019s also competitively priced among other mesh routers, so if all you need is rock-solid performance, it\u2019s an attractive option.\nRead our full Linksys Velop Pro 6E review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus ZenWiFi AX (XT8) is a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router, and while it's among the more expensive options out there, and limits you to two router units, this Asus system offers blazing fast speeds as well as plenty of flexibility in its setup \u2013 such as the option to set up one or two networks using the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.\nDuring our tests, it manage to push our 50Mbps internet connection all the way, even squeezing it up to 60Mbps at one point. It also held download speeds steady at 7.3MB/s even on the slower 2.4GHz band in an area in our space with previously low connectivity issues.\nSetup isn't quite as straightforward. However, with excellent security features to boot, this is a fantastic choice if you\u2019re looking at the best mesh Wi-Fi systems.\nRead our full Asus ZenWiFi AX (XT8) review\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi system for homes\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEero has always been excellent at releasing affordable, reliable routers, and the latest addition to its line, the Eero 6+ doesn\u2019t fall far from the best value tree. It\u2019s competitively-priced and an improvement over its predecessor with its fast and reliable coverage that\u2019s good enough for larger homes.\nDespite sticking with dual-band Wi-Fi 6, it\u2019s almost twice as fast as its predecessor with its 3.0Gbps top speed. It, of course, performs beautifully in practice, reaching the maximum speed supported by our office broadband connection on Ookla and Steam during testing. Included in the price are new features, such as some additional Ethernet ports, support for the latest smart-home technologies, and support for Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0 and the new low-power wireless technology called Thread.\nSadly, parental controls require a paid subscription and the Eero app feels a little limited in functionality. But, you\u2019re getting a lot of value for your money here.\nRead our full Eero 6+ review\nThe best value mesh Wi-Fi with easy setup\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Linksys Velop WiFi 6 AX4200 is proof that Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems can be affordable and accessible. It gives big households on a budget an excellent option that still delivers admirable performance and ease of use.\nIf you want to improve your home network\u2019s speed and connectivity, this state of the art mesh system is an ideal solution. During our tests, it smoothly handed the Wi-Fi signal over to the second node that we placed closer to a harder-to-reach area in our space while maintaining the same speeds seamlessly.\nThose who aren\u2019t as computer savvy will also appreciate that easy-to-use Linksys app. It explains everything from connecting to your existing broadband router in order to use its Internet connection to where to place any additional nodes in order to get the best Wi-Fi reception.\nRead our full Linksys Velop WiFi 6 AX4200 review\nThe best 6E mesh Wi-Fi for large spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLarger homes and offices need a much more robust mesh system like the Asus ZenWiFi Pro ET12. This Wi-Fi 6E mesh system might be a bit of an overkill for most users, but there are still many that will benefit from the level of performance and range it brings \u2013 particularly those that have massive spaces and high network demands to cover.\nWith it, you're getting a top speed of 11Gbps as well as a 6,000-square-foot range (if you get the router and a node set). It delivers in practice as well. During our testing of the two-pack set, the first ET12 gave us the maximum speeds provided by our office broadband service and the second unit allowed us to maintain those speeds, even in the hard-to-reach areas.\nRead our full Asus ZenWiFi Pro ET12 review\nThe best value mesh Wi-Fi for large homes\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus ZenWifi XT9 may be an expensive proposition for smaller homes and budget users, but those who have larger areas to cover and a much busier network, this tri-band Wi-Fi 6 router is a wise investment. Its impressive range and strong performance should see larger homes through their bigger demands.\nThe 7.8Gbps speed will meet the demands of most of the bigger households, and its 2.5Gbps Ethernet is just as future-proof. We were able to get smooth, steady speeds of 150Mbps and 19Mb/s for Ookla and Steam, even on the slower 2.4GHz band, during testing. And, that's in an area where our regular router typically struggles to deliver.\nAs a bonus, it comes with free parental controls - something many of its rivals actually charge a monthly subscription for. That makes it an even great value for families with kids.\nTo save money on Asus products, check out our Asus promo codes.\nRead our full Asus ZenWifi XT9 review\nThe best Powerline mesh Wi-Fi system\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Magic 2 WiFi 6 Mesh absolutely smashes through thick walls and massive obstructions by using Powerline technology to break through those obstacles. This mesh Powerline system allows you to enjoy robust and uninterrupted connectivity throughout your space even when you're dealing with an older space that regular mesh Wi-Fi routers cannot handle.\nOf course, if you\u2019ve got a large house or building with a number of rooms to cover, that mesh technology via plug-in adapters also ensures that there aren\u2019t any dead zones or weak areas.\nPerformance-wise, it slays as well. It had no trouble cruising along at 110Mbps and delivering a rock-steady 12.5MB/s for Steam downloads. Its Wi-Fi speeds are relatively modest, but it\u2019s more than enough for what most general users and households need. And, if you require an even more solid and faster connection, two Ethernet ports per device are on hand.\nRead our full Devolo Magic 2 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh review\nThe best mesh system for Wi-Fi 7\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWi-Fi 7 can provide a significant boost to your home Wi-Fi, but most routers offering this connectivity cost a pretty penny. While we wouldn\u2019t call the Netgear Orbi 770 \u201ccheap,\u201d it\u2019s still reasonably priced considering all of the fantastic features you get (especially compared to Netgear\u2019s other very expensive routers).\nIt boasts performance that should eliminate Wi-Fi dead spots in all but the most expansive of homes. Our testing saw it eat up a pesky dead spot that has tripped up other routers in the past, blasting the full 150Mbps our broadband provided to all corners of the home. And with its ability to hit speeds of almost 11Gbps, it should be more than enough for any home user (and a fair few businesses, too).\nThe Netgear Orbi 770 supports some useful extras, too, including the ability to set up a dedicated internet of things (IoT) network for your smart home accessories, keeping your regular network free for everything else. And it features multi-link operation too, which lets it combine the 5.0GHz and 6.0GHz bands together in order to improve performance (provided your devices support Wi-Fi 7). That all makes it a premium mesh router system that should last for years to come.\nRead our full Netgear Orbi 770 review\nHow to choose the best mesh Wi-Fi system for you\nWhen choosing the best mesh Wi-Fi system for you, there are a few important considerations starting with the size of your coverage area and the speed you require depending on your daily average needs and the amount of devices that regularly use your network. Based on that, you need to take a look at the mesh Wi-Fi system's range and performance.\nAlso take a look at the design, setup process, and ease-of-use for when you need to adjust settings during use. Other features like security protocols and parental controls are important as well, and gaming-focused extra if there are gamers in the family.\nOf course, the price is a major factor. Remember that many of the best mesh Wi-Fi routers tend to be expensive. However, you will find more affordable options if you know where to look.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat does mesh Wi-Fi do?\nIn simple terms, a mesh setup combines a main Wi-Fi router with several additional satellites. These act as separate hubs that beam Wi-Fi signal around your home. This means that instead of relying on a single router that must reach every corner of your house, you have a team of routers, each responsible for a different area.\nAs you move around your home, your connected devices will automatically connect to whichever mesh satellite is providing the strongest signal. In many cases, these satellites all appear as a single network, making it simple to connect to the mesh system without having to manually select the strongest signal. It also means that you don\u2019t have a host of devices clogging up a single router, and this can help to improve your connection strength and speed.\nGenerally speaking, mesh Wi-Fi systems are overkill for small homes and apartments, where a regular router should be enough to cover every corner. But if you have a large home or business \u2013 or frequently suffer from Wi-Fi dead spots that lack proper internet signal \u2013 one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems can be an excellent solution.\nWhat is the best mesh Wi-Fi brand?\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi systems include several different brands, each with its own particular strengths, and the best brand for you will depend on your specific needs. For instance, Google and Netgear provide rock-solid connectivity and are ideal for whole-home coverage or for small business use.\nIf gaming is your jam, brands such as Asus deliver the best mesh Wi-Fi systems, as they are specifically designed with online gaming in mind. For beefed-up security, brands like TP-Link, Netgear, and Asus all offer robust solutions to safeguard you and your data.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than a traditional router?\nThe short answer is yes if you happen to live in a larger home, as a mesh Wi-Fi system is better at covering a large area than a traditional router.\nIf your home has large square footage or is built on several stories, a mesh system can help keep coverage constant and reliable across the whole space.\nHowever, gaming-heavy households may prefer to install one of the best gaming routers instead, as these supply speeds that most mesh Wi-Fi systems aren\u2019t capable of delivering. And if you're in a smaller apartment or office, then a regular router should be more than enough coverage, and a mesh Wi-Fi system will not give you much benefit, if any, for the extra expense.\nHow we test mesh Wi-Fi systems\nWe test every mesh Wi-Fi router that lands on our desk before we can recommend it to you. Much like with any peripheral or device we test, we check everything from its design and features to its performance.\nWe take a look at its design, of course, because if you\u2019re going to have several routers spread around your space, they should blend in with your home or office aesthetics. We also check its ports and any extra features it might have \u2013 like the ability to create a guest network and set up family controls \u2013 as well as ease of initial setup and use.\nThen we move on to its performance. We check its range and strength of coverage as well as perform the Ookla speed test and our file download test, jotting down any information we collect. Naturally, we also test it against our everyday network usage to give you a glimpse on its real-world performance.\nWe then take everything we\u2019ve learned and measure all that against its price tag to see if it\u2019s a great value to consumers.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff Writer who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well as reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and trends.
