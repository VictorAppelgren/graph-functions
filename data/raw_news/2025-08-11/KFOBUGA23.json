Custom patches are used for branding, promotions, uniforms, fashion, and personal expression. They can be sewn, ironed, or attached with Velcro to garments, bags, hats, or gear.\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Custom Patch?\nPurpose of Use\nDetermine where and how your patch will be used\u2014on products, apparel, promotional items, or work uniforms.\nDurability\nConsider how the patch will hold up to washing, weather, or physical use. Look for materials and backing options that are water-resistant and long-lasting.\nMaterial Type\nChoose based on your design and usage:\n- Embroidered patches for a classic raised texture\n- Sublimated patches for photo-like detail\n- Leather patches for a premium, rugged look\n- Woven patches for intricate detail with a smooth finish\nApplication Method:\nMatch the patch to your needs:\n- Iron-on patches for DIY use\n- Sew-on patches for durability\n- Velcro patches for flexibility and removability\n- Adhesive patches for short-term or event use\nCustom Patch Design Tips\nSimplicity Is Key\nOverly detailed or cluttered designs can be hard to read when reduced to patch size. Stick with clean shapes, bold lines, and limited text.\nColor Contrast:\nEnsure strong contrast between background and foreground elements for visibility. Avoid light-on-light or dark-on-dark combinations.\nAppropriate Sizing\nDesign your patch to fit the intended surface\u2014whether a jacket sleeve, cap front, or chest area.
