      "summary": "The White House announced plans to rename the Department of Defense back to the Department of War, a change championed by President Trump as a return to offensive military values. Trump said the renaming could occur within the next week or so, and White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly framed it as restoring historic military identity. The proposal would require congressional approval, but Trump expressed confidence that Congress would cooperate. The announcement follows a broader push for Pentagon reforms and a shift toward a more aggressive defense posture.",
