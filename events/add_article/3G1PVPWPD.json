      "summary": "YouTube Music celebrated its tenth anniversary by adding community comments to albums and playlists, taste‑matching playlists that update daily, and new badge and notification features that tie in with artist milestones and merch. Spotify already offers similar fan‑engagement tools, such as Blend playlists and an integrated merch hub, but YouTube Music’s rollout marks its first foray into direct fan interaction on the platform. Separately, Pornhub announced a beta launch of “Shorties,” a vertical short‑video format modeled on TikTok Reels, designed to boost mobile engagement but raising concerns about increased addiction and the platform’s potential for “gooning” behavior.",
