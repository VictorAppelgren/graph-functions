      "feedback": "The draft is too verbose and mixes explanatory theory with market‑level speculation that the source does not support. Trim it to a clear, fact‑based summary: state the key differences between winter and all‑season tires, explain Toyo’s walnut‑shell additive (hard, abrasive shells that improve traction without road damage), and note that Toyo uses leftover walnut shells, bakes them, and tests them before adding them to the Observe line. Remove the causal chain, market‑transmission discussion, long‑run fundamentals, and risk/catalyst analysis. Keep citations (XPGIRT4RH) for each factual claim. The resulting paragraph should be concise, factual, and free of unsupported speculation.",
