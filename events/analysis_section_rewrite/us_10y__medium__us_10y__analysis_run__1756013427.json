      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**  \n1. **Citations & Source IDs** – Every factual claim (e.g., “$215 m revenue, $30 m net income, 49 % gross margin, 23 % debt‑to‑equity, 37 % YoY earnings growth”) must be bracketed with the corresponding source ID (e.g., [SK994CBWR], [SK994CBWR‑Past], [SK994CBWR‑Financials]). Add inline citations for the UAS‑job growth figure (97 % rise, 1,400 jobs) and for the Fed‑rate‑cut optimism (source [SK994CBWR] or a separate Fed‑policy article).  \n2. **Quantify Upside/Downside** – Replace vague “will climb to the consensus target of $34.76” with a numeric range: e.g., “$34.76 (+14 %) within 4–6 mo if revenue hits the upper guidance, or $32.00 (‑6 %) if guidance is missed.” Include a 3‑month trailing P/E (≈ 12×) and a forward P/E (≈ 10×) to anchor valuation.  \n3. **Scenario Structure** – Add a concise table:  \n   - **Base**: 2025 revenue $950 m, N2 tech adoption 70 %, Fed cuts, no export‑control tightening → price $34.8.  \n   - **Bull**: 2025 revenue $1.0 bn, 90 % adoption, China self‑sufficiency boost → price $38.5.  \n   - **Bear**: 2025 revenue $850 m, 50 % adoption, new export controls → price $31.5.  \n   Specify trigger dates (e.g., Q3 earnings, Fed meeting in September, China policy change in Q4).  \n4. **Macro & Policy Integration** – Explicitly tie the UAS job growth to semiconductor demand: “97 % UAS‑job rise → 15 % projected lift in advanced‑node wafer demand (source [FOM34PUWA]), feeding ACMR’s product pipeline.” Add a brief note on the Fed’s projected rate path (e.g., “Fed likely to cut 25 bp in Q3, supporting chip spending”).  \n5. **Risk & Watch‑List Signals** – Create a bullet list:  \n   - Export‑control tightening (China, EU).  \n   - Fed rate hike (Sept 2025).  \n   - Supply‑chain bottlenecks (rare earths).  \n   - Competitor launches (e.g., new cleaning tech).  \n   - Earnings guidance revision.  \n   Each signal should have a “watch” date or threshold.  \n6. **Path‑Dependency & Timing** – Clarify that product ramp‑up is path‑dependent: “N2 bubbling tech must reach 70 % of sales by Q4 to sustain margin expansion.”  \n7. **Valuation & Flow Analysis** – Add a quick DCF snippet: “DCF‑based fair value $35.2 (10 % WACC, 5‑yr terminal growth 2 %)” and compare to current price $30.53.  \n8. **Remove Redundancy & Tighten Language** – Consolidate repeated points (e.g., “high gross margin” appears twice). Aim for ~250 words.  \n9. **Consistency with Section Focus** – Ensure all elements (macro, policy, flows, valuation, catalysts, timing) are explicitly linked to the 3–6‑month horizon.  \n10. **Citation Density** – Aim for at least one citation per paragraph; avoid generic statements without source IDs.  \n\nImplementing these edits will elevate the analysis to a world‑class, data‑driven, scenario‑rich forecast that meets the specified constraints.",
