      "summary": "Aris Mining announced a positive prefeasibility study for its 51%-owned Soto Norte Gold Project in Colombia, confirming a high‑quality, 22‑year mine with a 3,500 tpd mill and 750 tpd dedicated to local community processing. The study projects an after‑tax NPV of $2.7 billion, a 35.4% IRR, and a 2.3‑year payback, with life‑of‑mine cash costs of $345/oz and AISC of $534/oz. The project emphasizes low operating costs, strong by‑product credits from copper and silver, and industry‑leading environmental and social design, including no cyanide or mercury use, 96.5% water recycling, and a community engagement model. Environmental studies are underway, with an environmental license expected early 2026, positioning Soto Norte as one of the most attractive gold projects in the Americas.",
