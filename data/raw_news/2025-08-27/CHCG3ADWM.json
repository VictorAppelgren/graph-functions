  "title": "Ahead of the iPhone 17 Launch, Apple Clears Out AirPods 4 Stock to a New Record Low",
  "description": "If you don\u2019t like the in-ear style of the AirPods Pro, these AirPods 4 are the best choice for comfort and sound.",
  "content": "Apple won\u2019t be formally announcing the new iPhone 17 until September 9, but in the meantime, they\u2019re putting down some fantastic deals for Back to School. Anyone on the lookout for terrific sound devices will be able to get AirPods 4 without Active Noise Cancellation on sale for a record-low price of $89 at Amazon, down from their regular price of $129. For those that are fans of ANC, there\u2019s a new model AirPods 4 available for purchase at $139 instead of $179.\n\nSee AirPods 4 without ANC at Amazon\n\nSee AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon\n\nBehind it all is the H2 chip which is the same solid chip found in some of Apple\u2019s higher-end audio products which delivers reliable Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity and efficient battery life. One of the nice things that this chip helps with is Personalized Spatial Audio which gives you a 3D listening experience. It\u2019s basically surround sound tailored to your ears, all thanks to dynamic head tracking. So whenever you turn your head, the sound automatically changes.\n\nAudibly, these earbuds have a clean and well-balanced sound profile with added bass and slightly more refined highs compared to their ancestors. Even though the non-ANC model doesn\u2019t quite seal out ambient noise, it still offers very good sound quality for casual listening. ANC mode, on the other hand, specifically removes annoying background noise without having to resort to regular silicone ear tips. Transparency mode is also available so that some ambient noise can pass through so you don\u2019t have to remove the earbuds but are still able to hear what is happening around you.\n\nComfort and construction are clearly not an afterthought with the AirPods 4. They only weigh 4.3 grams per ear, so they practically become one with your ears, making them bearable for long listening sessions. The fit has also been tweaked to stay comfortable even during exercise or busy commutes. And they come with an IP54 rating, meaning they are resistant to dust, sweat, and water. This makes them excellent choices for rainy days or hardcore gym sessions without worrying about damage.\n\nBattery life is also another place where these AirPods is good at: You can have a maximum of 5 hours listening time from a single charge when you don\u2019t have ANC on and a little less than that, around 4 hours, when ANC is activated. The charging case extends it to a total of a maximum of 30 hours on the standard model and a maximum of 20 hours with ANC. It now charges via USB-C which is an improvement that translates to faster and more convenient charging and wireless charging is also compatible with the case.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been hesitating, now might be the perfect time to dive into the world of AirPods 4.\n\nSee AirPods 4 without ANC at Amazon\n\nSee AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon",

      "text": "The iPhone 17 is coming. The iPhone 17 is coming! Well, technically, four iPhone 17 devices are reportedly coming on Tuesday, Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT. That\u2019s when Apple will announce a family of new devices, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17\u2014phones that have been leaking out for the better part of the last year.\nApple sent the following invite to Gizmodo:\niPhone 17 event confirmed for Sept. 9. See ya there! pic.twitter.com/VTJOjYfZYE\n\u2014 Ray Wong (@raywongy) August 26, 2025\nThe invite reads \u201cAwe dropping,\u201d which sounds like a play on jaw dropping,\u201d hinting that Apple\u2019s new products will be very exciting. The invite also shows a hint of orange, which could be Apple teasing the rumored orange iPhone 17 Pro? Apple enthusiast Parker Ortolani also made some astute observations. \u201cIf you wanna try to read the tea leaves, infrared is used for non-invasive blood pressure and glucose monitoring\u2026.,\u201d Ortolani wrote on X. He also added, \u201cCool AIR appears as dark blue on infrared.\u201d Might Apple be alluding to the light blue iPhone 17 Air that leaked a few weeks ago?\nExpected Product Announcements\nApple\u2019s annual fall event, which will once again be held at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA, will also be where the company is expected to announce new Apple Watches (Series 11 and Ultra 3), new AirPods (Pro 3?), and a slew of new features for all of the new devices. If it\u2019s like past years, Tim Cook and pals should also give us release dates for when we can officially install the non-beta releases for Liquid Glass. That includes iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26.\nThere\u2019s gonna be a truckload of Apple announcements on Sept. 9. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to get even thicker with the biggest camera bump (housing a new 48-megapixel telephoto camera) that Apple has ever put into an iPhone. We may also see a new orange color for the iPhone 17 Pros. The iPhone 16 Plus will almost certainly die this year, and its replacement will likely be the \u201ciPhone 17 Air,\u201d a new, super-thin glass slab with a single camera and possibly reduced battery life due to its skinny frame.\nOn the accessories and wearables front, we\u2019re anticipating modest updates to the Apple Watch Series 10, maybe a bigger screen (but not a bigger case) for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and we could see live translations rolled out to AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with or without a new AirPods Pro 3 announcement.\nGizmodo Live Blog\nThe leaks have been steady, and many of them have come from reputable sources with solid track records. But you know what they say, nothing is official until it comes straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. So clear your calendar and maybe sell a kidney now (please don\u2019t do that!) cause Apple\u2019s fall gadget bonanza is only a few weeks away.\nThe only thing for certain that you can count on happening on Sept. 9 is a live blog. Just like we did with last week\u2019s \u201cMade by Google\u201d event for Pixel 10, Samsung\u2019s Unpacked for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and Apple\u2019s WWDC and Google\u2019s I/O developer conferences this past summer, we\u2019ll be live-blogging the Apple Event.\nApple will be streaming its event on its website at Apple.com and YouTube here, but I promise Gizmodo\u2019s live blog will be more entertaining. It\u2019s also the only place where I\u2019ll reveal the breakfast spread that Apple\u2019s gonna serve to the media. That\u2019s important stuff!"
