      "rationale": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a policy change that primarily affects tax credits and deductions for households. While it can influence consumer spending and savings behavior, it does not have immediate, high‑frequency market impact. Therefore it falls under the policy/structural category, warranting a low‑importance rating of 4."
