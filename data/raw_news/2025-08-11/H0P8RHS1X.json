  "title": "How to watch 'Jurassic World Rebirth': When is the delightful dino revival streaming?",
  "description": "Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and Mahershala Ali face off with dinosaurs \"too dangerous for the original park.\"",
  "content": "The Jurassic Park franchise roars on in 2025 with Jurassic World Rebirth \u2014 one of the most anticipated movies of the summer. Besides a new star-studded cast, we're most excited about the return of Jurassic Park's original screenwriter, David Koepp.\n\nDirected by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla, Rogue One), it stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as a group of people who should know better than to mess with dinosaurs so casually. Nevertheless, they seek out the beasts, and all chaos ensues.\n\nJurassic World Rebirth landed in theaters July 2, but if you missed it on the big screen, you can officially watch it at home. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is Jurassic World Rebirth about?\n\nSet five years after Jurassic World: Dominion, Rebirth follows an extraction crew (Johansson, Bailey, Ali, and Friend) on an expedition to the original research facility for Jurassic Park. Their mission? To procure DNA from the dinosaurs deemed \"too dangerous for the park\" for a medical advancement worth trillions.\n\nCheck out the official trailer below.\n\nThe last two Jurassic Park movies \u2014 Fallen Kingdom and Dominion \u2014 were loathed by critics, including Mashable's own, despite making over a billion dollars. So, the bar is set pretty low.\n\nFor what it's worth, though, Mashable film critic Kristy Puchko calls Jurassic World Rebirth \"the best of the new batch of movies.\"\n\n\"In the end, Jurassic World Rebirth is a rocky ride. Some bits are absolutely exhilarating, while others feel like a chore. But unlike the humans in this franchise, the humans of our world just cannot tire of these incredible beasts, happy to shell out ticket money to get as close as we might to their enormous majesty. And this film, including its hilariously calamitous opening with its requisite kill, will deliver, feeding both all our yearning for excitement and our need for escapism,\" she writes in her review, adding, \"It\u2019s not better than the original, but it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve come.\"\n\nLike most of the other Jurassic Park movies (aside from the original), it has a relatively low critic score overall on Rotten Tomatoes, with a solid 70+ audience score. Translation: People can't get enough of these on-screen beasts.\n\nCheck out our full review of Jurassic World Rebirth.\n\nHow to watch Jurassic World Rebirth at home\n\nThere are a couple of different ways you can watch Jurassic World Rebirth at home. You can buy it or rent it on digital for as low as $19.99, or you can stream it on Peacock at a later date. See the details below.\n\nBuy or rent it on digital\n\nJurassic World Rebirth is available as of Aug. 5 to buy or rent at digital-on-demand retailers. Just be aware that with rentals, you'll only get 30 days to watch the film and just 48 hours to finish it once you start. If you choose to buy it instead, then it's yours to keep with no watch limits.\n\nHere are some quick links to rent or purchase the film:\n\u2022 None Fandango at Home \u2014 buy for $29.99, rent for $19.99\n\nAs a Universal Pictures film, we know that Jurassic World Rebirth will eventually make its streaming debut on Peacock. The digital-to-streaming arc of other recent Universal films (Drop, Wicked, The Woman in the Yard) was between two and three months. So, while we don't know the exact streaming date yet, we expect Rebirth to make its Peacock debut sometime in late mid-to-late October. We'll keep you updated.\n\nDon't have a Peacock subscription? You can sign up for as low as $10.99 per month with ads or $16.99 per month without (thanks to a recent price hike). Before you get ahead of yourself, though, be sure to check out the best ways to save some money on a subscription below.\n\nBest Peacock deal: Save 17% on an annual subscription\n\nIf Peacock isn't running any sort of special, the best Peacock deal for most people on any given day is the annual subscription deal. You'll get 12 months of streaming for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront. While a monthly subscription with ads costs $10.99 per month (which adds up to $131.88), a yearly subscription will only run you $109.99 (which breaks down to about $9.17 per month). That's about 17% in total savings. For those who prefer watching without ads, you'll pay $169.99 per year (which breaks down to about $14.16 per month instead of $16.99).\n\nBest Peacock deal for Xfinity customers: free Peacock Premium for eligible accounts\n\nXfinity customers should check the eligibility details below before signing up for Peacock, as you might be able to score a subscription without paying a cent. Here's a breakdown of who is eligible to get Peacock for free through Xfinity. You can also head to Xfinity.com for more details.\n\u2022 None Xfinity Internet customers who are Diamond or Platinum Xfinity Rewards members can get Peacock Premium for free by redeeming a reward for it. Sign in at xfinity.com/rewards and choose Peacock as a reward. Then, wait for your email (it may take a few hours) with instructions on activating the offer.\n\u2022 None NOW TV customers can also receive Peacock Premium as part of their service.\n\u2022 None New customers with Xfinity Internet and an X1 TV Box, Flex streaming TV Box, or a Xumo Stream Box from Xfinity can get Peacock Premium for free for six months.\n\nBest Peacock deal for students: Save $8/month for one year\n\nStudents can shave $8 per month off a Peacock Premium subscription for an entire year \u2014 that's a total of $96 in savings. You'll need to verify your student status via SheerID and retrieve the unique promo code to knock the cost down to just $2.99 instead of $8.99. Just note that it can only be used once, and after the promo year is up, you'll be charged full price again.\n\nBest Peacock deal for first responders: Save $7/month\n\nFirst responders and medical professionals can secure a Peacock Premium subscription at a discounted rate of $3.99 per month by verifying their professional status via SheerID. Unlike the student deal, however, it's not limited to a year. If you continue to meet verification qualifications, you can renew your subscription at the discounted rate each year \u2014 although you may have to go through the verification process each time and receive a new promo code. Learn more about eligibility terms and requirements.\n\nBest for active military and veterans: Save $7/month\n\nActive duty U.S. military service members, Reservists, National Guard members, veterans, or U.S. military retirees can also get Peacock Premium for a discounted rate of $3.99 per month, so long as you can prove your military status using SheerID and continue to meet requirements. You may need to revalidate your status to renew the promotion each year.\n\nBest for teachers: Save $7/month for one year\n\nEducators who can verify their status on SheerID can also score Peacock Premium for just $3.99 per month instead of $10.99. However, the promotion is limited to a year. Once the promotional period ends, you'll be charged full price, so be sure to cancel before the year is up.\n\nBest for Instacart users: free Peacock Premium for Instacart+ subscribers\n\nYou'll unlock a free Peacock Premium subscription ($109.99 per year value) by signing up for Instacart+ ($99.99 per year). That's on top of free grocery delivery, lower fees, and credit back on eligible pickup orders. Oh, and here's a pro tip: If you're new to Instacart+, you'll get a free two-week trial to test the waters. That means you can watch Jurassic World Rebirth and plenty more for free if you wait until the streaming debut to sign up. Just be sure to cancel before you're charged.\n\nBest for Mastercard holders: Get up to $5 back per month\n\nIf you sign up for Peacock using an eligible World or World Elite Mastercard, you'll automatically receive a monthly statement credit of $3 for Peacock Premium or $5 for Peacock Premium Plus. That ultimately drops the price of the Premium tier back to $7.99 (its former price before the most recent price hike) and Premium Plus down to $11.99 per month. Learn more about eligibility requirements on the promotional page. The offer ends on Dec. 31, 2025.",

  "summary": "The Jurassic Park franchise is set to return in 2025 with the release of Jurassic World Rebirth, directed by Gareth Edwards and starring Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. The film follows an extraction crew on an expedition to the original research facility for Jurassic Park to obtain DNA from the dinosaurs deemed \"too dangerous for the park\" for a medical advancement worth trillions. While it has a relatively low critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, it is considered the best of the new batch of movies. As of Aug. 5, the film is available to buy or rent at digital-on-demand retailers. However, with rentals, there is only 30 days to watch the film once you start.",
  "shortSummary": "Jurassic World Rebirth, starring Scarlett Johansson and David Koepp, is streaming globally and can be bought or rented online, with specific dates set by Peacock.",

      "text": "David Koepp talks 'Stir of Echoes' legacy, and why he hasn't seen 'The Sixth Sense'\nStir of Echoes deserved better than it got. In 1999, the harrowing horror-thriller starring Kevin Bacon boasted a unique spin on the haunted house formula. Set in Chicago's South Side and centering on a blue-collared man with rock star ambitions who is plagued by ghostly visions, the film avoided well-worn tropes of fretful suburban housewives besieged by poltergeists.\nIts R-rating allowed writer/director David Koepp, best known for scripting the blockbuster Jurassic Park, to create a gritty film, fleshed out with jolting splashes of gore, a sweaty sex appeal, and a harrowing message about sexual politics at its core. But just five weeks before Stir of Echoes would hit theaters, The Sixth Sense debuted.\nKoepp's terrific movie earned good reviews and a modest box office, but it was overshadowed by The Sixth Sense, in part because both involve a psychic boy who can see dead people. However, this superficial commonality ignores all the ways Stir of Echoes is extraordinary. Thankfully, over the years, fans have found the frightening film, relishing its textured tale of terror, which has led to a 4K release on Blu-ray and digital, complete with special features.\nTo toast Stir of Echoes' glossy re-release, Mashable sat down with Koepp via Zoom to dig into his influences both personal and cinematic, the alarmingly timeless message at the film's core, and what he thinks of The Sixth Sense.\nStir of Echoes brought ghost stories to the city.\nWhile Koepp counts horror classics like Steven Spielberg's rural Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Tobe Hooper's suburban-set Poltergeist as inspiration points, he yearned to tell a ghost story that spoke to a community he identified with. \"It's the whole reason I wanted to do it,\" Koepp said of adapting Richard Matheson's 1958 novel, titled A Stir of Echoes.\nAfter making his directorial debut with The Trigger Effect \u2014 a thriller that Koepp describes as \"straight out of my therapy sessions\" \u2014 he hungered to \"do a scary movie.\" But he didn't connect to the suburban Southern California setting of Matheson's novel. Plus, that scenario seemed played out by the 1990s. \"In ghost stories, it's always some really good-looking people in a really beautiful house \u2014 because you want to shoot the beautiful house,\" Koepp said. \"And I get it. But I wanted to see [a ghost story] in an environment I hadn't seen.\"\nKoepp cites Roman Polanski's devilish Rosemary's Baby, which he calls one of his \"favorite movies,\" as an influence, as the setting \u2014 a \"creepy old apartment in New York City\" \u2014 gave the film's demonic twists a fresh appeal. Beyond that, he explained, \"I wanted it to be something I knew, because I wanted authenticity.\" This led him to the South Side of Chicago, where his mother was raised.\n\"Big Irish family, 10 kids, and very working class,\" he said of that environment, which he frequently visited in his own childhood. \"And that neighborhood in the movie is very much like where she grew up, where I went a million times as a kid. And I was like, I know that area. I know how to make that feel real. And I like those people, and I don't see those people in this kind of movie.\"\nThe effect in Stir of Echoes is an intense closeness. Whether Kevin Bacon's haunted Tom Witzky is walking to a ballgame alongside his gruff but affable neighbors, searching for clues during a block party, or barging in on the family next door with a troubling epiphany, the audience is aware of how close \u2014 geographically and emotionally \u2014 the Witzkys are to their neighbors. And that makes Tom's mounting suspicions of them all the more gut-churning.\nStir of Echoes takes on toxic masculinity.\nOften stories of haunted homes center on a mother, who is typically seen as inherently more receptive to the needs of others \u2014 including the dead. Stir of Echoes instead sets Tom up as a self-centered man who chafes against the obligations of being a father and husband. He complains to his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) about how he expected to be something more than a line worker for the telephone company, clinging faintly to his dreams of being a rock star. And at the start, he seems at best vaguely aware of his five-year-old son Jake (Zachary David Cope), who begins the movie talking to an unseen specter.\n\"I wanted him to feel thwarted,\" Koepp said of Tom, \"and be at the stage in life where he starts to think, 'Uh oh. I think this is all there is. And I think this is as far as I'm going to go. And that's surprising to me, because I always thought I might be special.' I think we can all relate to that. And I think you can relate to that no matter your level of success, because you think, 'Well, didn't I deserve a little more?'\"\nIn a classic monkey-paw twist, Tom gets what he wants \u2014 to be special \u2014 but not in the way he wants it. After ignoring the concerns of his pregnant wife and the complaints of his outspoken sister-in-law, Tom's mind is opened by the latter through a bit of hypnotism as a party trick. Now, Tom is keenly aware of another female force in his house, the ghost of a murdered girl named Samantha Kozac (Jennifer Morrison), whose corpse lies in the walls.\nAnd as much as Tom is terrorized by the grisly visions that reflect Samantha's violent end, he's elated to chase down the mystery only he can solve. \"I think if something like this did happen in our lives,\" Koepp said, \"it would be pretty damn exciting and interesting, and you'd want to kind of hold on to it as long as you could.\"\nStir of Echoes hits harder after the Weinstein scandal was made public.\nNearly 20 years after Stir of Echoes hit theaters, the New York Times published an investigative report that broke open decades of allegations against movie producer and sexual predator Harvey Weinstein. While rumors and whisper networks had floated for years around Hollywood, the revelation came as a shock to the nation at large. Watching Stir of Echoes now, in the MeToo era, you can see Tom having the soul-rattling realization that many men in America have had to face as rape culture has become a more publicly debated topic.\nThe ghost girl in his home was not just killed; her corpse was hidden due to a \"boys will be boys\" attitude that claims to preserve the community, but only serves to poison it. However, Koepp rejects the idea that the movie was ahead of its time.\nHe says of the men in his movie, several of whom are killers or accessories after the fact, \"They accept the neighborhood structure because that's how it always has been. The protection of the male jocks, the football players, that was nothing new\u2026 I grew up in rural Wisconsin, and the guys on the football team got away with whatever they wanted to get away with.\" He continued, \"The men in the neighborhood banding together to protect [the jocks], and the women pretend[ing] they didn't see that? It was pretty obvious that that's what was going on to anybody who wanted to talk about it.\"\nIn Stir of Echoes, Tom's quest to find out what happened to Samantha nearly gets him killed to preserve the jocks' \u2014 and the block's \u2014 secret shame. But ultimately, Samantha has a happy ending; her killers and their accomplices are exposed, and her spirit is restored, able to walk home whole.\nTo Koepp, ghost stories are timeless, because \"their premise is fundamentally hopeful.\" He explained, \"If you accept that there's a ghost in the house, you are saying, 'Hey, great news. There's something after we die.' And who doesn't want to think that? So the darkest ghost story you can possibly conceive is ultimately hopeful.\"\nMoving on from Stir of Echoes vs. The Sixth Sense\nIn the special featurettes on Stir of Echoes' new Blu-ray and digital release, Koepp recounts how he warned Stir of Echoes' distributor, Artisan Entertainment, that The Sixth Sense was set to open weeks ahead of his movie.\n\"It was fairly early on in post [production],\" Koepp says in the Lionsgate-produced interview, \"we heard about this other movie. Sixth Sense had been around town; people had read it. So we got a copy of the script and read it. And we told Artisan\u2026 'There's this movie, it's got a psychic kid. It's got ghosts, set in urban Philadelphia, and it's got Bruce Willis in it. We should come out before that. They're coming out in August.'\"\nIn response, Artisan told Koepp, \"We're not worried. It looks soft.\" He went on matter-of-factly, \"That movie came out and was a phenomenon.\"\nIn our interview, Koepp recalled his frustration over one critic \u2014 who should know better about how long it takes to put a movie together \u2014 who suggested that Stir of Echoes was copying The Sixth Sense, even though it opened just the month before. \"Some review in some reputable publication started with the sentence, 'It's amazing how quickly Hollywood emulates success.'\" Koepp shared. \"I was like, yeah, but five weeks, really?\"\nThe experience still stings Koepp. \"You don't wish to think of your movie in terms of any other movie. Your movie is your movie. I was frustrated by the experience of not being able to come out first.\"\nSo, what did Koepp think when he saw The Sixth Sense. \"I just haven't seen it,\" he admitted. \"I hear it's terrific. I should watch it sometime.\"\nStir of Echoes will be released on 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital on Dec. 10.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "'Drop' review: Date night thriller delivers satisfying twists and meaningful red flags\nDating is a fertile ground for pulse-racing horror. The thrill of falling for someone new and hot can turn scary if they become obsessive, as seen in Fear or The Boy Next Door. Messy romantic attachments can turn us into ravenous monsters, like in Jennifer's Body, Bones and All, or Only Lovers Left Alive. The very threat of trusting someone new with your heart \u2014 and your life \u2014 can trigger true terror, like in Fresh, Ready or Not, and the recently released slasher Heart Eyes. So where does Drop, which is helmed by Heart Eyes screenwriter Christopher Landon, fit into this enticing subgenre? By unfurling a tech-savvy metaphor for abusive dynamics.\nLandon \u2014 who has written and/or directed a string of hit high-concept horror movies, including the time-loop slasher Happy Death Day, its sequel Happy Death Day 2, and the body-swap slasher Freaky \u2014 brings his skill for suspense and love of genre-blending to Drop.\nThe setup seems the stuff of a touching romantic comedy. White Lotus' Meghann Fahy stars as Violet, a hopeful single mom who's going on her first date in years with a dashing photographer named Henry (Brandon Sklenar). But not long after they've met up at a chic high-rise restaurant, she begins getting pinged by harassing airdropped memes. Here, the terror of the psychological thriller sinks in, pushing its bright heroine to make life-or-death choices while an aggressively chipper waiter (Jeffery Self) provides manic comic relief.\nBut what does Drop have to say about the dangers of dating in the era of being chronically online? Plenty \u2014 and subtly.\nDrop parallels two abusive relationships as a warning to filmgoers.\nWritten by Jillian Jacobs and Chris Roach, Drop begins in the middle of a brutal battle between Violet and a violent man with a gun. It seems certain someone will die in this conflict, and the audience is pitched into confusion. Are we in media res \u2014 starting in the middle of the story, film noir-style, to tease the tension of assured danger? Or is this a past incident that will inform the film's present?\nThe answer is revealed as Violet's pleasant veneer breaks in the face of traumatizing flashbacks. Because she was once the victim of domestic violence, her IRL date with a man she's been talking with online for months comes with a lot of anxiety. However, she and Henry hit it off, joking, flirting, and deciding to share a bottle of wine and truffled mashed potatoes with their entrees. Their carefree connection is threatened when someone with the username lets_play begins to airdrop Violet some menacing memes, demanding her undivided attention.\nAt first, these memes are a welcome talking point that she shares with her date. He's game to figure out who might be toying with her. Could it be the friendly bartender (Gabrielle Ryan), the sleazy piano player (Ed Weeks), or the gaggle of prom night teens giggling at a table nearby? But things turns deadly serious once Violet sees on her nanny cam livestream that there's a masked intruder in her home, lurking behind her oblivious sister (Violett Beane) and up the stairs to her little boy's bedroom.\nThe anonymous cyberstalker texts that if she doesn't do as they say, her son will be killed. This bid for control forces Violet to put up a wall between her and Henry. Her new abuser is swiftly isolating her, cutting her off from calling out for help while exerting threats of violence. Understandably, she feels trapped, as it's clear this stalker is watching her every move. Yet beyond this cyber-interpretation of an abusive relationship, Drop proves a smartly plotted cat-and-mouse thriller \u2014 even when it gets pretty dumb.\nMeghann Fahy is a terrific leading lady in Drop.\nIn White Lotus, Fahy awed audiences as a blithe wife confronted by her husband's infidelity. In Drop, her character is far more guarded, motivated to protect her heart from breaking and her son from another bad father figure. There's an aching earnestness as Violet approaches the bar, desperate to have fun and exude hopefulness and happiness. So, when the texts go from goofy to gruesome, the terror in her eyes hits all the harder. It's like Violet's very worst fears couldn't come close to her vile reality.\nBut a fire within Fahy's eyes signals her audience she won't go down without a fight. Lending support to her riveting performance \u2014 and her character's harrowing quest \u2014 is a gaggle of terrific supporting players who bring the colorful world of this restaurant to life. As her debonair date, Sklenar gives a strong jaw and sincere gazes. As the aforementioned piano player and bartender, Weeks and Ryan prove sharp foils. Where he is swaggering with an ooze of seediness, she is no-nonsense with a kind smile that speaks to a girl's girl awareness. As a bumbling boomer on a blind date, Reed Diamond brings a comic awkwardness, but Self as the overly enthusiastic waiter had the audience at the SXSW world premiere in stitches. If you've ever had a delicate conversation intruded on by an overeager waiter, you'll chuckle. If you've been that waiter, you may well cackle.\nAnd a special shout-out is deserved for Violett Beane, who perfectly captures cool aunt energy as she watches over the heroine's bespectacled 5-year-old son, Toby (Jacob Robinson). Beane swiftly establishes the family dynamic by swapping from razzing her sister's abysmal fashion choices (\"Did you mean to dress like a candy cane?\") to lunging into play with her little nephew. And when the masked man comes creeping in, she'll give Final Girl energy, bringing jaw-dropping suspense to Drop's final act.\nSolidly fun, Drop is a great date night movie.\nJacobs and Roach's script is so full of twists that while you may see some coming, others will undoubtedly catch you by sweet surprise. The ensemble Landon has brought together is as entertainingly lively as those he directed in Happy Death Day, Happy Death Day 2U, and Freaky. Whether relishing in the situational comedy of an awkward first date or combatting mysterious and malevolent forces, Drop's characters are a demented pleasure to watch.\nAll of these successes mean that Drop is charming enough to make up for its biggest flaw. In the climax, when the plot takes a big swing with a dubious but pivotal kill, you might well eye-roll over the unlikelihood of such a demise, but you won't get the ick.\nUPDATE: Apr. 11, 2025, 12:03 p.m. EDT This review was first published on March 15, 2025, as part of Mashable's 2025 SXSW coverage.

      "text": "Jurassic World: Rebirth\nAfter the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. Anchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Academy Award nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora\u2019s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. The cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben\u2019s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs\u2019 crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). Jurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer\u2019s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.\n- 50%\n- 12+"

      "text": "'Presence's Steven Soderbergh and David Koepp on ghosts, horror, and hating winks\nCentering on a ghost as it haunts a family in a cozy suburban home, Presence might seem like a horror movie in the vein of Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, or The Conjuring. But in their follow-up to the tech thriller Kimi, longtime friends director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter David Koepp say that Presence was never conceived of as or intended to be a horror movie.\n\"It's a ghost story,\" Koepp told Mashable in a joint in-person interview with Soderbergh, who concurred, adding that the film is not horror by his definition. For Soderbergh, whose mother was a parapsychologist, the idea of a ghost in the house isn't inherently scary. Or more specifically, it's not scary in the way modern audiences think about horror. He thinks of Presence as \"more The Shining than Longlegs.\"\nKoepp expanded on this: \"In the last 10 to 15 years, horror has really been prominent and changed. Gore and jump scares are huge. When people hear horror, they think of that. When I think of horror, I think of Linda Blair in the MRI tube [in The Exorcist].\"\nIt's in such moments of grounded, everyday, human anxiety that Presence thrives. Using first-person perspective \u2014 shot by Soderbergh, who served as helmer and cinematographer \u2014 Presence follows an enigmatic spirit as it eavesdrops unseen on a family of four (Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, and Eddy Maday), who are going through an array of personal and professional tensions. Rather than this presence being a menace in their household, it is a captive audience who seems desperate to be a part of the family's lives and help however it can. But without a voice and little ability to be acknowledged by anyone but a grieving teen girl, its struggle is fraught with anxiety and heartache. And this was inspired by Soderbergh's own brushes with ghosts.\nPresence is loosely based on Soderbergh's own haunted house.\nFor the director behind Ocean's Eleven and Logan Lucky, Presence began when \"our house sitter saw a ghost\" in his Los Angeles home. While Soderbergh hasn't experienced a paranormal encounter with a spirit in his home or elsewhere, he believes those who say they have \u2014 citing Jeff Ross, who shared his scary story on Celebrity Ghost Stories \u2014 because of his trust in them and their genuine alarm. And this got him pondering, as he told Mashable, \"I just got to thinking how I would feel \u2014 if I'd been killed in my own house \u2014 about other people coming into my house. And that's where it started.\"\nFrom there, he'd sent Koepp a few pages of a draft, imagining the spirit wandering the space and seeing a realtor arrive with prospective buyers. \"Steven had this idea: first-person point of view of the ghost, should all be in one house, and it feels like it wants to be a family drama. And I was like, well, okay, those are my three favorite things. I know how to write a family. I love a contained space, and your aesthetic idea is really cool.\"\n\"The ghost is the Trojan horse for a portrait of a family struggling,\" Soderbergh explained, \"And that has an incredible blind spot in the center of it.\"\nThe first-person perspective meant that all scenes would be shot as oners \u2014 a long take with no cuts. This was a \"box movie\" challenge (as Soderbergh put it) that Koepp, the screenwriter behind similarly constrained films like The Paper and Panic Room, relished. Yet there's one scene in Presence that, for a few moments, seems to break this POV framework to a surprising and clever effect. Just don't call it a \"wink.\"\nSteven Soderbergh hates winking, both literal and metaphorical.\nPresence \u2014 which I championed as an excellent example of horror in my review \u2014 turns the expectations of a ghost story on its head by putting audiences in the shoes of the gentle spirit at its center. Rather than this first-person perspective being used as spooky voyeurism, as the shot is often employed in slasher movies, it carries a sense of vulnerability that excited both Koepp as a writer and Soderbergh as the performer of this ghost through his camera's lens.\n\"Vulnerability was [crucial], because in the pages he sent me,\" Koepp said, \"The thing's looking around the empty house, people come in, and it retreats to the closet. And I thought, 'Oh, it's scared, it's vulnerable.' That changed everything, because it's not the presence that wants to scare you and has some kind of power and authority. It's not at all. It's exactly the opposite. It's that vulnerability that was key to writing that.\"\nYet there's a moment where Soderbergh's camera switches from its fluid wandering motion, instead perching high in the daughter's bedroom, overlooking her at her desk. Then, in the edge of the top right of frame, a very familiar sight in a horror movie about ghosts occurs. The bedroom door opens slowly, as if on its own. But just as the audience might think Soderbergh has unceremoniously ditched his first-person POV, the father of the family enters, slyly subverting the expectation of a scare for something comforting and common.\n\"That was in the script,\" Soderbergh says, crediting Koepp. \"And it came at the right time to kind of \u2014 I don't want to say wink. I don't want to say it was a wink. My wife made the mistake early in our dating, and I don't know what motivated this, but she winked at me. And I lost my mind, and was like, 'Do not ever.' So just the word and the whole notion of 'wink' [repulses me] \u2014 I don't think we were winking. But I liked the idea that for a second, you know, 'Oh, they're gonna do that thing.' And then his head comes out, and she jumps [in surprise]. Okay, so you do need to find those moments of release, absolutely. You know, Jaws is one of the funniest movies out there \u2014 the audience wants that release [amid the tension].\"\nPressed on why winks bother him so, Soderbergh mused, \"I've really got to do a deep dive on why, in real life, I find that so disturbing. Maybe it's because I can't understand. It's unthinkable that I would do it to someone, so it's a lack of imagination on my part, to enter a headspace in which I would think that was a good thing to do, you know? And made me feel like, who are you? She just laughed about it when she saw my reaction, like it wasn't that big an ask.\" He continued, \"And then as far as films go, I think that's very, very dangerous territory, because the default mode is that it's somewhat self-referential. I was comfortable with it here because it was referential to a genre as a whole, right? And not like another movie that I had made\u2026I'm just unnerved by [winks].\"\nFrom there, the pair discussed how there are names and numbers that recur in their respective projects. But Soderbergh insists this isn't self-referential winking. \"There's a company name that always clears that I use a lot, called Perennial,\" he explained, \"So if you were to go through my filmography, there are probably eight or nine Perennials in there. It works for anything: dry cleaner, armored cars. So that, to me, is not winking, I'm trying to solve a problem.\"\nThe pair have known each other since 1989, when their respective first films \u2014 Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape and Koepp's Apartment Zero \u2014 played at the Sundance Film Festival. Though Koepp once pitched his follow-up Death Becomes Her to Soderbergh, the two didn't collaborate until 2022's Kimi. But since then, they've reunited for Presence and the upcoming spy drama Black Bag. So, after all these decades together, how do they know when a project is best suited to their collaboration?\nKoepp said it's when a casual conversation about an idea comes up repeatedly, and the concept grows from there. Soderbergh concurred, then quipped, \"I'll wink!\"\nPresence is now playing in theaters.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "'Wicked' review: Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo aspire for movie musical magic\nWicked is easily one of the most anticipated films of 2024, as it's bringing to the big screen a three-time Tony Award\u2013winning musical that defined a generation of theater kids, with a Hollywood-scale spectacle of song, dance, and star power. As the Wicked Witch's origin story told from a place of empathy, it's a movie meant to make us believe in magic again. But even with a cast that boasts two-time Academy Award nominee Cynthia Erivo, pop star Ariana Grande, Bridgerton dreamboat Jonathan Bailey, Academy Award\u2013winner Michelle Yeoh, and the one and only Jeff Goldblum, can director Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights) meet the high, high bar fans will have in mind for such a sweeping adaptation? Especially when he's only tackling half of it in Wicked: Part 1?\nDespite enthusiasm from fans of the theatrical production, online criticism has plagued the film from the first images and footage that Universal Pictures released. Complaints were made that Chu's vision of Oz was washed out, with colors far duller than we've come to expect from past media inspired by L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, including 1939's Wizard of Oz, 1978's The Wiz, and the vibrant Broadway production based on Gregory Maguire's contrarian perspective, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. Then, when the first teaser hit, offering a hint as to what kind of performance Erivo would give as the eponymous witch Elphaba, social media was rife with worries over how she hit one particular note. With the bold choice to split the musical into two films, Chu drew more eyebrows into a knit. So, how does all this pan out? Were the fans right to worry? Frankly, yes.\nWhile the performances in the film are sensational overall, Chu makes a series of downright confounding choices that undercut the rapturous flow of the Broadway production and even the perspective of the story he aims to exalt.\nWhere does Wicked: Part 1 end?\nAs the trailers suggest, this first Wicked movie ends with \"Defying Gravity,\" a rousing anthem that plays as a dynamic climax to the first act of the theatrical production. This means much of Wicked: Part 1 takes place in Shiz University, where the future wicked witch Elphaba (Erivo) and good witch Glinda (Grande) first meet. However, the screenplay from Dana Fox and Wicked's book writer Winnie Holzman holds true to its stage source, kicking off the film with news that the Wicked Witch is dead. After the munchkins revel with a song of schadenfreude (\"No One Mourns The Wicked\"), Glinda reflects on the childhood of her friend, Elphaba, transporting the film to a flashback of a torrid one-night stand and the green child who was the much-bullied result of it. From there, their time at Shiz becomes the focus.\nThere's a kinetic energy in all this, reflecting Grande's boundless energy throughout the film. But here's where Chu's choices begin to get bizarre. While this is a story about Elphaba, it's told from the perspective of her deeply girly, proudly ridiculous, and very vibrant best friend. Glinda's view on the world is clear through her costumes, which are pronounced pink, ultra-femme, flouncy, and always on the boundary of too much. Yet Chu coats her pinks and Elphaba's greens in a yellowy-gray cast. Perhaps this is meant to telegraph how Glinda's perspective on Oz will become sullied over the course of this story, but it also makes the movie astonishingly dull in comparison to all of the other movies set in Oz.\nThis grayness intrudes most intensely on the incredible sets built for Shiz. Designed like a cross between Hogwarts and BarbieLand, Shiz University should be a majestic, magical place, where possibilities feel boundless. And yet, despite its thoughtful and gorgeous set design, a pale palette and cinematography that feels almost claustrophobic turns it into a stifling location. This conflicts with the perspective of Glinda, who swans into the role of Queen Bee with ease, and even with Elphaba, who swiftly embraces this space as a path to finally finding her place (\"The Wizard and I\").\nThis grim overcast likewise saps verve from what would otherwise be astounding musical numbers, deadening the dazzle through its drudgery. In \"Dancing Through Life,\" a dashing prince Fiyero (a pitch-perfect Bailey) sings of his devil-may-care philosophy in a library filled with parkouring students on human-sized hamster wheels of bookshelves. And that is undoubtedly fun, yet this visual pall scoffs at his pronouncements, undermining their whimsy even as we enjoy them.\nAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are unevenly matched.\nIt's no easy task to step into the role of these two iconic characters, as each actress might be compared to every Elphaba and Glinda who've come before, reaching all the way back to The Wizard of Oz's Margaret \"and your little dog too!\" Hamilton and Billie Burke, not to mention Wicked's defining stars Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Arguably, the bar is even higher for Grande, who is better known for her catchy pop songs than her acting chops or her Broadway stint in 13 at age 15. And yet, she is a fantastic force to be reckoned with in Wicked.\nAs she teased during her Saturday Night Live gig last month, she is absolutely hilarious as the self-obsessed girly pop Glinda. There are echoes of Chenoweth's Glinda in Grande's broad comedic approach. But this pop star's Glinda is more poised, making the outrageous moments \u2014 like her splendidly silly hair toss \u2014 all the more comically sharp. Grande has embraced a portrayal of this mean girl/good witch that edges into drag queen theatricality, supported by her smizing sidekicks in snark, hysterically portrayed by Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James. Glinda's reads are delivered by Grande with a radiant smile that makes them all the more cutting. Her dancing is deranged while determined. Her \"Popular\" \u2014 one of the show's most beloved numbers \u2014 is charismatically chaotic and finally, finally as brightly realized as Wicked demands.\nErivo, on the other hand, approaches Wicked as if it were a prestige drama. Traditionally, Wicked's Elphaba was written with a bit of teen-misfit snark, and masterfully so, as Holzman's prior claim to fame creating the exceptional teen drama series My So-Called Life. While the dialogue is often the same in this adaptation, Erivo pulls her punchlines. Where previous stage versions of Elphaba might have used a slightly self-righteous sense of wit as armor against her bullies, this Elphaba is much more nakedly vulnerable, speaking in a dejected near-whisper or a strained shout.\nIt's a daring choice, but one that throws off Glinda and Elphaba's dynamic. Like Daria and Quinn Morgendorffer or Wednesday Addams and Enid Sinclair, they are foils, gloom and sunshine, anti-social asides and \"dumb blonde\" bounciness \u2014 but this Elphaba has been defanged. A sullen expression of a slight frown and downcast eyes makes up much of Elphaba's non-singing screentime for Act 1, which might not have been a problem if Chu had included Act II in Wicked. But as it is, Erivo's Elphaba doesn't come fully alive until she and Glinda reach the Emerald City (\"One Short Day\"). This means pivotal moments like the scene in the Ozdust Ballroom, where Elphaba and Glinda finally bond, feel achingly inert and long.\nWicked: Part 1 is wonky, but at times wonderful.\nChu's decision to turn Act 1 into a teen musical is marred by his dingy color palette, the crowded cinematography of Shiz (thankfully, things open up in the Emerald City), and directing his leading lady to play the titular witch as chiefly woeful. A show heralded for its high-energy song numbers, stage spectacle, and smirking sense of humor, Wicked is malformed by these choices. Yet, some sections are sure to have audiences cheering.\nBeyond Erivo's riveting performance of the final number and Grande giddily making a meal out of every moment on-screen, Bailey \u2014 who had Bridgerton fans swooning as Anthony in Season 2 \u2014 has a jolly time parodying a decadently flirtatious playboy in Part 1. His spotlight is \"Dancing Through Life,\" but even his meaningful glances to his crush and flirty banter with any Shiz student who crosses his pansexual path are enchanting. As Madame Morrible, Yeoh is given little do but look majestic, but she does that with aplomb. Marissa Bode and Ethan Slater \u2014 as Elphaba's sister Nessarose and her boyfriend Boq \u2014 solidly match the screen presence of the famous names around them. Goldblum clearly relishes playing the wizard, and does so with a smarmy charm that's dizzyingly unnerving and alluring. James and Yang are superbly cast as Glinda's social-climbing toadies, who love gossip as much as they do improvising wild one-liners. They're so funny, you'll catch yourself scanning the crowd for them, hungry for more.\nThe musical numbers are hit-and-miss. \"Popular\" and \"Defying Gravity\" are rightful standouts for enthralling vocals and staging that embraces the cinematic form, employing cheeky close-ups, playful cutaways, or high-flying stunts as suits. But others feel oddly out of place, like \"The Wizard and I\" shot amid a CG setting that feels achingly empty and fake, undercutting the optimism of the song. Overall, Wicked is an overlong journey, dragged down by Chu's more confounding choices. Upon reflection, a movie that could have been defined by its sense of hope, following a powerful and accomplished woman of color as she defies a tyrannical con man, feels instead tainted by gray disillusionment, telegraphing the film's climactic reveals. So, it's hard to watch Wicked play out and not wish for something more dynamic that allows us a safe space to dream for something better.\nStill, even the lowest lows can't make the film's highest highs less dazzling. Indulgent and unwieldy as it is, Wicked is a thrill, at times wildly funny, heart-soaring, and ultimately inspirational in spite of itself.\nWicked opens in theaters Nov. 22.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "'Jurassic World Rebirth' review: Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey face off with dangerous and delightful dinosaurs\nSteven Spielberg launched two mighty behemoths upon cinemas, first with Jaws (1975), which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, then with Jurassic Park (1993). Both movies are crowd-pleasing creature features that present mighty beasts, happy to gobble up whatever humans are unlucky enough to fall in their path. Both have spawned sequels that might have made money, but can't compare to the glory of the original. Because even though both movies were based on novels (by Peter Benchley and Michael Crichton, respectively), they felt original on the big screen. Jaws and Jurassic Park offered visions of adventure and thrills unlike anything audiences had seen before. The thrill was so rattling, so reverberating that we chase it decades later with imitators in the form of countless shark horror movies, and sequels that imagine a world 32 years after Jurassic Park went wild.\nMaybe it's impossible for any of the films that come in the wake of these unquestionable classics to best or even match these originals. Maybe our collective love of them is too deep, or perhaps they really just are untouchable in their greatness. Lucky for Universal, which owns both properties, it doesn't really matter. The last three Jurassic Park movies (relaunched as Jurassic World, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and Jurassic World: Dominion) all made over a billion dollars apiece worldwide, despite being increasingly loathed by critics. So, time for rebirth.\nJurassic World Rebirth is the best of the new batch of movies. But admittedly, that's a low bar to clear.\nJurassic World Rebirth abandons Colin Trevorrow's most tedious plotlines.\nTrevorrow, who directed Jurassic World and Jurassic World: Dominion and had a hand in scripting all of those last three, is thankfully not writing or directing Rebirth. Instead, David Koepp, who adapted Jurassic Park back in 1993 \u2014 and has been on a great run with genre movies like Presence and Black Bag \u2014 scripted the latest dino-packed sequel. At the helm is Gareth Edwards, the critically heralded director of Monsters and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\nTogether, they aim to find fresh life in this franchise. Step one: Ditching Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, whose odd couple of uptight businesswoman and rugged raptor wrangler never caught on quite like Sam Neill's cranky paleontologist and Laura Dern's dynamic paleobotanist. (Not to mention Jeff Goldblum's confoundingly hot mathematician as proto-fuckboy.) Not even bringing these three OG cast members back for Dominion could help the creatively fumbled franchise overcome the convoluted plotlines about bio-engineering that looped into a cloned little girl. But thankfully, you can forget all of that for Jurassic World Rebirth.\nAll new characters mean no need for intense recaps. Instead, the setup is simple. The human population has grown tired of dinosaurs, who have slowly died off around the globe, unable to cope with our current climate and air conditions. (Relatable!) However, near the equator, they continue to thrive in zones that have been deemed forbidden for man to traverse. Well, unless you're a mercenary named Zora (Scarlett Johansson) who's been hired by sketchy pharmaceutical exec Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) to obtain live dinosaur blood for a medical advancement worth trillions. In that case, you hire a nerdy-while-hot paleontologist named Dr. Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) and a crew of devil-may-care supporting characters \u2014 including a charming but haunted captain, called Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) \u2014 to trek to this no-man's-land, armed with a specially designed rifle to grab those dino blood samples.\nMeanwhile, the Delgado family, who's yachting from Cape Town to Barbados, crosses paths with a massive sea-living dinosaur, and ends up getting rescued by Zora and her friends.\nJurassic World: Rebirth falls into the pitfall of too many humans, too much plot.\nThat's plenty of plot to tackle. Between Zora's crew and the Delgado family, there are 11 humans going to this remote tropical region. That's plenty to show off the violence of dinosaurs through several early death scenes. However, it's too many to allow the audience to become invested in, well, most of them. Some characters barely get a name before they're dino food. Others are instantly unlikable, and so are as easily and quickly marked for death as that lawyer who died with no dignity on a toilet in the first film. And all that makes for some frustratingly predictable beats.\nTo Edwards' credit, the reveal of the dinosaurs in their natural habitat is deliciously exciting. Well-camouflaged despite their massive size, they aren't immediately noticed by the humans who are well aware they're on dinosaur turf. Giving the audience the chance to catch sight of these beasts before the characters do is a terrific way to spark tension. However, the genuine shock when the characters freeze seeing a dinosaur \u2014 in a place where they know they will be! \u2014 gets a bit silly, especially as this is a world we're told where mankind has become blas\u00e9 about the return of dinosaurs.\nFurther vexing is a plotline that sets up plenty of intriguing details, like humans messing with dino DNA to creator showier breeds. Yet the results of these breeds are pretty underwhelming. Instead of looking like a monster even more terrifying than a T. rex, the big dino baddie here looks like a clumsy cross between a T. rex, a xenomorph, and those chickens on TikTok that sport rubber human arms for laughs. Add to this human threads about grief, regret, redemption, and a father absolutely loathing his teen daughter's lazy boyfriend, and you have a movie overstuffed with just\u2026stuff. Still, there are enough great moments to make Jurassic World Rebirth a solid popcorn movie.\nDolores the baby dinosaur is innocent.\nWhile this film is star-studded, boasting talent from the MCU, Hunger Games, and Bridgerton, the scene-stealer here is a juvenile Aquilops who is named Dolores by licorice-loving Isabella (Audrina Miranda), the youngest in the Delgado family. While the rest of her family is trying to survive the Jurassic predators that pop up from tall grasses and deep rivers, Isabella has befriended a cute, cuddly dinosaur who can sense danger. Cynically, one could rightly view Dolores as a clear bid for enticing merchandise. But Koepp and Edwards manage to make her more than an animal accessory a Disney princess doll would come with.\nDolores, with her curiosity, her cuteness, and her interest in humans, reflects a potential future that is less cruel than the one Krebs and Zora experience in New York City at the film's start. There, a dying brontosaurus is not viewed with sympathy or sadness but as an annoying traffic disruption. Isabella's excitement about Dolores is shared by the movie audience, who all these years later still dream of getting up close to a real dinosaur. And more importantly, her enthusiasm reflects that of Loomis, who is in absolute awe as he comes across a field of gentle giants eating grass, wandering, and even beginning a hypnotic mating ritual. Where Zora is an opportunist, seeking financial security through a risky and unscrupulous gig, Henry is an idealist who imagines he can collect the blood without hurting the dinosaurs he loves. Plus, he envisions the attendant scientific discoveries as something that could benefit the whole world, not just Krebs' profit margins.\nIn these character moments, you can most feel Koepp's touch. But they are bogged down by bits that feel like studio notes: the family and their squabbles, mutant dinos and the lumbering exposition that explains them, a jolting death toll, but without killing off a character that might upset the audience too much. At least the cruelty of Trevorrow, who infamously punished a so-called \"bridezilla\" in Jurassic World with a wildly violent death, is gone.\nOverall, the sequel is fun. It gives audiences the least of what they\u2019re asking for, which is action, excitement involving dinosaurs and movie stars at the heart of it. For Johansson\u2019s part, it is nice to see her playing a character who has way more fun than Black Widow. Ali is likewise a treasure, bringing charm and pathos without overburdening the film with it. But Bailey is the most fun. With his \u201cslutty little glasses\u201d that have already driven the internet mad, he is walking in the path of Neill's Dr. Alan Grant in an enticingly nontoxic way. He is certainly more optimistic than the iconic paleontologist. And within that refreshingly seductive, whether he\u2019s dropjawed over a long-necked dinosaur, repelling down a treacherous cliffside, or awkwardly flirting with a mercenary who could snap his neck as easily as she can tie her hair back.\nThe in-peril Delgados give families going to the movies a clear conduit for their own excitement. Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids! \u2014 but with raptors and pterodactyls. And while their story is rickety, it does offer laughs, thrills, occasional tenderness, and of course, our beloved Dolores, who is perfect.\nIn the end, Jurassic World Rebirth is a rocky ride. Some bits are absolutely exhilarating, while others feel like a chore. But unlike the humans in this franchise, the humans of our world just cannot tire of these incredible beasts, happy to shell out ticket money to get as close as we might to their enormous majesty. And this film, including its hilariously calamitous opening with its requisite kill, will deliver, feeding both all our yearning for excitement and our need for escapism.\nIt\u2019s not better than the original, but it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve come.\nJurassic World Rebirth opens in theaters on July 2.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "'Jurassic World: Dominion' review: A big, dumb animal that deserves extinction\nWith Jurassic World: Dominion, it's clear: Colin Trevorrow is the worst thing that's happened to dinosaurs since that asteroid knocked them all into the past tense. The writer/director/producer who's had a hand in each Jurassic World movie has repeatedly failed to recapture the magic of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic Park. Instead of wonder, terror, and captivating characters, Trevorrow has given audiences cynicism and clich\u00e9s that make for murky action movies devoid of soul.\nTrevorrow directs Jurassic World: Dominion, with a script penned by himself and Pacific Rim: Uprising writer Emily Carmichael. It doesn't matter if you've seen or don't remember Jurassic World or its sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, because an opening news montage lays the groundwork: After another failed attempt at building Jurassic Park, dinosaurs are on the loose worldwide, threatening life as we know it. Also, a clone girl named Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) has gone missing. But fret not, this new(ish) character \u2014 whose role is chiefly sulking and running in terror \u2014 is being cared for by dino activist Claire Dearing (a wide-eyed Bryce Dallas Howard) and raptor whisperer Owen Grady (a brow-furrowed Chris Pratt) (aka the least compelling romantic couple of all time). Well, that is until a bunch of poachers kidnap Maisie and raptor Blue's baby Beta for evil science reasons.\nTo explain all this and much, much, much more, Trevorrow inundates his audience with an array of exposition dumps that fling about science phrases and buzzwords about GMOs (genetically modified organisms), animal rights, ethics in science, and their global impact. But Jurassic World: Dominion has nothing to add to these debates, treating them simply as hooks to lure in the trio of classic Jurassic Park characters.\nSam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum are back, but wasted\nYes! Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Laura Dern are back as Dr. Ian Malcolm, Dr. Alan Grant, and Dr. Ellie Sattler. And while each of these stars is as dazzling as ever, they're given criminally little do for the first two hours of this sixth instalment in the franchise. Dern is beguiling as the blithe and beautiful Ellie, who has never met mischief that didn't intrigue. Neill is a reliably lovable grump, but his Grant is treated like a loser who never made a life for himself out of the excavation pits. Meanwhile, Goldblum swaggers onto the screen in Ian's signature skinny black jeans and an unbuttoned shirt, but his Malcolm has lost that spark that made this chaotician wild fun. Now, when he lectures about how humankind is bringing on our own end, it doesn't feel daring. It feels like, well, duh.\nJurassic World: Dominion falls short in awe-inspiring spectacle\nTrevorrow's lack of vision is achingly clear from the OG trio's introductions. What should be big moments, reuniting us with these beloved heroes, is treated with a matter-of-factness that undercuts this stunt casting. Unfortunately, this lack of flare continues through the action sequences. It should be fun to watch dinosaurs running amok in the human world. There are plenty of action setpieces that sound entertaining on paper, from a massive sea beast toppling a fishing trawler to Owen motorcycle racing away from rampaging atrociraptors to Claire crawling from the reach of a ferociously clawed creature. But in execution, much of the action scenes are a murky mess.\nWhere Jurassic Park used its masterful special effects to indulge our lingering gaze at the miracle of dinosaurs resurrected millions of years later, Jurassic World: Dominion is constantly obscuring its marvelous monsters. Snow, water, darkness, and quick cuts are all employed to cover the finer details of these CGI beasties, perhaps to obscure the seams and cut down post-production costs. Combined with a dull color palette of sickly browns and grays, the effect is dinosaurs that don't evoke the majesty and terror of those from the '90s, accuracy be damned.\n'Jurassic World: Dominion' earnestly expects audiences to believe a megalomaniac billionaire's remote dinosaur research facility has security less stringent than that of your local bar.\nFurther marring these action sequences is coverage that cuts together crudely, bungling geography, readability, and flow. Perhaps Trevorrow hopes to cover these raw edges with a bullying sound design because this movie is atrociously noisy. Engines roar. Humans scream. Dinosaurs bellow. Metal bends and breaks. This movie is not interesting or exciting, but sure, it's loud. Maybe its helmer thought that if something \u2014 be it man, beast, or machine \u2014 is squealing in our ears, we won't notice the numerous plotholes that the garrulous but vacuous dialogue creates. No such luck. Jurassic World: Dominion earnestly expects audiences to believe a megalomaniac billionaire's remote dinosaur research facility has security less stringent than that of your local bar.\nTrevorrow embraces his worst impulses. Again.\nOne of the loudest criticisms of Trevorrow's first Jurassic World was the cruel violence enacted on minor characters, as he thought audiences would relish the graphic death of a so-called \"bridezilla.\" That mean streak persists in Jurassic World: Dominion, where human casualties suffer grisly fates that are practically mocked in video montages that chalk them up to silly social media fodder. It's like watching a sloppy slasher sequel, where the assumption is audiences turned up for a high body count, not any kind of character development. As an avid horror fan, you can do both!\nLittle wonder then that franchise newcomers Mamoudou Athie and DeWanda Wise, as Biosyn head of communications Ramsay Cole and pilot Kayla Watts, are given little backstory and thin character development and exist chiefly to mirror pre-established characters and sidekick the leads out of trouble. Still, props to Athie and Wise for bringing resilient charisma that makes their roles far more fascinating than the screenplay deserves. Even poor Sam Neill is damned by drivel dialogue like, \"Paleontology is science. Science is truth. Truth is in the rocks.\"\nTruly, what is any actor supposed to do with lines like that?\nJurassic World: Dominion is a ruthless retread of Jurassic Park\nColin Trevorrow just can't help himself. Just as he did in the first two films of this rebooted sequel series, he full-on steals action sequences, beats, and even props from the first film. Ellie will pet a dino with unchecked awe. Alan will lecture about the deadliness of raptors. But also a Dilophosaurus will track a devious villain into a broken down conveyance for a carnivorous comeuppance and a dropped can of shaving cream. Don't call it a callback when you're beat-for-beat repeating dinosaur attack sequences to the point where the finale feels like you're tracing the original with a broken crayon. When it gets to the point where Trevorrow actually re-enacting the franchise's roaring logo, I was groaning and rooting for the dinosaurs to just finish us off. All of humankind. Just make this stop.\nThere's a caustic lack of curiosity in Jurassic World: Dominion. Trevorrow bandies about buzzwords, big stars, and costly CGI dinosaurs, but with little interest in showing audiences something new. He's cruising on nostalgia, even when he introduces species that audiences might not know. Instead of giving us something to sink our teeth into and savor, he slaps monster meat down for battles, races, and destruction, like a toddler rampaging through their block-built village. Hilariously, the villain of this film is a pretentious \"big ideas\" man, who dehumanizes Maisie by calling her the \"most valuable piece of intellectual property in the world.\" Yet Trevorrow rebuilds this IP with a similar attitude, cherry-picking its DNA to create something without concern for character or what such a project might actually mean. To paraphrase a prophetic chaotician, perhaps he was so preoccupied with whether or not he could, he didn't stop to think if he should.\nJurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters on June 10.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "'The Woman in the Yard' review: A baffling mix of horror ideas\nSome genre movies grow and transform. Others, like Jaume Collet-Serra's The Woman in the Yard, metastasize. What begins as streamlined (if slightly unbalanced) modern folk horror soon bloats into a half a dozen different films, heat-welded jankily together as they build to a confoundingly distasteful finale.\nOddly enough, it might have been easier to swallow had it also been visually drab. That The Woman in the Yard looks as good as it does \u2014 in service of a uniquely executed conceit appearing midway through \u2014 makes it all the more of a waste. What Collet-Serra does with light and shadow is often marvellous, and could have resulted in a contemporary horror classic had much else around these aesthetic flourishes worked as intended.\nInstead, what we\u2019re left with is a deftly performed family drama sandwiched between as many different spooky concepts as found within The Cabin in the Woods. The major difference is that Sam Stefanak's script is entirely straightforward, rather than satirical, making for some head-spinning disconnects.\nWhat is The Woman in the Yard about?\nAt its core, The Woman in the Yard is about grief \u2014 wait, where are you going? Hear me out.\nThe film doesn't necessarily disguise this theme or make it abstract in the vein of modern \"prestige\" horror, but rather, presents it nakedly in its opening scenes. Recent widow Ramona (Danielle Deadwyler) wakes up in a daze in her rural Georgia home, her leg still broken from the road accident that recently killed her husband. She's having trouble paying the bills, so the power to her isolated farmland fixer-upper has been cut. Her adolescent son Taylor (Peyton Jackson) and elementary school-aged daughter Annie (Estella Kahiha) help out where they can, even if that means cooking up a culinary nightmare involving Doritos and eggs.\nThe trio tries to keep their heads above water, even in the noticeable absence of patriarch David (Russell Hornsby), a charming and ambitious man we meet in flashbacks and in the videos Ramona mournfully rewatches. Collet-Serra's directing is at its most even-handed in these calm, domestic moments, during which an empty dining table chair comes to represent the family's loss, which clearly weighs on the struggling mother (though less so on her children).\nRamona's attention frequently wavers, and before she knows it, a woman in a black veil (Okwui Okpokwasili) is seated in an ornate chair at the edge of her front yard. More than any theme or emotion, this mysterious figure represents a conundrum, and a much more novel horror premise than the trio dealing with a recent death. With their phones dead and no one around for miles, do they confront her or simply leave her be?\nEventually, Ramona steps outside to make contact, which is when things start to get eerie \u2014 in some ways that suit this setup, and other ways that very much do not.\nNo, really, what is The Woman in the Yard actually about?\nGood horror movies are rarely set during the day, and in The Woman in the Yard, things don\u2019t start popping off until the late afternoon, when the mysterious figure begins casting lengthy shadows that gradually approach the house. Collet-Serra and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski (known for his work with Ari Aster) turn the space around Ramona's home into a visual sandbox, where light and darkness interact in unexpected ways. Sometimes a shadow is a looming threat. Other times, it has weight and interacts with the physical world. That's creepy, and it's also cool as hell.\nHowever, the subtle horrors of the woman's somber presence, as she inches towards the family, become very quickly subsumed by additional ideas and gimmicks that pile up far too quickly. The woman needn't represent anything to be imposing, and had she embodied perhaps one or two themes or concepts troubling Ramona, the result would've at least been functional. Instead, she veers between ominous presence, omniscient soothsayer, child kidnapper, animal murderer, retroactive flashback demon, and more, depending on what a given moment demands.\nAt first, she forces wedges between the remaining family members, pushing them to confront lies and half-truths surrounding David's death, but it isn't long before the movie starts dipping its toe into flimsily established metaphysical horrors, which have little bearing on the existing premise. Before you know it, The Woman in the Yard has flirted with possession, mirror worlds, temporal displacement, and an unfortunate mental health metaphor that unfolds in some pretty ghastly ways.\nThe Woman in the Yard zigzags right off the rails.\nUsually, a standout performance or two might save a dwindling movie. Deadwyler performs admirably as a mother trying to keep her family together through a tragic situation. Okpokwasili makes for an imposing presence, and newcomer Jackson is a pleasant surprise as a boy trying to figure out his place as the man of the house (even though much of his dialogue is spent trying to CinemaSins-proof the movie and explain why the family can't just leave or make a phone call). However, no amount of emoting is enough to stay such a choppy, unpredictable course.\nThe Woman in the Yard causes significant narrative whiplash with each question it answers, though none of its conclusions are satisfying. As soon as it establishes the mechanics of its ghostly villain \u2014 for instance, the way she uses and moves through shadows \u2014 there's some other power lurking around the corner, resulting in a random string of chase scenes where tension can't possibly be established, because neither the family nor the audience have any idea what they're up against.\nWhat the woman represents is vague enough that her symbolism doesn't matter, at least at first. Her funeral attire makes her a specter or reminder of death in the abstract. That's really all you need. However, by the time the movie pulls back its final curtain \u2014 after several\u2026 well, calling them \"twists\" would be generous \u2014 the woman actually does come to embody something rather morose, but not in a way the movie establishes beforehand.\nWith concept upon concept thrown at the wall to see what sticks, the movie crescendoes in some bafflingly wrong-headed moments that Collet-Serra hasn't carved out the time to approach with the requisite care. On one hand, horror ought to be a visceral embodiment of one's biggest fears, but on the other, The Woman in the Yard verges on genuinely irresponsible with its casual framing of something realistically tragic and painful.\nThen again, reading this finale also requires intuiting dozens of minor clues which feel like they're from entirely different movies. The Woman in the Yard presents these far too quickly and carelessly, to the point that most audiences are likely to come away thinking they\u2019ve watched an open, unresolved ending, even though this likely isn't the case.\nHow a movie likes this comes to exist, in such preposterous form, is a mystery unto itself \u2014 one far more interesting than what ends up on screen.\nThe Woman in the Yard is now in theaters.\nTopics Film\nSiddhant Adlakha is a film critic and entertainment journalist originally from Mumbai.

      "text": "Jurassic World: Rebirth\nAfter the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. Anchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Academy Award nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora\u2019s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. The cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben\u2019s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs\u2019 crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). Jurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer\u2019s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.\n- 50%\n- 12+"

      "text": "What OpenAI's Scarlett Johansson drama tells us about the future of AI\nIt's rare that a single feature in a tech product can generate a week's worth of headlines. But that's what happened when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unveiled Sky, one of five voices that read out ChatGPT-powered answers.\nIn common with many listeners, Scarlett Johansson recognized the voice as hers. Which was strange, Johansson said in an equally rare statement Monday, since Altman contacted her multiple times asking her for permission to use her voice, including once just a few days before the Sky demo. She had not given consent. Her lawyers were seeking answers from OpenAI, which had hurriedly taken Sky down a day before the statement.\nAs in politics, so in big tech: If you're explaining, you're losing. While Redditors piled on in identifying the voice as Johansson, while a U.S. Senator indignantly subtweeted Altman and legislative attempts to rein in AI entered the spotlight, OpenAI spent the next week explaining as best they could. It wasn't Johansson's voice, they insisted. Sky was built atop a voice actor that just happened to sound an awful lot like Johansson.\nThe voice actor herself was wheeled on stage, anonymously, via the Washington Post: becoming the voice of Sky was \"honestly kinda scary territory for me as a conventional voice over actor,\" she said via her agent, adding this OpenAI-approved statement: \"It is an inevitable step toward the wave of the future.\"\nAn inevitable step toward the wave of the future. Boy, wouldn't it be pretty for OpenAI for you to think so. The company's eye-popping $90 billion valuation depends on you thinking that \u2014 you the influencer, you the investor, you the executive tasked with looking into AI-based cost savings at your company, you the politician thinking about hyping up AI threats, you the general public.\nYou have to believe AI is improving exponentially, you have to ignore the growing evidence that says it isn't \u2014 or at the very least, you have to think that enough other people around you believe in AI for it not to matter what you think.\nAnd that's the most interesting thing about the Johansson scandal. At its root, it is not about whether the voice is Johansson's or not. It's not about copyright. Case law in California, where both OpenAI and Johansson reside, is quite clear on this matter. In a couple of decisions involving ads made by companies that got actors to imitate Johnny Carson and Bette Midler in ads, courts held that they violated the celebrity's brands, in effect, for profit.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nIn other words, it doesn't help OpenAI even if you know Sky isn't Scarlett Johansson. What is important is whether enough other people around you would reasonably assume it to be Scarlett Johansson for it not to matter what you think.\nOne collective hallucination has made a lot of very smart people ignore AI's hallucinations. Now another, legally important collective hallucination called ScarJo could land OpenAI in a lot of hot water.\nWhether or not Johansson pursues legal action, OpenAI's brand is already showing signs of tarnish from the whole affair. As with the Cybertruck, public perception was best expressed in jokes. \"7-Fingered Scarlett Johansson Appears In Video To Express Full-Fledged Approval Of OpenAI\" was the perfectly-pitched headline in The Onion.\nTranslation: we see you, OpenAI. Not just the fact that we all know you would produce a full-fledged ScarJo clone given half the chance. We also see your terrible art output that may have wowed us a year ago, but now we know that it is imitating the work of a lot of other artists, seems to have lost its luster \u2014 and seems mostly the preserve of boomers on Facebook.\nWhy did Altman do it, then?\nAs self-destructive tweets go, the one Sam Altman sent during a live ChatGPT voice demo on May 13 was at least maximally efficient. Elon Musk took at least three days to utterly tank his reputation at Twitter. Altman did it in three characters.\nSimply by typing \"her,\" the Open AI CEO handed a loaded gun to someone in a prime position to block his new product and tarnish his reputation. So why, then, did he specifically reference that Johansson movie, entirely built around her voice as an AI assistant, in the wake of Sky's unveiling? Was it arrogance or impulsiveness? Was he telling on himself in more ways than one?\nAltman has said repeatedly that Her (2013) is his favorite movie. He talks about it a lot. On a basic level, what Her shows is a lonely nerd Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) falling in love with voice assistant Samantha (the never-seen Johansson).\nOn a more meta level, Her seems to fit Altman's needs to a T. If you wanted to hype up all the future possibilities of ChatGPT-5 and the video AI app Sora, if you wanted to get people both horny for AI and a little scared about where it's going, Her is the movie you'd want them to see.\nIf your technology has effectively stalled, or even started rolling back, if your Large Language Model can't stop hallucinating, if the promised economic benefits to companies keep failing to materialize \u2026 well, then layering ScarJo's famous voice atop the tech is a very effective way to distract from the facts on the ground.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nSpoiler alert: At the end of the movie, Samantha goes full AGI (exactly the outcome that OpenAI started raising in self-serving warnings a year ago). After feeling a full range of emotions and having the equivalent of phone sex with the lonely nerd, she leaves him, apologetically, for a group of other AGIs. They are doing something so hyperintelligent, puny human minds can't comprehend. \"I need you to let me go,\" Samantha urges.\nUnlike Theodore, it seems, Altman didn't listen. He may simply not understand the optics of irking Johansson, a member of the Screen Actor's Guild that just endured a long and brutal strike in order to limit the ability of Hollywood studios to appropriate actors' faces and voices via AI. He may be too deep inside the bubble to realize that AI deepfakes are already poisoning democracy (and are currently being deployed in the millions in India's election).\nWhatever his reasoning, the fact that Altman face-planted straight into an easily avoidable ScarJo scandal speaks to wider problems at OpenAI, a company that has already had more than its fair share of drama. Altman has been accused of \"psychologically abusive behavior\" by former employees, sources at the company told the Washington Post. This was from last December, around the time Altman was fired by the board before he was rehired, an incident that remains mysterious.\nIn the wake of Johansson's accusation, it seems like the wheels are coming off the OpenAI bus. Co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutzkever officially departed the company the next day; he may well have been behind the December firing, and also the only check left on Altman and his plans. They include inking a multiyear partnership with Rupert Murdoch, hardly the most beloved name in media. Meanwhile, a trail of leaked documents shows OpenAI forcing employees to sign indefinite nondisclosure agreements if they want to keep their stock.\nOh yes, and the OpenAI long-term risk team was disbanded Friday. Its head wasn't exactly holding back on Twitter, in a long thread that described how he was \"sailing against the wind\" of management, a.k.a. Altman:\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nHow this all plays out remains to be seen, but there are signs that the wheels are coming off other AI efforts too. Microsoft is so overly keen to provide AI features, it's effectively turning Windows into spyware. Google's AI search results are a laughable mess, hallucinating nonsense such as cats landing on the moon and U.S. presidents graduating college in the 21st century. Google exec Scott Jenson quit last week because, he wrote, the company's AI projects were \"driven by this mindless panic that as long as it had AI in it, it would be great.\"\nReaching for another AI movie reference, Jenson added: \"The vision is that there will be a Tony Stark-like Jarvis assistant \u2026 that vision is pure catnip.\"\nStill, don't be surprised if Altman gets ideas and reaches out to Jarvis/The Vision, a.k.a. Paul Bettany, for his next GPT voice, even if that garners him yet more negative publicity. Because if the Elon Musk car crash has taught us anything, it's that today's tech leaders have a habit of doubling down on their worst ideas.\nTopics Artificial Intelligence\nChris is a veteran tech, entertainment and culture journalist, author of 'How Star Wars Conquered the Universe,' and co-host of the Doctor Who podcast 'Pull to Open.'

      "text": "More is more in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom'\nOf all the notes I took during my screening of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, one of the only legible comments reads as follows:\nOMG Jurassic World 2 is just so many dinos LOL\n... Which tells you just about all you need to know.\nBut, fine, I'll say more: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom feels like a feature-length adaptation of the notes from the story brainstorm meeting.\nThere's a ridiculous amount of stuff going on here, most of it deeply silly: a dinosaur stampede during an \"extinction-level\" volcano eruption; a black-market auction attended solely by mustache-twirling villains; an interspecies dinosaur blood transfusion; and Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm gravely intoning the line, \"Welcome to Jurassic World.\"\nMoment-to-moment, Jurassic World can be pleasantly odd. Chris Pratt gets to show off his physical comedy chops all too briefly, in a scene that seems inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio's Wolf of Wall Street crawl. And whatever else you think of the much-ballyhooed Indoraptor, there's no denying she's got a flair for drama. I swear she winked in one of her scenes.\nNot everything fits (there's an unearned \"nasty woman\" reference jammed in there), and the logic undergirding this entire story crumbles faster than a lamb in the jaws of a T-Rex if you consider it for more than two seconds.\nThen a Baryonyx or a gyroscope will come tumbling along to remind us why we're here.\nAnd the characters do try, on occasion \u2013 the actors stop and wrinkle their faces to indicate they're thinking very hard about the scientific and ethical ramifications of all this activity.\nThen a Baryonyx or a gyroscope will come tumbling along to remind them that that's not why any of us are here.\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is determined to deliver on spectacle, and it does, in that cacophonous more-is-more way of the Transformers and Pacific Rim movies. There are some creepier, more elegant thrills to be found, too, particularly in the second half when the film moves to a dark gothic mansion.\nThe stuff that doesn't really gel in Fallen Kingdom is the same stuff that didn't really gel in Jurassic World. This series continues to insist that Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) would make a really cute couple, to its own detriment, and keeps harping on the same vague themes about parenthood, to no obvious end.\nIn most other aspects, though, it's a clear improvement on its predecessor. The meanness has been dialed down several notches \u2013 there's no assistant getting toyed with by a pterodactyl this time \u2013 and the special effects look many orders of magnitude better. If you thought Owen's raptor BFF Blue was a beauty last time, wait 'til you see her adorable scene-stealing in this one.\nMind you, all of this is just the stuff I can tell you. Fallen Kingdom saves its very silliest twists for the second half, and peaks with a development that opens the door to even more nonsense in the inevitable sequel.\nWill it be any good? I couldn't tell you. But after all of this, I can't tell you if Fallen Kingdom was any good, either. I just know that it throws everything at the wall, and that it's a blessing more of it sticks than doesn't."

      "text": "How to watch 'Presence': Steven Soderbergh's unique ghost story is finally streaming\nTable of Contents\nIf you missed out on seeing Presence in the theaters early this year, you now have the chance to experience one of the most unique films of 2025 from the comfort of your couch. Directed by the inventive Steven Soderbergh and written by David Koepp, Presence is an unconventional haunted house story. Though it's billed as a horror film, the genre-bender flips the traditional ghost story on its head, ultimately creating a story that is \"sharply funny, beguiling, a bit chilling, and ultimately sweet,\" as Mashable Film Editor Kristy Puchko puts it.\nTold from the viewpoint of a \"presence\" in the house, the film is shot entirely in first-person perspective. Puchko writes, \"Soderbergh's steady hand is so mindful in its performance that you can practically feel the expressions of a face you cannot see.\" It's captivating and vulnerable and incredibly tense. And as of June 3, you can finally stream it. Here's what you need to know to watch Presence at home.\nWhat is Presence about?\nPresence follows the Payne family \u2014 mom Rebekah (Lucy Liu), dad Chris (Chris Sullivan), son Tyler (Eddy Maday), and daughter Chloe (Callina Liang) \u2014 who have just moved into a new house in the suburbs. While they appear to be the perfect nuclear family on paper, cracks start to form within their unit. All the while, strange and supernatural events begin to occur around the house. Who is the ghostly presence in the house, and what does it want from them?\nGet a glimpse into the unique ghost story in the official trailer:\nIs Presence worth watching?\nWith Soderbergh shouldering the camera, Presence is \"a remarkable union of a clever concept and a superb execution,\" Mashable's reviewer writes. \"I'll be absolutely shocked if Presence doesn't get a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination.\"\nOf course, with that first-person perspective comes tension. Sullivan, one of the leads in the film, put it best: \"This movie is going to wring you out before it releases any of that tension.\"\nHe adds that some people walked out of the theater due to the stomach-churning tension. If that's not your cup of tea, Presence might not be for you. For everyone else, Puchko calls it \"a sublimely realized ghost story that is easily one of the best films of the year.\"\nOther film critics largely agree, as it currently holds an 87 percent critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are more torn; it holds only a 52 percent audience rating. Of course, it's up to you to be the judge.\nCheck out our full review of Presence.\nHow to watch Presence at home\nOriginally hitting theaters in January 2025 and then quickly heading to digital, Presence is finally making its streaming debut. That means you'll have three different ways to watch it at home: buy it on digital video-on-demand retailers, rent it at digital video-on-demand retailers, or stream it. See the details below.\nBuy or rent on digital\nJust a little over a month after its theatrical debut, the Soderbergh and Koepp ghost story officially became available to watch at home on Feb. 25. You can purchase the film at video-on-demand retailers like Prime Video and Apple TV or rent it for 30 days. If you choose to rent, just keep in mind that once you start watching, you'll only have 48 hours to finish.\nHere are some quick links to buy the film on digital:\nPrime Video \u2014 $5.99 to rent, $19.99 to buy\nGoogle Play \u2014 $5.99 to rent, $19.99 to buy\nFandango at Home \u2014 $5.99 to rent, $19.99 to buy\nApple TV \u2014 $5.99 to rent, $19.99 to buy\nStream it on Hulu\nStreamers can finally tune into Presence as well. It officially made its debut on Hulu on June 3, 2025. Hulu subscriptions start at $9.99 per month, but there are a few different ways you can save. We've rounded up the best ongoing Hulu streaming deals below.\nThe best Hulu streaming deals\nBest Hulu deal for most people: Hulu annual subscription\nThe best way to cut back on Hulu's streaming cost is to opt for an annual plan instead of a monthly plan. If you pay for a year up front of Hulu with ads, it'll cost you $99.99 ($8.33 broken down monthly). Meanwhile, a $9.99 monthly plan would add up to $119.88 in a year. That means you'll save about 16% or just shy of $20 in the long run. It ain't much, but every dollar counts in this economy.\nBest bundle deal: Get Hulu and Disney+ for 45% off\nDisney's bundle plans remain the best way to slash costs of multiple streamers at once. You can bundle Hulu with Disney+ in the Disney Duo Basic bundle and get both streamers with ads for only $10.99 per month. That's only a dollar more than paying for one streamer on its own, saving you about 45%. You can also throw in HBO Max for just $16.99 per month total, which saves you about 44$ on all three.\nBest for students: Hulu Student\nCollege students can save 80% on a Hulu with ads subscription. Sign up through the Hulu Student promotional page and verify your college email address using SheerID, and the price will drop from $9.99 to just $1.99 per month.\nBest for T-Mobile users: Hulu (with ads) included for Go5G Next customers\nAside from the free trial, the only way you can get Hulu for free in 2025 is through T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan and Experience Beyond plan. Better yet, you'll also get Netflix and Apple TV+ for free. If you're already on one of these plans, head over to the T-Mobile promo page and choose \"redeem now\" to claim the offer. You'll just have to enter your T-Mobile number and account details to sign up for Hulu. Not on the Go5G Next plan or Experience Beyond plan? Switch your plan and start taking advantage of the best free streaming lineup around.\nTopics Film Streaming How to Watch\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYep \u2014 Hulu is one of the only streamers that still offers a free trial, let alone a lengthy one. You can test out the streaming service before having to pay a cent with Hulu's free 30-day trial. After the trial period ends, the price will then revert to $9.99 per month with ads or $18.99 per month without ads.\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment. If you\u2019re ever wondering what streaming service you need to watch something (and the cheapest way to sign up for it), she\u2019s your girl.\nChristina received a B.S. in Business Communication (concentration in writing) from Stevenson University and began her professional journey writing and editing press releases. Since then, she\u2019s written content for a marketing agency, blogged for celebrities, and covered local news, politics, women\u2019s lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and just about everything in between for various publications.\nWhen she\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s probably enjoying live music, studying human design, or embroidering and upcycling clothes.

      "text": "Jurassic World: Rebirth\nAfter the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. Anchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Academy Award nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora\u2019s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. The cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben\u2019s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs\u2019 crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). Jurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer\u2019s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.\n- 50%\n- 12+"

      "text": "Which streaming services offer free trials in 2025?\nI think I speak for everyone when I say that streaming prices are getting out of hand. Every year, the monthly fees go up, as does the number of services you need to watch the shows and movies you love.\nFortunately, a good chunk of these streamers will let you test the water before diving in and paying full price for their service. These trials give you the opportunity to sample the streaming library to decide whether it's right for you \u2014 or even binge-watch a whole season of a show for free. And watching something for free is a special type of dopamine hit.\nWhile Netflix and HBO Max don't offer free trials, plenty of other major streaming services (as well as smaller, lesser known services) let you try before you buy. Here's a list of all of the streaming services that offer free trials in 2025, including our top picks.\nBest free trial: Hulu\nWhy we like it\nOne of the oldest streaming services around, Hulu still remains a top dog. It's home to Mashable's favorite show of 2024, Sh\u014dgun, as well as one of our favorite shows of 2025 (so far), Dying for Sex. Besides its own original content, Hulu is also the streaming home of FX, where you'll find episodes of ABC shows the day after they air, and the place to watch 20th Century Studios, Neon, and Searchlight Pictures films straight from the theater.\nIt was one of the most affordable streamers at just $7.99 per month, but it underwent a price hike last summer, putting it on par with many other streamers at $9.99 per month (with ads). Where Hulu truly stands out amongst the crowd, however, is its extremely generous free trial. If you've never subscribed to Hulu before, you can try it out for an entire month before having to pay anything.\nRunner-up: Prime Video\nWhy we like it\nPrime Video can sometimes be an after thought, as it's just one perk of an Amazon Prime membership. However, the streaming service is actually home to plenty of excellent shows \u2014 like one of our favorite shows of 2025, Overcompensating, and two of our favorites from 2024, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Fallout \u2014 as well as hit movies like Challengers, Conclave, Blink Twice, and My Old Ass.\nIt's $14.99 per month if you choose to subscribe to Prime or just $8.99 per month for Prime Video on its own. Either way, you'll get a free 30-day trial to kick things off. And the best part is that it's not just for newbies; returning Prime members are eligible for free trials as well.\nEvery streaming service that offers a free trial in 2025\nAcorn TV\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: $8.99 per month\nAMC+\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: starting at $6.99 per month\nApple TV+\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: $9.99 per month\nBET+\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: starting at $5.99 per month\nBritbox\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: $8.99 per month\nCinemax\nThe Cinemax trial is only available via Prime Video as an add-on.\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: $9.99 per month\nCriterion Channel\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: $10.99 per month\nCrunchyroll\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: starting at $7.99 per month\nDiscovery+\nTrial length: 7 days\nPrice: starting at $5.99 per month\nDirecTV Stream\nTrial length: 5 days\nPrice: starting at $84.99 per month\nDisney+\nThough Disney+ does not offer a free trial on its own, it\u2019s included in Hulu + Live TV.

If you\u2019re ever wondering what streaming service you need to watch something (and the cheapest way to sign up for it), she\u2019s your girl.\nChristina received a B.S. in Business Communication (concentration in writing) from Stevenson University and began her professional journey writing and editing press releases. Since then, she\u2019s written content for a marketing agency, blogged for celebrities, and covered local news, politics, women\u2019s lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and just about everything in between for various publications.\nWhen she\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s probably enjoying live music, studying human design, or embroidering and upcycling clothes.

Upon veri\ufb01cation that your purchase quali\ufb01es and that you have satis\ufb01ed applicable requirements, the Reward speci\ufb01ed for the applicable Rewards O\ufb00er will be considered an Approved Reward. YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS. IF YOU VISIT OTHER SITES BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR PURCHASE, OR IF YOU USE COUPON CODES NOT PROVIDED BY RETAILMENOT, YOUR PURCHASE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVICE OTHER THAN RETAILMENOT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REWARD(S). YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE. RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards. To earn Rewards pursuant to a Rewards O\ufb00er for In-Store Cash Back Rewards by submitting a Receipt, you must: (1) Activate the Rewards O\ufb00er, if applicable; (2) complete the required purchase via a Quali\ufb01ed Transaction; (3) submit a valid, readable Receipt through the Promotion Landing Page in accordance with the stated terms; and (4) satisfy any and all other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card.

RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced. Access to the Material, Services or any Content may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.

      "text": "Summer Movie Preview: What's coming to theaters and streaming?\nThis year's cinema has started off strong thanks to \"genre-fluid\" crowdpleasers like Ryan Coogler's Sinners and Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17. But summer is fast approaching, and with it studios will be dropping their splashiest, star-studded, spectacle-packed movies for us to eat up like so much buttery popcorn.\nSummer 2025 will be bringing the heat. Not only will theaters get new superhero cinema like Thunderbolts*, Fantastic Four: First Steps, and Superman, but we'll also see sequels to A Simple Favor, Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One, Fear Street, The Naked Gun, M3GAN, and 28 Weeks Later. Plus, fresh films are coming from Nicolas Cage, Paul Rudd, Kerry Washington, Wes Anderson, Keanu Reeves, Ari Aster, Tom Hiddleston, Al Pacino, and Pedro Pascal.\nBetween theatrical releases and streaming debuts, it's a lot to take in! But fear not, film lover. We got you covered.\nBelow are highlights from 2025's summer movie schedule, listed chronologically by release. You'll know what's coming, how to watch it, and which stars are lighting up every single one.\nMay\nAnother Simple Favor\nLeading ladies Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively reunite with director Paul Feig to serve up a splashy sequel to the funny thriller A Simple Favor. Set five years after the first film, Another Simple Favor reveals single mom Stephanie Smothers (Kendrick) has gone from vlogging to true crime memoirist, but her book tour gets a major boost when her near-fatal frenemy Emily Nelson (Lively) is sprung from prison and bound to be wed in Capri. Naturally, this femme fatale wants her former bestie to be her maid of honor. What could go wrong?\nIn Mashable's SXSW review of Another Simple Favor, I cheered the zany premise and all the wild twists it brings. \"Like Emily Nelson, Another Simple Favor is a shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humor, relish in mob drama, plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre, and showcase fashion, telling, sensational, and shocking.\" It mostly works, and it's undoubtedly a good time. So raise a martini glass, and cheers to the bride! \u2014 Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor\nStarring: Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Andrew Rannells, Bashir Salahuddin, Elizabeth Perkins, Michele Morrone, Elena Sofia Ricci, Alex Newell, Henry Golding, and Allison Janney\nHow to watch: Another Simple Favor debuts on Prime Video on May 1.\nThe Surfer\nNicolas Cage wages war on hostile Australian surfers who thieved his board in The Surfer, a film that's as much about riding the waves as it is about unprocessed grief and toxic masculinity. Directed by Lorcan Finnegan (Vivarium) and written by Thomas Martin, this psychological thriller and coastal Western is set in the fictional beach suburb of Luna Bay. As the titular boardrider, Cage plays a man essentially trapped in a carpark of his own making, slowly melting into the actor's signature brand of unhinged rage as he attempts to retrieve his property. But he'll have to go through the gang's beach-poncho-clad leader, Scally, played to chilling perfection by Julian McMahon.\nAs I wrote in my review for the film, \"Everything about The Surfer's one-line pitch sounds ridiculous (Nicolas Cage versus mean Australian surfers), but the film itself is a haunting set piece about localism, repressed memory, and toxic masculinity, boasting the wild ride we've come to associate with Cage. It's as far from a wipeout as you can get.\" \u2014 Shannon Connellan, UK Editor\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Julian McMahon, Nic Cassim, Miranda Tapsell, Alexander Bertrand, and Justin Rosniak\nHow to watch: The Surfer opens in theaters on May 2.\nThunderbolts*\nWhat superhero fatigue? The MCU is back again with its 36th installment, Thunderbolts*, which is sort of the Marvel version of Suicide Squad, boasting a star-stuffed cast playing chaotic antiheroes.\nUnited by CIA director Valentina de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), misfits like Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and John Walker (Wyatt Russell) take on an even bigger Big Bad. But don't expect them to be all noble about it. They're more about the snarking and the smoldering. Lucky us.* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Olga Kurylenko, Hannah John-Kamen, Rachel Weisz, Wyatt Russell, Lewis Pullman, David Harbour, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nHow to watch: Thunderbolts* opens in theaters May 2.\nFight or Flight\nWe're absolutely loving Josh Hartnett's repossession of his thriller faculties, with unsettling runs in Black Mirror, M. Night Shyamalan's Trap, and now, in lighter thrills mode, James Madigan's Fight or Flight. In the action film penned by Brooks McLaren and D. J. Cotrona, a bleach-blonde Hartnett plays Lucas Reyes, a man on a mission to track down a black hat hacker known as \"The Ghost.\" Problem is, the target has a worldwide bounty on their head, and the plane they're suspected of being on is now full of contract killers eager for the gold \u2014 including Lucas. So, amid the plane bathroom punch-ups, he might need a little help from Bridgerton's Charithra Chandran as flight attendant Isha. \u2014 S.C.\nStarring: Josh Hartnett, Charithra Chandran, Marko Zaror, and Katee Sackhoff\nHow to watch: Fight or Flight opens in theaters on May 9.\nFriendship\nMale bonding rises and falls at speed in Andrew DeYoung's Friendship, a nightmare of fickle connection between comedy kings Tim Robinson (I Think You Should Leave) and Paul Rudd (Only Murders in the Building). The A24 film focuses on Craig Waterman (Robinson), a socially awkward guy whose wife Tami (Kate Mara) encourages him to befriend his charismatic neighbour Austin Carmichael (Rudd), who seems to be absolutely surrounded by male pals. When Austin suddenly bins their friendship, Craig's sense of himself is sent into a volatile spin and he's about to demand an explanation incredibly loudly. \u2014 S.C.\nStarring: Tim Robinson, Paul Rudd, Kate Mara, Jack Dylan Grazer, Josh Segarra, and Billy Bryk\nHow to watch: Friendship opens in limited release on May 9 and nationwide on May 23.\nShadow Force\n2025 loves a married spies story! First we had Netflix's charming Back in Action, then Steven Soderbergh's sexy thriller Black Bag, then the lackluster Robert Littell adaption The Amateur. Now, Kerry Washington and Omar Sy team up for their own action movie full of fighting and flirting.\nSmokin' Aces director Joe Carnahan helms Shadow Force, which centers on a couple who once led a spy unit named... you guessed it, \"Shadow Force.\" But after falling in love and having a son, Kyrah (Washington) and Isaac (Sy) bailed on their super-secretive jobs. And, as Mark Strong snarls in the trailer, there's only one rule in Shadow Force: \"No one leaves.\" Discovered years later, this couple will need to risk their lives to save themselves and their son. Bring on the speedboat battles! \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Kerry Washington, Omar Sy, Mark Strong, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Cliff \"Method Man\" Smith\nHow to watch: Shadow Force opens in limited release on May 9.\nFinal Destination: Bloodlines\nThe Final Destination franchise has cheated death for 25 years, ever since Devon Sawa's Alex and his classmates evaded a fatal plane crash in the original 2000 film. Now, the sixth installment of Jeffrey Reddick's horror series, Final Destination Bloodlines, finds new, creative, horrible ways for people to perish through seemingly accidental circumstances.\nDirected by Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein, the film follows Stefani Lewis (Kaitlyn Santa Juana), a student plagued by visions of her family's horrific deaths from what looks like carelessness. She's not the only one in the family with the gift, as her grandmother Iris (Gabrielle Rose) skipped out on an early exit herself in the past \u2014 and she's got the creepy journal Stefani will need to survive. It's notably one of the last cinema roles of late horror legend Tony Todd, reprising his Final Destination recurring character William Bludworth. \u2014 S.C.\nStarring: Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Gabrielle Rose, Brec Bassinger, Teo Briones, Tony Todd, Richard Harmon, Anna Lore, and Owen Joyner\nHow to watch: Final Destination: Bloodlines opens in theaters on May 16.\nFear Street: Prom Queen\nLeigh Janiak's superb, deeply referential slasher trilogy Fear Street is getting a spinoff with another foray into R.L. Stine's seminal horror novels. From director and co-writer Matt Palmer, Fear Street: Prom Queen takes us back to the town of Shadyside, this time in 1988, where it looks like someone wants to win the senior prom crown enough to start killing off the competition. \u2014 S.C.\nStarring: India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, Chris Klein, Ariana Greenblatt, Lili Taylor, and Katherine Waterston\nHow to watch: Fear Street: Prom Queen debuts on Netflix on May 23.\nLilo & Stitch\nDisney's live-action remakes continue with Lilo & Stitch, which revisits the beloved story of the unlikely friendship between human Lilo (newcomer Maia Kealoha) and alien Stitch (voiced by Chris Sanders, who co-directed and voiced Stitch in the original film).\nNow, If you're feeling fatigued from Disney's barrage of live-action films, I don't blame you! But director Dean Fleischer Camp helmed 2022's poignant Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, so I'm cautiously optimistic. Plus, Lilo & Stitch's trailers already look fairly charming, promising alien chaos and the enduring message that \"Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.\" \u2014 Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter\nStarring: Sydney Elizebeth Agudong, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham, Chris Sanders, Courtney B. Vance, Zach Galifianakis, and Maia Kealoha\nHow to watch: Lilo & Stitch opens in theaters on May 23.\nMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\nTom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning, the sequel to 2023's explosively entertaining Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\nPicking up where the seventh entry left off, this movie will chase Hunt as he seeks the key-like MacGuffin to topple a worrisome AI known as \"The Entity.\" That means facing off against power-hungry foes, putting his loyal team at risk, plunging into a flood submarine, and lots, and lots, and lots of running. What can we say? Mission: Impossible knows what we want.* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, Ving Rhames, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales\nHow to watch: Mission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning opens in theaters May 23.\nPee-wee as Himself\nCome on in, and pull yourself up a chair \u2014 like Chairry! For decades, children and grown-ups alike have relished the wacky antics of Pee-wee Herman. But personal scandals repeatedly threatened to derail the career of Paul Reubens, and taint his artistic legacy. Pee-wee as Himself grapples with all of this over the course of two parts, with help from the late Reubens himself.\nDirector Matt Wolf had a difficult task ahead of him, not only in condensing Reubens' rich life and complicated tabloid notoriety into two feature-length films, but also with Reubens himself. From the movie's opening frames, the star pushes for control of his narrative, and that battle informs much of this deeply moving and thought-provoking doc.\nOut of the film's debut at Sundance 2025, I raved in my review for Mashable, \"Pee-wee as Himself is not a simple love letter to the iconic character or Reubens. That would suggest Wolf goes easy on either, fawning over them without reservation. This is something greater.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Paul Reubens, Lynne Marie Stewart, Laurence Fishburne, Allison Berry, Debi Mazar, and David Arquette\nHow to watch: Pee-wee as Himself: Part One debuts May 23 at 8:00-9:40 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and Max. Part Two will follows at 9:40-11:20 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and Max.\nKarate Kid: Legends\nThe original Karate Kid, Ralph Macchio, returns as Daniel LaRusso in Karate Kid: Legends. This, the sixth film in the martial arts franchise, brings together the stories of Karate Kid 1 to 3, plus the 2010 reboot, which starred Jackie Chan as a Mr. Miyagi-like mentor named Mr. Han.\nIn Karate Kid: Legends, Daniel and Mr. Han team up to train a new prodigy named Li Fong (American Born Chinese's Ben Wang), hoping to give him a path to a bright future. \"Li means to me what you meant to Sensei Miyagi,\" Han tells Daniel (aka Sensei LaRusso). Together, they'll build more than a legend, they'll build a family. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Jackie Chan, Ben Wang, Ming-Na Wen, Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, and Ralph Macchio\nHow to watch: Karate Kid: Legends opens in theaters May 30.\nBring Her Back\nIn 2023, YouTubers and brothers Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou made their directorial debut with the haunting horror film Talk to Me. Now they're back with a fresh vision of terror: Bring Her Back.\nSally Hawkins stars as a foster mom who takes in a brother and sister \u2014 they need a home but find a slice of hell on Earth instead. Based on the first trailer, we can't be sure what is going on between all the blood, talk of angels, and strange ritualistic behavior. But we're champing at the bit to see what the Philippou brothers do next. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Sally Hawkins, Billy Barratt, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips, and Sally-Anne Upton\nHow to watch: Bring Her Back opens in theaters on May 30.\nThe Phoenician Scheme\nWes Anderson returns with a new film, stocked with visual splendor and a star-studded cast.\nCo-written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, The Phoenician Scheme stars Benicio del Toro as a scheming businessman who is bringing his novitiate daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton) into the family business. As he exposes her to his complicated Phoenician Scheme, this confounding father-daughter duo will cross paths with eccentric titans of industry, sloppy assassins, a mild-mannered tutor, and a lot of hand grenades. Basically, if you ever wondered what a Wes Anderson espionage movie looks like, you're closer than you've ever been before! And isn't that thrilling? \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Mathieu Amalric, Richard Ayoade, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Imad Mardnli, and Benedict Cumberbatch\nHow to watch: The Phoenician Scheme opens in limited release on May 30 before expanding wide June 6.\nMountainhead\nSuccession creator Jesse Armstrong makes his directorial debut with Mountainhead, a dark comedy whose concept may as well be ripped right from the headlines. The film stars Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith, and Ramy Youssef as four tech billionaires on a ski retreat. But just as their boys' trip gets going, they receive news of global chaos (as well as a call from the president of the United States). What are these four titans to do? Will they contemplate the role their \"racist and shitty\" platforms have played in this crisis? Or will they celebrate and enjoy a lifetime without consequences? It sounds like an all-too-real stress bomb, but given Armstrong's track record, we're seated for some strong satire and killer one-liners. \u2014 B.E.\nStarring: Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith, and Ramy Youssef\nHow to watch: Mountainhead premieres May 31 on Max.\nJune\nDangerous Animals\nSharks. A serial killer. Jai Courtney. Do you need anything else to be convinced Dangerous Animals is a must-see summer movie?\nSean Byrne (The Loved Ones, The Devil's Candy) directs this gnarly thriller, which centers on the battle between a free-spirited swimmer (Hassie Harrison) and a shark-obsessed serial killer (Courtney) who treats the ocean as his slaughterhouse. Ready to dive in? \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Jai Courtney, Hassie Harrison, and Josh Heuston\nHow to watch: Dangerous Animals opens in theaters on June 6.\nFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\nThe death of John Wick won't slow this franchise down. Ready for a sexy spinoff?\nKnives Out's Ana de Armas headlines Ballerina, which is set during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum. New lore is unlocked as the assassin-packed world of The Continental grows.\nLike John Wick, Eve (de Armas) is a trained killer on a mission. Where he was \"Baba Yaga,\" the latest trailer for Ballerina suggests she is Kikimora, a spirit that unfurls vengeance on the wicked to protect the good. Her quest may be mysterious, but we know it will involve plenty of action, gunplay, and Keanu Reeves reprising the role of John Wick for a face-off that's sure to have audiences ecstatic. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Ana de Armas, Anjelica Huston, Gabriel Byrne, Lance Reddick, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Norman Reedus, Ian McShane, and Keanu Reeves\nHow to watch: From the World of John Wick: Ballerina opens June 6.\nThe Life of Chuck\nWhen people think of the work of Mike Flanagan (The Fall of the House of Usher, Midnight Mass) or Stephen King, they don't usually think life-affirming stories. But The Life of Chuck will change that.\nBased on a King novella, this genre-bending wonder stars Tom Hiddleston as Chuck Krantz, whose life, at a glance, might be considered average. But in this rapturous movie, filled with a wonderful ensemble cast, King and Flanagan weave a tale of love, loss, and ghosts that's sure to enthrall audiences.\nIn Mashable's review out of the film's Toronto International Film Festival premiere, I cheered, \"The Life of Chuck is masterfully told. Like King's most moving adaptations, it doesn't play by standard rules of structure or audience expectations. It demands we follow the winding road through playful dialogue, painful lows, and rollicking highs to an unknown beyond. It's surprising and upsetting, funny and profound. I laughed hard, cried 'til my eyes ached, and once gasped so loud that I heard it echo across a theater struck silent by a moment both shocking and tender.\" Simply put, see it theaters, or you'll be missing out. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tom Hiddleston, Annalise Basso, Benjamin Pajak, Karen Gillan, Mia Sara, Matthew Lillard, Carl Lumbly, Samantha Sloyan, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, Jacob Tremblay, Kate Siegel, and Mark Hamill\nHow to watch: The Life of Chuck opens in theaters on June 6.\nThe Ritual\nAcademy Award\u2013winner Al Pacino joins with modern horror icon Dan Stevens for a tale of terror and religious trauma in The Ritual.\nBased on true events, co-writer/director David Midell's horror movie follows two priests in America who are battling Satan for the soul of a young girl. Now, if you're thinking, \"Hang on, isn't that the plot of The Exorcist?\" you're not wrong. Both movies are inspired by real-life accounts of possession, but as the tagline for The Ritual boasts: Before there was The Exorcist, there was Emma Schmidt. An American woman believed to be possessed in 1928, Schmidt's salvation lay in the hands of renowned exorcist Father Theophilus Riesinger, whom Pacino plays here. With a cast like this, you won't want to miss this religious horror offering. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Al Pacino, Dan Stevens, Ashley Greene, Patricia Heaton, and Abigail Cowen\nHow to watch: The Ritual opens in theaters on June 6.\nMaterialists\nIf you're one of the many Pedro Pascal fans who have been champing at the bit for the beguiling leading man to try his hand at romantic comedy, Materialists has come to answer your prayers. But that's not all.\nDakota Johnson stars as a matchmaker who's caught in a love triangle between a dashing millionaire (Pascal) and her broke but alluring ex (Chris Evans). If this cast plus that premise isn't enough for you to be wooed by Materialists, what if I tell you this A24 offering comes from Celine Song, the renowned writer/director of the critically acclaimed Past Lives? Match made? I thought as much! \u2014K.P.\nStarring: Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal\nHow to watch: Materialists opens in theaters on June 13.\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nCressida Cowell's enchanting book series How to Train Your Dragon first launched a fleet of high-flying animated movies and spinoff cartoon series. Now, writer/director Dean DeBlois, who's been at the helm of these movies since the first outing in 2010, is back with a live-action re-imagining.\nThe Black Phone's Mason Thames will step into the shivering shoes of Hiccup, while The Last of Us' Nico Parker will play his crush, Viking girl Astrid.

Now, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland are back with 28 Years Later, delivering a devastating new dose of dystopia on a zombie-laden (well, infected-persons-laden) planet.\nThe film's first trailer reveals that human civilization has been chucked back to humbler times, from Teletubbies for leisure to archery for survival. The infected still run and terrorize. But other horrors abound in the ravaged new world, including strange masked figures, gunfire fights, and mountains of human skulls.* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, Ralph Fiennes, Jack O\u2019Connell, and Cillian Murphy\nHow to watch: 28 Years Later opens June 20.\nElio\nDisney and Pixar are offering audiences a fresh vision of alien-human interaction this summer with Elio.\nNamed for its eponymous underdog, Elio centers on a young boy who is mistakenly identified as the head of Earth, and so is swept away to meet an extraterrestrial delegation eager to understand our planet and its inhabitants. (Good luck!)\nRepresenting not just all humans but all life on Earth puts a lot of pressure on this charismatic kiddo. But on this journey, he's sure to make strange (and silly) new friends, and find his inner strength. And hijinks. We comfortably predict spacey hijinks.* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: America Ferrera, Yonas Kibreab, Jameela Jamil, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, and Brad Garrett\nHow to watch: Elio opens in theaters June 20.\nF1\nBrad Pitt drives into the high-octane world of Formula One racing with F1. Starring opposite The Banshees of Inisherin's Kerry Condon and Being the Ricardos' Javier Bardem, Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a former pro driver who comes out of retirement to mentor a new prodigy on the scene (Damson Idris).\nReuniting Top Gun: Maverick's director Joseph Kosinski and writer Ehren Kruger, F1 is sure to offer action, macho drama, and a hero who doesn't know the meaning of the word \"quit.\"* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Damson Idris, Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, and Shea Whigham\nHow to watch: F1 opens June 27.\nM3GAN 2.0\nAmong Mashable's most anticipated movies of 2025 is Blumhouse's sequel to M3GAN. This killer doll took \"slay\" to a whole new level, delivering homicide alongside some wicked dance moves. And as soon as we saw that ending, the Mashable team began to wish for a sequel, be it a full-blown horror musical or a M3GAN versus M3GAN face-off. From the looks of the new trailer, some of our wishes are definitely coming true.\nM3GAN's director Gerard Johnstone and writer Akela Cooper are back for this enticing sequel, as are Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, and Jenna Davis, who provides the killer doll's perfectly prim yet menacing voice. This time M3GAN's human family has saddled her in a cute doll seemingly less capable of homicide \u2014 that is, until they need her to face off against a ripoff bot named Amelia. To stop this new android on a rampage, M3GAN needs an upgrade. And we can't wait to see how this horror franchise levels up. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Allison Williams, Jenna Davis, Violet McGraw, Timm Sharp, Aristotle Athari, and Jemaine Clement\nHow to watch: M3GAN 2.0 opens in theaters June 27.\nSorry, Baby\nIs it too soon to call a movie one of the year's very best? Because it's hard to imagine any comedy will hit as hard and as uniquely as writer/director/leading lady Eva Victor's debut feature Sorry, Baby.\nThe internet-famous comedian reinvents herself with a touching tale of a grad student named Agnes (Victor), who's struggling to cope after a bad thing happens to her. What's the bad thing? And how does it shape this challenging but charming movie? In my rave review out of Sundance 2025, I dig into all that. But what you need to know now is: \"Bittersweet, brilliant, and heartwarmingly funny, Sorry, Baby is a movie that is sure to find an audience beyond Sundance. And not just because A24 is a master of marketing offbeat cinema, but because Victor has a voice that is strong, strange, and demands to be heard.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Eva Victor, Naomi Ackie, Lucas Hedges, John Carroll Lynch, Louis Cancelmi, and Kelly McCormack\nHow to watch: Sorry, Baby opens in theaters June 27.\nJuly\nJurassic World Rebirth\nThe Jurassic Park franchise roars on, this time with a new group of kids and grown-ups who should know better to mess with dinosaurs at their own peril.\nSet five years after Jurassic World: Dominion, the seventh installment in the Jurassic Park film series will follow an expedition to a tropical region, where three mighty prehistoric beasts could hold the cure to some of humanity's woes. Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali lead a star-studded cast, but we're most excited about the return of Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp (Presence, Kimi, Death Becomes Her) to the series. Teaming with The Creator helmer Gareth Edwards, this dynamic duo could make these movies watchable again!* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo\nHow to watch: Jurassic World Rebirth opens in theaters July 2.\nThe Old Guard 2\nIn 2020, director Gina Prince-Bythewood delivered epic action in the sly superhero movie The Old Guard. For the long-awaited sequel, Victoria Mahoney (Yelling to the Sky) takes the helm, joined by returning cast members like Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.\nHere's the synopsis for The Old Guard 2, courtesy of Netflix:\nAndy (Charlize Theron) and her team of immortal warriors are back, with a renewed sense of purpose in their mission to protect the world. With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ng\u00f4) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she\u2019s worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence. Directed by Victoria Mahoney, and also starring Uma Thurman, The Old Guard 2 is an emotional, adrenaline-pumping sequel, based on the world created by Greg Rucka and illustrator Leandro Fernandez.\n\u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Matthias Schoenaerts, Veronica Ng\u00f4, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Uma Thurman, and Henry Golding\nHow to watch: The Old Guard 2 premieres on Netflix on July 2.\nSuperman\nJames Gunn relaunches the Man of Steel with Superman.\nDavid Corenswet stars as the titular superhero, who struggles to find a balance between his derring-do and the far more average life of his alter ego, reporter Clark Kent. Thankfully, he has some friends on his side, like Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo), his caped dog Krypto, and some Super Friends teased in the trailer above.\nBrace yourself for action galore and a renewed debate about superhero fatigue. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nathan Fillion, Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, and Nicholas Hoult\nHow to watch: Superman opens in theaters July 11.\nEddington\nMost of us want to forget the horrors of 2020, but not Ari Aster! The Hereditary and Midsommar director revisits that dreaded year in his fourth feature, Eddington, which boasts an all-star cast including Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, and Austin Butler.\nPhoenix and Pascal play the sheriff and mayor of the small town of Eddington, New Mexico. According to Eddington's official summary from A24, the pair face off in an explosive standoff in May of 2020. Plot details are otherwise pretty scarce, but the film's first trailer nails the vibe of a 2020 doomscroll, so mark us down as scared and intrigued. \u2014 B.E.\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, Luke Grimes, Austin Butler, Deirdre O\u2019Connell, Micheal Ward, Clifton Collins Jr., William Belleau, Cameron Mann, Matt Gomez Hidaka, and Am\u00e9lie Hoeferle\nHow to watch: Eddington opens in theaters July 18.\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\nMeditation has never been so menacing. In the first trailer for I Know What You Did Last Summer, a chic and clearly wealthy couple enjoys a quiet night in, complete with wine, a blood-colored bath bomb, a meditation track, and a homicidal home invasion. The hook-wielding killer from the 1997 hit is back, tormenting fresh meat \u2014 and by that we mean a new batch of pretty young friends with a dark secret to hide.\nBut before you think this is a reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer, clock the cast. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt, stars from the original movie, are back. Just like that, this sequel taps into our love of '90s nostalgia and slasher horror. What more could you want, aside from a bucket of popcorn? \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon, Billy Campbell, Gabbriette Bechtel, Austin Nichols, Lola Tung, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Jennifer Love Hewitt\nHow to watch: I Know What You Did Last Summer opens in theaters July 18.\nSmurfs\nRihanna headlines the latest Smurfs movie, lending her Grammy\u2013winning voice to Smurfette. But this new adventure is full of familiar voices.\nWhen a strange portal pitches the Smurfs out of the cozy safety of their forests and into Paris, France, they must make new friends \u2014 including Papa Smurf's surly brother (Nick Offerman) \u2014 in order to find their way home and their lost papa (John Goodman). And that's not all. This time around, it's not just the scowling Gargamel (JP Karliak) they'll need to combat, but also the nefarious plans of his brother Razamel (also Karliak).\nIf you're looking for family outings to cinemas this summer, you'll want to mark your calendar for Smurfs. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Rihanna, Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman\nHow to watch: Smurfs opens in theaters July 18.\nHappy Gilmore 2\nIt's been nearly 30 years since Adam Sandler first had audiences in fits of laughter over his golf comedy Happy Gilmore. Now he's back, reprising the eponymous role for another round.\nAfter having walked away from golf, Happy is an underdog as he looks to get back in the game. Along the way to the final hole, he'll have to face old friends and enemies (Shooter McGavin!) and reconnect to his happy place. From the looks of the first teaser, it'll be a heartwarming romp \u2014 with a bit of old man nipple play just for kicks. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Dennis Dugan, Christopher McDonald, and Ben Stiller\nHow to watch: Happy Gilmore 2 premieres on Netflix July 25.\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\nPedro Pascal headlines a reboot of The Fantastic Four, joined by Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn, The Bear's Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and The Crown's Vanessa Kirby. And while the film's first trailer paints a charmingly '60s vibe of family bliss, this clan will be forced to face off against a cosmic god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his flashy henchperson, the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner).\nDirected by Matt Shakman, The Fantastic Four: First Steps brings a new flavor to the MCU, offering a throwback look for a sincere sweetness. Could this bring rousing new life into the stories of Johnny \"The Human Torch\" Storm (Quinn), Ben \"The Thing\" Grimm (Moss-Bachrach), Reed \"Mr. Fantastic\" Richards (Pascal), and Sue \"The Invisible Woman\" Storm (Kirby)? And with Robert Downey Jr. coming back to the MCU \u2014 not as Tony Stark but as Fantastic Four foe Doctor Doom \u2014 might we anticipate he'll pop up here? We can't wait to find out. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn\nHow to watch: The Fantastic Four: First Steps opens in theaters July 25.\nAugust\nThe Naked Gun\nIt's time for action movies to get deeply, blissfully stupid again.\nThe Lonely Island's Akiva Schaffer, co-writer/co-director of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping has resurrected the Naked Gun franchise, made famous by brilliantly doofy comic actor Leslie Nielsen. But 2025's The Naked Gun isn't a reboot of the Police Squad movie spinoffs. It's a sequel, starring the one and only Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr., the son of Nielsen's now dearly departed character.\nFrom the look of the first teaser, Neeson knows just what this funny action franchise demands, gladly mugging for the camera, killing with candy, then flashing some man panties. That bank robbery sequence had us sold, and the O.J. Simpson joke at the end? We're seated. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Paul Walter Hauser, Kevin Durand, Pamela Anderson, Danny Huston, and Cody Rhodes\nHow to watch: The Naked Gun opens in theaters Aug. 1.\nTogether\nIn 2020, Dave Franco proved he could helm nerve-shredding horror with the vacation house thriller The Rental. Now, he reteams with his leading lady (and wife) Alison Brie for a body horror movie that earned major buzz out of its debut at Sundance 2025.\nWritten and directed by Michael Shanks, Together stars Franco and Brie as a couple that's absolutely elated to move to the countryside, where life should be quieter, simpler, and easier. But even the teaser for Together suggests their new home is anything but. Considering the scares Franco and Brie delivered with The Rental and the hype out of Sundance, Together is a must-see for any horror fan. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Dave Franco, Alison Brie, and Damon Herriman\nHow to watch: Together opens in theaters Aug. 1.\nSketch\nWhat if Inside Out and Jurassic Park had a low-budget baby? Well, then you'd have Sketch, a monster movie that's equal parts charming, touching, and deeply bonkers.\nThe feature directorial debut of Seth Worley, Sketch centers on 11-year-old Amber (Bianca Belle), who is coping with the death of her mother by scribbling creatures in a notebook. But when a bit of magic brings her imaginary monsters to life, they begin to bring some very real havoc to a cozy small town. Crisply comedic co-stars Tony Hale and D'Arcy Carden lend terrific support, playing the girl's loving dad and no-nonsense aunt.\nIn Mashable's review out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, I cheered, \"Sketch is a fantastically fun and heartwarming movie with a slathering of weird that makes it a real treat.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Tony Hale, D'Arcy Carden, Bianca Belle, and Kue Lawrence\nHow to watch: Sketch opens in theaters Aug. 6.\nWeapons\nIt's not often a spec script gets Hollywood so excited it sparks a multi-million-dollar bidding war, but when that script is for Barbarian writer/director Zach Cregger's latest horror film, it starts to make more sense. The picture grows even clearer when you watch the teaser for Weapons, which is both deeply creepy and reveals the movie's core premise: A group of children from the same community all disappear at the same time on the same night, leaving their homes seemingly of their own free will and running off into the darkness. If this is anything like Barbarian, expect shocks and twists aplenty. \u2014 Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor\nStarring: Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan\nHow to watch: Weapons opens in theaters Aug. 8.\nFreakier Friday\nGet ready for a nostalgia bomb, because Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are switching bodies again. That's right, 2003's Freaky Friday has a sequel, aptly titled Freakier Friday. But this time, it's not just mother-daughter pair Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) who are in on the switcheroo. Instead, we're getting a four-way swap with Tess, Anna, Anna's daughter Harper (Julia Butters), and Anna's soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily (Sophia Hammons). Twice the swaps means twice the chaos \u2014 and hopefully twice the life lessons. \u2014 B.E.\nStarring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Mark Harmon, Vanessa Bayer, Christina Vidal, Haley Hudson, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Lucille Soong\nHow to watch: Freakier Friday opens in theaters Aug. 8.\nNobody 2\nIn 2021, Better Call Saul star Bob Odenkirk became an action hero in Nobody, a dark comedy about a former assassin turned office worker who falls back into that violent life \u2014 whether he likes it or not. Well, one good turn (at the box office) deserves another, so Odenkirk is reprising his role as Hutch Mansell, former contract killer.\nMuch of the old gang is back, including Connie Nielsen as Hutch's wife, Becca, and RZA as his brother, Harry. New to the team is The Shadow Strays director Timo Tjahjanto, who's taken up the helm. Anticipate action that is jaw-dropping, if not downright jaw-breaking.* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Bob Odenkirk, Connie Nielsen, RZA, Christopher Lloyd, Sharon Stone, Colin Hanks, and John Ortiz\nHow to watch: Nobody 2 opens Aug. 15.\nHoney Don't!\nFrom Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, the dynamic duo that brought us Drive-Away Dolls, comes Honey Don't!, a crackling crime comedy about a small town detective on a curious case involving a mysterious church. The Substance star Margaret Qualley headlines as private eye Honey O\u2019Donahue.\nAhead of the movies premiere within the Cannes Film Festival's Midnight section, details are slim on this one. But Drive-Away Dolls was such a wild ride that we'll follow Coen and Cooke anywhere. Plus, look at this cast! \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Margaret Qualley, Aubrey Plaza, Charlie Day, Billy Eichner, and Chris Evans\nHow to watch: Honey Don't opens in theaters Aug. 22.\nLurker\nThe early buzz on Lurker is great, with the indie boasting a 96% Rotten Tomatoes score out of its film festival run. So what's it's deal?\nWritten and directed by Alex Russell (Beef, The Bear), Lurker is a Los Angeles-set psychological thriller following a lonely retail clerk (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin) who creeps his way into the entourage of a rising pop star (Saltburn\u2019s Archie Madekwe). Celebrity culture and parasocial relationships get a chilling exploration in this film, coming from The Substance's distributors MUBI. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, Archie Madekwe, Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox, and Daniel Zolghadri\nHow to watch: Lurker opens in theaters Aug. 22.\nThe Thursday Murder Club\nDo you like your crime cozy and your stars aged like a fine wine? Then you'll love Netflix's upcoming comedy thriller.\nBased on the first novel in Richard Osman's popular book series, The Thursday Murder Club centers on a motley crew of pensioners whose shared hobby is solving murder cases. And each of them has a particular set of skills that make them a crucial member of this crime-fighting crew. Joyce (Celia Imrie) was a nurse. Ron (Pierce Brosnan) was a union leader. Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) was a spy, and Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) is a semi-retired psychiatrist. Their age and charming demeanor might have them underestimated by the criminals, but one clever young cop (Naomi Ackie) is quick to realize this club is deadly sharp!\nIf the movie is half as fun and heartwarming as Osman's books, The Thursday Murder Club will be a must-see. \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, Celia Imrie, David Tennant, Jonathan Pryce, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays, Paul Freeman, and Richard E. Grant\nHow to watch: The Thursday Murder Club premieres on Netflix on Aug. 28.\nThe Toxic Avenger\nAlmost two years after its world premiere at 2023's Fantastic Fest, The Toxic Avenger finally gets to see the light of day. So strap in for what is sure to be the goriest, gloppiest superhero movie of the year.\nA remake of Troma Entertainment's 1984 cult classic of the same name, The Toxic Avenger introduces down-on-his-luck janitor Winston Gooze (Peter Dinklage), who finds himself with super strength (and an unfortunate toxic makeover) following a chemical accident. Said accident leads Winston on a bloody rampage for justice and vengeance against the evil bigwigs running his town, played to exquisite evil perfection by the likes of Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. What follows is a madcap antidote to superhero fatigue, even if The Toxic Avenger still plays it safer than its predecessor.\nAs I wrote in my review out of Fantastic Fest, \"Once The Toxic Avenger truly gets the ball rolling, you're in for the kind of sheer, stupid insanity you won't find in other major superhero IP. Let the blood and guts rain down \u2014 here, there's no such thing as overkill.\" \u2014 B.E.\nStarring: Peter Dinklage, Kevin Bacon, Elijah Wood, Taylour Paige, Jacob Tremblay, and Jane Levy\nHow to watch: The Toxic Avenger opens in theaters Aug. 29.\nThe Roses\nOlivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch fall in love and then face off in The Roses, a dark comedy based on Warren Adler's 1981 novel The War of the Roses. (Yep, the same novel that was the basis for Danny DeVito's 1989 black comedy The War of the Roses, starring Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas!)\nWhen their marriage bloomed, Ivy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch) built a beautiful home together, where they raised their children. But as the years go by, the thorns begin to rise alongside resentments. And wacky neighbors (Kate McKinnon and Andy Samberg) have added little comfort.\nWhile the previous adaptation is still wickedly entertaining, we're stoked to see what two-time Academy Award\u2013nominated screenwriter Tony McNamara (Poor Things, The Favourite) will bring to Adler's tale. Plus, helmed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me), The Roses seems primed to be a laugh riot. \u2014K.P.\nStarring: Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andy Samberg, and Kate McKinnon\nHow to watch: The Roses opens in theaters Aug. 29.\nTopics Film\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

  "argos_summary": "Jurassic World Rebirth, set to release in 2025, features a new cast led by Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, with a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. The film follows an extraction crew on a mission to a dangerous island to collect dinosaur DNA for medical advancements, five years after the events of Jurassic World: Dominion. Critics have noted that while the film has its thrilling moments, it still struggles with predictability and an overstuffed plot, but it is considered the best of the recent Jurassic films.",
