      "feedback": "Strong multi-year framing and attempt to tie policy to pricing power are evident, but the piece needs a formal regime map, explicit first-principles anchors, and a coherent transmission chain; you should fix tariff detail inconsistencies across sources, and lock in a reusable scenario framework. Actionable edits: 1) Build a two‑regime map anchored in first principles (regime invariants: real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity/BOP trajectories, policy reaction functions) and define (a) tariff framework regime under US–EU talks (centered on 15% across most goods with wine/steel specifics to resolve) and (b) a separate deregulation/directional policy regime (per 9W8ZUIBDY and 5M9M1KACF) with clear transition rules; 2) Articulate explicit transition conditions and speed (e.g., if EU legislation fails to implement a car/steel carve-out by date X, escalate to broader tariff coverage; if CRA/REINS actions pass, shift to a stronger deregulation trajectory; if courts block tariffs, pivot to legal‑risk pricing); 3) Replace the single paragraph with a formal base case plus at least two alternative scenarios (bullish on deregulation, bearish on protectionism) with quantifiable levers (tariff pass‑through, inflation, capex timing); 4) Quantify channels using concrete numbers from sources (tariff coverage near 70% of EU goods; 15% headline rate; 1.8% short‑term CPI impact per Yale Budget Lab; 18.6% import tax average; 2.6% June CPI); include scenario ranges (e.g., 0–15% car tariff ambiguity, potential steel tariff quotas, and possible chip‑tariff surges up to 300% as noted); 5) Explicitly reconcile tariff contradictions across sources (Fortune’s claim of a car zero‑tariff stance vs AP/Turnberry/EC chatter of 15% on autos); present a sourced set of plausible tariff envelopes and assign each to the most credible/updated source; 6) Deepen the policy‑to‑pricing chain: policy action → tariffs pass‑through to consumer prices and margins → sectoral capex/locations decisions (with Intel/CHIPS leverage and potential equity stake) → supply‑chain geography and currency dynamics (cite 5M9M1KACF and 9W8ZUIBDY for chips, 2SJORBV6H for steel push) and cross‑border friction from Adyen data (QRX2HD4X0) as a real‑world friction indicator; 7) Treat the Japan anti‑dumping probe as a separate exogenous shock that tightens input costs and elevates risk premia in metals/exports; 8) Flesh out the base‑case discount rate, risk premium, and earnings impact for sensitive sectors (semiconductors, autos, consumer goods) with explicit ranges; 9) Improve structure and clarity by signaling regimes, transitions, and transmission channels up front, with a short “watch list” and “invalidation” points for each regime; 10) Tighten citations: attach claims to the exact source IDs, cover all critical sources (RHFWI02JT, 2SJORBV6H, 9W8ZUIBDY, 5M9M1KACF, QRX2HD4X0) and explicitly discuss disagreements rather than choosing a single interpretation; 11) Consider BoP/terms‑of‑trade as endogenous to regime shifts (e.g., how tariff revenue, import costs, and export demand affect the external balance) and state the invariants you’re using; 12) In the conclusion, state a calibrated confidence level for the base case and enumerate the key risks (rapid tariff escalation, court injunctions, and a renewed protectionist wave) with concrete indicators to watch (court rulings, CRA/REINS progress, Intel/chips policy moves).",
