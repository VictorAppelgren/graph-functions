      "summary": "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is set to hold a conference call with his French, German, and British counterparts to discuss the potential reimposition of UN sanctions over its nuclear program, amid growing European concerns. The call comes as the deadline for a satisfactory solution approaches, with the European nations warning of 'snapback' sanctions if no agreement is reached by August 31. Iran's nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade levels, have raised alarms, especially after it ceased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency following the recent Iran-Israel conflict.",
