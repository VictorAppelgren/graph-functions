      "summary": "Recent leaks suggest that Apple will retain a redesigned version of the Camera Control button in the iPhone 18, contrary to earlier claims of its removal. The new design aims to simplify the button by eliminating its capacitive functionality, making it solely pressure-sensitive to reduce manufacturing and servicing costs. While the button is reportedly underused, the revised version will still support touch, long press, and swipe gestures.",
