  "content": "Movie star Tom Cruise turned down a Kennedy Center Honor from President Trump because of scheduling conflicts, according to reports.\n\nMultiple current and former Kennedy Center employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Washington Post that Mr. Cruise declined the invitation to the December ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, though the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d star\u2019s representation declined to comment to the Post.\n\nMr. Trump will host the Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 7, where actor Sylvester Stallone, KISS, disco singer Gloria Gaynor, country music icon George Strait and stage and screen actor Michael Crawford will receive the titular honors.\n\nMr. Trump, who was elected chairman of the Kennedy Center\u2019s board of trustees earlier this year, announced the nominees at the Kennedy Center. In a video posted to his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump said he wanted to \u201ccongratulate all the nominees. They\u2019re unbelievable people and we\u2019re going to have a tremendous day in December.\u201d\n\nKISS member Paul Stanley said: \u201cThe prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.\u201d\n\nMs. Gaynor told Fox News that \u201cI am beyond blessed and honored to be receiving this award. My hope is that in accepting this honor, I can continue with the inspirational phenomenon that began with \u2019I Will Survive.\u2019 Sharing my music and art on a global level to provide encouragement, hope, empowerment, inspiration, understanding, and unity is the core of my purpose.\n\nThe 48th Kennedy Center Honors show will be shown on CBS and Paramount+.",
