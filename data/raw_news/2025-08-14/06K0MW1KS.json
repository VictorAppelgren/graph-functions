  "description": "While appearing on Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast, \"New Heights,\" Taylor Swift and Travis talked about the early days of their relationship and how the Eras Tour brought them together.",
  "content": "Taylor Swift gave Travis Kelce all the clues he needed on how to be her ideal man.The 35-year-old Grammy Award-winning singer made her podcast debut when she appeared on Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast, \"New Heights\" on Wednesday. When asked why she chose to appear on the podcast, she joked, \"This podcast got me a boyfriend ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app.\" She continued, \"This dude didn't get a meet-and-greet, and he's making it everyone's problem. That's what I thought at first... You realize he didn't even reach out to our management. He came with Pat [Mahomes] and he thought that because he knows the elevator lady, that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room.\"Travis, however, credits the Eras Tour for getting them together, saying had he not gone to the show \"and been mesmerized\" by her on stage, \"and then left with such a desire to want to meet you,\" he would never have spoken about her on the podcast, which is what ultimately led to their relationship. He also shared how being at the show helped figure out how to win her over.TAYLOR SWIFT AND BOYFRIEND TRAVIS KELCE'S SHARED MORAL VALUES SPARKED ORGANIC LOVE STORY\"I was sitting there at the Eras Tour listening to every single one of those songs being like, \u2018I know exactly what she wants me to do,'\" he said. \"I'm the luckiest man in the world.\"Travis famously spoke about seeing Swift in concert on a July 2023 episode of the podcast, and expressed disappointment that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his phone number on it. They began dating soon after, and that fall, she was seen at her first Kansas City Chiefs game \u2013 the rest is history.Swift found Travis' gesture to be \"wild,\" but admitted, \"I'm glad it worked.\"\"I was like, 'If this guy's not crazy, this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager,'\" she said.Swift explained that after Travis \"did the full send on the podcast,\" different people in her life began \"whispering in my ear about you,\" and telling her what a great guy he is.  She went on to say the whole situation made her feel like she \"was in an \u201880s John Hughes movie\" with someone \"standing outside of my window with a boombox saying, \u2018I want to date you!\u2019\"Since they met and began their relationship while she was on tour, a lot of their early relationship moments were spent in foreign countries, but Swift is happy to have some normalcy back in her life.\"We got to travel the world and have vacations and adventures when I wasn't on stage, which was really fun, because Europe was so fun, Australia's amazing, it was great,\" she said. \"I was on tour for so long, and now I'm finally not on tour, and it's kind of great, because I'm getting my hobbies back.\"LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSAside from singing and songwriting, her many hobbies are what she considers to be \"granny s---,\" which includes sewing, cooking and painting.\"I'd say all my hobbies could be categorized as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s,\" she explained. \"I have a different baking obsession every six months. Right now, we're very deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life.\"\"I'm always baking bread and texting my friends like, 'Can I send you some bread? I need some feedback. Do you like this one better than you like the other one? I did the rise a little differently,'\" she later added. \"I'm on sourdough blogs. There's a whole community of us, and I didn't know it.\"Both Jason and Travis seem to be enjoying her sourdough phase, with Travis calling himself \"a lucky man,\" and Swift revealing he requested she send him two loaves while he was at training camp. It seems like Travis has even gotten in on the action, with Swift proudly stating he's also baked his own loaf, and, much to Jason's disbelief, it came out good.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\"His rose higher than mine,\" she said about Travis' bread. \"His was actually more delicious than mine.\" Swift also announced the release of her upcoming 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which is set to drop on October 3.",

Now, Kelce is sharing how the two fell in love, despite the media frenzy that has followed the famous couple's every move.\n\"Whenever I\u2019m with her, it feels like we\u2019re just regular people,\" the NFL star told GQ. \"When there is not a camera on us, we\u2019re just two people that are in love. It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of\u2026. It happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\"\n\"Nothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the f--- off.\"\nTAYLOR SWIFT ANNOUNCES TS12 ALBUM \u2018THE LIFE OF A SHOWGIRL\u2019 ON TRAVIS KELCE PODCAST\nWatching Swift over the past two years led Kelce to believe the two actually have a lot in common.\n\"I hadn\u2019t experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,\" he explained to the outlet. \"That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows. She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I\u2019ve seen what she goes through. I\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\"\n\"To go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours. The [Eras Tour] floor is literally \u2013 I\u2019ve seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer. You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the computer and you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the sun and you\u2019re doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she\u2019s doing it three, four, five days in a row.\"\nFor Kelce, Swift has the morals and values he's always looked for in a partner. Some even mirror the values of his mom, Donna Kelce.\n\"Their kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room,\" the football star listed when asked what the two share specifically. \"Their ability to show love and support no matter what. And on top of that, their work ethic. I saw my mother reach goals that she had set for herself, go from being a teller to working all the way up in the KeyBank building.\"\n\"I\u2019ve seen Taylor do the exact same thing of setting goals for herself and exceeding the expectations and really captivating the world in that regard.\"\nSwift and Kelce first sparked romance rumors in September 2023 after Swift appeared at one of Travis' NFL games with his family. Shortly before, Travis had tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at one of her concerts.\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as h---,\" she told TIME in 2023. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\"\n\"When you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\" Swift added. \"The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

The NFL superstar was now dealing with paparazzi at his home in Kansas City along with constant speculation on the couple's relationship status.\n\"I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. \"But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it ... The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that, I better not be the one acting all strange.\"\nAt the time, Kelce admitted getting to know Swift was \"mind-blowing.\"\n\"I\u2019ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f------ mind-blowing. I\u2019m learning every day.\"\nAs their relationship has grown, Swift and Kelce have continued to support each other over the past two years, with the NFL star attending multiple concerts of the pop star's billion-dollar \"Eras Tour.\" Kelce even appeared on stage during one of Swift's tour stops in London.\nSwift has also made an appearance at both of Kelce's Super Bowl games in the last two years. In 2024, the NFL tight end shut down skeptics of the couple's relationship during the pre-game interview.\n\"You\u2019re all crazy,\" he told CBS when asked what he'd say to people who didn't believe their love was real. \"Every last one of you, you\u2019re crazy.\"\n\"It\u2019s been nothing but fun,\" Kelce said at the time. \"We\u2019ve both been learning about this lifestyle knowing that I brought her into the football world.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nSwift is also jumping into Kelce's podcast world by making an appearance on \"New Heights\" to announce her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\nTravis and his brother Jason revealed Swift would be joining them on Aug. 13 after announcing a \"VERY\" special guest.\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE INSTAGRAM POST\nThe NFL brothers later shared a teaser clip featuring a flirty Swift and Kelce.
