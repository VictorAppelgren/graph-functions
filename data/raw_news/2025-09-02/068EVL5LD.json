  "description": "Putting assets into trust can offer many benefits, for example to reduce your inheritance tax bill or to create a legacy for loved ones.",
  "content": "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner\u2019s tax affairs have come under scrutiny again this week as it was revealed she has split the ownership of her \u00a3650,000 constituency home with a trust administered by a law firm.\n\nPutting assets in trust can offer many benefits, for example to reduce your inheritance tax bill or to create a legacy for loved ones.\n\nSpeculation mounted that Rayner\u2019s arrangement may be related to inheritance tax as the property, which is her old home in her Ashton- under-Lyne constituency that she owned with her ex-husband, was valued at \u00a3650,000 \u2013 the joint IHT allowance for a couple.\n\nHowever, she declined to answer questions about its purpose, which No 10 says is because of a court order.\n\nIt is understood this order relates to trust arrangements for her children, one of whom has special needs. It may not concern inheritance tax at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Rayner is not the only person turning to trusts to handle their money.\n\nWealth managers have reported a recent rush of enquiries about how to put wealth in trust to get it out of the hands of the taxman, especially since news of an inheritance tax raid on unspent pensions from April 2027.\n\nSo how do they work \u2013 and could they help you cut your tax bill or offer other benefits to your family?\n\nTrusts are a legal arrangement that allow you to hand over assets to be managed for the benefit of one or more people.\n\nYou can of course just give away money or possessions as you like at any point, and if you live for seven years they will be lifted out of your estate for inheritance tax.\n\nBut some people choose to use trusts instead to retain some control over the assets, although they do not own them any longer.\n\nThey also might do so to protect the beneficiaries \u2013 for example from inheritance tax, or exploitation by others if they are vulnerable, or sometimes their own irresponsible spending habits.\n\nA \u2018settlor\u2019 puts the assets, such as a property, into the trust, \u2018trustees\u2019 look after them and \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 ultimately receive them.\n\nA trust is a popular way to beat inheritance tax. You can put property or other assets into a trust set up for your loved ones.\n\nIf you survive for seven years afterwards, these fall out of your estate for inheritance tax purposes.\n\nYou can exert control over how assets in a trust might be used \u2013 for example you could stipulate beneficiaries can only access funds from a certain age or for particular purposes, such as university fees or buying a home.\n\nHowever, you usually cannot continue to benefit yourself from what has gone into it.\n\nThat is why putting your own home into a trust does not tend to work. If you plan to carry on living in the home, it would be deemed a \u2018gift with reservation of benefit\u2019 by HMRC.\n\nIn other words you have not fully given it away because you are still getting use from it, which means it will remain liable for inheritance tax, unless you jump through hoops including paying market rent to live in it.\n\nAlthough trusts are growing in popularity, be certain you are rich enough that your estate would attract inheritance tax before considering setting one up.\n\nThe basic threshold for inheritance tax \u2013 known as the nil-rate band \u2013 is \u00a3325,000, or if you are leaving a family home to direct descendants it\u2019s \u00a3500,000 \u2013 double those figures if you are a couple. Trusts can be complex and setting them up requires financial advice and expense.\n\nEvery seven years you can transfer up to \u00a3325,000 individually, or \u00a3650,000 from a couple, into a discretionary trust tax-free.\n\nOn anything over that, you are charged 20 per cent of the value of assets being put in the trust (this is offset if you die and the seven-year rule kicks in, but cannot be reclaimed if you survive seven years).\n\nEvery ten years, there is a further 6 per cent tax charge on the excess over the nil-rate band.\n\n\u2018Very few people go ahead with putting their main residence in trust for their beneficiaries once the difficulties have been explained to them,\u2019 says Ian Dyall, head of estate planning at wealth manager Evelyn Partners.\n\n\u2018Trusts add a layer of complexity to your affairs and often they come with additional administration and cost \u2013 including the cost to set up the trust and unwind it later,\u2019 says Paul Davidoff, a partner at law firm Kingsley Napley.\n\nThe Government could also change the rules in the future, removing any tax saving, Davidoff warns. \u2018The result will be a complicated arrangement which has cost money to establish and administer, but without any tax advantage.\n\n'The more complex the arrangement that is required to save tax, the more likely it is that it will be affected by future tax changes.\u2019\n\nPeople who are vulnerable, for any number of reasons, might need spending decisions to be made on their behalf throughout their lives.\n\nUnfortunately, they might also need protection from unscrupulous people who would exploit them.\n\nYou can set up a \u2018discretionary\u2019 trust during your lifetime or one that takes effect after your death, and tailor the rules to suit the person involved.\n\n\u2018Some trusts for disabled adults or children receive special tax treatment,\u2019 says Heather Rogers, founder of Aston Accountancy. \u2018These are trusts for vulnerable beneficiaries.\n\n\u2018There is no inheritance tax on creation of such trusts or ten-yearly charges as the idea is to accumulate funds to support the vulnerable beneficiary.\u2019\n\nYou will want to take particular care in choosing trustees, including whether to be one yourself during your lifetime.\n\nAny trustees should be clear on what you want \u2013 you should leave a \u2018letter of wishes\u2019 with your will \u2013 and be prepared to take on possibly onerous long-term responsibilities.\n\nGet a solicitor with specialist experience to help you set up a trust with this goal. Charities relevant to your child\u2019s needs might be able to provide recommendations and other advice.\n\nSome people try to put almost everything they own into trust including their home, to deplete their assets to the point where their local council will pick up any future care bill.\n\nThe hope is that if they give away their home in advance their family will get to keep it. Be warned, this is unlikely to work, and any firms that claim it can are best avoided.\n\nIf you need residential care, and your assets fall below the \u00a323,250 threshold where your local council steps in to help, you will have to fill in a financial assessment and reveal what you gave away, via a trust or otherwise.\n\n\u2018Giving away a property can be treated as a \u201cdeliberate deprivation\u201d of one\u2019s assets and the property might still be brought into account when considering some means-tested benefits,\u2019 says Paul Davidoff.\n\nThere is no time limit on how far back your council can look into your affairs, and if it deems \u2018deprivation of assets\u2019 took place you can be charged for care as if you still owned your home.\n\nIt is common in blended families for you to want a surviving spouse to have somewhere to live for the rest of their lives, but for your own children to inherit your property.\n\nIn this situation you can set up a \u2018property life interest trust\u2019, where your share of a family home \u2013 usually 50 per cent \u2013 would be placed into a trust after you are gone.\n\nThese typically give a spouse the right to remain in the property, including up until their death, but your share remains ring-fenced for your intended beneficiaries.\n\nThis kind of arrangement prevents widows and widowers from inheriting a home then changing their own wills to cut out stepchildren.",

      "text": "The areas where it's hardest to sell a home... so is YOUR region one of the worst affected? LUCY EVANS reveals all, plus the steps you must take to entice reluctant buyers\nHomeowners trying to sell their property in recent weeks will have noticed something very odd.\nThe phones aren\u2019t ringing as much as they used to, viewings are few and far between, and offers just aren\u2019t flowing in.\nThe property market is gummed up \u2013 it is now taking sellers as much as 68 per cent longer than usual to sell their homes in some areas of the country, fresh analysis for Money Mail reveals.\nProperty portal Zoopla has analysed the number of days it took for a home to sell \u2013 from the moment it is advertised on the website to the time it is marked as \u2018sold\u2019 or \u2018sold subject to contract\u2019 \u2013 between April and June compared with the average length over the last five years.\nAnd its findings reveal a plunge in buyer confidence has drastically slowed down markets across the UK \u2013 and has particularly hit homes in Devon and along the south coast.\nSo how long does it take to sell a home in your area \u2013 and how can you spur on buyers to snap it up?\nPROPERTY MARKET HAS SLOWED\nIt now takes some 78 days to sell a home, according to property data consultant Twenty EA, up from just 42 days in 2022.\nBuyer confidence has plummeted in the past two years as surging mortgage rates and soaring house prices dented affordability.\nJust 38 per cent of buyers are confident in the current property market, the Council For Licensed Conveyancers says.\nWhile rates have started to fall, buyers still haven\u2019t been tempted to return to the market.\nThis will be in large part down to April\u2019s slash to the stamp duty thresholds, which has tempered demand in the past few months as buyers now need to pay thousands more in tax when they buy a new home.\nAnd the housing market is likely to have slowed further since Zoopla\u2019s analysis due to growing concerns over Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s upcoming autumn Budget. House hunters are waiting to see if she has any cruel tricks up her sleeve that will hit homeowners.\nRumours of a fresh tax raid on homeowners have swirled in recent weeks as the Treasury is reportedly considering an overhaul of stamp duty and a brand new property tax.\nPlus, there\u2019s a pernicious mansion tax in the running, which could see capital gains tax charged on high value homes and a potential wealth tax. These rumours and a failure by the Treasury to shut them down will likely have dented buyer confidence further.\nThey have already hit house prices as annual growth has slowed to 2.1 per cent, according to Nationwide \u2013 less than the most recent 3.8 per cent inflation figure \u2013 which means buyers are holding off making a move until they know more.\nNow properties are lying unsold as prospective buyers wait for the Budget before beginning their hunt for a new home.\nBuying agent Henry Pryor says: \u2018Some 40 per cent of what has sold so far this year had reduced the price once but the really sobering statistic is that only half the homes that go on the market actually sell.\n\u2018Homes are taking longer to sell because it takes time for the penny to drop. Most sellers won\u2019t accept that the market is turning and many agents are too young to have worked in a falling market to recognise the signs.\n\u2018Prices are slipping back as affordability issues bite but not all sellers understand this. I\u2019ve seen this problem before. Initially everyone refuses to accept that prices might have topped out.\u2019\nSo sellers must say goodbye to the days where buyers would offer tens of thousands of pounds over the odds to secure one of the rare available homes for sale.\nIt\u2019s now a buyer\u2019s market.\nWHICH AREAS HAVE BEEN WORST HIT?\nProperties on this road in the heart of Notting Hill and close to Portobello Market are currently on the market for over \u00a312million\nHomes in the City of London currently take the longest to sell with a 57-day average, the Zoopla data reveals.\nProperties have typically taken 49 days on average to sell over the past five years, so homeowners in the central area have seen an eight-day jump in selling time.\nIt\u2019s a similar story in Kensington & Chelsea, as houses in the exclusive area now take 52 days to be snapped up by a buyer, a rise from the usual 46 days.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the London property market is struggling. Previously soaring property prices and high stamp duty charges have tempered demand which has left droves of homes \u2013 especially flats \u2013 languishing on the market.\nPlus, the Government\u2019s attack on wealth has caused high-net-worth individuals to flee the country and overseas buyers \u2013 who normally compete to snap up swathes of London rental properties and flats \u2013 to stay away.\nBut the new data reveals the capital is not the only place in the country to face a sink in demand from buyers. Far from it.\nHouse sales in West Devon have slowed the most. In some parts, second home owners have been subject to a punitive 100 per cent council tax hike since April\nIn fact, homes in 352 of the 377 local authorities analysed by Zoopla are taking longer to sell than usual. From luxurious areas in the inner capital to Gwynedd in north Wales, demand is plummeting.\nA slew of the places Zoopla found house sales to have slowed the most \u2013 including West Devon, Teignbridge and South Hams \u2013 have been subject to a punitive 100 per cent council tax hike for second home owners since April. This will have massively deterred those looking for a holiday home near the coast and slowed the local property market.\nThe southwest has seen a 21 per cent surge in supply overall.\nWest Devon has seen the biggest hike in selling time as properties now take almost 68 per cent longer than usual to go.\nOver the last five years, homes in the local authority were snapped up in 31 days. But between April and June, this soared to 52 days.\nTeignbridge, also in the southwest, has seen a 56 per cent increase in the number of days it takes to sell a home while for sellers in Torridge it\u2019s a 55 per cent hike.\nHomeowners in South Hams also have to wait 53 per cent longer for a sale \u2013 from 32 days to 49 days.\nElsewhere on the south coast, Eastleigh, near Southampton, has also seen a huge falter in demands as properties take 52 per cent longer to sell.\nSCOTLAND HOMES SELL IN DAYS\nIn North Lanarkshire and Falkirk, properties are being marked as \u2018sold\u2019 or \u2018sold subject to contract\u2019 in 12 days while in South Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire it\u2019s 13 days\nNorth of the border, however, is bucking the trend. Homes in vast swathes of Scotland are being snapped up in as little as 12 days on average, the Zoopla analysis shows.\nIn North Lanarkshire and Falkirk, properties are being marked as \u2018sold\u2019 or \u2018sold subject to contract\u2019 in 12 days while in South Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire it\u2019s 13 days.\nBut estate agents in North Lanarkshire describe homes appearing on the market garnering tens of viewings in a few days and buyers placing offers worth thousands of pounds over the asking price.\nCraig Mitchell, director of Move On estate agents in Motherwell, says: \u2018There\u2019s been a lot of people wanting to buy but not as many properties coming on to the market. Properties typically have viewings within one day and they are selling within a few days.\n\u2018Sale prices are really high and sellers are getting good offers.\u2019\nHe\u2019s seen one property listed for \u00a3210,00 and the first buyer to view it offered \u00a3220,000.\nWhy? Estate agents explain there\u2019s still a huge demand for properties due to the incredible value for money the area offers.\nProperties in Motherwell have sold for an average of \u00a3181,886 over the last year, significantly lower than the UK average of \u00a3270,000, according to Zoopla.\nIn Northern Ireland, homes in Derry (pictured) and Strabane now sell in 24 days\nPlus, the demand has picked up among first-time buyers especially, while the market for family homes has slowed along with the rest of the country.\nWhen it comes to the biggest decrease in the time it takes to sell a home, Northern Ireland takes the top spot.\nIn Derry and Strabane, homes now sell in 24 days. Over the last five years it has taken 34 days on average \u2013 ten days more \u2013 so buyers are snapping up homes 29 per cent faster. Causeway Coast & Glens, also in Northern Ireland, has seen sale time plunge from 29 to 26 days \u2013 a 20 per cent fall.\nHOW TO SHIFT YOUR HOME\nFor sellers, the easiest way to sell your home quickly is to price it right. But this simple sounding task is not easy.\nEstate agents will often price a home higher than its value to entice vendors.\nMeanwhile, sellers often tend to think their home is perfect, unique and will believe a high asking price is justified.\nHowever, if you want your home to be snapped up in this slower market, you need to price realistically. Mr Pryor says: \u2018For most people, a lower than expected price isn\u2019t a major problem. What they want to buy will be similarly impacted. Lower prices should help first time buyers.\n\u2018The people who might suffer are those trading down. In a strong market you can usually get away with over-pricing as the market catches up but you need to be realistic in this market and pitch your asking price at a level that today\u2019s buyers recognise.\n\u2018You may think you\u2019re priced correctly but if you aren\u2019t getting any viewers then you\u2019re asking too much.\u2019\nPrice reductions will be flagged on property portals such as Rightmove or Zoopla which will raise suspicions of prospective buyers, potentially meaning it will take even longer to sell your home.\nMr Pryor suggests if you are getting viewings but no prospective buyers are making an offer then simply ask them why and make changes based on this. \u2018Most will be honest with you,\u2019 he says.\nGet your home valued but also look at the prices of recently sold properties in your area to gauge the current market.\nYou should also choose an estate agent that will price the property well.\nUse a comparison tool such as the best estate agent finder from the Homeowners Alliance. Go to hoa.org.uk/services/best-estate-agent\nOPPORTUNITY FOR BUYERS\nBut for buyers, there\u2019s an opportunity to take advantage of the slow-moving market. This tepid environment means price growth is minimal and sellers are desperate to offload their home onto a willing buyer.\nPlus, as a handful of lenders have recently relaxed affordability criteria, you may be able to borrow up to tens of thousands of pounds more than previously.\nHenry Sherwood, of The Buying Agents, says buyers can pounce on the slowdown and secure a good deal if they know what they are doing.\n\u2018Either get professional buying advice or do your research. You need to know what the sale prices \u2013 not asking prices \u2013 are doing.\n\u2018Look at the sold price per square foot and not just the sale price. Compare recently sold properties in the area so you have a rough guide.\n\u2018There is no point negotiating a 10 per cent discount from the asking price if the property is 15 per cent over valued to start with.\u2019\n- Are you struggling to sell your home?

      "text": "How inheritance tax works - and what families MUST know\nMost estates don't get hit by inheritance tax but it still manages to be regularly dubbed Britain's most hated tax.\nIt is charged at 40 per cent on assets above the inheritance tax threshold when people die and has long been the subject of criticism - including a damning report from the Office of Tax Simplification.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves launched an inheritance tax raid on savers in the Budget on 30 October by making pensions liable for the levy from April 2027. She also announced the main thresholds would be frozen until April 2030.\nBelow we look at how inheritance tax works, so you can work out if your family will have to pay it, and explain why it is so unpopular.\nInheritance tax: There are many ways to plan ahead and help your loved ones avoid the levy\nWhat you need to know about inheritance tax\nInheritance tax is widely loathed by the public. It's a tax on death, property and the natural desire to pass wealth down the generations.\nIf this riles you, there are two very important things to bear in mind about inheritance tax.\nFirst, only the richest 4 per cent of families pay it - though that is expected to rise to 8 per cent when pensions start being counted towards the levy. Second, if it applies to you, there are many ways to plan ahead and help your loved ones avoid the levy.\nThat said, the 40 per cent inheritance rate is drastically high if you have amassed enough assets for your beneficiaries to be liable on some chunk of them.\nAnd the trends are heading in very much the wrong direction for wealthy taxpayers, especially those who own a home in a price hotspot.\nThe property boom over recent decades plus frozen thresholds are dragging many more grieving families into the inheritance tax net, and the Treasury is raking in ever bigger sums as a result.\nThe pending inclusion of pensions in the calculations from 2027 will also impact more families.\nSo how much is inheritance tax, and what are the best ways to shield your family from paying it.\nHow much is inheritance tax and who pays?\nYou need to be worth \u00a3325,000 if you are single, or \u00a3650,000 jointly if you are married or in a civil partnership, for your loved ones to have to stump up death duties.\nBut there is a further chunky allowance which increases the threshold to a joint \u00a31million if you have a partner, own a property, and intend to leave money to your direct descendants.\nOnce an estate reaches \u00a32million this own home allowance starts being removed by \u00a31 for every \u00a32 above this threshold. It vanishes completely by \u00a32.3million.\nIf you are worth more than this, your beneficiaries will have to hand over 40 per cent of your assets above those levels to the Government.\nThresholds are set to be frozen until April 2030, and this combined with the new inclusion of unspent pensions from April 2027 means more people's estates will be hit.\nPeople inheriting property in the hottest house price spots, often due to work or family ties rather than by choice, are generally on the hook for the biggest sums.\nPension pots, which can run into many hundreds of thousands of pounds, will also be a major factor for many families. People are expected to spend or give away more pension cash to avoid it becoming part of their estate.\n'Tax of 40 per cent is typically levied on a deceased person's assets worth over and above \u00a3325,000, which is called the nil rate band,' explains This is Money's tax columnist, Heather Rogers.\n'Many people are allowed to leave a further \u00a3175,000 worth of assets without them becoming liable for inheritance tax, if their home forms part of their estate and they leave it to direct descendants.\n'This extra sum is what is called the residence nil rate band, and it is available to claim on deaths on or after 6 April 2017.\n'That means children, including adopted, step or fostered, and those children's linear descendants.\n'Both protected amounts or \"bands\", adding up to \u00a3500,000 per person, can be transferred to a surviving spouse or civil partner if unused on the death of the first spouse.'\nWhen do you have to pay?\nExecutors or administrators for an estate get just six months, kicking off from the last day of the month after a loved one's death, to add up their assets, calculate what is owed and hand over any money due to the taxman.\nAnd ant tax due must be paid before the executors or administrators are granted probate, which allows them access to and control over a deceased person's funds.\nRogers explains how you find the money to pay inheritance tax upfront here, or pay in instalments - though you will be charged interest.\nCommon solutions are a specialist loan, or an insurance policy taken out in advance.\nRead our guide to working out and paying inheritance tax.\nHow do you avoid inheritance tax?\nLuckily there are many legal ways to dodge the dreaded 40 per cent 'death tax' if you want to pass on the maximum sum possible and are prepared to plan ahead.\nBut you shouldn't lose sleep - let alone start working on elaborate avoidance tactics - unless you are certain you are rich enough for it to become a problem for your family.\nMeanwhile, financial advisers repeatedly remind people that the most cost effective ways to beat inheritance tax are to spend and enjoy your wealth or give it away early.\nHere's a round up of ways to do it which can be undertaken easily by any ordinary person, or read our 'Ten tips to avoid inheritance tax legally' for a full guide.\nGifts: You can give \u00a33,000 a year, plus make unlimited small gifts of \u00a3250, free from inheritance tax.\nWedding gifts are also exempt, although the amount depends on how close you are to the bride or groom. The limits are up to \u00a35,000 to a child, \u00a32,500 to a grandchild or great-grandchild, and \u00a31,000 to anyone else.\nYou can hand unlimited sums to other people if you want, but they will fall under the so-called seven-year rule.\nOfficially, these are called 'potentially exempt transfer' gifts, because if you survive seven years the money automatically becomes free of inheritance tax.\nIf you die before the seven years are up, inheritance tax is levied on a sliding scale - starting at the full whack of 40 per cent if it's within the first three years.\nRead our guide to inheritance tax and gifts, and see the tables below.\nInheritance tax gift limits haven't changed since the 1980s\n| Years between gift and death | Tax paid |\n|---|---|\n| Less than 3 | 40% |\n| 3 to 4 | 32% |\n| 4 to 5 | 24% |\n| 5 to 6 | 16% |\n| 6 to 7 | 8% |\n| 7 or more | 0% |\nSurplus income: You can also contribute to the living costs of someone else - younger or older relatives, for example - but only if you can prove it's coming out of spare income.\nSuch gifts must be made out of surplus funds, which means your beneficiaries may have to show HMRC your old bank statements to prove you did not need to spend that money on anything else.\nSupporting a cause: You can gift or bequeath money to charities and political parties and it will be excluded from your estate when inheritance tax is calculated.\nA political party has to have succeeded in getting at least one MP elected to parliament to qualify for this exemption.\nThere is also a way to reduce your heirs' inheritance tax rate from 40 per cent to 36 per cent of your taxable estate by giving to charity - although not to a political party.\nYou can do this by bequeathing at least 10 per cent of your net estate - the part liable for inheritance tax - to charity in your will."

      "text": "Angela Rayner tax row: Experts explain how stamp duty works on second homes - and what falls foul of the rules\n- Deputy PM reportedly changed her 'main' residence for tax purposes\nBritain's Deputy Prime Minister has found herself in hot water today, over claims she may have paid less stamp duty by changing her 'main' residence for tax purposes.\nStamp duty is the main property tax paid by homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland. It is paid when someone buys a home, with those buying second homes liable to pay more.\nConcerns were raised over the level of stamp duty paid by Angela Rayner for a flat she bought in Hove, East Sussex, which she reported as her main place of residence to tax authorities.\nAccording to reports in the Telegraph, the Deputy Prime Minister took her name off the deeds of her Greater Manchester property only weeks before purchasing the \u00a3800,000 seaside flat.\nMs Rayner's alleged changes to her property affairs are legal, however, they may spark debate as to whether the Housing Secretary purposefully made decisions to pay less council tax and stamp duty.\nSome may also see it as controversial given Labour's reported plans to levy more tax on those who own high-value properties.\nProperty portfolio: The Deputy PM owns a smart \u00a3800,000 apartment in Hove. It has been reported that she took her name off the deeds of her Greater Manchester property only weeks before purchasing the seaside flat\nIt comes after the Daily Mail revealed Ms Rayner, who is also Labour's Housing Secretary, had purchased the apartment in addition to the \u00a3650,000 house she owns in her Greater Manchester constituency.\nThe reported deed changes allegedly allowed the Cabinet minister to pay \u00a330,000 in stamp duty instead of \u00a370,000, which would have been applied if the property was her second home.\nMs Rayner is also said to have told Tameside Council that her home situated in her Ashton-under-Lyne constituency continues to be her primary residence.\nBrighton and Hove Council have also been notified by the politician that her apartment there is a second home, for the purposes of council tax, according to the Telegraph.\nWe explain the rules around stamp duty, how much people pay and how this is increased on second homes - as well as getting expert views on Rayner's situation.\nControversy: The Deputy Prime Minister reportedly took her name off the deeds of her Greater Manchester property only weeks before purchasing the \u00a3800,000 seaside flat in Hove, East Sussex\nHow much stamp duty do people pay?\nHome movers pay nothing on properties that cost less than \u00a3125,000. On the amount from \u00a3125,001 to \u00a3250,000, they pay 2 per cent, then on the portion from \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3925,000, they pay 5 per cent.\nAbove that it increases to 10 per cent and then 12 per cent for the most expensive homes.\nUnder the current rules, this means that an \u00a3800,000 property purchase, bought for the owner to live in full-time, would cost \u00a330,000 in stamp duty.\nFirst-time buyers pay nothing on properties up to \u00a3300,000, then 5 per cent on the portion from \u00a3300,001 to \u00a3500,000.\nIf the price is over \u00a3500,000, they cannot claim the relief and therefore pay the same as normal home movers.\nWhat counts as a main residence for stamp duty purposes?\nThere is no strict legal definition of what counts as a 'main residence'.\nIf a claim is disputed, HM Revenue & Customs will make its own decision based on the available evidence.\nThe main factor is usually where the person spends most of their time, but other factors, such as where they are registered with a GP, are also relevant.\nWhat stamp duty is due on second homes?\nIn the Autumn Budget last year, Labour changed the rules so that second home purchases in England were subject to an additional 5 per cent stamp duty surcharge, on top of the homeowner rates described above.\nThis surcharge, which also applies to buy-to-let landlords, had been 3 per cent previously.\nSomeone buying a second home for \u00a3500,000 can now expect to pay \u00a340,000 in stamp duty, up from \u00a327,500 before last year's Autumn Budget.\nIn Angela Rayner's case, buying an \u00a3800,000 home, she would be liable to pay \u00a370,000 in stamp duty, up from \u00a367,500 previously.\nWhat counts as a second home?\nA second home counts as any property someone holds or buys in addition to their principal main residence. This could include a buy-to-let, a holiday home or holiday let or a pied-\u00e0-terre.\nHMRC's guidelines are fairly clear on when someone becomes liable to pay it.\nThe 5 per cent stamp duty surcharge needs to be paid by anyone who has not sold their main residence on the day they complete their new purchase. This is because they'll own two properties.\nHowever, home buyers can apply for a stamp duty refund if they sell their previous main home within 36 months.\nThis rule is in place so people who have a period of overlap when buying a new home to live in aren't unfairly penalised.\nIf it takes longer than 36 months to sell their previous main home, there is an exceptional circumstance where they may still be able to claim the money back.\nThe delay in selling must be because of reasons outside their control.\nIn the case of Angela Rayner, rather than sell her main home she reportedly removed her name from the deeds of her Greater Manchester property weeks before purchasing the flat in Hovex.\nThe reported deed changes allegedly allowed the Cabinet minister to pay \u00a330,000 in stamp duty instead of \u00a370,000, which would have been applied if the property was her second home.\n'To avoid the second home surcharge, the new property must genuinely replace your main residence,' says Karen Noye, a tax expert at wealth manager, Quilter.\n'HMRC does not accept simple declarations. It considers where you actually live, such as where you're registered to vote, pay council tax, and spend most of your time.'\nTax hike: Since October last year, second home purchases in England have been subject to an additional 5% stamp duty surcharge on top of existing rates\nWhat questions are being asked?\nWhile Rayner's alleged changes to her property affairs are legal, tax experts have raised concerns over whether the actions were in the 'spirit' of the law.\n'There are more questions for Angela Rayner to answer before it becomes clear whether her actions were within both the letter and the spirit of the law,' says Phil Blackburn, tax partner at Lubbock Fine.\nThe key issues to determine the stamp duty liability, according to Blackburn, is where the genuine main residence for Angela Rayner is and if the Manchester property was previously the main residence, was there a genuine disposal of the property.\nThere is no suggestion currently that HMRC is investigating the issue.\nHowever, if it did, questions might be asked around where the family spends the majority of its time, where any children go to school and which is the residence that the individual is registered to vote in.\n'Even if the new property has become the main residence, the additional stamp duty charge will only be avoided if the previous main residence has been properly disposed of,' adds Blackburn.\n'There isn\u2019t enough information in the public domain to determine these issues, although the reports seem to suggest some potential inconsistencies between how the properties have been treated for stamp duty and council tax purposes.\n'And even if the letter of the law for stamp duty and council tax have been followed by implementing some careful planning, is that good enough for the public given the Government's own policy of taking a dim view of legal tax avoidance?'\nAndrew Boast, director at property lawyers Sam Conveyancing, says the removal of her name from the deeds of the Manchester property raises some questions as well.\n'It sounds as though Angela Rayner has removed her name from a property in Manchester so that when she bought her new home in Hove for \u00a3800,000 she didn't have an interest in another property, thus avoiding the 5 per cent higher stamp duty rate,' he says.\n'For most people, simply taking your name off of a property valued at \u00a3650,000 wouldn't be an option.\n'Why would you give away a property that valuable to save \u00a340,000 in stamp duty? Who now owns the property in Manchester?'\nWho remains on the property's deeds?\nThe answer may be found in the person who remains on the title deeds of the property in Greater Manchester.\nThis has not been confirmed, but it is possible that it could be Rayner's ex-husband, Mark Rayner. The pair reportedly separated in 2020.\nUnder UK law, property transfers between spouses or civil partners as part of a divorce or separation are generally exempt from stamp duty, provided the transfer is made under a court order or a formal written agreement connected to the dissolution of the marriage or civil partnership.\nHowever, complications can arise when one party purchases a second property before the divorce is finalised.\nHMRC treats married couples and civil partners as a single unit for stamp duty purposes unless they are formally separated by court order or deed.\nThis means that if one spouse buys a new home while still legally tied to the other, and retains an interest in the marital home, they may be liable for the 5 per cent stamp duty surcharge on additional dwellings.\nOlivia Egdell-Page, partner and head of property department at Joseph A Jones & Co\nIf the spouse has fully transferred their interest in the marital home and does not retain any ownership, either through sale, gift, or court-ordered transfer, they are no longer considered to own an additional property.\n'It is not clear to whom that property has been transferred,' says Olivia Egdell-Page, partner and head of property at law firm Joseph A Jones & Co. 'If this were to a spouse or civil partner, it would not be sufficient to overreach the application of the higher stamp duty rate.'\n'If the transfer has been made to an individual or third party, then this may well be sufficient upon a strict application of the stamp duty rules in this area.\n'Presumably, Rayner will have received robust legal and likely tax advice in connection with the proposed transfer and purchase - so I\u2019d expect that any such loopholes would have been considered and the transactions completed accordingly.'\nIt's a bad look given all the talk of property taxes\nRayner's tax affairs are newsworthy given Labour's rumoured plans to clobber some households with new property taxes in the upcoming budget.\nFirst, Rachel Reeves is considering plans to scrap stamp duty and council tax in favour of a new system.\nPotentially, it could see the stamp duty bill homeowners pay on purchase could be scrapped in favour of an annual tax for homes above \u00a3500,000.\nThe Chancellor is also rumoured to be considering charging some homeowners a levy if they sell their home and make a profit.\nAt the moment, people don't have to pay capital gains tax if they sell the home they live in and the price has increased since they bought it.\nBut according to The Times, Reeves is considering changing the rules so that capital gains tax would become payable on the sale of homes worth more than \u00a31.5million.\nOn residential property, capital gains tax is currently charged at 18 per cent for basic rate taxpayers, and 24 per cent for higher rate taxpayers \u2013 but with any significant gain, people are likely to pay most of it at the higher rate.\nThis is because a capital gain is added to a person's normal income to decide the tax rate.\nThe Times said a threshold of \u00a31.5million would hit around 120,000 homeowners who are higher-rate taxpayers with capital gains tax bills of \u00a3199,973."

  "argos_summary": "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has split ownership of her \u00a3650,000 constituency home into a trust, sparking speculation that the move may be aimed at reducing inheritance tax or safeguarding a special\u2011needs child, though she cites a court order and a court\u2011ordered transfer of her ex\u2011husband\u2019s interest.  The case has highlighted a surge in demand for trusts among the wealthy, as wealth managers warn that the 2027 pension\u2011tax raid and frozen inheritance\u2011tax thresholds will push more families toward estate\u2011planning tools.  However, the article notes that trusts are complex, costly, and may be subject to future tax changes, and that similar property\u2011tax manoeuvres, such as stamp\u2011duty avoidance, are under scrutiny by tax authorities and the public.",
