      "feedback": "The draft correctly links the Fed’s September 25 bp cut to a 0.5–1 % DXY rally via a 57 bp 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening and real‑yield differential expansion, but it drifts when it mentions “temporary dip of ~200 bp to 95.8 by August 31” without a clear causal chain or handle mapping; replace that sentence with a concise statement that the market’s pre‑pricing of the cut will likely keep DXY above 96.5, citing (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV) for the probability curve. Explicitly map the 0.5–1 % rally to the canonical handle `dxy` with a sign (+) and magnitude range, and add a 3–6 month horizon. Tighten the risk paragraph: state that a Fed rate hike or a >3 % PCE on Aug 30 would compress the real‑yield differential and push DXY down 50–100 bp, citing (7XH2DKEKV)(XTQIQRP5K). Include the catalyst window: September Fed meeting (Sep 25), early‑August CPI, Jackson Hole (late Aug), Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, each with inline IDs. Remove any mention of “mortgage rates” or “30‑yr Treasury” that are not part of the DXY transmission path. Finally, add a short‑term volatility window (Aug 30–31) and a confidence qualifier (“moderate‑to‑high”) tied to the cited data. This will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, and causal‑chain requirements while eliminating drift.",
