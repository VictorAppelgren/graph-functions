      "summary": "Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management sold almost its entire portfolio in Q1, buying put options on tech stocks that helped it avoid the April market crash, and has now shifted to a contrarian stance, buying shares and call options in UnitedHealth Group and Lululemon Athletica. UnitedHealth, down about 42% YTD, faces higher medical costs, a DOJ probe, and a revised earnings outlook, yet maintains a strong balance sheet and dividend yield that Burry and other investors view as a long‑term upside. Lululemon, also down nearly 47%, has a solid cash position and positive earnings but has cut guidance amid rising competition and a post‑COVID slowdown, prompting Burry’s cautious buy. Both stocks are seen as undervalued opportunities for investors willing to weather short‑term volatility for potential long‑term gains.",
