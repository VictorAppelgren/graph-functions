  "title": "Penn football is hoping for a better 2025 season after a rough finish to 2024",
  "description": "Penn head coach Ray Priore knows that it was the margins that downed the Quakers last season, but the last thing he plans to do heading into a promising 2025 is dwell on it.",
  "content": "It would have been easy for Penn head football coach Ray Priore to make an excuse.\n\nA close examination of last year\u2019s 4-6 record is not an accurate reflection of just how close the Quakers in the games they found themselves on the losing end of. Among the six losses, only two were by a double-digit margin.\n\nIt\u2019s what Priore hinted at when he, alongside quarterback Liam O\u2019Brien, spoke during Monday\u2019s Ivy League football media day. The losses showed what the group needed to tighten up, and the \u201cdiscipline\u201d they now need to display before opening the season in a little more than a month\u2019s time against Stonehill (1 p.m., NEC Front Row).\n\n\u201cIt starts with the ball, we\u2019ve got to possess it; we\u2019ve got to keep it and we got to get it,\u201d Priore said. \u201cYou can look at our plus minus [from last season] \u2026 this league is all about points. The [end] goal is not three [points], the goal is seven. We\u2019ve lost too many games by a very, very small margin. And the word I\u2019ve used often this past nine months has been discipline.\u201d\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Taylor Wray ready for \u2018next step\u2019 as Penn men\u2019s lacrosse coach after parting ways with St. Joe\u2019s\n\nPenn found out that the Ivy League also doesn\u2019t care about margins after the Quakers were ranked No. 6 in conference preseason polls. Penn sits just above Cornell and Brown, but stares up at the remaining programs in the league, with a desire to prove that they\u2019ve learned from their mistakes.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to showcase just how much they\u2019ve learned with O\u2019Brien at the helm, who takes over for graduate Aidan Sayin, last year\u2019s starter who threw for 1,108 yards and six touchdowns. However, it was O\u2019Brien who stepped up after Sayin suffered a season-ending injury last season. O\u2019Brien enters this season coming off a 1,000-yard passing season as well (1,018), in which he threw for 13 touchdowns and just two interceptions in four starts.\n\nPenn returns its entire starting offensive linemen. In just the short time since the end of spring ball and early stages of training camps, O\u2019Brien says the O-line stands to bring not just the \u201cfoundation,\u201d but the \u201cexperience\u201d to right the ship.\n\nIt would be quite lift now that the Quakers have more to play for with the Ivy League now officially competing for an opportunity to be a part of the playoff picture in the Football Championship Subdivision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re adjusting to new headsets, which is very exciting, but it\u2019s going to take, you know, some time to just get used to the communication into my ears,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut on top of that everyone else still has to play. We have to communicate. We all have to be on the same page. It\u2019s starts with we can\u2019t give up the five yard penalties, no false starts. No jumping offsides. Um, you know, keep it simple and just be smart.\u201d\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Penn State has its highest preseason ranking in the James Franklin Era. Here\u2019s how.\n\nIn addition to being smart, O\u2019Brien also has a top target in Jared Richardson, the senior wide receiver who was named to the FCS Football Central preseason All-America team last month. Richardson, who led the team in touchdowns last year with seven, is 528 yards from ranking among the top 10 in program history in career receiving yards, and already ranks sixth in Penn history in touchdown catches.\n\nHowever, the Quakers do have deficiencies on both sides of the ball, and none greater than the loss of sophomore rusher Malachi Hosley, who transferred to Georgia Tech at the end of the season, after being the Ivy League\u2019s offensive player of the year last season.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose an Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year to the [NCAA transfer] portal and the NIL, that\u2019s never, never good,\u201d said Priore. But again, it\u2019s got to be a next man up sort of mentality. We\u2019ve done some internal things and we\u2019re going to make some moves internally \u2026 Fortunately, as you\u2019ve been around and you\u2019ve watched people play, that\u2019s probably the one position where early player who can play can tap in really early.\u201d\n\nOne of those moves Priore admitted is a new role for wide receiver Julien Stokes. Stokes is contending to be the feature back behind O\u2019Brien; the 5-foot-7, 180-pounder was second-team All-Ivy last season, coming off an injury that saw him finish with 37 receptions, 313 receiving yards, and two touchdowns.\n\nPriore also noted that he was pleased with what he\u2019s seeing from Dante West, heading into his sophomore season, and Sean \u201cPup\u201d Williams.\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of time to fine-tune things in practice and against nonleague competition before opening Ivy League play at Franklin Field against Dartmouth on Oct. 4 (1 p.m., ESPN+). The Big Green finished No. 2 in the Ivy polling, just behind top-ranked Harvard.\n\nNow, it\u2019s getting back to the game of inches and worrying less about the margins.\n\n\u201cOur journey started right after the season,\u201d said Priore. \u201cI think we came off a season that I think for the players we\u2019re not satisfied, [so] we had to reach deep down and start that process \u2026 and our kids have started that progression and are very hungry and excited to get back.\u201d",

      "text": "Penn State has its highest preseason ranking in the James Franklin Era. Here\u2019s how.\nThe Nittany Lions have their 2022 recruiting class to thank for the program's highest AP preseason poll ranking in 12 seasons with Franklin as head coach\nPenn State\u2019s long climb back to national relevance under James Franklin has been uneven at times. His regime started with consecutive 7-6 seasons, an unexpected Big Ten title run that came up just short of the four-team College Football Playoff at the time, and seven seasons thereafter of falling just short of getting over the hump.\nThen last season\u2019s run happened.\nThe season felt gloomy after a Nov. 2 loss to Ohio State, which has become an annual occurrence since that 2016 season. But a light switched on and Penn State won four of its next five games, which included a hard-fought loss to Big Ten champion Oregon. If not for some late-game misfortune against Notre Dame in their CFP semifinal, the Nittany Lions could have been playing for a national title in what had seemed like a lost season two months earlier.\n\u00bb READ MORE: Nick Singleton among five Penn State players on The Athletic\u2019s \u2018Freaks List\u2019\nEntering this season, Penn State is No. 2 in the Associated Press preseason poll, the highest ranking since 1997, when the Nittany Lions were preseason No. 1. Penn State was also ranked No. 3 in USA Today\u2019s preseason coaches poll. It\u2019s the first time in more than 40 years in which the Nittany Lions have been ranked in the preseason top 10 in three straight years after starting the 2023 season at No. 7 and 2024 at No. 8.\nAlthough Franklin and his players have largely downplayed the preseason hype around the program, there\u2019s no denying this is the most anticipated season in the coach\u2019s tenure.\nHow last year\u2019s team, one that captured 13 wins, the most in program history, came to fruition dates back to the 2022 recruiting class.\nHeadlining the group, quarterback Drew Allar, was the Nittany Lions\u2019 prized five-star recruit out of Medina, Ohio, and the third overall prospect in 247Sports\u2019 2022 recruiting class. Running back Nicholas Singleton of Shillington, Pa., and edge rusher Dani Dennis-Sutton of Owings Mills, Md., were the other five-star recruits who joined the Nittany Lions from that class.\nThose three make up the core of this iteration of Penn State football, one that has expectations of the program\u2019s first outright national championship since 1986. Singleton recalls the group creating a group chat ahead of arriving to campus.\nBut there are many more beyond those three, like defensive tackle Zane Durant, offensive tackle Drew Shelton, interior offensive lineman Olaivavega Ioane, running back Kaytron Allen, and others who have developed into starters with NFL potential.\n\u201cI think we had the best recruiting class ever, man,\u201d Durant said during Penn State media day earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s so surreal, bro. We came in on a visit, just seeing each other and moving in together, and seeing everybody develop and chase their goals is actually crazy to see, because we came in at different starting points, some guys ahead, some guys weren\u2019t. We just stayed true to it, stayed true to the process, and just kept going.\u201d\n\u00bb READ MORE: Penn State earns No. 2 ranking in AP preseason poll, its highest spot since 1997\nAdded Ioane: \u201cThat group embodied exactly what Penn State talks about, whether it\u2019s [being] hardworking, being competitors. We came in here from Day 1, we started competing against each other, and that built everything up until now, just everybody working at it. We\u2019re all really close off the field, too.\u201d\nThe 29-player recruiting class, three of whom were transfers, already has five NFL players: Abdul Carter (2025 first-round pick), Chop Robinson (2024 first-round pick), Kevin Winston Jr. (2025 third-round pick), Hunter Nourzad (2024 fifth-round pick), and Mitchell Tinsley (undrafted free agent). Other significant contributors, like backup quarterback Beau Pribula (now at Missouri), wide receiver Omari Evans (Mississippi), and offensive lineman JB Nelson (Kansas State), have since moved on to other schools, but they played key roles in last season\u2019s deep CFP run.\nJust 12 players remain from that original class, but the impact on the program has been obvious. Singleton and Allen have been three-year starters. Durant, Dennis-Sutton, and Ioane have been key contributors the last two seasons, and Shelton started last year for the first time.\n\u201cThere was obviously a lot of hype around us at the time [of our recruiting class],\u201d Downingtown West grad Shelton said. \u201cObviously, that hype doesn\u2019t really matter until you do something with it. But my freshman camp coming in, seeing a bunch of guys running with the ones and the twos and seeing what they\u2019re doing, that was kind of when we knew that this class was going to be special.\u201d\n\u00bb READ MORE: James Franklin embraces Penn State\u2019s high expectations in 2025, but preseason hype \u2018means nothing\u2019 without results\nStacking up against recent champs\nPenn State doesn\u2019t have to look far to see how its journey could turn out. The Big Ten has won back-to-back national titles, breaking a nine-year gap between championships, but looking deeper at Ohio State and Michigan\u2019s rosters, the parallels to Penn State are stark.\nOn Michigan\u2019s 2023 title team, it returned quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the running back tandem of Blake Corum and Donovan Edwards, four of the five starting offensive linemen, and nine of 12 players on defense who played 400 snaps or more in 2022.\nOhio State last season returned running back TreyVeon Henderson, four of five starting offensive linemen, nine of its 11 starting defensive players, and added quarterback Will Howard, running back Quinshon Judkins, and safety Caleb Downs in the transfer portal, all of whom played big roles in the Buckeyes\u2019 title run.\nThe Nittany Lions return Allar, running backs Singleton and Allen, four of five starting offensive linemen, and just five starters defensively, although several backups played meaningful snaps throughout Penn State\u2019s playoff run last year.\nMichigan made the CFP in 2021 and 2022, losing in the semifinal, before breaking through in 2023. Ohio State made the CFP in 2022, lost to Michigan in 2023, and returned to the playoff in 2024 (despite losing to the Wolverines again) before going on its title run.\nFor Penn State, last season was the program\u2019s first in the CFP, but losses to Michigan and Ohio State in 2022 and a loss to the Buckeyes in 2023 prevented potential playoff berths. The expanded 12-team playoff certainly helped the Nittany Lions, but the core group has eclipsed 10 or more wins for the first time in a three-year stretch since 1980-82.\n\u00bb READ MORE: Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti isn\u2019t mincing words when it comes to College Football Playoff expansion\n\u201cI think personally speaking, there was a lot of things I wanted to accomplish here, both individually and as a team, that, you know, I felt like that I didn\u2019t accomplish through my first three years,\u201d Allar said on his decision to return for his senior season. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for everybody that decided to come back, but there are probably some similarities to my decision. \u2026 Just urgently working as hard as I can and being as diligent as possible for me to become the player that I want to be.\u201d\nThree new receivers are key\nAllar\u2019s intention to return coincided with offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki, who was reportedly a finalist for the West Virginia head coaching job. Kotelnicki, who ran Kansas\u2019 prolific offense and Buffalo\u2019s before that, raised Allar\u2019s floor as a player and maximized the skill sets of tight end Tyler Warren, Singleton, and Allen.\nThis season, Kotelnicki has transfers Trebor Pe\u00f1a, Devonte Ross, and Kyron Hudson in a revamped corps of receivers. Warren was the leading receiver last year by a large margin, while the team\u2019s pass catchers were much maligned, led by Evans, Harrison Wallace, and Liam Clifford, who combined for zero catches in the CFP semifinal loss to Notre Dame. In fact, no receiver caught a pass in that 27-24 loss.\nAfter losing Wallace and Evans to the portal, Penn State sought receivers who were \u201cveterans that have already produced in college football,\u201d Franklin said. And those three wideouts will be counted on to change the narrative of the receiving corps, along with returners Tyseer Denmark, a Philly native, and Clifford.\n\u201cI felt like they had a great team,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a, who had 941 yards and nine receiving touchdowns last season at Syracuse. \u201cThey had a lot of guys returning, obviously, Drew\u2019s returning. I felt like it just made the most sense for me. I can tell by the way our group works that everybody\u2019s hungry, everybody\u2019s ready to work, and nobody is complacent at all. We\u2019ve got a great group of guys, and I\u2019m happy I\u2019m able to contribute to that.\u201d\nAdded Hudson, who transferred from Southern Cal: \u201cI think just coming here to a school like this made the opportunity even better. Having the receiver corps we have, the brotherhood that we have here \u2026 I feel like I made the greatest decision I ever made.\u201d\n\u00bb READ MORE: James Franklin says Penn State is \u2018that close\u2019 to winning it all. A new baseline for success has been set.\nHudson, Ross, and Pe\u00f1a could be the missing pieces for Penn State\u2019s offense, along with Allar\u2019s ability to take the next step. Tight ends Khalil Dinkins, Luke Reynolds, and Andrew Rappleyea should also factor in as weapons for Kotelnicki\u2019s offense as well.\nHow far Penn State goes in 2025 will rest on Allar\u2019s shoulders, as the potential 2026 first-round pick has a 23-6 record as a starter. He could become the Nittany Lions\u2019 highest-drafted quarterback since Kerry Collins went fifth overall to the Carolina Panthers in 1995.\n\u201cI think the biggest thing is we need more playmaking at the wide receiver position for us to go where we want to go, in critical moments, in critical games,\u201d Franklin said earlier this month. \u201cDrew having more people around him making plays for him, I think will be really valuable.\u201d\nTime will tell.\nStaff writer Greg Finberg contributed to this article."

Now he\u2019s looking forward to coaching in the Ivy League.\nTaylor Wray is joining his third Philadelphia-area lacrosse program as he takes over as Penn men\u2019s lacrosse coach after 14 seasons at the helm at St. Joseph\u2019s.\n\u201cPhilly is the best sports town in the world,\u201d said Wray, a former defender for the Philadelphia Wings, a professional box lacrosse team. \u201cIf you can create a product that is exciting and represents the city and the toughness of the city and the grit of the city and the passion of the city, then people will support you.\u201d\nWray was named Penn\u2019s coach in on July 11. He said it was time for a change in his coaching career, and he wanted to experience coaching in the Ivy League, a top conference in college lacrosse, at a school known for pouring resources into its lacrosse programs.\n\u201cThis just feels like the next step in the progression of my coaching career,\u201c Wray said. \u201dThere\u2019s a lot of tradition and history at Penn that I need to get to know, but the infrastructure there is definitely in place to build something that can contend at the national level.\u201d\nThe coaching change came late. Penn began its search for a replacement after parting ways with Mike Murphy, who led the team for 16 seasons, in late June. USA Lacrosse Magazine called the timing of the decision \u201cpeculiar.\u201d\n\u201cA change in leadership is needed to elevate the men\u2019s lacrosse program to compete for Ivy and national championships,\u201d Penn athletic director Alanna Wren wrote in a press release.\nScott Meehan, who has been involved with St. Joe\u2019s program since 2019, will take over as head coach.\nLast season, Penn compiled a 4-10 record (1-5 Ivy), the program\u2019s worst since 2012, while St. Joe\u2019s, which competes in the Atlantic 10, finished 9-6 (2-3 A-10).\nUltimately, the Quakers found what they were looking for in Wray, who leaves St. Joe\u2019s as the winningest coach in program history.\nWray, an Edmonton, Alberta, native, played at Duke before joining the Professional Lacrosse League from 2004 to 2011. He was drafted by the Calgary Roughnecks and was the National Lacrosse League Rookie of the Year in 2004.\n\u00bb READ MORE: Haverford College\u2019s Harry Genth thought his baseball career was over. Now, he\u2019s signed with Minnesota.\nHis last five seasons in the league were with the Wings, and he began coaching as an assistant at St. Joe\u2019s during that stint.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say enough good things about my experience at St. Joe\u2019s and how well positioned they are to continue to be successful in the sport of men\u2019s lacrosse,\u201d Wray said. \u201cThere were a lot of growing pains the first few years, but we started to kind of turn things around in the third year there and got things moving in the right direction.\u201d\nWray acknowledged that Penn has had success before. The Quakers won the Ivy League and made NCAA quarterfinal appearances in 2019 and 2022, but he also knows what it takes to turn a program around.\n\u00bb READ MORE: Olin Chamberlain Jr. is grateful to play at Temple as a preferred walk-on: \u2018Iron sharpens iron\u2019\n\u201cThe Ivy League is as tough a conference from top to bottom as any conference in Division I lacrosse,\u201d Wray said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge to compete with the other teams in the Ivy, but not much different than the Atlantic 10, which is a very challenging league from top to bottom as well. The level of play in the Ivy might be slightly higher, and we\u2019ll need to make sure that we\u2019re prepared to compete with those guys.\u201d\nWray is excited to join a program with a long heritage. St. Joe\u2019s lacrosse is heading into its 33rd year as a varsity sport, whereas Penn has 125 seasons under its belt.\n\u201cI learned a lot about recruiting [at St. Joe\u2019s],\u201d Wray said. \u201cI learned a lot about how important it is to have the right people on board and to have the right culture established, and I think that those are going to be the biggest keys to bring to a more well-established program like Penn.\u201d"
