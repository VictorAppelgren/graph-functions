  "content": "Piles of untouched Happy Meals littered sidewalks outside McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Japan as frenzied customers scrambled to buy limited-edition sets with Pok\u00e9mon cards over the weekend.\n\nThe promotional tie-up between McDonald\u2019s and Pok\u00e9mon ended just hours after it launched on Saturday as customers bought bulk orders of the meals to get their hands on an exclusive set of cards for resale, discarding the food entirely.\n\nA Happy Meal set costs about $3.50 (around 510 yen) \u2013 with food, a drink and a toy \u2013 but scalpers are listing McDonald\u2019s Japan Pok\u00e9mon cards on eBay for $28 each.\n\nPhotos on social media showed dozens of bags of Happy Meals dumped outside a restaurant, as well as unclaimed food left sitting idly on self-pick-up tables, prompting public outcries of food wastage.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that the distribution of Pok\u00e9mon cards to customers who purchased the Pok\u00e9mon Happy Meal, which was scheduled for three days only from August 9 to 11, has ended at many stores due to higher than expected sales,\u201d McDonald\u2019s Japan posted on its official website.\n\nJapan is typically known as a model of cleanliness, with tourists often praising the country for its tidy streets and high standards of public hygiene. So, when images of piles of rubbish were posted to social media, people took notice and urged McDonald\u2019s management to clean up the mess.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the fast food chain said it \u201cdoes not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for resale or the abandonment or disposal of food.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Japan also said it will work with third-party websites to stop scalpers from ratcheting up the price of the collectible cards.\n\n\u201cThe recent situation clearly contradicts our long-held philosophy of providing enjoyable dining experiences for children and families.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take this matter seriously and acknowledge that our response was insufficient.\u201d\n\nJapan is the birthplace of Pok\u00e9mon, the globally popular franchise centered around pocket-sized monsters that have appeared in trading cards, video games, films and TV series since 1996.\n\nLimited edition and mint condition Pok\u00e9mon cards can fetch hundreds of dollars on the resale and collectibles market, driving many to purchase the cards as a speculative alternative investment.",

      "text": "There\u2019s a new contender for the world\u2019s most expensive crunchy snack.\nA Pok\u00e9mon-shaped Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheeto nicknamed \u201cCheetozard\u201d has sold for $87,840 to an unnamed buyer, the Goldin auction house said on social media.\nThe 3 inch (7 cm) long Cheeto, shaped like the character Charizard from the Japanese anime franchise, is affixed to a customized Pok\u00e9mon card and enclosed in a box.\nThe dragon-shaped spicy snack was discovered and preserved by a sports memorabilia company sometime between 2018 and 2022, then surged in popularity on social media last year, according to Goldin\u2019s website.\nCheetozard sold for a whopping $72,000 plus a buyer\u2019s premium, Goldin said. Bidding on the precious Cheeto began at $250 in mid-February and quickly climbed into the upper five figures.\n\u201cGoldin specializes in rare and one-of-a-kind collectibles, and the Cheetozard is exactly this. Part of what makes this item so fun and unique is that it bridges two fandoms \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon, and Cheetos,\u201d said Dave Amerman, Head of Consignment at Goldin.\nCheetos, the snack brand owned by PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay, responded to Goldin\u2019s Instagram post about the sale with a \u201ctwo eyes\u201d emoji.\n\u201cCheetos are crafted with individual care and designed to be unique, and the \u2018Cheetozard\u2019 is no exception. It\u2019s a longstanding tradition for fans to search for fun, interesting shapes and sizes inside every Cheetos bag, and we always love to see what they find,\u201d said Tina Mahal, senior vice president of marketing at PepsiCo Foods US.\nPok\u00e9mon\u2019s Charizard is a large, orange dragon with turquoise wings and a flame at the tip of its tail. Known as Lizardon in Japan, the dragon is one of the franchise\u2019s original creatures \u2013 and one of its most beloved. In 2020, Charizard was voted one of the top 10 most popular Pok\u00e9mon, according to the franchise.\nSocial media users flooded the comment section of Goldin\u2019s Instagram posts about the sale. Many questioned why someone would spend so much money on a Cheeto, while others wondered how the snack came to be so dragon-esque.\n\u201cThis is kinda stupid but it\u2019s 2025, people doing wild things,\u201d one user said.\nAnother joked that Cheetozard would be their death row meal.\nThis is not the first time a curiously shaped Cheeto has sold for buckets of cash. In 2017, a Cheeto resembling Harambe the gorilla fetched nearly $100,000 on auction site eBay."

      "text": "Professor Chris McMorran teaches Japanese studies at the National University of Singapore, where his work focuses on serious and important topics like labor, gender and marginalized communities.\nBut when he takes his students to Japan, one major question invariably emerges: why aren\u2019t there any trash cans?\nIt\u2019s a common refrain, especially among the Western travelers who flock to Japan in increasing numbers every year: how can the country be so clean and organized when there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to dispose of garbage in public places?\nMcMorran\u2019s students are not the only ones with that question. Earlier this year, the Japanese National Tourism Organization (JNTO) conducted a survey of passengers leaving Japan and asked what logistical challenges they faced during their trip.\nThe number one response? A lack of trash cans. Twenty-two percent of tourists cited the difficulty of finding a place to throw away garbage as the single biggest issue they\u2019d dealt with during their trip, ahead of a lack of English speakers (15%) and overcrowding at popular attractions (13%).\nThere are a few different ways to address the trash disposal question, but they generally involve the unique cadences of Japanese etiquette.\n\u201cThis (lack of trash cans) can be a nuisance particularly for budget-conscious young travelers,\u201d says McMorran. \u201cInstead of sitting down for a meal at a restaurant, they are more likely to grab an onigiri at a convenience store or an Instagrammable dessert at a stall. Once they finish eating, they search in vain for a place to throw the waste.\u201d\nHe notes that while local Japanese people also buy food and drinks from vending machines or kombini (convenience stores), the difference is that they don\u2019t necessarily consume these products on the street.\nIt\u2019s considered bad manners to eat while walking \u2014 to the point where some cities in Japan have outright barred the practice. Instead, it\u2019s more common to take these grab-and-go foods to their home or office, eat it there, and then dispose of the trash. If they do eat while out on the go, most people keep a small bag with them where they can stow trash until they get home.\nThe effect of tourism growth\nMass tourism is causing problems with Japan\u2019s public trash situation.\nFor example, travelers come from around the world to visit the UNESCO-listed city of Nara, a 45-minute bullet train ride east of Osaka. While the city is home to historic temples and Buddhist artifacts, its most famous residents are wild deer which are known for taking crackers from visitors and \u201cbowing\u201d to say thank you.\nTrash, though, has become a life-or-death issue for the deer: nine died in 2019 after eating plastic waste that was left on the ground by tourists.\nTrash cans were removed from Nara\u2019s parks in 1985 to prevent deer from trying to eat out of them. Signs throughout the city cautioned people not to litter as eating trash or food outside of their diet could be harmful for the deer.\nAs the number of travelers increased, it became clear that the posted signs weren\u2019t enough, and people weren\u2019t following the local custom of taking their trash away with them. The city has since reconsidered its policy and installed several trash bins near the busiest tourist areas.\nThe solar-powered trash cans are printed with \u201cSave the deer\u201d in English.\nTokyo\u2019s cool Shibuya neighborhood has also struggled to cope with tourists and the trash they leave behind. Local politicians have cracked down on the notoriously riotous Halloween celebrations and made it illegal to consume alcohol on the street \u2014 partly to reduce noise complaints, but also to curb the amount of litter.\nOn TikTok, videos about Japanese etiquette for tourists abound, with some travelers comparing Japan favorably to Canada and the US in its approach to public hygiene or offering tips about where to find a trash can when you really need one (many vending machines have a small one next to them).\nFor some tourists, the lack of easily findable rubbish bins is another charming quirk of Japanese culture.\nFor other visitors, it\u2019s a nuisance that diminishes the enjoyment of their vacation.\nHong Kong resident Rubin Verebes is in the latter camp. He visited Japan for the first time in September 2024 and said he was annoyed by the difficulty of finding a place to throw litter away.\n\u201cIt is infuriating to walk around Tokyo the whole day, racking up 20,000-plus steps on your feet, and not find a single bin to throw away your plastic wrapping from your sandwich,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSome 7-Eleven, Family Mart or Lawson stores didn\u2019t even have rubbish bins to use, so you are left to hold these dirty wrappers or bottles all day until you get back to your hotel. (It\u2019s) great that the streets are clean, but it is annoying having to hold (trash) all day long.\u201d\nPaul Christie, CEO of travel company Walk Japan, says he focuses on the values of respect and community when he fields questions from clients about the lack of trash cans.\n\u201cThe Japanese prize cleanliness and cooperate as a society to make it so, the result being that their country rates highly in the neat and tidy stakes,\u201d he tells CNN.\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d says McMorran, the Japanese studies professor, \u201cJapanese communities have made the decision to avoid the nuisance and cost of public garbage cans, and Japanese consumers have accepted the burden of having a disposal plan when they purchase something.\u201d\nJapan has made a huge push for its citizens to recycle, which is another reason for the small sizes of trash cans. McMorran says that some municipalities have as many as 20 different categories of recyclable items, and even some locals can find it challenging to sort them all and throw out everything correctly.\n\u201cThe spotless public transport system is an excellent example where all passengers treat the stations, trains, buses and fellow travelers with respect and act accordingly.\u201d\nA darker undercurrent\nBeyond the topics of cleanliness and hygiene, there\u2019s a bleaker reason behind the lack of trash cans in public areas.\nOn March 20, 1995, members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult carried out sarin gas attacks on several Tokyo subway trains, killing 14 people and injuring at least 5,500 more.\nThe cult members brought plastic packets of sarin onto subway cars, dropped them on the floor, and then punctured the bags with umbrella tips as they left the train. Several subway workers who attempted to clean up the spill and help passengers escape were among those who died.\nThe incident shocked Japan and changed the country forever.\nOne aftereffect was the removal of trash cans from subway and train stations. While some still exist, they feature clear plastic bags that enable police officers to easily see what\u2019s inside, rather than the dark metal cylinders used in the past.\nAnd this phenomenon isn\u2019t isolated to Japan.\nMany trash cans were removed from London Underground stations and major intersections throughout the UK capital following several bombings by the paramilitary Irish Republican Army in the 1970s.\nJapanese authorities also closely monitor terror incidents overseas. Two Japanese rail lines stopped maintaining trash cans after train bombings in Madrid in 2004, citing concerns about terrorism.\nThere is a creative solution for travelers worried about how to carry their waste during the day.\nFuroshiki are square pieces of cloth used to wrap items, and nearly every souvenir shop in Japan will have some. They can work in the short term for carrying trash until finding a bin, then can serve decorative purposes back home after the vacation."
