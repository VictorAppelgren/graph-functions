      "title": "The big buydown bet",
      "summary": "Mortgage rate buydowns have become a trap for buyers, as UST 10‑year yields remain above 6.5% in 2025, keeping mortgage rates high and pushing home prices up. The continued high rates are expected to persist through 2025, forcing sellers to cut prices or offer new buydowns and eroding equity gains for homeowners who took buydowns in 2022‑23. This sustained rate environment weakens the housing market and limits the upside for recent buyers who relied on temporary buydowns to afford higher‑priced homes.",
