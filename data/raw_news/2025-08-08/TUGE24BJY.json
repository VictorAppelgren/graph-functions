  "content": "Princess Beatrice could have been named something different if Queen Elizabeth II hadn't stepped in a rejected the original moniker her parents chose for her.\n\nHowever, her name was not revealed to the public for a whole two weeks after her arrival.\n\nIn that time, the nation waited with bated breath to discover the name of the new Royal, who at the time would be fifth-in-line to the throne.\n\nAnd when the name was revealed, it was a surprise to bookies and the rest of the nation.\n\nNo-one had expected the newest Royal in 1988 to be called Beatrice.\n\nIn fact, many people were pretty sure as early as May that year that Beatrice would be called Annabel.This was after a newspaper quoted Andrew saying as much.\n\nSome people also thought the names Charlotte and Victoria were in the running.\n\nNot a single bet was placed on the name Beatrice at two of the largest bookmakers at the time.\n\nThe Press Association quoted a William Hill bookmakers at the time as saying: \u2018It\u2019s terrific.\n\n'We couldn\u2019t have chosen a better name.\u2019\n\nAnother bookmaker, from Coral, said: \u2018It is a bit of a surprise for everybody.\n\n'Victoria and Elizabeth were the two favorites.\u2019\n\nJust one newspaper, The Sun, ended up correctly choosing Beatrice, in the process explaining the remarkable reason for why it wouldn\u2019t be Annabel.\n\nThe newspaper reported that it was indeed Prince Andrew and Sarah\u2019s first choice.\n\nHowever, Princess Annabel was not to be, because the Queen disliked it. She rejected it, saying it was too \u2018yuppie\u2019.\n\nSince the monarch has to approve Royal names, Annabel was out.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t explain why the Queen thought so little of the name.\n\nThe Queen ended up suggesting the name Beatrice, which was the name of Queen Victoria\u2019s youngest child.\n\nIt derives from the Latin for 'one who brings joy'.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the name therefore was royal enough for the Queen and, crucially, unusual enough to satisfy Fergie.",

Founded in 2002, the label is best known for its elegant handbags, regularly spotted on royal style icons, such as the Princess of Wales , Zara Tindall, Princess Beatrice and Queen Camilla.

The haunting at Sandringham was first reported by the late Kenneth Rose, a royal biographer and journalist who shared the story in his personal diaries.

After all, Edward was only seventh in line to the throne and therefore it was remarkably unlikely the crown would ever find his head. The Royal Family, even appeared to accept that it was a much low-key ceremony with St George's Chapel in Windsor chosen as the venue instead of St Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey in central London. However, any hope of avoiding a media circus were dramatically halted when distressing images of Sophie were leaked to The Sun newspaper by a former colleague and friend of Sophie's.\nPrincess Eugenie just wore the perfect summer dress while on holiday with Robbie Williams and Ayda in Portugal - and we've found it on the high street\nPrincess Eugenie is continuing her style transformation while enjoying a getaway in Portugal with friends Robbie Williams and Ayda Field.

She was blamed for multiple palace aides leaving royal employ amid allegations of bullying and allegedly even made staff cry. Meghan, who turns 44 today, has always denied the allegations of bullying while she was working as a royal, which she described as an orchestrated smear campaign against her. Supporters insisted that she was 'well liked' by royal aides who were inspired by her energy and enthusiasm. Veteran royal correspondent Valentine Low broke the bullying story in May 2021, just before Harry and Meghan were to appear on screen with Oprah Winfrey to discuss Megxit. He said: ' There had been one or two stories which suggested there were difficult relations between Meghan and her staff. We'd seen them and the phrase \"Duchess Difficult\" had been used. We knew Meghan was angry about those stories. We knew she challenged that narrative'.\nHow the Queen Mother dealt with grandchildren's divorce misery: The profound effect marriage breakdowns had on the royal, dubbed 'imperial ostrich' over her views - on what would have been her 125th birthday\nToday would have been the Queen Mother 's 125th birthday and in her long and remarkable life she witnessed massive changes in attitudes within Britain. She lived to see the legalisation of abortion and homosexuality as well as the criminalisation of capital punishment. But the societal change that perhaps most impacted Elizabeth was the growing societal acceptance of divorce in Britain. Indeed, the Royal Family 's hostility to divorce in the 1930s was part of the reason Elizabeth's husband King George VI ascended to the throne.\nEXCLUSIVE Meghan Markle aides who accused her of bullying were frightened of 'what she would do to them' because of her 'infinite capacity for revenge', veteran royal correspondent claims\nThe Duchess of Sussex's staff were left 'in a psychologically delicate state' and 'viewed her capacity for revenge as infinite', an expert has alleged. Meghan, 43, has always denied the allegations of bullying while she was working as a royal, which she described as an orchestrated smear campaign against her. Veteran royal correspondent Valentine Low broke the bullying story in May 2021, just before Harry and Meghan were to appear on screen with Oprah Winfrey to discuss Megxit. He claims that some of the royal staff who had worked with the Sussexes were still in a 'very fragile state' more than two years later - and despite the royal couple having emigrated 5,000 miles away to the US. 'They were very worried about what Meghan would do to them. They viewed her capacity for revenge as infinite', Mr Low said.\nBehind the scenes of Prince William's Christening that caused Diana agony: The Queen Mother turned 82 on the same day while Charles and Diana clashed\nFor most people, a family Christening means wearing your best clothes, piling into the local church for a pompous ceremony and eating finger sandwiches as you chat to the umpteenth distant relative of the day. But for the heir to the throne, things are much more elaborate. The Christening for Prince William took place at 11am in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace , a traditional setting for royal Christenings since the birth of Queen Victoria's children, on August 4, 1982 - the same day as the Queen Mother's 82nd birthday. Princess Diana held her newborn son, who wore the antique Christening robe that was made for King Edward VII, as he was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. His Godparents reflected his noble heritage: King Constantine II of Greece, Princess Alexandra of Kent, the Duchess of Westminster, Lord Romsey (now Earl Mountbatten of Burma), Lady Susan Hussey and Sir Laurens van der Post.\nPrince Andrew should testify to US lawmakers under oath over his ties to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, says top lawyer\nFamed lawyer Gloria Allred, 84, said the Duke of York should volunteer to speak under oath before Congress.

And if not, why not?'\nThe extraordinary advice Prince Philip gave 'level-headed' Kate Middleton that she still keeps to today, according to royal author\nEight years ago on this day, Prince Philip undertook his final solo public engagement after 70 years of service to the Firm. Stepping down at the age of 96, he was the longest-serving consort in British history and served as patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations. The prince of Greece - with Danish, German and Russian blood - was viewed as an outsider when he first joined the institution but quickly became known as the Queen's strength and stay. This made him arguably the best person to advise newlywed Kate Middleton as she entered the Firm aged 29. According to royal author Gyles Brandreth, who became a friend of Philip through his work for the National Playing Fields Association, the Duke of Edinburgh was 'relieved' that his grandson, Prince William, had found 'such a level-headed girl' in Kate.\nI'm a royal fashion expert and this is Zara Tindall's most stylish outfit - as she's named in Tatler's Best Dressed List\nTatler Magazine revealed its annual Best Dressed List earlier this week, and it came as no surprise that Zara Tindall made the cut.

In a video shared to his YouTube channel, ex royal chef Darren McGrady said the simple hearty breakfast was what the princess ate 'everyday' or on 'most mornings' at Kensington Palace. He added that it was 'healthy and packed with protein and nutrients' - much of the reasons why modern day celebrities and influencers have gone crazy for it.

Royal biographer Katie Nicholl wrote in The Making of a Royal Romance: 'William had signed up for 18 months of training with the RAF and there was simply no time to even think about a wedding.
