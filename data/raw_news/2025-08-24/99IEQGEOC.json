  "content": "Melbourne is renowned as an Aussie city where coffee lovers can rely on grabbing a first-class brew just about anywhere.\n\nAnd now Hollywood star John Cena has declared that Victoria's capital is the 'best place in the world' for a flat white.\n\nThe 48-year-old wrestler turned actor, who spent time frequenting Melbourne's cafes while filming Ricky Stanicky in 2023, is a well-known coffee connoisseur.\n\nMelbourne is a 'coffee-first' city, the suave performer declared in a video that\u2019s since gone viral on Reddit.\n\nThe TikTok clip, originally produced by Bon App\u00e9tit magazine, features Cena sampling coffee from the Cond\u00e9 Nast office caf\u00e9 in New York City.\n\n'When it comes to coffee, John Cena is a purist. The actor explains why he judges a coffee shop based on how they make their flat whites,' the caption read.\n\nAn unimpressed Cena says that the coffee presented to him for the test was an 'American version' of a flat white.\n\n'I can tell cause it's too big and there\u2019s too much milk and the milk's not steamed,' he explains.\n\nHe continues, \u2018The reason I love a flat white is because coffee is a universal language throughout the world. So I will judge a place based on its flat white.'\n\nCena said he divides cafes into two categories.\n\n'A lot of places are food first and coffee is an accoutrement,' he said.\n\nAfter judging that the Cond\u00e9 Nast cafe is not a 'coffee-first' establishment, Cena declared, 'The best flat whites I\u2019ve had are in Melbourne, Australia; they are coffee-first people.'\n\nElsewhere in the clip, Cena gave a rundown of the best way to prepare a flat white, explaining that the ideal size would be 170 grams (six ounces), which gives the double-shot of coffee a stronger taste.\n\nThe Reddit post, captioned 'Melbourne coffee getting some kudos', has racked up more than 4,400 views and 300 comments.\n\n'This man knows his coffee,' one user wrote on the thread.\n\n'All I really know is that my flat whites in America were milky AF even in a small cup,' added another.\n\nA third user commented, 'That is top-tier coffee wan**ry. Well done John Cena.'\n\nCena was often spotted around Melbourne during his downtime while filming Ricky Stanicky with co-stars Zac Efron and Jim Carrey back in February 2023.\n\nThe WWE great was seen at local restaurants and caf\u00e9s, according to the Herald Sun.\n\n'He came in every single day aside from Thursday. I was one of the main people waitressing him,' a waiter from Degraves Espresso said.\n\n'I've respected his space and he's been a very good customer... He's welcome back anytime.'\n\nShe went on to say Cena 'just walked in' one day and sat down, revealing that more customers have been showing up to get a glimpse of him.",
