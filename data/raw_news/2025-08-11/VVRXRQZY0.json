The Notes were priced at par value and will bear an interest rate of 6.375% per annum. The Notes are being offered in a private offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by Novelis, and by certain of Novelis' subsidiaries. The Issuer expects to close the offering of the Notes on August 18, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nThe Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand, to (i) purchase all of the outstanding $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.250% Senior Notes due November 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\") that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant the Issuer's previously announced tender offer (the \"Tender Offer\") and (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Tender Offer. To the extent that there are any remaining proceeds from the Offering, the Issuer intends, but is not obligated, to use such proceeds to redeem the remaining 2026 Notes that are not validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer at the applicable optional redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.\n\nThe Notes and the related guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and have not been, and will not be, offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons, except to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which, or to any person to whom, such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
