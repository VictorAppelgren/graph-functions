  "description": "Altera will trim scores of tech jobs in San Jose \u2014 although the pace of tech staff reductions has slowed in the Bay Area.",
  "content": "SAN JOSE \u2014 Altera will cut 82 jobs in north San Jose, according to an official notice the tech company filed with the state Employment Development Department.\n\nThe chipmaker stated the reductions would all occur around Oct. 8 at its headquarters at 101 Innovation Dr.\n\n\u201cPermanent employment losses for certain employees\u201d will occur, Shiva Allen, an Altera vice president, wrote in the WARN letter the company sent to the state EDD.\n\nAltera employees are not represented by a labor union, the company stated in the WARN notice.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the company\u2019s policy for transfer, bumping or reassignment for salaried, hourly or managerial employees,\u201d Altera told the EDD in the filing.\n\nThe layoffs have emerged in the wake of Intel\u2019s decision to sell a 51% stake in Altera to Silver Lake, a private equity investment firm that specializes in tech company acquisitions. The deal was completed in May and a new CEO took the reins of Altera around that time.\n\nDespite the layoff announcement, signs have begun to emerge that job losses for the Bay Area tech industry are starting to abate.\n\nOver the first six months of 2025, the Bay Area lost 18,300 tech jobs, according to seasonally adjusted estimates that Beacon Economics derived from the official monthly state EDD jobs reports for California and its metro regions.\n\nYet sharp contrasts have emerged in the pace of losses during the first three months of 2025 compared with the numbers for the next three months, this news organization\u2019s analysis of the Beacon and EDD reports shows.\n\nDuring January-through-March, the Bay Area lost a net total of 12,000 tech jobs. From April-through-June, the region lost 6,300.\n\nThe South Bay has lost 5,100 tech jobs in 2025. Of these, 5,000 came in the first quarter and 100 occurred in the second.\n\nThe San Francisco-San Mateo region slashed 9,000 tech jobs during the first half of 2025 \u2013 5,000 in the first quarter and 4,000 in the second.\n\nThe East Bay shed 3,800 tech jobs over the first six months of 2025 with 1,700 in the first quarter and 2,100 in the second.",
