  "title": "I Put Apple AirTags on Basically Everything and You Can Too Thanks to This Labor Day Deal",
  "description": "I use AirTags for travel and tracking everything from my bike to my keys. If you want to stock up, you can get a four-pack for $70 right during Amazon's Labor Day Deal.",
  "content": "Labor Day deal: With Labor Day weekend comes some pretty significant savings, especially on top tech like the Apple AirTags. During Prime Day in July, the four-pack dropped to $80. But right now, Amazon's Labor Day deals have this four-pack down to just $70. That's a 29% discount, saving you $29. Just remember, deals like these can be fleeting so scoop up this deal while you can.\n\nNot long ago, as I waited at baggage claim after a trip to Paris, I became increasingly nervous as bag after bag dropped onto the carousel, none of them mine. I knew there was no need to panic, though. Back at Charles de Gaulle airport, I had dropped a sophisticated little tracking device into my trusty rolling suitcase before handing it over and heading to my gate. So, I pulled out my iPhone, and with just a few taps, I could see that my bag had never left the City of Light. (Merde!)\n\nOver the years, I've come to depend on Apple's AirTags to keep track of my easy-to-lose valuables. They're not just good for luggage, I use them to track wallets, bikes, keys and even my car. I tell everyone who will listen that you can never have too many of these handy devices.\n\nHere's how the Apple AirTag (like the one that was in my suitcase on that fateful trip) works. It uses an ingenious method of tracking itself, detecting its location from nearby iPhones and using them to anonymously piggyback the coordinates to a secure server where I could look it up on my iPhone. Until just a few years ago, this would have seemed like a scene straight out of a spy movie.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nInstead of wondering if my belongings were stuck on an abandoned luggage cart or strewn across the tarmac, I could see in almost real time that my suitcase was still chilling at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. I was able to calmly tell the airline my bag didn't make the flight, and it made arrangements to have it delivered to me a few days later.\n\nApple AirTags are all about peace of mind\n\nBy itself, an AirTag isn't much. A smooth, round, 1.26-inch puck that looks like a glossy white breath mint, it sinks to the bottom of a bag or dangles from a key chain (with a compatible key ring, sold separately). It's meant to disappear.\n\nActivating the AirTag was a simple process of pairing with my iPhone. And then, because it obviously doesn't really do anything out of the box, I forgot about it.\n\nBut the next time I couldn't find my keys? Sorcery. My iPhone didn't just tell me they were somewhere nearby -- it walked me directly to them, thanks to the AirTag's built-in Ultra Wideband chip. Suddenly, all that time I'd spent retracing my steps and overturning couch cushions in the past felt like ancient history.\n\nNow I have AirTags in or attached to every significant item I'd want to keep track of: My everyday laptop bag, my camera backpack, the suitcase I use most when traveling, my key chain, my car and a smaller sling bag I take on walks. I can pull up the Find My app on any of my Apple devices (or sign in to iCloud on any web browser) and see where my items are and the last time the AirTags registered their locations.\n\nAirTags aren't just for my everyday items. People I know in the movie business tell me that AirTags are tossed into nearly every bag and Pelican crate, not solely to ensure that the valuable equipment inside doesn't walk away but also to quickly differentiate equipment amid similar-looking containers. Some of my friends also attach AirTags to their pets' collars (though experts say there are better ways to track your pets).\n\nAirTags are also useful for things that you want to keep close by\n\nBeing able to detect my luggage a continent away provided a sense of relief, to be sure. But at the local level, my AirTags will also trigger an alert when I get too far away from them. For example, if I accidentally forget my camera bag in the car when I stop somewhere for lunch, a Find My notification appears telling me I've left it behind. It works the same for newer AirPods models as well.\n\nSharing is now a big part of AirTag tracking\n\nMy family has two cars, and I wanted to be able to track them both. But it used to be inconvenient to pair the AirTag in the car my wife drives to her iPhone (and the one in my car to my iPhone).\n\nTo guard against unwanted tracking, an AirTag will notify nearby iPhones of its existence, so whenever I drove my wife's car without her in it, I got a notification that an AirTag was traveling with me. (If the owner is near the AirTag, the alert does not appear.)\n\nHowever, ever since the release of iOS 17, AirTags are shareable, which solves this problem. I shared my AirTag with my wife, and she with me, so regardless of which car I'm driving, I can find it more easily in a crowded parking lot without getting constant, unnecessary alerts.\n\nA more recent feature is the ability to temporarily share an AirTag's location with someone I trust. In my luggage example above, if the suitcase was in the airport with me, but the airport's staff hadn't yet been able to locate it (not uncommon during peak travel times), I could share its location with an attendant who could quickly retrieve it from areas inaccessible to the public.\n\u2022 Splash, water and dust resistance: Rated IP67 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes)\n\nThe only minor annoyance about AirTags\n\nAn AirTag includes Bluetooth, the U1 Ultra Wideband chip and an NFC chip to share basic details when it's in Lost Mode. That's all powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery, which in my experience lasts roughly a year before I need to replace it.\n\nI get notified when a battery is starting to get low, although there's no gauge to see how much is left until it goes into the red. And it's easy to change batteries. But my small fleet of AirTags means I need to swap multiple ones each year. I buy them in packs of 20 that I slowly work through.\n\nApple AirTags consistently appear in our gift guides throughout the year because you can always find another use for one. They're often reduced in price when sold in packs of four. And there's an ever-growing ecosystem of ways to mount them, from sturdy vaults that adhere to a car to discrete fabric holders that will keep your favorite classic bomber jacket from flying away. Whenever I show someone how I use AirTags on a bag or keychain, I kind of wish I had a pocket full of AirTags to hand out because once someone sees how it works, they're sold.\n\nWhen will this deal expire?\n\nWe don't know how long this deal will last. We saw four-packs available at a slightly higher price ($80) during Amazon Prime Day, and these four-packs do go on sale a few times throughout the year. This particular deal could expire at any time without notice, even before Labor Day weekend is over, so if you know you want to pick some up, I recommend placing your order while you can be sure to get this price, because I'm confident you'll find new uses for them once you have a few.",

      "text": "We expect the iPhone 17 series to be revealed in September. Since Apple hasn't formally announced its iPhone event, it might be best to hold off on buying any new iPhone. However, you might need an Apple phone now. Lucky for you we've tested and reviewed the iPhone 16 lineup, as well as some older models that you can still buy, so you have a lot of options depending on your needs and budget. For example, there's the $829 iPhone 16 which gets you additional buttons for shortcuts, an extra camera and MagSafe. Then there's also the $999 iPhone 16 Pro, which has a bigger screen and a main camera with a new sensor.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best iPhone right now?\nThe best iPhone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger, 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and creating summaries of messages and web pages. There's also ChatGPT integration with Siri. The phones have an Action button, too, which can be programmed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at.\nBest iPhones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Does most of the Apple stuff I want\n- Battery life is great\n- Matte finish back\n- The rear camera is good\n- A18 chip performance\nCons\n- $599 price isn't cheap\n- Odd value proposition\n- Lacks MagSafe\n- Screen is good, but wonder how it will age\nApple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the $599 iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a \"new\" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. In my testing, I found that this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Read our iPhone 16E review.\nWhy we like it\nAfter testing the iPhone 16E, I was most surprised by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4. If this is all you want in an iPhone, look no further.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the day plus battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.\nWho shouldn't get it\nChoosing between the $829 iPhone 16 and the $599 16E is a tough choice. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nThe iPhone 16 is the recipient of a CNET Editors' Choice award, and you can get one for free when you switch to T-Mobile.

The $599 price is more than Apple's previous cheap phone, the $429 iPhone SE, but it has a similar appeal especially for those currently on an older iPhone.\nFactors to consider when buying a new iPhone\nHold the iPhone first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person.\nDon't discount the last year's model: Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price.\nBuy an iPhone case and screen protector: You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on.\nKnow what you care about most: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almost rival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea.\nSeek out holiday discounts: Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange.\nHow we test iPhone models\nWe test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test and a 45-minute drain test starting with a full battery, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update.\nPerformance measuring\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published.\nRead more: How CNET Tests Phones\nOther iPhones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nKey terms\neSIM\nAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.\nWith the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This means you can't just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number of smaller operators work with eSIM.\nApple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018's iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networks can be found on Apple's website.\niOS 18\nApple's iOS 18 is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includes new features such as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models.\niPhone FAQs\nWhen is the best time of year to buy a new iPhone?\niPhone or Android?\nShould I wait for the new iPhone model (iPhone 17)?\nHow reliable is an iPhone?\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nThere's already been plenty of buzz about what we could see with the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. The camera module could also get a makeover, and reports suggest Apple will overhaul the look and feel of its software with the launch of iOS 19. Apple doesn't release details on future products, but to get an idea of what to expect, we rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."

      "text": "Impulse buying can get a bad rap -- and for good reason. We've all purchased things in the spur of the moment that we didn't actually need. But impulse purchases don't always have to be something you'll regret, especially if you're shopping for the perfect gift. Impulse buying can lead to rare finds that surprise and delight -- and leave your recipient wondering how they ever lived without that wonderful and unique thing.\nWe rounded up our favorite impulse buys that ended up being must-have products. All of these items cost less than $25 and make great gifts -- and some are even on sale for Amazon Prime Day, which runs through July 11. Who knows? Maybe you'll just have to pick up an item or two to enjoy yourself.\nSnap N' Strain clip-on pasta strainer\nThis clip-on strainer is a clever kitchen hack. Clip it onto the side of your pot, and when your pasta is done boiling, just pour the water straight into the sink. It cuts down on the number of dishes used, and it's a total space saver.\nGearLight LED flashlights, 2-pack\nOur CNET readers are constantly on the lookout for great deals, and some offers have grabbed their attention more than others. This GearLight two-pack is one of those popular picks. These flashlights have five modes and a zoomable beam.\nTaco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza\nIf you want a fun addition to family game night, look no further. Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is highly addictive and great for all ages. CNET contributor Oliver Haslam says, \"It might be the most fun I've had with a card game since forever, and it made our recent vacation very memorable.\"\nFluicer juicer\nThe best little juicer you never knew you needed. This genius contraption perfectly squeezes lemons and limes to get every last drop of juice out. It even catches the pulp and seeds with the built-in catcher. Bonus points: It's great for making margaritas, according to CNET's David Watsky.\nHiccAway Hiccup Straw\nHiccups can be more than just an annoyance for some folks. Who knew there was actually something that can get rid of them? This clinically proven device helps you end those hiccups ASAP, and it works for kids or adults.\nSnackle box\nIt's like a tackle box -- but for snacks. What could be better? Take it on picnics or keep it on your desk while you're working if need a little boost of energy throughout the day. \"I like to keep an assortment of nuts, dried fruit, chocolate and pretzels so I can have a little sweet or salty on hand,\" says CNET's Faith Chihil.\nA portable Apple Watch charger\nCNET's Russell Holly swears by this tiny magnetic charger that's designed specifically for the Apple Watch. \"Super handy when you're away from the house for longer than you expect, small enough to be tucked away in a backpack, purse or keyring,\" he says.\nStrawberry huller\nWhy waste a perfectly edible portion of a strawberry? This handy tool lets you quickly remove the green leafy top and stem so you're not tossing away the good stuff. It's much easier to use than a paring knife, and it works like a charm every time.\nElectric wine opener\nThe Rabbit is so last year. CNET's Corinne Reichert prefers this handy electric wine bottle opener, which quickly and easily removes corks without all the fuss and having to strain your wrist. Keep it on the charging dock and it's always ready to open a bottle -- or two or three. It's 41% off for Black Friday.\nCar phone mount\nIf you depend on your phone for navigating, streaming music or just taking calls hands-free while driving, it's a good idea to invest in a car phone mount. iOttie's Easy One Touch 5 doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive car phone mounts (like wireless charging or arms that open automatically). It made our list of the best car phone mounts for 2025, and it's 20% off right now.\nPeeps glasses cleaner\nIf you wear glasses, you know how quickly they get filthy and smeared. \"This Peeps cleaner works like a miracle,\" says CNET's Gael Cooper. \"You gently slide it over your lenses and voila, they're cleaner than ever. I've given them to everyone I know.\"\nA spatula for lefties\nLike a lot of kitchen tools, spatulas are designed with right-handed folks in mind, which can make something that's usually simple -- like flipping eggs -- a major hassle. If you, or someone you know, is left-handed, this spatula is a game changer in the kitchen.\nNail polish organizer\nKeep your nail polish collection easily accessible with this handy organizer case. It fits bottles from just about any nail polish brand, and you can store all your accessories, like emery boards, nail glue, acrylic dip powder and more.\nMicrofiber face towels\nWe've found these towels to be considerably better at removing makeup and grime from your face compared with a standard washcloth. And they're more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than using disposable face wipes. CNET's Faith Chihill says, \"I quit using face wipes and switched to using these with some micellar water and my skin is so thankful.\"\nPacking cubes\nIf you know someone who likes travel, these packing cubes are totally life-changing. Not only do they keep you organized and make things easier to find, but they also save you tons of space. Put your shirts in one, your underwear and socks in another, your chargers and gadgets in yet another, and you'll never have to go digging through your bag again to find that one item you needed.\nConair fabric shaver\nFor people who like to keep things looking their best, using a fabric shaver can be satisfying -- therapeutic even. Like most fabric shavers, this Conair model isn't perfect. You'll still have to empty the lint catcher, but the thrill you'll get when you transform the look of your fuzzy sweaters is worth it.\nLulu candles\nScented candles are a great gift for any occasion, and Lulu's scents are just as fresh and complex as brands that charge a premium. CNET's Jessica Dolcourt says, \"I've bought four of them for myself, and as gifts, to add some aroma and elegance to spaces throughout my home.\"\nTP-Link Kasa Wi-Fi mini smart plug\nYou can never have too many smart plugs on hand, whether you want to use them for automating lights, turning gadgets on and off with voice commands and so much more. This Kasa smart plug is a budget-friendly choice and makes a great gift, especially if you pair it with something like an Echo Dot or smart LED lights.\nCountertop water dispenser\nThis little battery-powered water dispenser lets you easily (and elegantly) serve up water, beer, cocktails and more wherever and whenever you'd like. It's USB rechargeable, so you can bring it with you to parties, camping or any outdoor gathering. CNET's James Bricknell says, \"I have mine on my bedside table with a 5-gallon water tank hidden behind my bed. It looks great and saves me from 'bathroom water.'\""

      "text": "Many of us tend to lose or misplace items like our keys or bags. To help people remember where they placed these vital items, there are a lot of Bluetooth item trackers on the market, like Tile. But for those heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, the AirTag is the best choice. It's a small, disk-like device that you can attach onto or into things like your bags or keys in order to locate them more easily. You can even put them on your car to help you find where you parked in a large lot, as well as on many other everyday essentials.\nOur Picks\nBut to get the most out of your AirTag, you'll need some accessories. Yes, accessories for an accessory sounds absurd, but that's because the AirTag does not have an integrated hole to attach to your keys, nor does it come with a lanyard or strap to hang on your bag. Thankfully, the AirTag accessory market is ripe with tons of options from both first- and third-party manufacturers.\nRead more: Apple AirTags Hands-On Evaluation\nAt CNET, we make it a point to try out everything we recommend, but we haven't yet had the chance to check out every single Apple AirTag accessory. However, we've looked into other products from the same brands, so we're pretty confident in our picks. As we get the chance to test more AirTag accessories, we\u2019ll keep adding to the list.\nKey chains and straps\nWhile it launched a little later than some Apple AirTag accessories, Otterbox's key chain holder, which Otterbox calls a \"Rugged Case,\" is made of solid plastic and does indeed encase your AirTag for full protection. Installing it is easy: you unscrew the top piece, place your AirTag in the case, then screw the top piece back on to lock the AirTag in the holder.\nThe Apple-branded leather key ring costs around $35 and is available in a few color options, though you may find limited stock with FineWoven replacements making it to stores.\nIf you're looking for a good value option, your best bet may be to roll the dice on a no-name brand. This Eusty key chain cover is available in a four-pack for less than $10. Often, generic models like this are labeled as \"leather\" when in fact they are faux leather (sometimes referred to as PU leather or vegan leather).\nThese look a lot like other basic faux leather AirTag key chains and come in a few color options. There are dozens if not hundreds of generic AirTag holders available. Most should be fine, but don't expect them to wear as well over time as the true leather models.\nSpigen is also selling an attractively simple key chain Apple AirTag holder, the Valentinus, for around $18. It's made of faux leather.\nApple's Loop, made for attaching your AirTag to a bag, costs as much as an AirTag. But it's Apple's official loop option and this polyurethane option is cheaper than the $35 Leather Loop. That doesn't make it a good deal, but I'm just pointing it out. It's available in four colors.\nSpigen, known for its affordable iPhone cases, has the Apple AirTag Case Rugged Armor. It's not quite as cheap as we hoped it would be, but maybe it will reduce in price in time. It does have a rugged design with a nice carabiner and carbon fiber elements.\nOther AirTag options\nIf you're looking for a holder that sticks onto an object (like the underside of a bike seat or scooter), Pelican's Stick-on AirTag Mount is designed to do just that. A single mount costs $10 while a pack of four sells for $30 or less when on sale. It's available in many colors.\nIf you don't want to spend a lot for a mount, these Gorilla Mounting Tape Squares are a cheaper option and can be cut to size for AirTags. AirTags have an IPX67 water-resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is dust-proof. So it can withstand some punishment without a cover. After all, it doesn't have a screen.\nCasetify has a wide variety of AirTag holders. They're made of hard plastic and are fairly basic but have some eye-catching art on the backside. You can also customize them with your name or choose from several emojis and other graphics. They're expensive at $32 but sometimes go on sale.\nThe AirTag uses a CR2032 coin battery, which should last about a year. You can find a 10-pack of those batteries on Amazon for somewhere around $11. That's the way to go, especially if you have multiple AirTags, and other devices that use CR2032 coin batteries. Always remember to keep coin batteries away from small children so they don't accidentally swallow one. They can cause major injury if ingested.\nCaseology's AirTag Vault is another straightforward key chain option that's affordable at $15 (currently on sale for $14) but could shave a few dollars off its price over time. (Caseology is also a sub-brand of Spigen.) It's one of the few Apple AirTag accessories that was available at launch and has been pretty popular as a result. It comes with a carabiner but you could attach a standard key chain if you want.\nWhile this faux leather affordable key ring from Cyrill, a sub-brand of Korea-based Spigen, is nothing fancy but it is available in a premium black and gold finish. You can also look into the rest of Cyrill's collection on Amazon.\nI like the design of Nomad's leather AirTag key chain better than Apple's, which leaves the AirTag partially exposed. This AirTag key chain hides it and looks more like a standard key chain. It's designed to \"weather\" over time, getting darker (particularly the brown version). It's available in brown or black for $30, which is pricey but it is nice. Nomad also makes a Leather Loop that's also a key chain and lists for $20. I prefer the more expensive model pictured here.\nMoment, which makes and sells photo and video accessories for Apple products, including lens attachments, has an enclosure accessory that allows you to mount your Apple AirTag. It's \"made from a rugged aramid fiber shell and backed with a super strong adhesive, you can stick an AirTag to any flat surface,\" Moment says. So, it'll keep the device protected and offers easy and trustworthy attachment.\nStill not sure about AirTags? Here's what CNET's Experts have to say."

Keep checking back as we'll be updating this page over the Labor Day weekend with all the best Apple deals as they drop.\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\nBest Labor Day iPad deals\nIf you need top-end performance, you can't go wrong with the iPad Pro. With a cutting-edge M4 processor, this advanced iPad is the best tablet out there for power users. Creatives will get a lot out of this powerful Apple tablet.\nApple recently released a new flagship A16 iPad, which means this 10th-generation model is no longer the latest. But it's still one of the absolute best tablets on the market and a serious bargain now that you can grab it on sale. It features a 10.9-inch display, USB-C charging and an A14 Bionic chip. It's an excellent choice and an affordable option if you only need a tablet for the basics like scrolling social media, streaming shows and web browsing.\nThe 64GB model is on sale for $80 off, which makes it $269. If you're interested in more storage, the 256GB variant is $100 off, bringing it down to $349.\nThe ninth-gen iPad might not be the latest and greatest model these days but it's still a solid option if you want a cheap(ish) Apple tablet. Right now, you can pick one up for just $210, a $120 savings off the original price.\n- iPad Air, 13-inch (M3, 128GB): $629 (save $170). An excellent balance between price and performance.\n- iPad Air 11-inch (M3, 128GB): $449 (save $150). Apple's latest lightweight tablet is our top pick for students.\n- iPad Pro, 13-inch (M4, 256GB): $1,099 (save $200). Apple's fastest iPad with the biggest and best display it's ever had, too.\n- iPad Mini, 8-inch (A17 Pro, 128GB): $398 (save $101). This smaller, more portable model may be ideal for some users.\n- iPad Mini, 8-inch (A17 Pro, 256GB): $499 (save $100). It's the same small and portable model with more storage.\n- iPad 11-inch (A16, 128GB) : $299 (save $50). A solid everyday tablet for most at under $300 right now.\nBest Labor Day AirPods and Beats deals\nApple's latest AirPods 4 with ANC are now a modest $40 off. With active noise cancellation, they're perfect for focusing at work, during travel or other important tasks. Its powerful H2 chip makes it easy to toggle ANC with transparency mode whenever you need to remain alert. The battery life lasts up to 4 hours on a single charge and adds an extra 20 hours with the case.\nOur audio reviewer and expert, David Carnoy, gave these earbuds a glowing review, saying that the \"noise canceling really is a game-changer,\" noting that they have most of what you expect from the AirPods Pro 2 in an open earbud design. He also said that \"they're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works.\" So if that is a combination you need, look no further.\nEarning spots on our lists of the best noise-canceling headphones and the best headphones overall, these Beats Studio Pros are an excellent and more affordable alternative to the AirPods Max. Our reviewer praised their sound quality and noise-canceling capabilities, as well as their sleek design and cozy feel. They also deliver an impressive 40-hour battery life and USB-C charging, and they support spatial audio when paired with an iPhone.\nThe second-gen AirPods Pro are among the best noise-canceling earbuds on the market and are a top pick for Apple users. This version includes the USB-C and MagSafe charging case. They are almost identical to the original AirPods Pro 2, except for one key feature. Folks who buy a Vision Pro headset will benefit from lossless audio when connecting these earbuds. That's probably a small detail but it's still worth considering, especially if Apple adds the same feature to future iPhones and other hardware.\nOur in-depth review by resident audio expert David Carnoy noted that the AirPods Pro 2 feel like a \"fully evolved, refined product that packs not only an impressive set of features but top-notch performance in a very small design.\" These are even better value for the money when at a discount.\nThe Beats Solo 4 headphones are an excellent alternative to bulky over-ear models. They're one of our favorite pairs of on-ear headphones, with our reviewer commending them for their sound quality, battery life and voice-calling performance. They lack active noise cancellation but support spatial audio if you're an Apple user. Plus, they deliver an impressive 50 hours of listening time per charge. They're also lightweight at just 217 grams, and the plush ear cushions help reduce outside noise.\nAmazon is currently offering a modest discount on the latest AirPods 4. You'll save $39. Our AirPods 4 review noted that the new design is a better fit for a wider range of ears, which is an advantage over the last generation.\nOur review also noted that the AirPods 4 \"may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2 but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features.\" Given the much lower price during the sales, these make for an absolutely no-brainer purchase.\n- Beats Studio Buds Plus: $100 (save $70).

The best deals usually accompany big events like Prime Day or a major holiday, which is why Labor Day is an excellent time to shop Apple sales on several devices. If you're looking to spend less, try foregoing the latest releases. You'll find bigger discounts on previous-generation models or refurbished devices.\nWhere are the best Labor Day sales?\nYou can find major savings for Labor Day at hundreds of retailers. Some of the places you can shop for significant savings are Amazon, Best Buy, Home Depot and Walmart. You'll find plenty of other smaller retailers hosting Labor Day sales as well.\nHow we choose the best Labor Day deals\nAt CNET, we have a team of expert shoppers and deal-hunters whose experience spans years of helping buyers understand which major sales and deals are legitimately good and which are more routine. That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial savings. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.\n- Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed."

      "text": "Apple makes some of the best wireless earbuds and headphones on the market -- and that includes models from Beats, which Apple acquired several years ago. Most recently, it introduced two new AirPods 4 earbuds, one with surprisingly effective active noise canceling for an open-ear design. While we're impressed with the AirPods 4 ANC in particular, the AirPods Pro 2 are arguably the best Apple AirPods you can buy if you don't mind having silicone eartips jammed in your ears. I've tested and fully reviewed all of Apple's headphones and earbuds that are on this list. We also keep a close eye on their prices so we can bring you the best deals on every AirPods model.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nBest Apple AirPods for 2025\nPros\n- Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging\n- Excellent sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H2 chip\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset\nCons\n- No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices except headset\n- Still no XL tips included\nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it also made the switch with the AirPods Pro (second generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro as well as the novel hearing aid mode to better hear the sound around you.\nNevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple customers despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.\nPros\n- Same H2 chip found in AirPods Pro 2\n- More compact design\n- Active noise canceling that works\n- Improved sound\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Personalized spatial audio\n- Case has wireless charging and speaker for Find My\nCons\n- Battery life could be a little better\n- Noise-canceling isn't as good as AirPods Pro 2's\nIf you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have more features.\nUltimately, however, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- No enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nWhile the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and new-for-2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted.\nPros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight\n- Impressive sound and build-quality\n- Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode\n- Good headset performance for calls\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2\n- No cable included for wired use\nYes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.\nPros\n- Lightweight and discrete, they fit comfortably with upgraded performance all-around (voice-calling is excellent now)\n- Android friendly (iOS users get hands-free Siri)\n- Improved battery life\nCons\n- No wireless charging capabilities\n- Missing spatial audio\n- No head tracking or in-ear detection sensor\nWhy I like them\nCompared to the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market, the newer Studio Buds Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. Read my Beats Buds Plus review.\nThe transparent version got a lot of attention at launch (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' \"acoustic architecture\" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds.\nReasons to buy\nThe compact Beats Studio Buds Plus offer good sound quality and strong all-around performance for an affordable price, especially when they're discounted, which they often are. It's also worth noting that like with other Beats headphones and earbuds, these are more Android-friendly than Apple's AirPods (there's a Beats app for Android) and the only feature that Apple users get that Android users don't is hands-free Siri.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe Studio Buds Plus were released in May of 2023, so they're over two years old and may be due for an upgrade. Also, while the AirPods Pro 2 may cost more, they have a more robust feature set -- for Apple users anyway.\nBest Beats over-ear headphones\nBeats Studio Pro\nPros\n- Improved sound quality, noise canceling and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No major design changes except for case\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read our full review to find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Very compact case\n- Good sound and voice-calling performance\n- Strong battery life\nCons\n- Few features\n- No battery or LED charging indicator in charging case\nWhy I like them\nAvailable in four color options, the Solo Buds are missing some key features found in more premium buds, including a battery in their very compact charging case, ear-detection sensors and active noise canceling. But they get the fundamentals right. They're lightweight and not only offer decent sound quality and strong battery life but very good voice-calling performance that rivals what you get with the company's more expensive Studio Buds Plus. Read my full review.\nReasons to buy\nThey're the most affordable Beats earbuds and their charging case is quite compact and doesn't take up much room in a pocket. They also have great battery life.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nHaving no battery in the case may be a deal-breaker for some people (using a USB-C cable, your phone can supply power to charge the buds in the case, but not everybody likes that concept).\nFactors to consider when choosing AirPods\nDesign\nThe AirPods come in three styles: open earbuds (AirPods 3 and AiPods 4), noise-isolating earbuds with noise canceling (AirPods Pro 2) and over-ear headphones (AirPods Max). Some people like the standard AirPods because they have an open design and don't require you to jam silicone ear tips into your ears. Note that the discontinued AirPods 2, which are based on the original AirPods design, have longer stems and slightly smaller buds than the AirPods 3. The new AirPods 4 are slightly more compact than the AirPods 3 but slightly larger than the AirPods 2. Meanwhile, the Beats Fit Pro has built-in wingtips that may help you get a more secure fit. Newer models also feature USB-C charging ports to better align with the rest of Apple's new charging ecosystem, replacing the long-used Lightning port.\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new AirPods. The quality of value-priced AirPods continues to improve as more models release, so you can often find good affordable AirPods on sale for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $300 or more -- sometimes much more in the case of the AirPod Max.\nFit\nIt's key that the AirPods you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. Consider the differences between in-ear and over-ear AirPods before buying.\nDurability\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for AirPods models that we note have sturdy build quality.\nAirPods or Beats earbuds and headphones?\nBecause Apple owns Beats, the various AirPods models and Beats models can share similar components and features. Beats products tend to be geared to both Apple and Android users, while the AirPods tend to be focused more toward Apple users (they have more exclusive features for Apple users), although they can be paired with Android devices.\nReturn policy\nBecause the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds aren't a good match for your ears.\nAirPods price comparison\nComparisons for the prices of each AirPods model on this list\n| Model | Apple store price | Best price right now | Best all-time price |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| AirPods 4 | $129 | $119 | $119 |\n| AirPods Pro 2 | $249 | $189 | $169 |\n| Beats Fit Pro | $200 | $159 | $159 |\n| AirPods Max | $549 | $449 | $395 |\n| Beats Studio Buds Plus | $170 | $100 | $100 |\n| Beats Studio Pro | $350 | $136 | $136 |\n| Beats Solo Buds | $80 | $80 | $80 |\nHow we test wireless Apple AirPods\nAlong with all of our wireless headphones and earbuds, we test Apple AirPods based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\nDesign\nWe assess not only how comfortably the AirPods fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. With wireless headphones and earbuds, we'll note if they're water-resistant, but only a few full-size headphones have water- and dust-resistance ratings, which is especially important for workout headphones you may take to the gym or on a run.\nSound quality\nWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\nNoise-canceling performance\nIf the AirPods we're testing feature active noise canceling, we evaluate ANC performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out onto city streets to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they do at muffling not only street noise but also people's voices. Those that are able to reduce the most amount of ambient noise are noted and rated highly on this list.\nExtra features\nSome great-sounding AirPods aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness through a double tap to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. The newest models even incorporate hearing health metrics with hearing tests and a new hearing aid mode. We also take a look at the companion app for the AirPods if there is one and how user-friendly it is and wireless charging capabilities.\nVoice-calling\nWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make phone calls on noisy city streets and evaluate how well the AirPods reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices. Call quality is a key metric in today's work-from-home world, so we're sure to assess this feature in several fields.\nValue\nWe determine value after considering the strength of the AirPods against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared with other models in their price class. Some models require additional purchases, like a wireless charging case, to get the most out of their features, so we take those needs into account, too.\nOther AirPods we tested\nAirPods 3: With the arrival of the AirPods 4, Apple is phasing out both the AirPods 3 and AirPods 2. As a result, you may see some nice discounts on the third-generation AirPods as they exit the market. Slightly larger than the AirPods 4, they have better battery life than their successor and their case has wireless charging (only the step-up AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation have wireless charging). But with improved sound quality and Apple's more advanced H2 chip, the AirPods 4 -- even the entry-level model -- is superior to the third-generation AirPods.\nBeats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio earbuds often sell for $150 and offer decent sound and performance. The new Studio Buds Plus is a significant upgrade, with better sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance, so we recommend users buy those instead.\nAirPods 2: The AirPods 2 are an incremental upgrade to an already excellent, fully wireless headphone, but sound quality, design and fit are basically the same. Such incremental upgrades tend to be a little boring. And on the surface anyway, the new AirPods aren't exciting. However, thanks to those updated components on the inside, including a new H1 chip that supports Bluetooth 5.0, improved audio synchronization and always-on Siri, they're definitely better in small ways that a lot of people will appreciate.\nBeats Flex: Yes, these are \"wired wireless\" earbuds -- with a cable connecting the left and right earbud, but they're also the most affordable wireless Apple headphones you can buy (Beats is a subsidiary of Apple). Equipped with Apple's older W1 chip, not the H1 found in the AirPods 3rd Generation, AirPods Pro and Beats Fit Pro, they don't have such extra features as spatial audio. However, they sound good and work well for making voice calls."

      "text": "Everyone loves to travel and see the world. Whether you're heading out for spring break or just planning for summer vacation or a business trip coming up, having the right luggage can make all the difference. You want something spacious enough to hold all your things (and perhaps even souvenirs for the trip back) and also able to handle those bumps from being tossed around in a plane, train or car. But there are many options out there for luggage, so finding the right one for your needs can be a little tricky.\nOur Picks\nYARD AND OUTDOORS DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $1,099 (save $500)\n- $389 (save $161)\n- $599 (save $151)\n- $500 (save $200)\n- $173 (save $58)\nEveryone has their luggage preferences, and what you need can vary based on your travel method and trip length. Some like the flexibility that a duffel bag can offer, while others are partial to a simple backpack you can carry on your person. However, if you tend to pack heavy, you'll probably want to choose a carry-on suitcase with smooth rolling wheels, allowing you to roll your bag rather than lift it. f you're packing for extended trips or international travel, you'll also want to nab a checked bag to pair with your carry-on luggage for extra packing room. There are also different suitcase materials to consider, from sturdy hardside options to more flexible softside luggage.\nRegardless of how you like your luggage, we've found a variety of great options from top luggage brands. From robust, hard-shell designs to budget-friendly, travel-ready carry-on bags, these expert-approved selections are here to transform your packing experience into one that's effortless and enjoyable.\nSold under the brand Gomatic in the UK, Nomatic's Navigator wheeled case is a superb all-rounder piece of travel luggage. It's sturdy, with a hard back that protects it from knocks and bumps with a softer top that can be expanded from 37 to 44 liters. That makes it a flexible option as a one-size-fits-all case for short weekend trips or longer excursions.\nNomatic calls it a \"carry-on\" and at 14 by 9 by 22 inches it fits just about within British Airways' carry-on restrictions. However, other more budget airlines would not accept this size, so make sure you double-check the restrictions with whatever airline you're flying with and that you're including the expanded size, if you're using it.\nIt has separate zip compartments for your laptop and other gadgets, the outer material is water resistant and both the handle and wheels feel robust and capable of handling anything a demanding travel schedule can throw at it.\nWhile its outward aesthetic mimics aluminum hard-shell luggage, with its riveted edges and deep lines, Carl Friedrik's carry on case is actually made from polycarbonate. It makes the case much lighter than an all-metal version would be, and more resistant to dents from baggage handlers, too. It has an aluminum frame which helps it feel extremely sturdy and even after numerous weekends away in the car, on trains and on planes, our test model looks as good today as when it first arrived -- especially with the classy leather detailing and matching handle.\nIts wheels provide a smooth run across most surfaces, its handle is built to withstand plenty of abuse and its dual clasps provide a satisfyingly-easy locking mechanism. With a 40 liter volume it's got space enough to pack for at least a long weekend while remaining compatible with most airline carry on restrictions (though make sure you check with your airline before you fly).\nIt's not a cheap case by any means, but Carl Friedrik's Carry-on offers a great combination of sturdy build with luxury touches that will make this case great to use for years to come.\nWith a hard shell made from aluminum, it's no surprise that the MVST Select Trek suitcase feels extremely sturdy. It'll easily protect your belongings from the hazards of baggage handlers while its wheels are removable to be easily replaced should the worst happen.\nI really like the look of aluminum cases and while they're typically some of the most expensive pieces of luggage you can get, MVST Select's range is on the more affordable side. The case has a clamshell opening, with heavy-duty trunk-style latches with TSA-approved locks.\nWhile this medium-sized model is too big for most airline overhead bins, a smaller carry-on size is available, along with a larger size for longer trips.\nWith a 35-liter internal volume, the Horizn Studios H5 case is compatible with many airlines' carry-on restrictions, making it a great option for shorter trips -- though always double-check the restrictions of the airline you're flying with. It's lightweight, but its polycarbonate shell is sturdy, with enough flex in it to put up with severe knocks and bumps while in transit.\nIts four wheels offer a smooth glide across carpet or rough outdoor terrain and its retractable handle feels reassuringly able to put up with abuse. It's made from a range of recycled materials too, it's 100% vegan and made in a way that eliminates 99% of waste during production.\nThe H5 comes in a standard or \"Smart\" version, the latter including a battery pack hidden beneath the handle that lets you plug your phone in if you need to charge on the move. It's a handy addition, but personally I'd just go for the standard model and get my own charger that I can take anywhere.\nYou'll also find a TSA-approved combination lock and comfortable carry handles on the side and top. I love its smart look that wouldn't look out of place on a vacation with your mates or being wheeled into a fancy city-center business hotel.\nThere's a lot I like about July's Carry On Trunk. It's well-built, with an extremely sturdy-feeling polycarbonate shell and aluminium frame, the wheels offer a smooth ride over most surfaces and it has a hidden, removable battery pack with USB-C fast charge for giving your phone a quick boost while you idly tap away at solitaire as you wait for your gate to be announced.\nBut I love the design too, with a classic trunk-style opening and sophisticated looks that wouldn't look out of place being wheeled into any of Europe's fanciest hotels. I especially like the brown color of the test model I was sent, which harks back to retro 70s looks. The carry on version should fit most airline overhead bins (though check the dimensions of whatever airline you're flying with) and it's available in larger check-in versions if you need more space. You can also customize your piece for an additional $50.\nWhile Carl Friedrik's Carry-on (seen above) is a great stylish option for shorter trips, the Trunk offers a much larger 90 liter internal volume that makes it much more suited for long trips with checked luggage. It features a similar polycarbonate design as its smaller sibling, with leather detailing and rivet heads designed to mimic vintage aluminum luggage and I think it looks great.\nIts trunk style means it opens with a shallower lid, providing a huge internal cavity to fill up with bulkier items. I've used the Trunk on multiple photoshoots, using the larger internal space for camera hardware (including tripods, lights and other heavy, bulky items), reserving the top space for clothes. It handled the load admirably, being happily dragged around Paris and casually hurled into the back of taxis on a recent trip. Its three external clasps proved more than capable of keeping all of my gear safely inside.\nIt also comes with three movable dividers and packing cubes, allowing you to customise the internal space for your needs, whether that's a lot of clothes for a long trip or a mixture of items, perhaps saving room for stocking up on duty free on your return home.\nThe Trunk isn't a cheap option, but it's put up with my abuse extremely well and I'm confident this case is a solid investment in luggage that will cope with many trips to come.\nSamsonite's Proxis four-wheeled suitcase is one of the most expensive on this list, and that's largely down to the material it's made from. Samsonite calls it Roxkin and it's apparently designed to be hard-wearing while remaining light.\nAnd certainly at only 3.5 kilograms it's on the light side for a case with a whopping 125-liter internal volume. Its sheer size makes it a great option for longer vacations or family trips where you really want to try and cram everything into just the one case.\nAs for its hardiness, it survived our tumble tests admirably, with no visible dents after multiple falls down stairs. The great-looking petrol blue outer did show some scuff marks, so keep that in mind if you like your luggage to always look pristine (why would you?) but I have no concerns about its ability to put up with abuse from baggage handlers.\nIt's got a built-in TSA-approved lock and its four casters, while quite small, still manage to offer a smooth ride over thick carpet and rough ground.\nFreitag's F306 Hazzard backpack is made from recycled tarps from the side of trucks. It not only makes it strong enough to withstand being chucked around with reckless abandon, it makes each one unique as they're taken from different sections of different truck covers. Some might look more plain, while others will have random bits of pattern or text from whatever branding was being displayed on the truck. My test model shows \"+3\" which I suspect may well have been from a French phone number with a +33 dial code.\nBut it also means these backpacks have great eco credentials, being made not just of recycled truck tarp, but recycled seatbelts for the straps and recycled bottles for the inner linings. It features a capacious interior, with laptop compartment, smaller front pocket and a convenient side handle which is helpful for sliding it in and out of overhead storage.\nWhile many bags out there call themselves water-resistant and a few even claim to shirk enough liquid to qualify as waterproof, few companies take it as far as Yeti. The Panga is actually waterproof enough to be fully submersible. That means not a single drop of liquid will get inside it when it's properly zipped up, which also means it's impossible to deflate when you've zipped it up when it's empty.\nIts waterproof nature means this is a bag that's aimed squarely at those of you looking for a rugged outdoor holdall that can put up with whatever your active nature-loving lifestyle can throw at it. Camping in the snow? No problem. Backpacking via canoe? Shove your clothes in, zip it up and throw it on the boat.\nThe rubberised outer fabric feels hard-wearing (as you'd hope) and you'll find strengthened nylon loops on the outside for you to lash it to your boat so even if you capsize, your precious bag won't go floating off downstream. It all feels well designed and while it's probably not the ideal bag for a long weekend in Paris (unless you're swimming in the Seine), it's a superb option if you need a bag to put up with your wilderness adventures.\nWith its 101-liter internal capacity, the American Tourister Airconic Spinner offers a capacious size that makes it great for families on longer trips. It zips open down the middle, opening up into two halves that allows you to pack more thoughtfully -- your clothes in one side, the kids' clothes in the other.\nEmpty, it weighs only 3.2 kilograms (7 pounds) meaning it adds very little of its own weight to your luggage. Despite that, it still feels well-built, with a semi-firm outer shell that offers protection to the contents, but with enough flex to absorb the knocks and bumps it'll get in baggage handling.\nThe wheels are quite small which was noticeable when wheeling it across thick carpet, but on smoother surfaces it glides well in either its upright mode on all four wheels or being dragged with handle on just two wheels. It has a water-resistant zipper, a built-in TSA-approved lock and it's available in an array of vibrant hues to help it stand out when it comes round on the luggage carousel.\nI've taken Db's Hytta Duffel on multiple weekend breaks and road trips recently and it's performed superbly on them all. It's essentially a duffel bag, with carry handles on the top and straps on the back so you can wear it as a backpack. But there's a zip all round the middle that lets it open into two halves like a butterfly. Each side has its own zip cover.\nRather than it just being one big storage area for everything like most holdalls, this two-sided approach makes it much easier to separate out your packing and keep things organized while you're away. Perhaps it's to separate clean clothes from dirty ones, or one side for clothes, one side for toiletries and other accessories. The choice is yours.\nIt's made from durable recycled materials that feel like they'll probably last forever and its total 50-liter volume is capacious enough for a long weekend at least. It's compatible with most airlines' carry-on restrictions too.\nWhen I first started testing the Samsonite Stackd I thought it felt a bit plasticky and might not put up with much punishment from over-enthusiastic luggage handlers. I needn't have worried though -- it put up with my abusive tests admirably, with none of the fractures or breakages I was concerned about.\nIts 96-liter internal volume makes this another good option for family traveling, or for anyone traveling solo for extended periods. Its polycarbonate construction means it's light and its four wheels provide a smooth motion, on rough ground, carpet or cobbled streets -- or as smooth as it can be on cobbled streets, anyway.\nIt has a TSA-approved lock, and the retractable handle is comfortable to haul along the road and feels like it can put up with some punishment as you drag it up staircases or onto trains.\nHow we test our luggage\nIn an ideal world, we'd expense flights to the best vacation destinations simply to put our luggage through the sort of real-world tests that you'd do yourself. Our budgets not being in the tens of thousands, we have to find more appropriate ways to simulate those situations at home.\nFirst, we fill the cases with a mixture of heavy and soft items and zip them up. We walk them around inside our homes, across hardwood floors, thick carpets, thin rugs -- exactly the sort of surfaces you'd find in your own home and inside the various hotels, Airbnb rooms and guest houses you'll find on your travels. Then we throw them down the stairs. Not because we're cruel, but because this is a great way of simulating the sort of brutal treatment the cases will likely get from airport baggage handlers.\nCases are frequently broken by baggage handlers being too rough, with snapped wheels being all too common. So we drop them on their wheels from all angles again and again. And then again. We pull on them and twist them. We put pressure on the handle. Can it support our weight and can it put up with being dragged around in a bad mood when your flight was delayed and you missed dinner service at your hotel?\nWe take them outside, still full of heavy items, and drag them over sidewalk paving stones, along old cobbled streets and up and down curbs. Do they wobble? Do the wheels rattle? Do the handles bend? Do they scratch? These are all the things we look for. Finally, we look close up at the zippers and materials to check for any signs of loose stitching or other manufacturer defects that suggest that quality control could be better.\nIf they don't survive the tests, they don't make it to the list."

      "text": "Many of us tend to lose or misplace items like our keys or bags. To help people remember where they placed these vital items, there are a lot of Bluetooth item trackers on the market, like Tile. But for those heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, the AirTag is the best choice. It's a small, disk-like device that you can attach onto or into things like your bags or keys in order to locate them more easily. You can even put them on your car to help you find where you parked in a large lot, as well as on many other everyday essentials.\nOur Picks\nBut to get the most out of your AirTag, you'll need some accessories. Yes, accessories for an accessory sounds absurd, but that's because the AirTag does not have an integrated hole to attach to your keys, nor does it come with a lanyard or strap to hang on your bag. Thankfully, the AirTag accessory market is ripe with tons of options from both first- and third-party manufacturers.\nRead more: Apple AirTags Hands-On Evaluation\nAt CNET, we make it a point to try out everything we recommend, but we haven't yet had the chance to check out every single Apple AirTag accessory. However, we've looked into other products from the same brands, so we're pretty confident in our picks. As we get the chance to test more AirTag accessories, we\u2019ll keep adding to the list.\nKey chains and straps\nWhile it launched a little later than some Apple AirTag accessories, Otterbox's key chain holder, which Otterbox calls a \"Rugged Case,\" is made of solid plastic and does indeed encase your AirTag for full protection. Installing it is easy: you unscrew the top piece, place your AirTag in the case, then screw the top piece back on to lock the AirTag in the holder.\nThe Apple-branded leather key ring costs around $35 and is available in a few color options, though you may find limited stock with FineWoven replacements making it to stores.\nIf you're looking for a good value option, your best bet may be to roll the dice on a no-name brand. This Eusty key chain cover is available in a four-pack for less than $10. Often, generic models like this are labeled as \"leather\" when in fact they are faux leather (sometimes referred to as PU leather or vegan leather).\nThese look a lot like other basic faux leather AirTag key chains and come in a few color options. There are dozens if not hundreds of generic AirTag holders available. Most should be fine, but don't expect them to wear as well over time as the true leather models.\nSpigen is also selling an attractively simple key chain Apple AirTag holder, the Valentinus, for around $18. It's made of faux leather.\nApple's Loop, made for attaching your AirTag to a bag, costs as much as an AirTag. But it's Apple's official loop option and this polyurethane option is cheaper than the $35 Leather Loop. That doesn't make it a good deal, but I'm just pointing it out. It's available in four colors.\nSpigen, known for its affordable iPhone cases, has the Apple AirTag Case Rugged Armor. It's not quite as cheap as we hoped it would be, but maybe it will reduce in price in time. It does have a rugged design with a nice carabiner and carbon fiber elements.\nOther AirTag options\nIf you're looking for a holder that sticks onto an object (like the underside of a bike seat or scooter), Pelican's Stick-on AirTag Mount is designed to do just that. A single mount costs $10 while a pack of four sells for $30 or less when on sale. It's available in many colors.\nIf you don't want to spend a lot for a mount, these Gorilla Mounting Tape Squares are a cheaper option and can be cut to size for AirTags. AirTags have an IPX67 water-resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is dust-proof. So it can withstand some punishment without a cover. After all, it doesn't have a screen.\nCasetify has a wide variety of AirTag holders. They're made of hard plastic and are fairly basic but have some eye-catching art on the backside. You can also customize them with your name or choose from several emojis and other graphics. They're expensive at $32 but sometimes go on sale.\nThe AirTag uses a CR2032 coin battery, which should last about a year. You can find a 10-pack of those batteries on Amazon for somewhere around $11. That's the way to go, especially if you have multiple AirTags, and other devices that use CR2032 coin batteries. Always remember to keep coin batteries away from small children so they don't accidentally swallow one. They can cause major injury if ingested.\nCaseology's AirTag Vault is another straightforward key chain option that's affordable at $15 (currently on sale for $14) but could shave a few dollars off its price over time. (Caseology is also a sub-brand of Spigen.) It's one of the few Apple AirTag accessories that was available at launch and has been pretty popular as a result. It comes with a carabiner but you could attach a standard key chain if you want.\nWhile this faux leather affordable key ring from Cyrill, a sub-brand of Korea-based Spigen, is nothing fancy but it is available in a premium black and gold finish. You can also look into the rest of Cyrill's collection on Amazon.\nI like the design of Nomad's leather AirTag key chain better than Apple's, which leaves the AirTag partially exposed. This AirTag key chain hides it and looks more like a standard key chain. It's designed to \"weather\" over time, getting darker (particularly the brown version). It's available in brown or black for $30, which is pricey but it is nice. Nomad also makes a Leather Loop that's also a key chain and lists for $20. I prefer the more expensive model pictured here.\nMoment, which makes and sells photo and video accessories for Apple products, including lens attachments, has an enclosure accessory that allows you to mount your Apple AirTag. It's \"made from a rugged aramid fiber shell and backed with a super strong adhesive, you can stick an AirTag to any flat surface,\" Moment says. So, it'll keep the device protected and offers easy and trustworthy attachment.\nStill not sure about AirTags? Here's what CNET's Experts have to say."

      "text": "The AirTag tracking tiles that Apple unveiled in 2021 are one way the iPhone-maker can help you track non-Apple devices. Apple also allows its Find My app to locate items made by third parties. This is especially helpful for traveling.\nThe groundwork for the AirTag was laid in 2014 with the iBeacon, a small, inexpensive Bluetooth transmitter that provided location-based information and services to iPhones. While Bluetooth can track items to within about 5 meters, ultrawideband, or UWB, technology can pinpoint them to within 5 to 10 centimeters. Rumors that Apple was developing a device to compete with Tile Bluetooth trackers began in 2019, when hints were found in the code for iOS 13 and the iPhone 11 incorporated UWB tech. Apple finally debuted its AirTag tracker in April 2021.\nHere's everything you need to know about the AirTag, including how it works, where to get accessories and how to buy AirTags.\nRead more: AirTags vs. Tile vs. Samsung SmartTag: Here's How Apple Compares with the Competition\nWhat's an AirTag?\nAn AirTag works similarly to a Tile tag in that you can clip one of the small devices onto a key ring, a bag or something else with a chain. The tag can simply be slipped into a wallet or bag as well. The AirTag can be paired with devices like your iPhone, and it works with the Find My app. (Here's how AirTags compare with Tile trackers.)\nThe AirTag is a small, lightweight, stainless-steel disc with the Apple logo on one side. You can personalize the other side with a free engraving. The device is also water- and dust-resistant, with a removable cover designed to make it easy to change the CR2032 battery, which promises a year's worth of battery life with everyday use.\nHow much do AirTags cost and where can I buy one?\nAirTags are available to purchase for $29 per tag, or $99 for a four-pack (\u00a329 or \u00a399 in the UK, and AU$45 or AU$149 in Australia). You can buy them from Apple, Amazon or Best Buy. And though it's not required, you can more easily attach AirTags to your items with a keychain accessory, including one from Herm\u00e8s. Here's what Apple is offering:\n- AirTag leather key ring for $35.\n- AirTag leather loop for $39.\n- AirTag polyurethane loop for $29.\n- Belkin Secure Holder with strap for $13.\n- Belkin Secure Holder with key ring for $13.\nEach product comes in various colors. In addition, Apple and Herm\u00e8s created AirTag Herm\u00e8s, which features a line of handcrafted leather bag charms, key rings and travel and luggage tags:\n- AirTag Herm\u00e8s key ring starting at $349.\n- AirTag Herm\u00e8s bag charm starting at $299.\n- AirTag Herm\u00e8s luggage charm starting at $449.\nHow does the AirTag work?\nAfter you set up the AirTag (here's how), a process that works much the same as pairing AirPods, it'll appear in the new items tab of the Find My app. You can name your items as well, with suggestions from the app or names of your own.\nFrom there, you can see the item's last known location if you've attached an AirTag to it. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can use the Find My app to signal the AirTag's built-in speaker to play a sound. AirTags also have Siri support, so your iOS assistant can help you locate the lost item.\nThe tags and the Find My app take advantage of Apple's U1 chip with Ultra Wideband technology to use Precision Finding, a feature that relies on camera input, ARKit, accelerometer and gyroscope to guide you to your AirTag using sound and haptic and visual feedback. With the Find My app, you'll get helpful notes like how many feet away your AirTag is and in what direction. Precision Finding also has a voice-over option to help low-vision or blind users.\nIf you're out of Bluetooth range, you can put your AirTag into Lost mode and get a notification when it's within range of the Find My network. If someone else finds your AirTag, she or he can use an iPhone or NFC-capable device (even an Android phone) to view your contact number, if you've listed it.\nDo AirTags keep my information private?\nApple is big on privacy, and the company says people can participate in the Find My network without having to share their location with anyone, including Apple. Carolyn Wolfman-Estrada, an engineer at Apple, said safety features are in place that discourage unwanted tracking.\n\"AirTag is designed to track items, not people,\" Wolfman-Estrada said during the Apple spring event when the company introduced AirTags.\nHowever, reports emerged earlier this year that the devices were being used for stalking. State officials also warned the public that AirTags can be abused and misused as a tool for stalking others.\nApple has since added a few extra security features to help prevent its AirTags from being used maliciously. These features include a shortened time period in which a nonowner is notified of an AirTag's presence, improved warning sounds, a tracker detection app for Android devices and an alert at setup stating that the AirTag is linked to your Apple ID and is designed to enable law enforcement to request identifying information on the AirTag's owner.\nThere are additional things you can do to protect yourself from being tracked.\nAirTags don't store any location data or history, and communication history through the Find My app is end-to-end encrypted, according to Apple.\nWhat can I get engraved on my AirTag?\nApple will engrave one side of your AirTag for free after you purchase. When you reach the order screen, you can use the letters of the alphabet, numbers (zero through 50), and any of 31 different emoji. Because the tag is small, you can choose up to four characters to engrave on the back. As you choose your emoji, letters and numbers, you'll see a preview of what the tag will look like engraved.\nWhat do I need to use AirTags?\nAirTags will need a device running iOS 14.5 or later. Users will also need an Apple ID to sign in to their iCloud account. Here are the compatible devices:\n- iPhone SE, 6S or later\n- iPod Touch 7th generation or later\n- iPad Pro, 5th generation or later\n- iPad Air 2 or later\n- iPad Mini 4\nWhat accessories are available for AirTags?\nAirTags don't attach to anything straight out of the box, so you'll need to find a way to stick the devices on your stuff. Several third-party manufacturers like Belkin, ESR, Nomad and Hermes are selling accessories such as keychains, eyeglasses straps and hard shell mounts that will hold your AirTag. These accessories range in price from $13 to $449.\nAlison DeNisco Rayome contributed to this report."

      "text": "Apple AirTags help keep track of your keys and bags, but can they help track your pet? It seems simple enough to place an AirTag on your pet's collar so you can track them 24/7. It's certainly an option, but it might not the best one. After all, it does have limitations and risks of its own.\nReliability and safety both must be factored into the conversation when it comes to deciding whether or not to strap an AirTag to your pet. To learn if AirTags are acceptable for pet tracking, we spoke with two experts. Here's everything to know.\nWhat is an AirTag?\nApple AirTags were created to help keep track of personal items by using a \"secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network,\" according to Apple.\nThe small devices, costing $29 per tag, are often used on suitcases, purses, backpacks and key chains. Apple's website doesn't mention using AirTags on pets, probably for a good reason.\nRead more: Best Apple AirTag Accessories of 2024\nWhy you shouldn't use an AirTag to track your pet\nAlthough AirTags may seem like a convenient and relatively cheap way to keep track of your furry friends, experts advise against it.\nIf AirTags are attached to a pet's collars, there's a chance it could lead to a medical emergency, said Dr. Shannon Vawter, medical director and veterinarian at Thrive Pet Healthcare Wedgewood in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"There's a battery in there, and if the dog or cat ingests this -- which there's several articles and reports in our veterinary magazines where people have cited that this has happened -- then we have to do a surgery called a gastronomy or an enterotomy and go fish that tag out,\" Vawter said, adding that the battery is dangerous because if it starts \"to corrode or open up with that acid inside, it'll burn a hole right through their GI tract.\"\nVawter said the emergency surgery to remove the AirTag could range in price between $2,000 and $5,000, adding that dogs are more likely to chew or eat an AirTag, but that cats could also be at risk of doing so.\nTracking limitations are another reason experts caution against them.\n\"An AirTag has very limited tracking capabilities and accuracy in rural areas, the exact place that you're likely to need it the most,\" said Maleki Burke, founder of Snootiful Hound, a company that created escape-proof harnesses for sighthounds. Because AirTags depend on nearby Apple devices, Burke said that if your pet is lost in a rural area, the location may not be accurate or available.\n\"This is especially problematic if you're trying to track a dog that has wandered far away from populated areas,\" he said.\nExpert advice: Better ways to track your pet\nBoth Vawter and Burke recommend that the first line of action to keep your pet safe is to get them microchipped. A microchip is a small, permanent chip that's equivalent to the size of a grain of rice and is embedded into the pet. According to Pawlicy Advisor, a pet insurance marketplace, microchips for dogs cost between $25 to $60. If you adopt your pet from a shelter, it may be chipped beforehand. In that case, the shelter would provide you with the microchip identification number during the adoption process.\n\"Any pet can get a microchip at any age, and it is not much bigger than a vaccine needle,\" Vawter said. \"We do it all the time with distraction, like giving them some cheese or a little bit of peanut butter, and they don't even know they get it.\"\nWhen someone finds a lost pet and brings it to an animal shelter or a veterinary office, the pet is scanned for a microchip. Microchips contain information about the pet and the owner's personal information so they can be reunited quickly. If you need to update your pet's microchip information, visit the American Animal Hospital Association's microchip registry lookup. Enter your pet's microchip ID to find where it is enrolled, then request to update all necessary information.\nThe microchip is great for someone who finds your pet, but you may still want to pair it with a device that can actively track them. That's where a GPS collar can come in handy.\n\"Let's say your dog gets loose, the chances are, in the short term, they're not going to go too far,\" said Burke, who personally uses the GPS tracker Tractive for his dog. \"If you have a GPS on them and you can track them, you can get them back in minutes.\"\nLike many GPS collars, Tractive requires a monthly subscription. The basic plan is $13 a month or $8 a month if you sign up for a year-long subscription.\nVawter also recommends a GPS tracker over an AirTag because they're typically flat and built into the collar, rather than dangling off the collar.\n\"They're very large, so they'd be difficult to eat or bite into,\" she said. \"The other thing is, they're relying on satellites, not people's phones or Bluetooth. The only negative about a GPS -- and that's why I still want a microchip -- is the GPS has a battery, and it's short-lived.\"\nVawter added that if your pet keeps escaping, talk with your veterinarian to find the root cause of why it's happening in the first place.\nThe bottom line\nAirTags are great for your keys and other personal belongings, but there are safer and more foolproof ways to track your pets.\n\"Make sure your dog is microchipped,\" Burke said. \"But also, if you're worried about your dog escaping, just get a GPS. The peace of mind is worth its weight in gold.\""

Start with the hottest sales and discounts on the CNET Deals page and sign up for the CNET Deals text to get daily deals sent straight to your phone. Need gift ideas for birthdays, anniversaries and other events? Our gift guide includes a huge range of suggestions for every occasion.\nBest Labor Day retailer sales\nAmazon: One of the biggest online retailers is going all-in on the Labor Day discounts with significant savings on tech, home appliances and smart home equipment.\nWalmart: Save big on appliances like televisions, refrigerators, laptops and more at Walmart's Labor Day sale.\nThe Home Depot: Eyeing home improvement tools? Home Depot has the best discounts on tools, appliances and even grills.\nCasper: If you've been on the lookout for a new mattress, Casper is offering 35% off its entire line. In fact, there's a 30% discount across the website, so you might want to take a look even if you're not in the market for a new mattress.\nBest Buy: Shop incredible Labor Day deals on laptops, headphones, televisions and more.\nWhich Labor Day sales are the best?\nThere are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you will depend on what you're hoping to buy.\nAmazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind. If home and garden products are what you need, start with stores like Home Depot, Lowe's and Overstock.\nDon't rule out more niche retailers, such as B&H Photo, Dell, GameStop and HP, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.\nWhen do Labor Day sales start?\nLabor Day 2025 falls on Monday, Sept. 1, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Many sales are already starting to go live, especially mattresses. Other retailers are starting to drop prices as well, but we expect to see Labor Day sales officially kick off a few days before the holiday. We also expect sales to extend through the week after Labor Day. We'll be monitoring sales to help you nab the most savings.\nShould I wait for Black Friday sales?\nLabor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those products.\nBlack Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months, you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \"Prime Early Access Sale\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.\nHow do I make the most of Labor Day sales?\nBefore diving into Labor Day sales, narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the Labor Day sales.\nThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to follow the team on X and sign up for the CNET Deals newsletter."

      "text": "Two years ago, I declared Apple's AirTags a travel essential when they saved my sanity during a luggage delay as I returned from my honeymoon. As a frequent flier, I continue to sing their praises and encourage anyone who is checking luggage on a flight to invest in the coin-size trackers.\nOn a recent trip involving six different legs and a journey to the other side of the planet, at every airport I'd check constantly on the whereabouts of my suitcases using Apple's Find My app. There was so much room for error that I was convinced something would go wrong. Even though the app sometimes took a while to show the latest location of my bags, it provided me with peace of mind as I transited through major hubs and, thankfully, made it there and back with no losses or delays to report.\nApple knows that people have come to rely on AirTags as they move around the world, and the company is about to make these travel accessories even more useful. As part of the latest update to its mobile operating system iOS 18, Apple is allowing people to share secure links to the whereabouts of their AirTags with third parties. That will soon include airlines.\nThis development will help put to bed one remaining gripe about using AirTags for traveling. That is, until now if your luggage went missing, you might be able to see where it was, but that didn't mean your airline could. There wasn't an effective, real-time way to prove to your airline that luggage was where you said it was, giving the airline little incentive to follow up on the evidence.\nApple is now closing the loop, directly partnering with airlines so that your Find My Item location data can be directly integrated into their customer service process for finding mishandled or delayed bags. It's a step that will hopefully reduce the amount of bags that are lost every year in transit, which usually number in the tens of millions. It'll also hopefully give travelers more recourse to fight for the safe return of their luggage.\n\"We know many of our customers are already traveling with AirTags in their checked bags, and this feature will soon make it easier for them to share location information with us safely and securely, helping our customer service agents work more efficiently and giving our customers added peace of mind,\" said David Kinzelman, United's chief customer officer.\nHe added that the service will be available in only a handful of airports initially, but that the airline hopes to have integrated the service across its network by early 2025.\nA key partner in Apple's bid to make luggage more traceable is Sita, a tech company that makes the baggage-tracking tech WorldTracer, which is used by over 500 airlines and ground handlers at more than 2,800 airports worldwide.\n\"With global passenger traffic set to double by 2040, airports and airlines worldwide will face important challenges,\" said Nicole Hogg, Sita's director of baggage. The Share Item Location links will make for more efficient baggage management and be a \"huge benefit to customers,\" she added.\nThis looks like the beginning of the end of the road for lost luggage, which feels like an infinitely solvable problem in the age of AirTags. Hopefully someday soon, it'll be a thing of the past.\nHow to share your AirTag location with your airline\nApple has introduced the ability to Share Item Location in iOS 18.2, which is available in public beta now and will roll out soon to most iPhone users. On an iPhone, iPad or Mac, you can generate a secure, shareable link for any of your items that'll show the whereabouts of your AirTag on an interactive map. As in the Find My app, the website link will continue to update as your item moves, with timestamps to show when it was last seen.\nIf your airline has partnered with Apple, you'll be able to share your link with the airline directly. Initially 15 airlines have signed up to include Find My Item links. They include Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic and Vueling.\nApple says more airlines will be added over time.\nTo keep your data secure, only a small number of people will be able to see the location of your AirTag and recipients will have to confirm their identity using a partner email address or their Apple account.\nWith precise, transparent location tracking, the idea is that your airline should be able to resolve your lost luggage complaint more smoothly. I'm keen to know if this is working as it's designed to, so do reach out and let me know how you get on with it as it rolls out across airlines and airports around the world.\nIn the meantime, make sure you have enough AirTags for all of your checked luggage \u2014 and crucially, make sure they have enough battery life to last through your next trip."

      "text": "CNET editors share their best picks for every occasion.\nBokksu collects some of the best snacks from Japan and compiles them in a one-time or recurring monthly curated tasting box. I've both given and received a Bokksu and it is always a hit. Inside the unmistakable orange boxes, you'll find eats like seaweed tempura, green tea and lemon cakes along with Japanese candy such as yuzu gummies and matcha-strawberry Kit-Kats. What's more, Bokksu includes some info-packed literature explaining a bit about each, including historical and cultural significance. Bokksu boxes start at $40 a month for subscriptions and $50 for a one-time send.\nCNET's Chris Wedel borrowed a pair of these glasses for an international flight, and will travel never travel without them again. \"The ability to have as much display space as I need for work, and a comfortable viewing angle for watching movies or playing games, makes travel so much more bearable. The glasses are also great for working on the go once you arrive at your destination.\" For more details on them, you can check out CNET's review of the Xreal Air Pro 2 smart glasses.\nBilled as the human dog bed, the Plufl has been getting a lot of play on TikTok and other social media channels, so we decided to try one. The \"bed\" actually comes in four pieces: the cover, two fairly long tube-like pillows and a slim, oval \"mattress\" made out of memory foam. You stuff everything inside the cover -- assembly takes about 15 minutes -- and lo and behold, you're looking at a giant dog bed (or a plush life raft that doesn't float) big enough for a human. Not only is it quite comfortable for homo sapiens, but our family canine immediately sought refuge in this much larger, roomier version of his bed. While the Plufl is slightly more suitable for small or average-size humans, as long as you aren't really tall, it should accommodate you. It comes in a few colors, and the cover is removable and washable.\nBioLite has several portable lighting options, and the Alpenglow 500 is one of its more recent additions. It's a portable lantern that has multiple modes and color options. As its name implies, it delivers 500 lumens, and as CNET's David Carnoy notes, it is indeed pretty bright.\nThe step-down Alpenglow 250 offers 250 lumens for $15 less. Both are rated for 5 hours of battery life on the high setting and up to 200 hours on the low setting.\nIf you know someone who enjoys sparkling water, they'll love the convenience of churning out the fizzy stuff at home -- and it will save them money too. The SodaStream Terra is our top pick for the best soda maker for most people. It's easy to use and it has a slim design that doesn't take up too much counter space.\nThere are more-affordable portable blenders, like the Blendjet 2 and the Hamilton Beach Single-Serve, but the Ninja Blast, which lists for $60, is a step up from those models. It looks and feels more premium, and though it isn't superpowerful, it's a good option for making smoothies and protein shakes on the go or at home when you don't want to deal with a full-size blender. Additionally, you can drink right from the blender, as it has a leak-proof sip lid. Available in multiple color options and easy to operate, it has an 18 ounce-capacity and recharges via USB-C.\nPlaying games with your kids can be incredibly rewarding, and so can playing games by yourself. The GoCube gives you the chance to do both. I've always wanted to know how to complete a Rubik's cube, but could never get the hang of it. The GoCube connects to your phone or tablet and takes you through the steps of solving a cube using \"algorithms.\" It's the first time I've felt I had a handle on manipulating a puzzle cube without it being completely random. Learning a new skill as a dad, especially one that can impress your kids, is always worthwhile -- and the app even lets you play battle games with your kids to make it more family-oriented.\nCNET's David Watsky tested all the top wine clubs, and FirstLeaf is his top choice for gifting to people with moderately experienced palates. If you've graduated from the Gallos and the Cupcakes and want to include more nuanced, complex and higher-priced premium wine in your life, Firstleaf Wine Club might be good for you too. Its palate quiz is one of the most involved, asking for varietal (Pinot Noir vs. Shiraz, for instance) preferences in addition to using several household name wines as taste benchmarks.\nThis intelligent wine subscription service gets to know you by asking about certain tasting notes and qualities you might prefer in your perfect wine -- such as minerality -- in contrast to similar quizzes, which assume many don't know what that means. In short, this is probably the best wine club for a wine enthusiast who has the basics down and is ready to launch into expert wine-tasting territory.\nStep up their VR experience by upgrading it with a Meta Quest 3, our top pick for the best VR headset of 2024. This headset allows for more-intuitive interactions, more-accurate precision, and realistic sensations, helping you immerse yourself better in the game or app. Plus, you can do more than just game on this set. You can also learn how to play the piano, attend workout classes in studios, and even attend your favorite band's concert, all from the comfort of your home.\nIf you know someone who wants to track their health metrics, but in a subtle way compared to using their phone or a smartwatch, the high-end Oura Ring 4 is the way to go. It can monitor their heart rate, activity and stress levels, plus sleep, and then they can see them all in the Oura app. This newest version, the gen 4, has an even sleeker feel than its predecessor. It also features a battery life that can outlast most smartwatches.\nCNET\u2019s Lisa Eadicicco says it\u2019s her favorite wellness tracker and that \u201cOura\u2019s personalized and actionable way of presenting biological readings makes its health metrics among the most useful of the wearables I\u2019ve tested.\u201d Read our Oura Ring 4 review.\nThe original Theragun Mini was already a very compact massage gun and this second-gen version is 20% smaller and 30% lighter, weighing only a pound. It easily fits in a backpack or purse and is great for travel. What's also new to this 2.0 model is USB-C charging, Bluetooth connectivity to the Therabody app on your iOS or Android device and the inclusion of three foam attachments (instead of just one) -- the Standard Ball, the Thumb and Dampener. While it doesn't have quite the power of one of Theragun's full-size devices, it's surprisingly powerful considering how small it is, with three speeds to choose from. I've tried larger massage guns in this price range, and it's just as powerful but half the size. The rechargeable battery is rated to last 2 hours at the lowest speed setting and a neoprene protective case is included. The Theragun Mini 2.0 comes in three color options.\nA coffee subscription is about as foolproof a gift as it gets. As long as the person being gifted, ya know, drinks coffee and all. I've tested and enjoyed many of the top coffee subscription services including Trade, Equator and many others. One stands out as particularly giftable and that's Atlas Coffee Club. For one, the coffee comes from all over with lots of interesting roasts from Africa and Central America. Each bag arrives as if sent by a friend (in this case it has!) with a glossy postcard and some information on both the beans and the region they hail from. A three-month gift subscription starts at $60.\nCNET's Lori Grunin owns all sorts of gaming laptops and consoles, but the Steam Deck OLED is her go-to gaming device. \"It's not for everyone -- really just gamers who have large libraries of games from the popular Steam store,\" she says. And you'll want make sure that your giftee wants one, since once it's opened it can't be returned.\nThe more expensive OLED version is worth the extra cost over the older LCD model -- it starts at $549, versus $399 -- for the bigger, better screen, twice as much storage, faster Wi-Fi and longer battery life.\nAmazon's Smart Thermostat sets a new standard for the category. It has a clean, modern touchscreen design, and it's easy to use, whether you're adjusting the temperature at the thermostat, through the Alexa app or with Alexa voice commands with a compatible Alexa-enabled speaker or display. It earned a CNET Editors' Choice award for best value smart thermostat.\nYou can get plenty of snap-on magnetic battery packs for iPhones and Android phones these days, but the Anker MagGo 622 rises above the pack, thanks to its features and unique design. In addition to being light, it's got a fold-down stand which perfectly nestles on a plane or train tray table, so you can watch a video on your phone while it juices up (it supports passthrough charging via USB-C). It also made our pick for the best magnetic power bank with an integrated stand.\nI consider the smaller Boom 2 the best value among current Soundcore by Anker Bluetooth speakers because it delivers very strong sound for a speaker that costs a little more than $100. But the larger and more expensive Boom 2 Plus is a better sounding speaker that plays louder and produces bigger sound with more bass. While it costs around $250, the key thing about it is that it competes well with boom box speakers from JBL and Sony that cost upwards of $400.\nThis speaker has dual 50W woofers and dual 20W tweeters, Anker says, and charges via USB-C, which is nice. There also a charge out option to charge your devices and the Boom 2 Plus is rated for up to 20 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels. The speaker has both a handle and removable strap to make it easy to carry around and is IPX7 waterproof. It also floats should you drop it in a body of water and has a customizable light show option.\nHaving the right sheets can make a big difference in the quality of your sleep -- some make you too hot, causing you to wake up a lot. That\u2019s where these 100% bamboo viscose bed linens come into play -- they\u2019re super soft, yet also breathable. Plus, they come with a 100-night warranty, so it\u2019s a win-win. These also made our pick for best cooling sheets.\nA quality portable Bluetooth speaker should be waterproof, durable and small enough to slip into a bag -- while still delivering excellent sound. The Bose SoundLink Flex ticks all those boxes, which is why CNET rated it the best portable Bluetooth speaker available."
