  "description": "Vice President JD Vance will visit U.S. troops stationed at a key military installation for the U.S. Air Force in England that supports heavy bomber aircraft.",
  "content": "Vice President JD Vance is poised to meet with U.S. troops at a military installation in England Wednesday \u2013 capping off a high-stakes trip to the U.K. meeting with European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s Friday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nVance\u2019s visit to the U.K. comes as he\u2019s sought to lay some groundwork with European allies leading up to Trump\u2019s talk with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska \u2013 and as he\u2019s turned up the heat on them to take greater ownership in the discussions since the conflict is in their backyard.\n\nThe vice president is slated to visit Royal Air Force Base Fairford in England Wednesday, where the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 501st Combat Support Wing and the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron are based. Vance, a former Marine, is expected to voice appreciation for their service, according to a source familiar with Vance\u2019s prepared remarks.\n\nVLADIMIR PUTIN TO RETURN TO US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE\n\nThe military installation serves as a key location for U.S. Air Force operations and is Air Force Global Strike Command's preferred bomber forward operating base in Europe. U.S. Air Force bombers are regularly deployed to the military base as part of Bomber Task Force Europe 25-2 to integrate with NATO allies and sharpen the service\u2019s global strike capabilities.\n\nDays after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, several Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers from Fairford conducted joint operations with Germany and Romania over NATO's eastern flank.\n\nThere are approximately 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in the U.K., according to foreign policy think tank Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPrior to addressing U.S. troops, Vance is poised to participate in calls with European leaders to discuss the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Fox News Digital has learned.\n\nThe calls come on the heels of multiple other discussions with European allies on a series of topics \u2013 including the war \u2013 during Vance\u2019s U.K. visit. Vance has met with multiple U.K. leaders, including U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\n\nA U.S. official told Fox News Digital that Vance and Lammy discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. and the two allies\u2019 shared economic and technology goals during a meeting on Friday at Lammy\u2019s official residence, Chevening House, in Kent, England.\n\nSUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP\u2019S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE\n\nMeanwhile, the two leaders also discussed the state of affairs in the Middle East, as well as negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. official said.\n\nThe two also met with representatives of Ukraine and other European allies at Chevening House on Saturday. The meeting led to \"significant progress\" on ending the conflict in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official.\n\nNo other details were provided regarding the Ukraine talks. It\u2019s unclear if Vance will accompany Trump to Alaska for talks with Putin.\n\nHowever, Vance said in an interview with Fox News that he communicated to European leaders that the U.S. is \"done with the funding of the Ukraine war business,\" and that European allies must assume more responsibility in ending the conflict.\n\n\"What we said to Europeans is simply, first of all, this is in your neck of the woods, this is in your back door, you guys have got to step up and take a bigger role in this thing, and if you care so much about this conflict you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself,\" Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nCongress has passed multiple measures to support Ukraine, totaling at least $175 billion in spending to aid Ukraine since February 2022, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nTRUMP, PUTIN WILL HOLD FIRST IN-PERSON MEETING SINCE UKRAINE INVASION NEXT WEEK IN ALASKA\n\nMeanwhile, Trump told reporters Monday that he\u2019d know within minutes is Putin actually interested in a deal or not. Still, he said Moscow and Kyiv must come to terms with some \"land swapping\" issues to sign off on a deal.\n\n\"If it\u2019s a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,\" Trump said. \"I may say, \u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say we can make a deal.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s meeting with Putin also comes as his relationship with the Russian leader has soured as peace negotiations have lagged. While the two seemed to remain cordial with each other publicly during Trump\u2019s first administration, that\u2019s changed in recent weeks as Trump has grown fed up with Putin\u2019s tactics.\n\n\"We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on July 8. \"He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\"",

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin will return to the U.S. for the first time in a decade when he meets with President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s announcement last week that the pair would be meeting for an in-person summit \u2013 marking the first time a U.S. president will meet with Putin after he invaded Ukraine in 2022, less than a year after he met with Biden in 2021 in Geneva \u2013 several locations were suspected as being the most likely meeting places, including Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and the United Arab Emirates.\nIt was reported that Putin shot down the idea of Italy, as it is seen as being favorable to Ukraine, and instead pushed for Hungary.\nTRUMP GOES AFTER ZELENSKYY OVER 'LAND SWAPPING' DISPUTE, LAYS OUT 'FEEL OUT MEETING' WITH PUTIN\nHowever, Trump surprised the nation when he announced on Friday that Putin would instead be traveling to Alaska for his first U.S. trip since he attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York in 2015, when he met with then-President Barack Obama.\nOn Monday, Trump said he thought it was \"very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country as opposed to us going to his country or even a third-party place.\"\nIt is unclear why a third-party nation like the UAE was not selected. Though the justification for why Hungary was not selected \u2013 despite being led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n who is friendly with both Putin and Trump \u2013 could be because it is a member of NATO and would likely prove controversial should a NATO ally host the Kremlin chief at a time when Europe faces its greatest threat since World War II.\nSimilarly, dubious optics could be attributed to not hosting the meeting in Switzerland, which, though not a NATO ally, is a member of the International Criminal Court which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023 over accusations of war crimes.\n\"They probably avoided Europe, because if they included Europe, then Europe would have demanded that they're actually at the table,\" Dan Hoffman, former CIA Moscow Station chief, told Fox News Digital. \"Probably your two choices were go to Russia \u2013 which Trump would never do \u2013 or invite him here.\n\"It also exposes the challenge that you can't solve this without Ukraine and without Europe,\" he added.\nWhile it remains unclear where exactly the pair will meet, or why Alaska was ultimately landed on, Alaska\u2019s senior Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it was \"another opportunity for the Arctic to serve as a venue that brings together world leaders to forge meaningful agreements.\"\n\"While I remain deeply wary of Putin and his regime, I hope these discussions lead to genuine progress and help end the war on equitable terms,\" she added, noting her concern when it comes to dealing with Putin.\nRussian officials appeared to take a more optimistic tone about the location of the meeting when Russia\u2019s special economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev took to X to acknowledge the historical role Alaska has played in the Russia-U.S. relationship.\n\"Born as Russian America \u2014 Orthodox roots, forts, fur trade \u2014 Alaska echoes those ties and makes the U.S. an Arctic nation,\" Dmitriev said, later describing it as the \"perfect stage\" for the meeting.\nHoffman argued that the location is not hugely significant and said, \"What's going to matter is what they talk about. The details of the meeting more than the venue.\n\"No one can predict what's going to happen. I don't even think Trump or Putin knows what's going to result from this,\" he added, noting there were too many variables to start predicting or analyzing any element of the upcoming talks.\nTrump wouldn\u2019t detail what he specifically hopes to get out of the talks with Putin on Friday, though he argued he\u2019d be able to tell within the first \"two minutes\" whether a ceasefire deal in Ukraine was even possible.\n\"I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal,\" he said. I think a deal should be made for both [Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy].\n\"I\u2019d like to see a ceasefire. I'd like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties. You know, it takes two to tango,\" he added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump said he would relate the details of the conversation to both Zelenskyy and European leaders immediately following the meeting.\n\"We're going to see what he has in mind,\" Trump said of his upcoming meeting with the Kremlin chief. \"And if it's a fair deal, I'll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to the NATO leaders, and also to President Zelenskyy \u2013 I think out of respect I'll call him first.\n\"I may say, \u2018lots of luck, keep fighting\u2019 or I may say, \u2018we can make a deal\u2019,\" Trump concluded."

If granted a seat at the table, it would mark the first face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.\nThe summit comes as Russia\u2019s war grinds into its third year and fifth month, with Moscow showing little sign of abandoning its efforts to erode Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and reassert the territorial influence of the former Soviet empire.\nPUTIN ALLY WARNS 'TITANIC EFFORTS' ARE UNDERWAY TO SINK TRUMP SUMMIT OVER UKRAINE WAR\nThe Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday that Trump and Putin are expected to \"focus on discussing options for achieving a long-term peaceful resolution\" in Ukraine. \"This will evidently be a challenging process, but we will engage in it actively and energetically,\" the statement added.\n'The US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously'\nOver the weekend, several European leaders voiced support for Zelenskyy\u2019s push to attend this week\u2019s summit, amid growing concerns that Kyiv\u2019s long-term security could be negotiated without its direct involvement.\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the European Commission said in a joint statement that any diplomatic solution brokered between Trump and Putin must uphold the security interests of both Ukraine and Europe.\nZELENSKYY WON\u2019T CEDE TERRITORY FOR PEACE DEAL AHEAD OF TRUMP\u2011PUTIN SUMMIT\n\"The U.S. has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously,\" European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told Reuters on Sunday. \"Any deal between the U.S. and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine\u2019s and the whole of Europe\u2019s security,\" she added.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also voiced support for Zelenskyy's attendance at the meeting and called the summit an opportunity to measure how serious Putin is about \"bringing this terrible war to an end.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nZelenskyy thanked European leaders for their support and said that \"the end of the war must be fair.\"\n\"I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations,\" he said."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022.

      "text": "President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet next Friday, August 15, for the first in-person meeting between leaders of the U.S. and Russia since Moscow launched its deadly 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nThe leaders are expected to meet in Alaska, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\"The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska,\" Trump wrote in his Friday evening post. \"Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\nThe location of the meeting was a major point of interest after the summit was first floated following a call between Trump and Putin on Wednesday after White House envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow to meet with the Kremlin chief.\nZELENSKYY TELLS PUTIN TO 'BE BRAVE' AND FINALLY AGREE TO TRILATERAL MEETING WITH TRUMP\nHungary, Switzerland, Italy, and the UAE were all under consideration, with Putin originally favoring Hungary, according to sources familiar with the planning.\nThe Kremlin chief also shot down the idea of meeting in Italy, according to reports on Friday, due to Rome\u2019s perceived closeness with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nFollowing the Wednesday Trump-Putin call, the U.S. president also spoke with Zelenskyy along with European leaders on the potential for a trilateral meeting.\nMoscow \u2013 which has thus far refused to hold direct meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy \u2013 has not appeared likely to engage in a trilateral meeting any time soon, as the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy advisor noted on Wednesday that the potential for such a meeting was \"mentioned\" but \"not discussed.\"\nTRUMP\u2019S DEADLINE ON SECONDARY TARIFFS ARRIVES; US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS HANG IN THE BALANCE\nReporting later suggested that Putin may be open to meeting face to face with Zelenskyy, but only if certain \"conditions\" are met, though what these conditions are remains unclear.\nPutin has allegedly suggested that Ukraine would need to formally cede the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2022, but which it does not have full control over.\nThough Zelenskyy has countered similar territorial demands by noting that under Ukraine's Constitution a national referendum would need to occur for any territorial concessions.\nDespite the immense hurdles that remain, Trump appeared optimistic when speaking to reporters on Wednesday that \"there's a very good prospect that [Putin and Zelenskyy] will\" meet.\nZelenskyy said at least one bilateral meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders was suggested, which would potentially be followed by a meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt remains unclear what the president hopes to definitively get out of meeting with Putin in person after expressing frustration with the Kremlin chief despite months of attempts to forge a ceasefire.\nTrump wouldn\u2019t comment on how likely he thought a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv could be on the horizon and echoed his previous frustrations with Putin by telling reporters, \"I've been disappointed before with this one.\""
