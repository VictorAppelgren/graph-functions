  "content": "TORONTO, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NexGold Mining Corp. (TSXV:NEXG; OTCQX: NXGCF), (TSXV: NEXG; OTCQX:NXGCF) (\"NexGold\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide additional drill results from a recently-completed 26,854-metre diamond drill program initially announced on January 22, 2025 at the Company's Goldboro Open Pit Gold Project (\"Goldboro\") in Nova Scotia. The drill program is primarily designed to infill specific areas of the open pit Mineral Resource identified to improve geological and grade continuity and potentially upgrade certain areas of Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resources. The assay results for an additional 12 infill diamond drill holes (BR-25-560, 574 to 576, 580, 581, 583, 587 to 589, 591 and 604) totalling 2,163.0 metres, were from drilling in the proposed east pit of the Goldboro Open Pit Gold Project (Figure 1; Tables 1 and 2). \n\n\n\nKevin Bullock, President and CEO, stated: \"The high-grade intercepts in recent drilling in the east pit will be important to ongoing work on the Goldboro Mineral Resource and mine planning. Goldboro continues to demonstrate the presence of high-grade zones, near surface, within the planned open pits. We are encountering this style of mineralization at open pit depths with all intersected zones projecting to surface. We anticipate final assays from the full drill program to be returned in the coming weeks and look forward to using that information in an updated Mineral Resource Estimate.\"\n\nSelected drill intersections from the 12 diamond drill holes in this news release are further detailed in Table 2 and include:\n\u2022 23.73 g/t gold over 5.3 metres (from 153.7 to 159.0 metres), including 244.00 g/t gold over 0.5 metres in drill hole BR-25-589;\n\u2022 24.65 g/t gold over 2.2 metres (from 142.2 to 144.4 metres), including 104.50 g/t gold over 0.5 metres in drill hole BR-25-576;\n\u2022 7.40 g/t gold over 3.7 metres (from 128.5 to 132.2 metres), including 51.60 g/t gold over 0.5 metres in drill hole BR-25-588;\n\u2022 1.90 g/t gold over 12.5 metres (from 56.4 to 68.9 metres), including 18.25 g/t gold over 0.7 metres in drill hole BR-25-580; and\n\u2022 5.20 g/t gold over 3.7 metres (from 255.8 to 259.5 metres), including 29.00 g/t gold over 0.7 metres in drill hole BR-25-588.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has now released assay results for 130 drill holes (approximately 92%) from the infill program. Results from the drill program, to date, continue to demonstrate the presence of mineralization that is consistent with previous drill results in the proposed west and east pits. In particular, the existing geological model appears to broadly predict the location of gold mineralization with local adjustments to the model where mineralization is either not in the exact positions predicted by the model or if no mineralization is intersected. Throughout the drill program additional gold mineralization was intersected in areas where mineralization was previously unknown or predicted. This occurs either in under-drilled areas or near historic drilling which were more selectively sampled than the current sampling approach. Mineralized solids within the Mineral Resource model will be adjusted where necessary to account for local variations in the model, and any impact due to additional assay data gathered during the drill program will be investigated during the forthcoming updated Mineral Resource Estimate planned for H2 2025.\n\nFigure 1: Plan map showing the location of diamond drill holes BR-25-560, 574 to 576, 580, 581, 583, 587 to 589, 591 and 604 along with highlights' assays in the proposed East Pit, Goldboro Gold Deposit\n\u2022 Some drill hole numbers are missing from the sequence. These drill holes are not reported in this news release since they were drilled in another location and will be reported in a separate news release with other contiguous or related drilling information.\n\u2022 Drill holes BR-25-466 to 559, 561 to 573, 577 to 579, 582, 584, 586, 590, and 605 to 607 were reported in previous news releases dated May 16, June 5, June 13, June 19, June 26, July 10, July 17, July 24, and July 30, 2025.\n\u2022 Reported intervals are drilled core lengths and do not indicate true widths. True widths are estimated at between 70-100% of core length. For duplicate samples, the original sample assays are used to calculate the intersection grade. All grades are uncapped.\n\u2022 Some drill hole numbers are missing from the sequence. These drill holes are not reported in this news release since they were drilled in another location and will be reported in a separate news release with other contiguous or related drilling information.\n\u2022 Drill holes BR-25-466 to 559, 561 to 573, 577 to 579, 582, 584, 586, 590, and 605 to 607 were reported in previous news releases dated May 16, June 5, June 13, June 19, June 26, July 10, July 17, July 24, and July 30, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nQA / QC\n\nThe Company has implemented a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program to ensure sampling and analysis of all exploration work is conducted in accordance with the CIM Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. The NQ diameter drill core is sawn in half with one-half of the core sample dispatched to either Eastern Analytical Ltd. (Eastern) preparation facility in Springdale, Newfoundland and Labrador or the ALS Canada Ltd. (ALS) prep lab in Moncton, NB and then the pulp is sent to North Vancouver, BC for fire assay. The other half of the core is retained for future assay verification and/or metallurgical testing. Analysis for gold was completed by fire assay (30 g) with an AA finish. All assays in this news release are reported as fire assays only.\n\nFor samples analyzing greater than 0.5 g/t Au via 30 g fire assay, these samples will be re-analyzed at Eastern via total pulp metallics. For the total pulp metallics analysis, the entire sample is crushed to -10mesh and pulverized to 95% -150mesh. The total sample is then weighed and screened to 150mesh. The +150mesh fraction is fire assayed for Au, and a 30 g subsample of the -150mesh fraction analyzed via fire assay. A weighted average gold grade is calculated for the final reportable gold grade. Total pulp metallics assays for drill holes sited within this news release may be updated in a future news release. Check assays are conducted at Eastern for assay samples received from ALS and check assays are conducted at ALS for assays received from Eastern following the completion of a program.\n\n\n\nOther QA/QC procedures include the regular insertion of blanks and CDN Resource Laboratories certified reference standards. The laboratory also has its own QA/QC protocols running standards and blanks with duplicate samples in each batch stream for all analysis. \n\n\n\nQualified Person \n\nPaul McNeill, P.Geo., VP Exploration of NexGold, is considered a \"Qualified Person\" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release on behalf of NexGold. \n\n\n\nAbout NexGold Mining Corp. \n\nNexGold Mining Corp. is a gold-focused company with assets in Canada and Alaska.
