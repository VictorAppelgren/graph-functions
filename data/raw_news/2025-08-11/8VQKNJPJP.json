  "description": "The Mayor of London has been warned of \"deeply distressing\" conditions for those in need.",
  "content": "Disabled Londoners are being failed due to a \"chronic\" shortage of accessible housing, the Mayor of London has been warned.\n\nThe chair of the London Assembly Housing Committee, Zo\u00eb Garbett, has written to Sir Sadiq following their investigation into accessible housing.\n\nA lack of homes which are either built or adapted to enable people with access needs to live independently has led to \"deeply distressing\" conditions for those in need, according to Ms Garbett, a Green Party London Assembly member.\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The Mayor is committed to ensuring that all Londoners can afford a place to call home and providing genuine choice for London's diverse population.\"\n\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), Ms Garbett said the \"stark and compelling\" evidence heard from stakeholders included one resident left unable to wash themselves after being placed in temporary accommodation without an accessible bathroom.\n\nAnother had to wait for their partner to lift them two floors up because they could not take the stairs, she added.\n\nLaura Vicinanza, from disability charity Inclusion London, said: \"The number of people we spoke to who experience stress, anxiety, depression, who have had to be hospitalised - it is just outrageous.\"\n\nHallie Banish, from the independent living charity Ruils, said: \"This is a housing emergency.\n\n\"Everyone deserves safe, accessible, affordable housing and the Mayor needs to do his job in ensuring this bare minimum standard is met.\"\n\nMs Garbett wrote: \"The consequences of inaccessible housing are far-reaching.\n\n\"It often leaves people reliant on partners or carers to meet even their basic needs. It can take a profound physical, mental and emotional toll.\n\n\"We are clear that deaf and disabled Londoners deserve better; they deserve to live in homes that meet their needs, allowing them to live with dignity and independence.\"\n\nEven where accessible housing does exist, navigating the systems to find it are \"complex and difficult\", she added.\n\nMs Garbett said the \"obvious solution\" was building more accessible homes and retrofitting existing housing, but a lack of data, stemming from a failure to effectively monitor developer standards, meant taking effective action was \"almost impossible\".\n\nOther recommendations included ensuring a larger proportion of homes are delivered to the wheelchair accessible standard and holding developers to account for failing to do so.\n\nThe London Plan, set out in 2021, requires 90% of new build homes be built to be adaptable for residents with accessibility needs, but last year, 23% of new build completions were compliant with this, the LDRS said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"Years of under-funding by the previous government, low economic growth, high interest rates and record construction costs have all held us back from building much-needed homes \u2013 and Londoners are suffering the consequences.\n\n\"The current London Plan requires 10% of new homes to be wheelchair accessible or adaptable, and a recent consultation to inform development of the next Plan invited comments on how to unlock more housing options for disabled Londoners.\"\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

      "text": "Disabled man 'stuck' again in new inaccessible flat\n- Published\nA disabled man who had to be carried down the side of his flat block after the lift broke has said he is now \"stuck\" in his new council flat too, because it is not accessible.\nNathan Rollinson, 33, was rescued by emergency services and then treated in hospital when he fell out of his wheelchair after the lift broke in June.\nHe said Lambeth Council promised to adapt a new flat before he moved in last month but it still had not been done, meaning he cannot open the front or back doors or windows unaided, and cannot use his kitchen.\nLambeth Council said it had been \"working hard\" and further adjustments were \"in the process of being carried out\".\nMr Rollinson has been a wheelchair user since suffering brain and spinal injuries in a rugby accident last year.\nHe previously told the Local Democracy Reporting Service after he was treated in hospital, he had been staying in a hotel until Lambeth Council could find him a more accessible place to live.\nHe told BBC London the council eventually suggested a flat in a sheltered accommodation scheme Mr Rollinson said is aimed at over-60s, but he still accepted it and moved in on 29 July.\nHowever, Mr Rollinson said despite the council acknowledging it \"needed to install an electric door opener\" on his front door and windows this has not happened.\nHe said he currently \"can't get out of the front door - I have to call the scheme manager who is only here Monday to Friday, 9 to 5,\" which meant he was either \"stuck\" or reliant on help from friends outside of these times.\nMr Rollinson added London Fire Brigade advised him the front door was \"my only evacuation route\" due to a change in the floor level between the back door and patio outside, so he said he could not escape independently if there was a fire.\n\"They've passed it on to Lambeth again, who know this, and Lambeth are choosing to say 'oh we'll do it in 12 weeks',\" he said.\nMr Rollinson claimed the council was also \"supposed to fully adapt\" the kitchen too but this has not been done, so he \"can't cook\" or use the kitchen.\n\"If I was to try and use the oven I'd fall into the oven because it's low to the floor and the fridge isn't accessible... the countertops, nothing is accessible,\" he explained.\nHe continued by saying when he moved in there were even problems with his fuse box and key-operated utility meter, which were installed \"eight foot\" away from the floor.\nWhen he told Lambeth Council about this, he alleged a staff member replied, \"it's fine, you'll have to just reach for it\" and later suggested staff could top the meter up for him instead.\n\"I want to be able to be fully independent, which obviously I can't,\" he said.\n\"It's horrendous. Even the scheme manager said I shouldn't be here.\"\nMr Rollinson went on to say while he was previously in hospital doctors \"found a pulmonary embolism which they said was caused by the stress of the last property\", and he suffered \"further spine damage\" after the fall which meant he had not been able to work.\n\"I didn't want to be doing all this,\" Mr Rollinson said, adding he was \"angry\" with the situation.\n\"I've had to push since 2022 when I first got injured,\" he said.\nAdjustments 'being carried out'\nA Lambeth Council spokesperson said: \"We have been working hard to support our resident on an ongoing basis to meet his needs.\n\"We have secured ground floor sheltered accommodation for him to live in which is suitable for wheelchair access.\n\"The council had the flat assessed by an occupational therapist before he moved in, and again on the day of the move.\n\"Any further adjustments needed to make sure all his needs are met are in the process of being carried out.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Housing needs to be considered in the context of transport and streetscapes and public infrastructure,\" she explained.\n\"I can't get into, I would say, 90% of the shops and restaurants in this area.\n\"If you can't easily get down the street, you can't access the Tube station, then it doesn't really matter that your house is accessible because it is essentially a beautiful prison.\"\nLocal and national decision makers are now being urged to work together to build more accessible homes, especially ones for social rent.\nTracey Lazard, chief executive officer at Inclusion London, said the low percentage of accessible new homes being built in the capital was \"shocking\" and was \"condemning disabled people now to live lives of, frankly, misery\".\nShe added: \"We talk a lot about future proofing and resilience and critical to that has to be about building homes that people can live in throughout their entire lives.\"\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor is committed to meeting London's diverse housing needs and has allocated more than \u00a3100m in funding to deliver well-designed, supported housing to enable disabled Londoners to live independently and access appropriate care.\n\"The mayor also requires a minimum percentage of accessible and adaptable units in all new housing developments funded by his Affordable Homes Programme, helping to build a fairer and better London for everyone.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

She says she then had to crawl up the stairs back to her flat in pain, with her flatmate carrying her wheelchair up the stairs.\nDespite calling \"constantly\", Ms Brown said Crabtree had told her it would not unlock the door, stating it was a fire door and must remain locked, that its offices in central London were too far away from east London, and that the property manager was off sick.\nAdditionally, Ms Brown said when she called Crabtree and explained she was a wheelchair user and the situation was causing her great difficulty, the staff member told her \u201cwhen you live in a block of flats you should expect that the lift will break sometimes\u201d.\n\"It's victim blaming,\" she argued. \"It makes me feel like it's my fault. They have no idea what it's like looking for a property in London [as a wheelchair user].\"\nLondon Fire Brigade (LFB), when contacted by Ms Brown about whether a fire door should remain locked, told her there was no fire safety reason why this would be the case.\nThe LFB told the BBC it was in the process of arranging a visit to the building in question, and the fire safety team had \"spoken with the resident and, as a result, has made contact with the building\u2019s managing agent\".\n- Published14 July 2023\n- Published5 February 2023\n\"It's caused a huge amount of anxiety,\" Ms Brown added.\n\"This is supposed to be the one place you feel safe but not being able to leave is making me wonder if I want to live here any more.\"\nMs Brown described the situation as like being in her \u201cown personal lockdown\u201d, saying she has been unable to go into her office job as usual, has relied on friends coming over to help bring her things, and is considering cancelling her doctor\u2019s appointment on Friday because she does not think she will be able to leave the building.\nShe also said it had impacted her health because she had not been able to go swimming, which is an activity recommended by her medical team.\n\"I feel like I'm being fobbed off - it's been six days,\" she said.\n\"No reasonable adjustments have been made, there has been no suggestion of temporary accommodation, no apology. They just keep saying 'bear with us', which is fine to say if you're not stuck in your home.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."

  "argos_summary": "Disabled Londoners are facing a severe shortage of accessible housing, leading to distressing living conditions, as highlighted by the London Assembly Housing Committee's chair, Zo\u00eb Garbett. The investigation revealed that many individuals with access needs are unable to live independently due to inadequate housing options, with only 23% of new builds meeting accessibility standards. Advocates are calling for increased construction of accessible homes and better monitoring of developer compliance to ensure that disabled residents can live with dignity and independence.",
