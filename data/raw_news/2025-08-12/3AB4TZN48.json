  "argos_summary": "Good Morning Britain's Marverine Cole reported a significant rise in UK unemployment, with an increase of 26,000 jobless individuals between May and June, according to the Office of National Statistics. This marks a troubling trend, as unemployment has risen in 10 of the last 12 months, primarily due to job losses in the hospitality and retail sectors, posing a challenge for Labour leader Keir Starmer.",
