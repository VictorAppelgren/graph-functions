  "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 The Powerball jackpot rose to an estimated $1.3 billion Monday night after the winning numbers failed to appear.\n\nThe numbers drawn were 8, 23, 25, 40, 53 with the Powerball 5.\n\nNo one has matched all six numbers since May 31, allowing the jackpot to swell to $1.3 billion, which would be the fifth-largest prize in the game\u2019s history if there is a winner in the drawing Wednesday night.\n\nAs ticket sales climbed during the past week, game officials raised the estimated Monday night jackpot to $1.1 billion before taxes.\n\nAlthough there was no lucky jackpot winner, two ticket holders in Montana and North Carolina each won $2 million.\n\nPayments for a jackpot would be spread over 30 years. A winner also can choose an immediate lump sum in cash before taxes, which now stands at $589 million.\n\nThe odds of matching all six numbers are astronomical: 1 in 292.2 million. The odds of getting struck by lightning are far greater. But with so many people putting down money for a chance at life-changing wealth, someone eventually wins.\n\nPowerball, which costs $2 per ticket, is played in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Drawings are held each week on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights.",
