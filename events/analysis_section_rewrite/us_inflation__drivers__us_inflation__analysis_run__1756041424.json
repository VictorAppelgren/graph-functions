      "feedback": "The draft does many things well (a crisp base-case anchored in Microsoft/Shopify AI-scale, a policy-driven easing backdrop, and a concrete near-term catalyst), but to reach world-class quality you should reorganize and sharpen several dimensions. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: (1) Make the causal chain explicit and first-principles-based—start from platform breadth (e.g., Azure/SaaS/Shopify ecosystem reach) leading to GMV growth (Shopify H1’25 GMV ≈ $163B; growth ~27%–27% implied by Q2’25 style), then to revenue uplift (Shopify revenue +29%), then to operating margin and free cash flow expansion; tie Azure contracted revenue ≈ $368B and Azure growth ≈ 39% directly into the growth/margin ramp assumptions, and quantify how scale translates into higher multiple under Regime A; (2) formalize a structured scenario framework (Base/Base-case plus Upside and Downside) with explicit catalysts, triggers, and invalidation points (e.g., actual September rate cut size and persistence; Intel governance signal pricing in markets; Shopify GMV/revenue/margin trajectory; EU/U.S. tariff progress; oil supply/demand surprises); (3) tighten quantification and avoid vagueness—where you state “durable easing regime” or “higher valuations,” attach ranges and source-backed numbers (e.g., 25–50 bp cut; 4%–4.5% 10Y yield band; IEA 2.5 mbpd 2025 supply rise; Shopify GMV 163B with +27% growth; revenue +29%); (4) reconcile potential conflicts across sources—explain how oil oversupply (IEA forecast) and softer dollar interact with inflation and AI capex timing, and how the 90-day U.S.–China tariff pause versus a still-long EU 15% envelope shape near-term pricing and capex timing; (5) strengthen the “watch-list” with five decisives: actual September cut size/persistence; Shopify GMV/revenue/margin trajectory next quarter; evolution of Intel’s ~10% stake and its market pricing; any tariff shifts (U.S.–China pause longevity, EU tariff steps, autos exemptions timing); FX and 10Y moves confirming or contradicting the regime; (6) tighten prose to remove repetition and ensure every assertion cites an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL, and ensure all critical sources are covered (e.g., consistently attach 0G3A676BP, 48JXC9VDP, GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, RHFWI02JT, QF, etc.), while avoiding new claims not supported by those IDs. This would yield a tightly reasoned, numerically anchored, cross-topic synthesis with a transparent, codified watch-list and clear invalidation logic.",
