  "description": "Kelly, Jack Leiter and Nathan Eovaldi combined to allow just one run in 21 innings during the series.",
  "content": "ARLINGTON \u2014 They did what they needed to do.\n\nThe Texas Rangers completed a three-game sweep of the Cleveland Guardians, capped with a 4-0 win Sunday at Globe Life Field to leapfrog them in the American League Wild Card standings and remain in theoretical contention for a postseason berth.\n\nThe win \u2014 paced by right-hander Merrill Kelly\u2019s best start yet for the Rangers \u2014 clinched the club\u2019s first sweep since they won six-straight vs. the Athletics and Atlanta Braves between July 21-27. The Rangers, at .500 once again with a 66-66 record, still trail the Seattle Mariners for the final Wild Card berth by four games.\n\nKelly, whom the Rangers acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks for a trio of prospects, pitched seven scoreless innings to record his first win since the trade deadline. The Rangers had gone 1-3 in his Kelly\u2019s four starts despite the fact that he had allowed only two runs in three of them.\n\nHe held the Guardians to three hits \u2014 two singles in the second inning and one in the fifth \u2014 and struck out eight batters. Cleveland\u2019s Kyle Manzardo was the only batter to reach third base. He led the second inning off with a single and took third on a Brayan Rocchio single; Kelly stranded both on the corners when he struck Bo Naylor out on three pitches.\n\nKelly, right-hander Jack Leiter and right-hander Nathan Eovaldi combined to allow one run in 21 innings pitched vs. the Guardians this series. The three starters combined for 27 strikeouts, 10 hits and 2 walks.\n\nSunday was only the second time in Kelly\u2019s first five starts with the Rangers that he exited the game with a lead. First baseman Rowdy Tellez hit a two-run home run \u2014 his 15th this season and fourth as a Ranger \u2014 off of Cleveland right-hander Gavin Williams in the fifth inning to give Texas a 2-0 lead.\n\nThird baseman Josh Jung and second baseman Ezequiel Duran both followed with single and, with two outs in the fifth, center fielder Wyatt Langford scored both with a bloop single into shallow right field. It was Langford\u2019s 13th time on base in a five-game span and it gave the Rangers a 4-0 lead.\n\nDesignated hitter Joc Pederson gave the Rangers a 5-0 lead with a laser solo home run vs. Cleveland left-hander Erik Sabrowski in the bottom of the seventh inning. It was Pederson\u2019s first hit against a left-handed pitcher this season. He had been 0 for 5 prior but had a .545 OBP against them because of 6 walks in 11 plate appearances.\n\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nClick or tap here to sign up for our Rangers newsletter.",

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 OK, full disclosure, this story has a shelf life of, oh, less than 24 hours.\nSo we\u2019ll make this snappy.\nThat\u2019s sort of how Nathan Eovaldi has operated this season anyways.\nEovaldi, the Texas Rangers\u2019 ace, pitched seven innings of one-run ball in a walkoff 4-3 win vs. the Cleveland Guardians in the process. He retired 15 consecutive batters at one point, struck out nine, walked none and walked off the Globe Life Field mound with his team in a position to win.\nThe 35-year-old established himself as possibly the league\u2019s best statistical pitcher, too, in the process.\nEovaldi\u2019s 1.73 ERA is now the best among all qualified pitchers in baseball by nearly half of a run after he logged his 130th inning of the season in his team\u2019s 130th game. Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Paul Skenes\u2019 2.16 ERA is the only one that\u2019s even remotely close to Eovaldi\u2019s mark. Detroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal, with a 2.32 ERA, is the closest in the American League.\nA pitcher must have totaled at least one inning per team game to qualify for league leaderboards and, when the Rangers and Guardians start their game Saturday night, Eovaldi\u2019s time atop the leaderboard will expire until his next scheduled start vs. the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday.\nThat will likely remain the case for each start that he makes the remainder of this regular season. He\u2019ll likely remain atop the board, too, if he continues what has been one of the singular best seasons in club history.\n\u201cI go out there and I try to be able to go deep into the game,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cOur whole starting staff, our goal is to go out there and try to be as consistent as we can and have that success. To me, pitching wins championships, and we have a great pitching staff right now.\u201d\nHis 1.73 ERA is the eighth-lowest that any pitcher has logged in their first 22 starts during the Wild Card era. He entered Friday\u2019s game with a league-best 1.89 ERA in games started after a team loss this season and only lowered it when he largely silenced the club directly ahead of Texas in the AL Wild Card standings.\n\u201cNot just a great effort,\u201d Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said, \u201cbut a gutty effort by Nate. That\u2019s why we won the game.\u201d\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 This is the vision when you select a prodigious player with the second overall pick in a draft, give them a boatload of money and hope that they can one day develop into a frontline starter.\nThe Texas Rangers, in the midst of a playoff chase, were guided to a series win vs. a team they needed to beat by a Jack Leiter masterclass.\n\u201cThis was a fun \u2014 a really cool \u2014 outing,\" Leiter said. \u201cA fun game overall.\u201d\nLeiter pitched seven scoreless innings, allowed two hits, struck out a career-high 10 batters and walked none in a 10-0 win vs. the Cleveland Guardians Saturday night at Globe Life Field. He is one of four pitchers this season to allow zero runs, no walks and two or fewer hits in seven or more innings this season alongside Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal, St. Louis\u2019 Sonny Gray and Atlanta\u2019s Spencer Schwellenbach.\nThe win pulled Texas to within a half-game of the Guardians in the American League Wild Card standings. They can leapfrog them with a win Sunday afternoon. Leiter, who mowed down a team with the fourth-fewest strikeouts in the AL, helped make that possible.\n\u201cWow, he was good,\u201d Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said before he corrected himself. \u201cHe was outstanding.\u201d\nLeiter produced his career-best start with a mesh of his tantalizing stuff and the command and attack-based-mindset that has at times escaped him in his first full major league season.\nJack Leiter picked up strikeouts with four pitches tonight (FB, CV, SL and CH) but used the fastball for seven.\n\u2014 Shawn McFarland (@McFarland_Shawn) August 24, 2025\nWe didn\u2019t see the usual two-strike struggles. He had two 3-0 counts and turned both into outs. Really, really impressive stuff.\nThe issue that\u2019s held him up the most this season is a propensity to lose batters and struggle to win advantage counts. Saturday, though, he threw 65 of his 93 pitches for strikes, landed nearly 60 percent of his pitches in the strike zone and only issued three three-ball counts. Of the 15 two-strike counts he worked, 14 ended in outs, and he averaged just two pitches per at bat when he got to two strikes.\nHe pitched with the kind of pace that made a game in which Texas scored double digit runs last just a shade over two hours. Seven of his strikeouts came on a four-seam fastball that averaged 97 mph. His arsenal of secondary pitches, which he was able to land for 15 called strikes or whiffs, helped set the heater up.\n\u201cI think I definitely kind of learned something about myself from this one,\u201d said Leiter, whose 3.81 ERA is the 23rd best among all American League pitchers who\u2019ve thrown 110 or more innings this season. \u201cI was able to find that mental groove of just locking in on the target and just executing a pitch one at a time.\u201d\nLeiter, who lasted just 3 2/3 innings in his last game against the Kansas City Royals on Monday, worked with the team\u2019s coaching staff between starts to both rediscover a feel for his secondary pitches and to readjust his mentality and focus toward the plate vs. himself. He was encouraged to throw his curveball for power over precise location and, in turn, tossed it more than a mile per hour faster than his average and landed it for six called strikes.\nIt was a \u201csimplification of pitching,\u201d as Leiter described, and a commitment to the target instead of an attempted mental overhaul each time that he made a mistake pitch.\nThere weren\u2019t many on Saturday night.\n\u201cIt was on full display tonight,\u201d third baseman Josh Jung said. \u201cI can\u2019t rave enough about our starting pitchers, but Jack doing that tonight is huge.\u201d\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "SEATTLE \u2014 Kind of like their season, the Rangers got off to a slow start in the trading period, but have come on strong.\nIn the final two hours before Thursday\u2019s 5 p.m. CT deadline, the club agreed to a deal to bring Merrill Kelly to their rotation, two people with direct knowledge of the conversations told The Dallas Morning News. The deal will push the Rangers over the $241 million CBT threshold, which will trigger a 50% surcharge on the overage.\nThe return going back to Arizona for Kelly, who has about $2.3 million remaining of his $7 million contract, is hefty: LHP Kohl Drake, their closest-to-ready minor league starter, rising prospect David Hagaman and LHP Mitch Bratt. Drake was viewed as an insurance policy in case of injury in the rotation, but the addition of Kelly makes minor league depth, at least for this year, less of a concern.\nThe Rangers also acquired lefty Danny Coulombe from Minnesota for Class-A pitcher Garrett Horn. And they were still in the market for another leverage relief arm as the trading period entered its final hour.\nKelly, 36, is 9-6 this season with a 3.22 ERA in 22 starts. Since the start of May, however, Kelly has a 2.81 ERA and a nearly 4-to-1 strikeout-to-walk rate. The Rangers are betting big on starting pitching. Kelly would likely pitch third in any playoff rotation behind Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi, giving the Rangers one of the top starting trios in the postseason. If they get to the postseason.\nThe move would also give the Rangers a hedge against any possible issues with the rotation as deGrom, Jack Leiter and Kumar Rocker are all carrying heavier than usual workloads. It could conceivably also push either Leiter or Rocker into the bullpen to work as a leverage arm, further buttressing the relief group.\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "ARLINGTON \u2014 Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said Sunday morning that, despite the lack of overall results, he\u2019d seen better swings from left fielder Wyatt Langford as of late.\nHe might\u2019ve been looking into the future.\nLangford, stuck in a swing-happy scuffle for the last month, hit a bases-loaded double in the first inning to kickstart an offensive outburst that anchored a 8-1 sweep-clinching win vs. the Atlanta Braves Sunday at Globe Life Field.\nIt was the Rangers\u2019 sixth consecutive win, second consecutive series sweep and it secured an 8-1 record on a nine-game homestand with four days until the July 31 trade deadline.\nThe 23-year-old outfielder, who had just two hits in his previous nine games before Sunday, crushed a two-out, two-strike sinker from Braves right-handed starter Bryce Elder into deep left-center field to clear the bases and give the Rangers a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning. It was just his fifth extra-base hit of the month.\n\u201cLately, [I\u2019ve felt] probably not very good overall,\u201d Langford said. \u201cI felt pretty good today.\u201d\nWasting no time today! #AllForTX pic.twitter.com/ckdx34JCaM\n\u2014 Texas Rangers (@Rangers) July 27, 2025\nBochy acknowledged Sunday morning that he has considered whether or not to give Langford at least a day off to serve as a mental reset, but noted that he\u2019s \u201cpretty tough mentally.\u201d Langford has struck out 42 times and walked just 16 times in his last 30 games.\nSunday, though, Langford finished 2 for 3 with a double, a single, a walk and a run scored to record his first game with multiple hits since he had four against the Los Angeles Angels on July 11. He was one of five Rangers who reached base multiple times Sunday as the team finished the homestand with a plus-25 run differential vs. the Detroit Tigers, Athletics and Braves.\nThe Rangers scored twice in the second, courtesy of a two-run home run hit by first baseman Josh Smith, and added another three in the third on singles from third baseman Josh Jung (two runs scored) and catcher Jonah Heim (one run scored). Jung has now recorded a hit in each of the six games that he\u2019s played in since the Rangers recalled him from Triple-A Round Rock last Monday; Heim, who\u2019d been stuck in a skid, has now slashed .294/.333/.588 in his last seven games.\nJosh Smith with a two-run shot and the Rangers offense looks to be cooking again. \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udf73\n\u2014 SportsDay Rangers (@dmn_rangers) July 27, 2025\n5-1 Texas after two innings.\n(Via @Rangers | #AllForTX)pic.twitter.com/Z2n0u5o4Xi\nRight-handed starter Jack Leiter threw a career-high 100 pitches and matched his career high with seven strikeouts in six innings. He allowed one run in the second inning after back-to-back walks preceded a ground-rule double hit by Braves catcher Sean Murphy, but held Atlanta to a 1 for 15 line with just one after Murphy\u2019s double. He has a 3.48 ERA in his last six starts.\n\u201cI felt really good,\u201d Leiter said. \u201cPhysically, felt really good all day. That second inning was a little frustrating after we scored some runs. That\u2019s the last thing you want to do, walk a few guys to start the inning. I think the bright side is that could\u2019ve gone south.\u201d\nFind more Rangers coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

  "argos_summary": "The Texas Rangers completed a three\u2011game sweep of the Cleveland Guardians with a 4\u20110 victory, propelled by Merrill Kelly\u2019s seven scoreless innings and a 15\u2011run season. The win moved the Rangers to a .500 record and into a theoretical wild\u2011card spot, still four games behind the Seattle Mariners. Key offensive contributions came from Rowdy Tellez\u2019s two\u2011run homer, Wyatt Langford\u2019s two\u2011run double, and Joc Pederson\u2019s solo blast. The sweep solidified the Rangers\u2019 push for a postseason berth while maintaining their competitive stance in the American League Wild Card race.",
