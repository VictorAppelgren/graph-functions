Generate Key Takeaways\n\nWhile most Americans are used to shopping for food at large grocery store chains like Walmart and Target, those stores typically sell food in relatively small quantities, like a pound of meat or a dozen eggs. But what if you're a restaurant owner who needs to feed a 100-seat venue on a busy Saturday night? You won't find these business owners at the grocery store. In most cases, they're purchasing food through wholesalers, such as Restaurant Depot, or local purveyors, though there are exceptions when a grocery store can come in handy.\n\n\"If there's an emergency and you happen to be around the corner from the store to grab what you need in a pinch, then you do what you have to do. But that's really the only case that's acceptable,\" Eddie Fahmy, franchise director of D\u00f6ner Haus, shared in an exclusive conversation with Chowhound.
