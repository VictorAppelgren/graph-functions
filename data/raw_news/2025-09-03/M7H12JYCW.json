  "title": "Are Investors Undervaluing Materion Corporation (NYSE:MTRN) By 46%?",
  "description": "Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Materion fair value estimate is US$204 Current share price of...",
  "content": "\u2022 Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Materion fair value estimate is US$204\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 65% higher than Materion's analyst price target of US$124 Does the September share price for Materion Corporation (NYSE:MTRN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.2b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$2.9b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.2b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$110, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Materion as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\u2022 Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$325.9b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$161.83\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n11.9%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.38\n7D\n0.4%\n1Y\n26.0%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$60.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.74\n7D\n0.5%\n1Y\n24.0%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$54.6b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$180.15\n7D\n3.8%\n1Y\n3.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$53.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$240.86\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n31.7%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$48.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.62\n7D\n0.3%\n1Y\n-19.1%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$103.64\n7D\n1.5%\n1Y\n34.3%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.29\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n12.9%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.68\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n21.4%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.86\n7D\n-0.9%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$3.2b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$28.48\n7D\n14.7%\n1Y\n-14.7%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.8b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$35.39\n7D\n9.7%\n1Y\n63.2%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.7b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$31.00\n7D\n20.7%\n1Y\n48.5%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$576.7m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.60\n7D\n0.4%\n1Y\n-9.4%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$407.5m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.31\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-35.1%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$281.8m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$22.35\n7D\n7.7%\n1Y\n-39.5%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$75.7m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$3.80\n7D\n-9.1%\n1Y\n-3.2%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$35.2m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.80\n7D\n7.3%\n1Y\n-58.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$894.4k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0017\n7D\n13.3%\n1Y\n-72.6%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n0%"

  "argos_summary": "Materion Corporation (NYSE:MTRN) is trading at $110, while a 2\u2011stage DCF model values it at $204, implying a 46% discount to intrinsic value. Analysts maintain a 12\u2011month target of $124, only 12% above the current price, and the company\u2019s debt is deemed manageable with low dividend payout. Revenue growth is modest (\u22487% annually) but earnings are projected to accelerate at ~78% per year, suggesting upside potential if the market incorporates these fundamentals. Overall, the stock appears undervalued relative to both its fair value and peer valuations, though its high PE ratio (140x) signals caution for risk\u2011averse investors.",
