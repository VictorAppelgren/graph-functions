  "description": "The review will explore differences in pay, career progression, and pension contributions.",
  "content": "The University of Surrey has begun a major review into ethnicity pay gaps across the NHS in England. The review has been commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory, an independent body established by the health service. The 18-month long project will run until December 2026 and will explore differences in pay, career progression, pension contributions and overall earning potential of staff from different ethnic backgrounds. NHS Employers, which represents NHS England, said it \"welcomed the much-needed review\" and described it as \"crucial work\".\n\nAnnouncing the review, the university said it would be drawing on \"extensive expertise in workplace equity and pay structures\". Professor of human resource management at the university, Carol Woodhams, is co-leading the review with colleagues Dr Nicola Burton-Brown and Prof Giuseppe Moscelli, in partnership with leadership and inclusion consultancy Delta. Prof Woodhams said the team was \"proud to be leading this important work\". \"We've researched workplace pay gaps for many years, so we're pleased to support this vital review. \"It's a chance to uncover the root causes of ethnic disparities in NHS pay and progression, and to help drive meaningful, evidence-based change,\" she added.\n\nOwen Chinembiri, assistant director of workforce at the observatory, said: \"Black, Asian and ethnic minority staff continue to face hurdles when it comes to career progression in the NHS. \"Even though there have been some improvements over the past few years, this has been slow, patchy and frustrating for ethnic minority staff who have been impacted for far too long.\" He described tackling inequalities as \"an urgent matter\" and said research would\" identify areas with unwarranted gaps\" and \"come up with impactful recommendations\".\n\nHelga Pile from trade union UNISON, which represents many NHS employees, said: \"Almost one in three NHS staff in England are from black or ethnic minority backgrounds, but... there's clear evidence they're less likely than white colleagues to secure jobs with higher salaries, even after being shortlisted. \"Understanding all the root causes is essential to wiping out disadvantage.\" Its chief executive, Danny Mortimer, said it welcomed the review. He added: \"The delivery of a better NHS and a healthier nation requires the best use of all the talents in our workforce. \"We cannot jeopardise this by the presence of inequalities and racism in our workplaces.\" He said said ethnic pay gap reporting was not mandatory, although some trusts voluntarily reported on earnings. The final report, which is due in December 2026, will \"offer clear, actionable recommendations\", he added.",

But, while there is an average \u00a36 an hour pay gap, this drops significantly when excluding medical and dental staff.\nWhen those staff along with their Local Clinical Excellence Awards (LCEA), are excluded from the analysis, the gender pay gap disappears.\n\"The significant pay gap seen overall is primarily influenced by the medical workforce,\" the report reads.\n\"The Trust's annual LCEA scheme, which rewarded consultants for outstanding care, ended in 2020.\n\"Funds were then equally shared among all substantive consultants, regardless of hours worked.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Gloucestershire\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.
