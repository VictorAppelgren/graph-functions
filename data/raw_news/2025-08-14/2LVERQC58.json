  "description": "Joe Biden's youngest daughter shared and deleted a cryptic post aimed at her soon-to-be-ex husband on Sunday amid a divorce filing, reports claim.",
  "content": "Ashley Biden, former President Joe Biden's daughter, has filed for divorce after 13 years of marriage to plastic surgeon Dr. Howard Krein.\n\nThe filing came just hours after an Instagram story from her verified account appeared to be aimed at her husband, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe Instagram Story appeared on Sunday and was deleted shortly afterward. According to the New York Post, it featured a photo of a man and woman walking hand-in-hand, taken from behind, with the man wearing a short-sleeved, shirt and the woman in a strapless black dress.\n\nBiden\u2019s caption over the image reportedly read: \"My husband and his girlfriend holding hands.\"\n\n\n\nASHLEY BIDEN FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM HUSBAND, HOWARD KREIN, AFTER 13 YEARS OF MARRIAGE: REPORTS\n\nThe New York Post reported that the story had been accompanied by the Notorious B.I.G. song \"Another,\" featuring Lil\u2019 Kim. In the clip, Lil\u2019 Kim raps: \"What do you do when your man is untrue? Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Dr. Howard Krein for comment on the post and the divorce filing. Krein did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, other posts from Sunday included a video of Biden walking through a park, giving a thumbs-up to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \"Freedom,\" and a reposted quote over Lauryn Hill\u2019s \"Freedom Time\" reading: \"New life, new beginnings means new boundaries. New ways of being that won\u2019t look or sound like they did before.\"\n\nBiden filed for divorce in Philadelphia Family Court earlier this week. The filing states the marriage is \"irretrievably broken\" and requests spousal support while the divorce is pending, according to filings reviewed by Radar Online.\n\n\n\nASHLEY BIDEN SLAMS REPORTING ABOUT HER DAD'S MENTAL ACUITY AS 'DISRESPECTFUL AND UNTRUE'\n\nBiden and Krein married in 2012 in Greenville, Delaware, at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church. The ceremony blended her Catholic faith with his Jewish heritage, followed by a reception at the Biden family\u2019s lake house in Wilmington.\n\nAt the time, then\u2013Vice President Joe Biden praised his future son-in-law, telling People magazine: \"This is the right guy. And he\u2019s getting a helluva woman.\"\n\nAt the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Ashley Biden recalled her father\u2019s role in the wedding, saying, \"At the time, my dad was vice president, but he was also that dad who literally set up the entire reception. He was riding around in his John Deere 4-wheeler, fixing the place settings, arranging the plants, and by the way, he was very emotional.\"\n\n\"Before he walked me down the aisle, he turned to me and said he would always be my best friend. All these years later, Dad, you are still my best friend.\"\n\nKrein is a New Jersey-born otolaryngologist and plastic surgeon. He serves on the faculty at Thomas Jefferson University and is Chief Medical Officer at StartUp Health. He previously served on the Biden Cancer Initiative board (2017\u20132019) and informally advised Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign on COVID-19 policy.\n\nThe Instagram post went live Sunday, and the divorce filing came just hours later. All of the posts have since been deleted.\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to former President Biden and Ashley Biden for comment and had not heard back as of publication time. The Philadelphia Clerk of Family Court could not be reached for comment.",

      "text": "Key facts about former President Joe Biden: What to know\nJoe Biden served as the 46th president of the United States. Prior to his presidency, he served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. During his own presidency, the Biden-Harris administration prioritized issues such as climate change, Medicaid, infrastructure and LGBTQ+ initiatives.\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Biden ran as the original Democratic nominee. Following his first presidential debate with Donald Trump, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed his vice president at the time, Kamala Harris, for president. Harris lost the election, with many voters voicing concerns over immigration, border security and the economy as reasons for casting their votes for the Republican presidential candidate, President Donald Trump.\nAfter leaving office, Biden has largely kept to himself but has remained a topic of conversation in politics, mainly regarding his health, which was questioned throughout his presidency. Investigations and allegations of a cover-up regarding the truth of Biden\u2019s physical and mental well-being during his time in the White House have been brought forward.\nBiden\u2019s family has also been in the spotlight over the years, facing both tragedy and controversy. He lost his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and his daughter, Naomi Biden, in a car accident in 1972. He later married Jill Biden in 1977. In 2015, his son Beau Biden died after a battle with brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, has faced personal battles with addiction over the years and has been at the center of numerous legal investigations, including over the contents of his laptop. Before leaving office, Biden pardoned Hunter for crimes he \"has committed or may have committed.\u201d"
