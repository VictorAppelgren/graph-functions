  "content": "Deborra-Lee Furness is well and truly moving on following her split from ex-husband Hugh Jackman.\n\nThe Australian actress, 69, has been spending time with friends, and recently enjoyed a fun day out with her close pal and colleague Nicholas Evans, 45, who co-founded the Hopeland charity with her.\n\nNicholas was seen wrapping his arm around Deborra-Lee and tenderly embracing her as they chatted on the street.\n\nThe mother-of-two looked radiant in a bright, summery ensemble consisting of a pink patterned T-shirt, matching pants and white platform Converse sneakers.\n\nA source told this week's New Idea magazine that Deborra-Lee had turned to Nicholas for support following her split from Hugh, 56, in September 2023.\n\n'It's having long-terms friends like Nick rallying around her that's helping Deb get back on her feet,' they began.\n\nThe insider added while Deb and Nick were just friends, she was ready to date again and kept him close to protect her.\n\n'Getting a divorce has been a huge life adjustment and now Deb's a very rich and single lady, she's making sure she's got a solid network watching her back,' they said.\n\n'Deb is ready. She needs friends like Nick by her side to make sure she is not headed for more heartache.'\n\nThe pair have known each other since 2014, when they established Hopeland together, a charity that supports disadvantaged children.\n\nDeborra-Lee is said to be back in the dating game after finalising her divorce with Hugh in June.\n\nShe is reportedly courting offers from potential suitors - but is holding back until she can find a partner who meets her high standards.\n\n'Deb is finally starting to heal and talk about what she wants in her life going forward,' an insider told Woman's Day magazine.\n\n'She's got an incredible support system that's been there every step of the way, helping her to pick up the pieces of her life. They are encouraging her to start dating again.'\n\nThey added she had received offers from some 'incredible guys' but was waiting for the perfect match.\n\nIn June, Deborra-Lee and Hugh finalised their divorce a month after filing, Daily Mail exclusively revealed.\n\nA judgment of divorce was filed on June 12, making it official. The document, however, wasn't made public until June 23.\n\nPrior to the judgment being entered, two other documents were filed on June 10 - a 'Qualified Medical Child Support Order', regarding children's insurance, and 'Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law.'\n\nThe divorce was essentially disposed of some time ago, but the judge needed to sign off on the judgment after a proposed judgment was entered.\n\nDeborra-Lee, who has two adopted children with the Wolverine actor, has received a 'spousal support payment,' according to an insider, who previously spoke to Daily Mail.\n\nIn May, Daily Mail exclusively broke the news of the former couple filing for divorce to officially terminate their 27-year marriage.\n\nShortly after news broke of the exes' divorce filing, she shocked fans by releasing a statement using the word 'betrayal' when speaking about her 'traumatic journey'.\n\nHugh has been dating his former The Music Man co-star Sutton Foster for months, although the timeline of when they began dating has never been confirmed.\n\nThe pair are said to be ignoring any negative talk about their romance - which some fans believed started as an affair while he was still married - and are 'looking to move forward' with their relationship.\n\nA source previously claimed to Daily Mail that while Hugh 'didn't physically cheat' on his ex-wife, the 69-year-old believes they were having 'an emotional affair' and 'feels he betrayed her.'",

Deborra-Lee Furness cuts a stylish figure in Venice\nSutton Foster raised eyebrows when her romance with Hugh Jackman was made public, but the controversy hasn't proved destructive, with the actress close to selling out her solo tour.\nHer successful ticket sales are in stark contrast to Jackman, 56, who suffered a humiliating blow to his solo Radio City Music Hall show - with ticket prices dropping to as little as $20.\nThe Younger alum's first show for her 'Sutton in Concert' tour (with Kelli O'Hara in select dates) took place in Chicago on Sunday as part of the outdoor music festival, Ravinia. The tour continues on July 18 in Lenox, Massachusetts, and then Westhampton Beach, New York, on July 19.\nBut, it's already sold out. And, there are also only a handful of tickets left for her upcoming shows in Park City, Utah; York, Pennsylvania and Germantown, Tennessee.\nSafe to say, fans of Foster should get their tickets soon - even for shows that are four months from now - before they sell out altogether.\nJackman, for his part, returns to Radio City Music Hall on July 18 and 19 - and then again a month later - with tickets on resale sites like StubHub still selling for as low as $20 to $32, depending on the section in the theatre.\nSutton Foster raised eyebrows when her romance with Hugh Jackman was made public, but the controversy hasn't proved destructive, with the actress close to selling out her solo tour\nHer successful ticket sales are in stark contrast to Jackman, 56, who suffered a humiliating blow to his solo Radio City Music Hall show - with ticket prices dropping to as little as $20\nBut the pair are ignoring any negative talk about their romance - which some fans believed started as an affair while he was still married to Deborra-Lee Furness - and are 'looking to move forward' with their relationship.\nA source previously claimed to Daily Mail that while Jackman 'didn't physically cheat' on his ex-wife, the 69-year-old believes they were having 'an emotional affair' and 'feels he betrayed her.'\nThe Australian actress finally filed for divorce in May, two years after they announced their shock separation. It was finalized on June 23.\nAlthough Foster and Jackman haven't been spotted together in public since May - when they were seen holding hands in New York City - a source told Daily Mail that they are 'very happy right now.'\n'They are looking to move forward while everyone else focuses on going backward and rehashing the past,' the source said.\n'Sutton is very much in love with Hugh and is very happy to be together with him, even with people chirping about her divorce and his divorce and how they got together and any other so-called \"controversy\".\n'Her life has led her to Hugh, and she couldn't be happier, and he is equally in love.'\nFoster has yet to finalize her divorce from estranged husband Ted Griffin. The couple had been married for nearly 10 years when she filed for divorce in October 2024.\nTickets to the Younger alum's 'Sutton in Concert' tour are nearly sold out - with some performance venues already sold out, Daily Mail can reveal (pictured with singer Kelli O'Hara, who will performing with her in select cities)\nHugh, who returns to Radio City Music Hall on July 18, continues to have tickets for his solo show being sold on websites, such as StubHub, for $20\nDaily Mail can reveal that there have been no new updates since Foster and her lawyer filed a response in December. The response was to Griffin's answer to her divorce complaint, in which he also filed a counterclaim - a lawsuit against her.\nThe source told Daily Mail that Foster and Jackman are staying 'far away from the noise as possible' and choosing to 'only deal with drama in their art.'\nThey explained: 'It is easy to get caught up with it all as emotions are high, but they are such a solid unit that they have been able to be a team and not worry about it... because they just don't want to welcome any unwanted or needed drama.'\n'They want to be happy, and that is what they are, very happy right now,' the source added. 'No more tears. They are chasing smiles and happiness.'\nDaily Mail has reached out to Foster and Jackman's reps for comment.\nFoster's close friend Michael Urie, previously opened up about her new romance, insisting she is 'happy' with the Wolverine actor.\n'They seem great. I love him. He's cool. He's very cool. He came around and saw the show,' Michael revealed, when speaking about his 2024 Broadway play with Foster at the Drama Desk Awards.\nJackman and Foster's relationship was confirmed in January, with reports at the time claiming the Music Man co-stars had been dating for months, although the timeline has never been confirmed.\nBut the pair are ignoring any negative talk about their romance and are 'looking to move forward' with their relationship\n'They want to be happy, and that is what they are, very happy right now,' the source added. 'No more tears. They are chasing smiles and happiness'\nJackman's ex Deborra-Lee Furness filed for divorce in May, two years after they separated. It was finalized on June 23 - although the court documents are not public\nFurness, who has remained silent for the most part, shocked fans when she released a statement about her 'traumatic journey' and hinted at 'betrayal' in her marriage to Jackman.\n'My heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,' she wrote.\nShe continued, 'This belief has helped me navigate the breakdown of an almost three-decade marriage. I have gained much knowledge and wisdom through this experience. Even when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose.'\nWhile Furness splits her time between her native country Australia and New York City, it is rumored that Foster has moved into her marital home - a $21 million penthouse in New York's Chelsea district.\nFurness was seen in good spirits in Italy last month as she attended the lavish wedding of Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos.\nAccording to photos obtained by Daily Mail, the film producer appeared to be having a lovely time as she boarded a water taxi to head to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, wearing a conservative black gown with sheer shoulder panels.\nA source previously revealed to Daily Mail that Furness 'has gotten offers to go out [on dates] and honestly, she is just not interested in this right now.'\nDespite the offers and her friends trying to set her up, the insider said dating 'is just not for her' at the moment. She 'never thought in a million years' she would be 'at this stage in her life'...single and no longer with her 'life-long companion.'"

'It\u2019s a profound wound that cuts deep, however I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us.'\nShe continued, 'This belief has helped me navigate the breakdown of an almost three-decade marriage. I have gained much knowledge and wisdom through this experience. Even when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose.\n'It can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom.'\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail\u2019s new showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop.\nDeborra-Lee Furness took a swipe at her estranged husband, Hugh Jackman, amid the flurry of rumors that he cheated on her with his current girlfriend Sutton Foster\nShe concluded her statement with the 'one thing' that she has learned, which is 'that none of this is personal,' adding, 'We are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random.\n'We are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognize and heal the broken parts of ourselves...I remain grateful.'\nBack in January, DailyMail.com exclusively reported that the estranged spouses had yet to file as their decision to dismiss a prenup was proving to be a point of contention.\nInsiders at the time claimed that their split could get \u2018messy\u2019 as they were struggling to divvy up their estimated $250 million fortune.\n\u2018One of the biggest reasons why they haven\u2019t yet filed is that they never had a prenup,\u2019 an insider close to Jackman said.\n\u2018When they got married, they thought it would be forever. Who doesn\u2019t? At the time, neither of them expected Hugh\u2019s career to get as enormous as it has.\n\u2018Because there was no prenup, and he made a fortune during their marriage, this divorce is not going to be cut and dry. It may even get messy because the stakes are high. A lot of moving parts need to be worked out and there is a huge amount of money involved.'\nThe insider insisted they both wanted to \u2018make this as easy as possible,\u2019 but that after three decades and one partner becoming a massive A-list star, \u2018it\u2019s not quite that easy.\u2019\nFollowing her decision to officially file for divorce from Deadpool & Wolverine star, 56, two years after announcing their separation, the Australian actress, 69, addressed her heartbreak in an exclusive statement to DailyMail.com (pictured in 1999)\n'My heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,' she said.

'Deborra-Lee feels entitled to more money than Hugh is willing to offer.'\nHer insistence on getting a bigger chunk of their estimated fortune was said to be fueled by the murky origins of his romance with Foster.\n'While he didn't physically cheat on her with Sutton, Deborra-Lee believes they were having an emotional affair and she feels he betrayed her,' the source continued.\nTheir marriage started to fall apart during Covid, as previously reported by DailyMail.com, around the same time that Jackman struck up a friendship with Foster, his costar on the 2022 Broadway revival of The Music Man. She was married to Ted Griffin at the time (Griffin and Foster are also in the midst of finalizing their divorce).\nThe couple were married for 27 years; seen in 2022\nFurness and Jackman announced the end of their marriage in a shock statement in September 2023, telling fans that they were 'shifting' and as a result had decided to 'separate to pursue our individual growth.'\nSoon followed rumblings that Jackman had struck up a relationship with Foster, with the pair finally confirming their romance in January in what fans claimed was a staged picture opportunity as they left a Los Angeles restaurant hand-in-hand.\nFurness and Jackman met back in 1995 on Australian TV show Correlli, when she was a major star, and he was enjoying his first role fresh out of drama school.\nHe proposed four months later, telling Today in 2018 that he knew two weeks into meeting Furness that they were \u2018going to be together for the rest of our lives.\u2019\nJackman went public with his new girlfriend, Sutton Foster (right), in January after months of speculation (pictured together in 2022)\nThey were married in Melbourne, Australia, in April 1996 before adopting their son Oscar, now 24, in 2000. Five years later they completed their family unit when they adopted daughter Ava, 19.\nSince tying the knot, Jackman has amassed an eye watering fortune, estimated to be around $200 million, thanks to his turn as Wolverine in Marvel's blockbuster comic book franchise.\nHe retired the role in Logan in 2017 before reprising the character - and hijacking the box office - last year with Deadpool and Wolverine alongside his close friend Ryan Reynolds.\nHe's currently performing in an off-Broadway play, Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes, alongside Ella Beatty, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening's daughter.\nThe actor swears liberally, speaks graphically about sex and engages in multiple steamy make-out sessions with his 25-year-old co-star."

'Now that's fine, I don't need to be in every scene in the movie.\n'But Ryan is a writer,' the X-Men star continues. 'And when I see the script, I see that the scene that I'm not in is the opening sequence...I'm like, the one scene I'm not in has dance. Now Ryan, he's very talented, but dancing?'\nJoined by his trainer, Beth Lewis, and his other dancers, he then proceeds to perform 'the dance that got away' - a choreographed jump rope routine to NSYNC's hit and the movie's opening number, Bye Bye Bye.\nIn-between his performances for Radio City Music Hall, Jackman continues to perform a two-man show with Ella Beatty, the 25-year-old daughter of Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, who plays his lover in the play.\nReviews of 'Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes' and talk about the actors' steamy kisses appear to be a big draw for theater-goers.

'Both are coming out of this financially secure.'\nWhile they figure out what to do with the rest of their $387 million fortune, the exes have at least decided to split their $24 million Manhattan property down the middle.\nEarlier this month, on June 2, Jackman and Furness filed records with the city regarding their shares of their former love nest. This marks the first public sign of their asset division.\nThe three-bedroom and 3.5-bathroom penthouse, which the couple purchased together back in 2022 for $21.12 million, had not been listed for sale but underwent a property transfer.\nFurness shocked fans by releasing a statement about 'betrayal' shortly after news broke about their divorce, referring to it as a 'traumatic journey.'\nJackman and Furness announced their separation after 27 years of marriage nearly two years ago. Now, the couple is close to finalizing their divorce after ironing things out before filing\nIn a statement sent to DailyMail.com, Furness said, 'My heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal.
