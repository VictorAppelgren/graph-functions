  "title": "Republicans draw a roadmap to change more US House seats outside of Texas",
  "description": "National Republicans are ramping up their efforts to squeeze out more GOP-friendly congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections outside of the five seats they hope to gain in Texas.",
  "content": "National Republicans are ramping up their efforts to squeeze more GOP-friendly congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections outside of the five seats they hope to gain in Texas.\n\nAllies of President Donald Trump have called on state leaders in Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina and Missouri to target the handful of Democratic districts remaining in the states. In Florida, Republicans took a first step toward as possible mid-cycle redistricting by launching a House committee to examine the issue. Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana on Thursday to meet with the state\u2019s Republican leaders.\n\nThe push to pick off those remaining seats marks the latest phase in a redistricting arms race sparked by Trump, who is taking extraordinary measures in hopes of stopping Democrats from winning back the House next year.\n\nThe effort is also the latest test of Trump\u2019s ability to persuade state and federal lawmakers to enact his agenda even at their own expense.\n\nGOP state lawmakers have several reasons to resist drawing new maps, from the additional costs of holding special sessions to the fact that new maps would change the districts of incumbent Republicans, potentially making them more competitive and undermining Trump\u2019s goal for the midterms. Efforts to target some seats could also draw legal challenges, including potential violations of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn some cases, Republican legislatures already considered more partisan maps during the traditional once-a-decade redistricting cycle but opted against them.\n\nRepublicans control the governorship and legislatures in 23 states \u2013 compared to just 15 held by Democrats \u2013 giving them a longer list of maps to target. But in several states, Republicans have already successfully left Democrats few, if any, seats.\n\nHere\u2019s where the president and his allies are seeking to gain additional seats.\n\nOutside of Texas, Ohio represents Republicans\u2019 best chance of gaining additional seats. Under state law, Ohio must approve a new congressional map by November 30 because the current lines drawn by Republicans passed without any Democratic support.\n\nRepublicans could gain an additional two to three seats in the state by targeting Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Emilia Sykes and Greg Landsman, according to an analysis by the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Democrats currently hold five of the state\u2019s 15 House seats.\n\nBut the process isn\u2019t clear-cut. Under rules backed by voters in 2018, Republicans must first attempt to pass a map with bipartisan support. If Republicans end up passing a map along party lines, Democrats could potentially ask voters to strike the map down via a statewide referendum.\n\nRepublicans are hoping to flip one, possibly two, districts in Indiana, where the party currently holds seven of the state\u2019s nine House seats. A new map would likely target Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan, who represents the state\u2019s northwest corner, or, potentially, Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, who represents much of Indianapolis.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Braun and GOP legislative leaders have expressed limited interest in redistricting, partly due to the costs of holding a special session as well as concerns of undermining Republican incumbents.\n\n\u201cYou can spread out your Republican vote a little too thin so that every few cycles, seats are going back and forth,\u201d Indiana Sen. Todd Young told Punchbowl News last month. \u201cAnd that can sort of cut both ways.\u201d\n\nBraun remained noncommittal after the meeting with Vance.\n\n\u201cWe listened,\u201d Braun said when asked if state officials and the vice president reached a consensus, according to the Indianapolis Star.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican who recently launched a campaign for governor, has called on state lawmakers to draw maps that would give the GOP all seven seats in the state. That would come at the expense of longtime Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state\u2019s lone Democratic member of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe have Republican supermajorities in South Carolina. Let\u2019s use them to create more competition in our congressional seats,\u201d Norman told Fox News. \u201cI have no doubt Republicans can be successful in every part of our state.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Nancy Mace, who is also running for governor, disagreed.\n\n\u201cI think our lines are good,\u201d Mace told reporters ahead of an event in Myrtle Beach Wednesday. \u201cWe did a great job.\u201d\n\nDemocrats would almost certainly challenge any efforts to dismantle Clyburn\u2019s seat \u2013 the only majority-Black district in the state \u2013 as a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nMissouri\u2019s Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe told reporters Tuesday that he would work with state leaders to \u201csee if there\u2019s a path\u201d to redrawing the state\u2019s congressional map.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the House in Republican control,\u201d he said, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\nRepublicans control six of the state\u2019s eight districts. A new map would likely target Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver\u2019s Kansas City seat. Cleaver has vowed to challenge any new map targeting his seat in court.\n\nTrump allies have been lobbying leaders in the state. Republican Rep. Eric Burlison told the Star last month that he spoke with a member of the Trump campaign who said the Cleaver seat was a missed opportunity during the last redistricting cycle. Missouri House Speaker Chad Perkins said White House staff reached out to him after he told a local outlet that mid-cycle redistricting would be \u201cout of character with the way\u201d the state operates.\n\n\u201cThey said \u2018Well, we\u2019re really going to try to do that,\u2019 and that might change the dynamic of it,\u201d Perkins told the Missouri Independent last month.\n\nRepublicans already hold all three seats in Nebraska but lawmakers could redraw the map to make the state\u2019s swingy 2nd District less competitive. US Rep. Don Bacon, who announced in June he won\u2019t seek reelection to the seat next year, told the Nebraska Examiner that there have been conversations about redrawing the maps, but \u201cnothing serious.\u201d\n\nFlorida House Speaker Daniel Perez sent a memo to lawmakers Thursday announcing the launch of a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting, marking the first concrete step towards redrawing the state\u2019s US House maps off-cycle.\n\nThe Select Committee comes a month after the state Supreme Court upheld the 2022 congressional map drawn by Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office. Opponents said the map violated the state constitution\u2019s \u201cFair Districts\u201d provision, which prohibits lawmakers from favoring one party or diminishing the political power of minorities, by dismantling a majority-Black seat. The state Supreme Court ruled that the district was a racial gerrymander that violated equal protection rights under the US Constitution, an interpretation that weakened the \u201cFair Districts\u201d rule.\n\nThe select committee Perez created will further examine how lawmakers should view the provision.\n\n\u201cExploring these questions now, at the mid-decade point, would potentially allow us to seek legal guidance from our supreme court without the uncertainty associated with deferring those questions until after the next decennial census and reapportionment,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nRepublicans currently hold 20 of the state\u2019s 28 House seats. Five of the state\u2019s eight Democrats won their 2024 races with less than 60% of the vote: Reps. Darren Soto, Kathy Castor, Lois Frankel, Jared Moskowitz and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., is calling on his state to join the growing fight over the country's congressional maps \u2013 with eyes on the one Democrat in his delegation.\nNorman told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that he wants the South Carolina General Assembly to redraw its district lines, which he argued is more in line with the Palmetto State's Republican majorities in the statehouse and state Senate.\n\"We have Republican supermajorities in South Carolina. Let's use them to create more competition in our congressional seats. I have no doubt Republicans can be successful in every part of our state,\" Norman said.\nNorman, who is running for governor, said that would make South Carolina's seats in the House of Representatives \"more competitive\" and that it would \"move our House delegation from 6-1 to 7-0.\"\n\"That will help increase Republican control of Congress and help President Trump pass his agenda. Every vote counts toward a conservative Speaker Mike Johnson rather than a liberal Speaker Hakeem Jeffries of New York City,\" Norman said.\nAnd while he did not give further details about how he'd want that map to look, he did mention the lone Democrat, longtime Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., by name.\n\"Jim Clyburn is a nice man and I respect him. But he is a liberal Democrat who helped put Joe Biden in the White House,\" Norman said. \"That's not the kind of representation South Carolina needs.\"\nClyburn is indeed a close ally of former President Joe Biden. His support was critical to Biden winning the 2020 Democratic primary in South Carolina, a victory that was decisive in putting Biden at the front of the crowded race.\nHe's also represented South Carolina's 6th congressional district since 1993.\nSCHWARZENEGGER PUSHES BACK AGAINST NEWSOM IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT\nThe 6th congressional district was first gerrymandered to give Black South Carolinians greater representation in the early 1990s, resulting in the only majority-Black district in the state.\nSouth Carolina's congressional map has seen some partisan fighting in recent years, however.\nIn 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said a Republican-led redraw of district lines unfairly diluted Black voters' power, primarily in South Carolina's 1st congressional district, which neighbors Clyburn's.\nThe high court's conservative majority ruled 6-3 that the district was redrawn along partisan lines, rather than racial, and therefore could be legally upheld.\nRedistricting is traditionally done following the U.S. census, which is taken every decade, to account for population shifts in various states.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNorman's call to redraw the lines again comes after Texas Republicans' push to create a new congressional map that would give the GOP as many as five new seats in the House of Representatives.\nIt's ignited a political firestorm across the country, with liberal states like New York and California pledging to follow suit.\nThere are now discussions in multiple states about potentially redrawing district lines as well.\nFox News Digital reached out to Clyburn's campaign for comment, as well as representatives in the South Carolina General Assembly."

      "text": "Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s narrow House majority has shrunk further.\nGOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee has officially resigned from the House, bringing the partisan breakdown to 219 Republicans, 212 Democrats and four vacant seats. Johnson can only afford to lose three Republicans in any party-line votes on the floor.\nGreen, the former House Homeland Security Committee chair, had announced he would leave Congress after the chamber voted to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy bill.\nAt the start of the 119th Congress, Johnson was already facing the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. The tight margin has created a major challenge for congressional Republicans as they seek to enact Trump\u2019s legislative priorities, leaving little room for error.\nRepublicans won 220 House seats in the November elections, while Democrats won 215, the most narrowly divided House majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago.\nAt the start of the new session of Congress, however, the partisan breakdown stood at 219 to 215, because former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida opted not to return to Congress.\nPassing a bill in the House requires a majority of all members present and voting. The magic number is 218 if every member shows up to vote and all 435 seats are filled, but that can change if there are vacancies or absences. A tie vote in the House is a fail.\nHow the House majority ranks in history\nThe last time a minority in the House held 215 or more seats was after the 1930 elections, when Republicans won 218 seats, Democrats won 216 and the Farmer-Labor Party won one.\nThe 72nd Congress \u2014 which took place in the early years of the Great Depression era \u2014 officially started in March 1931, but did not actually convene to conduct legislative business until months later, in December 1931.\nAt the official start of that term, in March, the House margin had narrowed even further \u2014 to 217 seats for Republicans to 216 for Democrats with one seat for the Farmer-Labor party and one vacancy as a result of the death of one Republican.\nIn an unusual turn of events, however, the partisan breakdown changed significantly by the time Congress convened when a series of additional deaths and ensuing special elections flipped control of the chamber to Democrats, though the margin remained narrow.\nAccording to House historical records, the 65th Congress had the closest party split in American history, but in that case, the partisan division was so narrow that neither party secured an outright majority in the House based on election results, which left Republicans with 215 seats and Democrats with 214. As a result, a handful of third-party lawmakers played a decisive role when the House convened to elect a speaker.\nChallenges ahead after speaker election\nJohnson won the speakership in a nail-biter of a vote at the start of the 119th Congress, a sign of the difficulty of overseeing such a narrow majority.\nTo be elected speaker, a candidate needs to win a majority of members who vote for a specific person on the House floor.\nThe election took place with the majority at 219 to 215, which meant that Johnson could only lose a single Republican vote if every lawmaker voted and all Democrats voted against him.\nNow, Johnson has a bit more breathing room and congressional Republicans have gone on to pass major legislation \u2013 most notably Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending cuts package in July \u2013 but not without challenges.\nGOP leaders lost two Republican votes on final passage in the House. Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted alongside Democrats against the measure.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nHaley Talbot and CNN\u2019s Zach Wolf contributed to this report."

      "text": "A few weeks ago, Republican election officials in Colorado began receiving unsolicited calls and texts from a GOP consultant who said he was working with the Trump administration on \u201celection integrity.\u201d\nIn a text to one of the officials, the consultant, Jeff Small, indicated he was acting on a request from Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. In a phone call with another clerk, Small said he was coordinating with the White House and the Justice Department to \u201cimplement\u201d an elections executive order signed by President Donald Trump, recalled Justin Grantham, the top election official in Fremont County.\nGrantham and Carly Koppes, who oversees elections in Weld County in northern Colorado, told CNN that Small made a specific request: Would they give a third party access to their election equipment?\nBoth declined.\n\u201cNot only is that a hard no, I mean, you\u2019re not even going to breathe on my equipment,\u201d Koppes said.\nThe outreach to the Colorado clerks is just one of a flurry of recent federal actions launched by the Trump administration and groups aligned with the president.\nWhile the White House distanced itself from Small, Trump and his allies are collecting vast amounts of voter data and working to change the ground rules for next year\u2019s midterms, often by invoking federal government authority.\nNext year\u2019s midterms hold enormous stakes for Trump and his opposition. Democrats need to net just three seats in the US House in 2026 to flip control of the chamber from Republicans. A Democratic-led House could block Trump\u2019s legislative agenda and launch investigations of the president in the second half of his second term.\nSamantha Tarazi, CEO of the nonprofit Voting Rights Lab, which has closely tracked state developments, said she believes Trump is gearing up \u201cto use the power of his office to interfere in the 2026 election.\u201d\n\u201cWhat started as an unconstitutional executive order \u2014 marching orders for state action regardless of its fate in court \u2014 has grown into a full federal mobilization to seize power over our elections,\u201d she said.\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Trump is \u201cfighting for election integrity\u201d and will keep doing so \u201cdespite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship.\u201d\n\u201cFree and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we\u2019re confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom,\u201d he said in an email.\nAggressive moves to remake the board\nRestricting who can access election machines and sensitive voting software has grown even more important to election officials in recent years following voting system breaches in states such as Colorado and Georgia. Trump allies had sought access to machines to find evidence that could back up the president\u2019s claim that widespread fraud marred the 2020 election.\nBut election watchdogs and some Democratic election officials say activity by Trump and aligned groups since his return to the White House has raised fears of a broader effort to reshape elections.\nRecent actions by the administration and its allies include:\n- Trump signing an executive order in March that sought to force states to require proof of citizenship to register to vote and take \u201cenforcement action\u201d against states that accept mail ballots after Election Day. Federal judges have blocked parts of the executive order, noting that the power to regulate elections rests with the states and Congress, not the president.\n- The Republican National Committee pushing to obtain voter registration records from states. On the day Trump signed the executive order, the RNC sent records requests to 48 states and Washington, DC, seeking information on how they maintain voter registration lists. And the RNC has sued New Jersey \u2013 home to a closely watched gubernatorial race this fall \u2013 alleging officials there have failed to respond to its requests for voter data and documents related to voting machine audits. A spokesperson for New Jersey\u2019s elections division declined to comment on the litigation.\n- The Justice Department asking more than a dozen states in recent weeks to provide voter lists, explain their procedures for removing potential ineligible voters from their rolls or discuss entering into information-sharing agreements to help the agency root out election fraud. The demands range from seeking copies of voting rolls in political battlegrounds such as Michigan to a broad request in Colorado to provide election records as far back as 2020.\n- Republicans in Texas undertaking a rare mid-decade redistricting, following entreaties from Trump. A map released Wednesday by GOP lawmakers who control the state legislature aims to take over five additional Democratic seats, which would to give the GOP the edge in 30 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts.\n- The Republican-controlled House in April approving the SAVE Act, which mirrors parts of Trump\u2019s executive order requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. The proposed legislation also would make it a crime for election officials to mistakenly register someone to vote who has not provided proof of citizenship. Critics note that it\u2019s already illegal for noncitizens to cast ballots in federal elections and say requiring proof of citizenship could disenfranchise eligible voters who lack the needed documents or changed their name through marriage.\nTo justify the redistricting in his state, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott cited a letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, that challenged the legality of four existing congressional districts.\nDhillon said in a statement: \u201cClean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections.\u201d\nShe said the agency \u201chas a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.\u201d\nTrump has been blunt about his partisan goals in Texas, and he has suggested that other GOP-controlled states should pursue their own redistricting efforts \u2013 a move that threatens to set off an all-out redistricting war this year with Democrats in California and other Democrat-led states.\nThe administration\u2019s recent actions have unsettled some election officials, who have endured years of threats and harassment following the 2020 election and the conspiracy theories about election fraud that flourished in its aftermath.\nElection officials \u201care surfing on quicksand,\u201d said David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research and a former DOJ voting rights attorney.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what the executive order means, if it has any meaning whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they will be investigated just for having done their jobs. They don\u2019t know if the vast power of the federal government is going to be weaponized against them. They don\u2019t know if the Department of Justice is going to be suing them.\u201d\nA recent survey of 858 local election officials by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s Law School bears that out. It found more than half of local election officials \u2013 59% \u2013 say they are concerned about political leaders engaging in efforts to interfere with how election officials do their jobs. And 46% said they were concerned about politically motivated investigations of their work or that of their fellow election officials.\nThe fight over voting machines in Colorado\nIn early July, as previously reported by The Washington Post and media outlets in Colorado, Republican election clerks began receiving calls and texts from Small. Small, who has worked for Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert and for the US Interior Department during Trump\u2019s first term, now is a principal with a Denver public affairs firm.\nCounty officials interviewed by CNN said Small told them he was reaching out specifically to Republican clerks in blue states in a push to help advance Trump\u2019s executive order.\nGrantham, the election clerk in Fremont County, said Small\u2019s outreach to only Republican officials was an early red flag during their conversation. Another concern arose, he said, when Small mentioned gaining access to the county\u2019s election equipment.\n\u201cMy response was, \u2018I didn\u2019t believe that the president had the authority in the Constitution to write executive orders to affect elections and that until the Supreme Court found that he could, I would not let anybody access my voting equipment.\u201d\nCNN reached out to Small, and his attorney, Suzanne Taheri, responded to CNN\u2019s inquiry. In a text, Taheri said Small\u2019s outreach \u201csupported efforts by allies in the administration to encourage officials to participate in President Trump\u2019s election security executive order.\u201d\nHe undertook the activity \u201con a volunteer basis, during his own free time, while on paternity leave,\u201d she added. Neither Small nor Taheri answered questions about who exactly in the administration asked him to contact the clerks.\nThe White House distanced itself from Small\u2019s actions in a statement.\n\u201cJeff Small does not speak for the White House nor was he ever authorized to do official business on behalf of the White House,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in an email to CNN.\nMiller did not respond to CNN requests for comment.\nThe impact on local election officials\nIn Colorado, election officials say, there is heightened sensitivity around who can access election equipment, after the high-profile prosecution of former Mesa County elections clerk, Tina Peters. She became a celebrity among pro-Trump activists who have advanced false claims that voting machines had been rigged to flip votes from Trump to then-candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\nMany state laws set strict security standards for voting machines to prevent tampering with elections. Colorado has specifically barred third parties from accessing election equipment.\nLast year, a judge sentenced Peters to nine years in prison after she was convicted on state charges for her role in a breach of her county\u2019s election system as part of an unsuccessful hunt for fraud.\nTrump and his administration have taken up Peters\u2019 cause, however.\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department said it was reviewing her case as part of a broad mandate from Trump to counter prosecutions it said were aimed at \u201cinflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice.\u201d\nAnd in a social media post in May, the president weighed in personally, calling Peters an \u201cinnocent Political Prisoner\u201d and directing the Justice Department to \u201cto take all necessary action to help secure\u201d her release.\nColorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold told CNN that her office has provided recent voter data to the Justice Department that\u2019s generally available to the public.\nBut she said she declined to comply with a request related to records from the 2020 election because the federal government has no \u201clegal basis\u201d to seek it. Federal law only requires the preservation of election data in federal races for 22 months.\nGriswold, a Democrat, said Trump\u2019s recent actions demonstrate the president \u201cis using the power of the federal government to undermine American elections and undermine voter confidence in them.\u201d\nIn Colorado, a state Trump lost in all three of his White House bids, tensions over election administration remain high.\nKoppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County, said she faced so many threats for her outspoken defense of the 2020 election results \u2013 and her county\u2019s use of Dominion Voting machines \u2013 that she began to vary her routes to and from work, a practice she continues today.\nCrane, the head of the clerk\u2019s association, said it took a \u201clot of courage\u201d for county clerks to rebuff the recent overtures, given the climate of suspicion and harassment that still persists. He noted that an elections office in southern Colorado housing Dominion machines was firebombed recently. No one was injured in the after-hours incident.\n\u201cThe threats against election officials are very real,\u201d he added."

      "text": "Vice President JD Vance met Thursday with Gov. Mike Braun and state legislative leaders as the White House ramps up pressure on Republican-led states to redraw their congressional maps.\nBut Indiana\u2019s GOP leaders didn\u2019t commit to giving President Donald Trump\u2019s administration what it wants: a mid-decade effort to turn the two Democratic-held House seats in the Hoosier State into right-leaning districts.\nBraun was noncommittal, telling reporters that \u201cwe listened\u201d and describing the conversation as \u201cpretty good.\u201d Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston said in a statement they\u2019d had a \u201cmeaningful discussion\u201d and will \u201ccontinue conversations.\u201d Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said he \u201cappreciated the opportunity to hear from the vice president on a variety of issues, which we will continue to talk through in the days ahead.\u201d\nThe Indiana Republican leaders are likely to face immense pressure from the White House and Trump allies. Still, many Republican operatives in Indiana said they are skeptical that a redistricting effort will take place.\nAnd former Gov. Mitch Daniels, who remains a hugely influential figure in Indiana Republican politics, told CNN he opposes a mid-decade redrawing of Indiana\u2019s maps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not going to reduce the level of public cynicism or increase the level of confidence,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIt may be appropriate in some places, but I don\u2019t understand that Indiana is one. I think we have pretty fairly drawn lines now, and I don\u2019t see any good reason that they should be tampered with out of cycle.\u201d\nVance ignored CNN\u2019s questions entering the Capitol Thursday about why Indiana should redraw its congressional districts and what he would tell Braun. Vance was brought in through tunnels to keep him away from public eyes as protesters rallied outside the governor\u2019s office. He left after about an hour and later attended a Republican National Committee fundraiser at the InterContinental Indianapolis hotel.\nTrump\u2019s push to find more Republican seats ahead of next year\u2019s midterms has launched a nationwide redistricting arms race. Republicans hold a slim majority in the US House, with Democrats currently needing to net just 3 seats next year to win back control.\nThe meeting in Indianapolis comes as Texas Republicans seek to redraw the state\u2019s maps to add five GOP-leaning House seats \u2014 an effort Democrats are impeding by fleeing the state to deny the Texas House the two-thirds quorum necessary to do business.\nRepublicans are also eyeing Ohio, where a quirk in state law requires the maps to be redrawn, and Missouri, for more potential seats. And Democratic governors in California, Illinois, New York and other states are vowing to retaliate with their own redistricting push.\nWhat could Republicans gain in Indiana?\nOne, maybe two, House seats.\nThe GOP already holds seven of Indiana\u2019s nine House seats, so they\u2019d be targeting the seats of Democratic Reps. Frank Mrvan and, potentially, Andr\u00e9 Carson.\nMrvan\u2019s 1st District includes what\u2019s known as \u201cthe Region\u201d \u2014 Indiana\u2019s cities and suburbs that stretch southeast of Chicago. Carson represents the 7th District, urban territory that includes most of Indianapolis.\nThose two seats have long been in Democratic hands. Carson, who won a special election to replace his late grandmother in 2008, has never faced a serious challenge. Mrvan, the son of a state senator who first won his House seat in 2020, coasted to a nearly 10-point victory last November despite some GOP efforts to target his seat.\nPolitical operatives in Indiana say Mrvan\u2019s district could be made more favorable to Republicans with nips and tucks from neighboring rural, deep-red districts. Carson\u2019s much more compact and heavily Democratic district, though, would likely have to be sliced into several different pieces, dispersed into multiple districts.\nWho are the key players?\nIndiana\u2019s filing deadline is in February, and the part-time legislature is out of session until January, so redrawing the congressional maps would likely require Braun to call a special session.\nFrom there, it\u2019d be up to Huston, the House speaker, and Bray, the Senate president pro tem. Both first won their offices in 2012 \u2014 Bray succeeded his father Richard, a long-time state senator. They\u2019ve both remained quiet amid questions about Indiana joining the redistricting arms race.. Both first won their offices in 2012 \u2014 Bray succeeded his father Richard, a long-time state senator. They\u2019ve both remained quiet amid questions about Indiana joining the redistricting arms race.\nOne consideration could be the costs of a potential special session in lawmaker per diems and travel expenses, as Indiana faces a budget crunch.\nHow are Democrats responding?\nDemocrats rallied steps away from the governor\u2019s office as Vance, Braun and legislative leaders met Thursday. However, they have no real power to stop a Republican redistricting push.\nThe GOP has supermajorities in Indiana\u2019s House and Senate, which means Democrats couldn\u2019t slow things down by following the lead of Texas House Democrats and fleeing the state to deny the quorum necessary to do business.\nCarson, in a news conference after that rally, urged Braun to \u201cshow the independent spirit \u2014 Indiana has always had an independent, libertarian streak\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate sovereignty.\u201d\nMrvan told the crowd outside the governor\u2019s office that he thought redistricting was a \u201cdone deal.\u201d\n\u201cHistorically, people have bent the knee to the Vance-Trump administration,\u201d he told reporters afterward.\nStill, both Mrvan and Carson said they will run for reelection regardless. Mrvan said he expects new districts would face legal challenges.\n\u201cEverywhere I go, people say, \u2018Find middle ground, we\u2019re tired of the fighting,\u2019\u201d Mrvan said. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re about to do is they\u2019re going to elevate that to the whole state of Indiana because they\u2019re afraid of a checks-and-balances system.\u201d\nState Rep. Matt Pierce, the Indiana House Democratic leader, urged Braun to resist pressure from Trump.\n\u201cI think they know that it\u2019s unusual to call special session for this purpose, but you know they\u2019ve not been able to say no to Donald Trump yet, and so that\u2019s my concern,\u201d Pierce said.\n\u201cThe governor can single-handedly stop this by simply refusing to call the special session,\u201d he said, \u201cand if he does, the leaders of the legislature need to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to subvert democracy just to satisfy President Trump.\u2019\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nCNN\u2019s Ethan Cohen and David Wright contributed to this report."

      "text": "The congressional map Texas Republicans hope to enact so efficiently distributes GOP voters that last year, President Donald Trump would\u2019ve won all of the 30 districts where the party hopes to win by at least ten percentage points.\nIn drawing the map, Republicans targeted five Democratic-held districts with precision, carefully cutting out blue areas and redistributing them to other districts which are already safe for either party and replacing them with solidly red turf.\nThe map looks likely to perform well for Republicans if the party continues to do as well in the state as they did in 2024, when Trump won by nearly 14 points. However, if a future election looks more like 2020, when Trump\u2019s margin was less than half that, several of these districts could be much more competitive.\nHere\u2019s a look at the five districts and how Republicans want to redraw them.\nDistrict 9: Houston\nDistrict 9 in Houston would change dramatically under the new map, morphing from a Democratic district based in southern Houston to a Republican district in eastern Harris County. While Democratic Rep. Al Green currently represents the 9th, he may run in the neighboring 18th District instead, which has been vacant since Rep. Sylvester Turner died earlier this year. That district would absorb much of Green\u2019s current turf and become even more Democratic under the proposed map.\nDistrict 32: Dallas\nA big piece of Rep. Julie Johnson\u2019s Dallas-area 32nd District would be merged with Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey\u2019s 33rd, while other Democratic areas would be distributed to heavily Republican seats. The new 32nd would then extend east into the heavily Republican counties of Rockwall, Hunt, Rains, Wood, Camp and Upshur.\nDistrict 35: Austin and San Antonio\nThe Republican proposal would eliminate Rep. Greg Casar\u2019s Austin to San Antonio 35th District in its current form. The new 35th would include some Democratic parts of San Antonio, but would stretch out from the city into more Republican turf in Guadalupe, Karnes and Wilson counties. Much of the Austin portion of the district would be absorbed into Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett\u2019s 37th.\nDistrict 28: South Texas\nOf the five targeted seats, District 28 has the smallest partisan shift. Because Trump won the current district by seven points last year, even as Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar won his 11th term, it sees just small changes to push Trump\u2019s margin to double digits. The new map cuts out some Democratic areas in San Antonio while adding more Republicans, especially in Live Oak, La Salle and Maverick Counties. The district also gains a portion of Hidalgo County along the Mexican border, which Trump won more narrowly.\nCuellar won in 2024 by a bit less than six points, so he could still have a chance to hang on, even if the district becomes three points more Republican.\nDistrict 34: South Texas\nSimilarly to the 28th, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez holds the nearby 34th despite Trump winning it by about four percentage points last year. The new map pushes that margin to double digits by excising a portion of Hidalgo County on the Mexican border, which Trump carried narrowly and which includes some Democratic areas, and replacing it with a portion of Nueces County near Corpus Christi, where Trump won 57% of the vote.\nGonzalez would be in a tougher position than Cuellar under this map. He won by less than three points in November, and his district will see a bigger shift towards Trump.\nDistricts 28 and 34 are both Hispanic-majority districts in a part of the state that have swung dramatically towards Republicans in recent years. Even in the 2022 election for governor, the 28th would\u2019ve voted solidly Democratic, while Republican Greg Abbott would\u2019ve very narrowly carried the 34th. That shift to the right will need to continue if Republicans want to be confident they can win these seats in 2026."

      "text": "What Gov. Mike Braun said about redistricting in Indiana following meeting with JD Vance\nGov. Mike Braun was noncommittal about the prospect of redistricting in Indiana following a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Indiana legislative leaders at the Indiana Statehouse on Aug. 7.\nWhen asked by reporters if the group came to a consensus on redrawing the state's congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Braun said, \"We listened.\" He also described the conversation as \"pretty good.\"\n\"It was great to meet with @VPVance today,\" Braun posted on X. \"We discussed a number of issues, and I was pleased to highlight some of the great things happening in Indiana.\"\nHouse Speaker Todd Huston and Senate Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, both Republicans, did not answer questions shouted by reporters following the meeting with Vance. In statements shared later, both Huston and Bray avoided commenting on any future redistricting in Indiana but said they appreciated meeting with Vance.\n\"I appreciated the opportunity to hear from the Vice President on a variety of issues, which we will continue to talk through in the days ahead,\" Bray, of Martinsville, said in a statement.\n\"We've been proud to work alongside the Trump Administration on several issues to strengthen our state and nation,\" Huston, of Fishers, said. \"We had a meaningful discussion, heard the vice president's perspective on a number of topics, and will continue conversations as we work to advance Indiana and deliver results for Hoosiers.\"\nWhy Indiana redistricting is a topic in 2025\nThe push in Indiana, where Republicans already hold seven of the state's nine U.S. House seats, comes as the Trump administration is looking to Republican-led states to initiate mid-decade redistricting in order to pad the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives prior to 2026. The party breakdown currently stands at 219 Republicans to 212 Democrats.\nThe effort is already underway in Republican-led Texas, where new congressional maps could give the GOP as many as five additional seats. Texas Democrats fled the state on Aug. 3 to disrupt legislative processes to approve those maps.\nPolitical analysts say, if Gov. Mike Braun calls a special session for redistricting, Republicans could easily redraw maps in Northwest Indiana to flip the 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan. That would put the state at eight Republican seats to one Democratic one.\nRedrawing the 7th Congressional District in Indianapolis, held by longtime U.S. Rep. Andre Carson, to get the state to nine Republicans would pose more challenges. Any breakup of deep blue Democratic voters in Marion County could make other Republican House districts more vulnerable in future elections, analysts said.\nThe prospect was met with thunderous opposition from more than 100 Hoosiers who trickled into the Statehouse earlier in the morning and formed a vocal throng by the time Vance arrived.\nUpon learning of his arrival on site, the protestors, organized by the nonprofit organization MADVoters, let out a chorus of booing for more than a minute straight.\nIn an environment where most GOP representatives in Congress don't hold town halls or respond to constituent calls, Carmel resident Gerrie Bonarrigo said, showing up to protest \u2015 regardless of the numbers \u2015 is not only a way to grab attention, but an outlet for folks who feel disempowered.\n\"There's nothing worse to me then feeling like you have no control over your life,\" she said, donning a foam statue of liberty hat. \"This gives you a voice that you don't have. We need to have people see what's going on.\"\nWhat's going on, in the eyes of protestors, is a form of cheating. Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn called it an \"obvious partisan power grab\" that her organization plans to challenge in court, if it happens. State Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, called her Statehouse colleagues who might support the redistricting plan \"sellouts.\"\nState Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said they need to do more than protest: they need to increase voter turnout, an area where Indiana ranks near or at the bottom of states. He said he'll soon announce a large voter turnout initiative in Marion County.\n\"This fight is not about left vs. right,\" he said, his voice growing hoarse from shouting. \"This is a fight about right vs wrong.\"\nAfter Vance left the building, U.S. Reps. Andre Carson and Frank Mrvan, of Indiana's only two Democratic congressional districts, joined protestors beneath the Statehouse rotunda to further decry talk of redistricting mid-cycle.\nBoth argued that the reason this is happening is because President Donald Trump, they said, doesn't want to be held accountable by the voters for unpopular policies, such as the scaling back of Medicaid and the enactment of import tariffs.\n\"We will not accept our state being cut and sliced and maneuvered for a wannabe king, Donald Trump,\" Carson said.\nContact IndyStar state government and politics reporter Brittany Carloni at brittany.carloni@indystar.com.\nSign up for our free weekly politics newsletter, Checks & Balances, curated by IndyStar politics and government reporters."
