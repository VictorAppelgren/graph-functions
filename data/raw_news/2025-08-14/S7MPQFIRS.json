  "title": "BROADWAY REVIEW: \u2018Mamma Mia\u2019 still worth the money, money, money",
  "description": "Anyone sitting in the Winter Garden Theatre, or merely reading the boffo grosses of the musical during the preview performances could see that U.S. audiences are as hungry as ever for the \u201cMa\u2026",
  "content": "\u201cAbba\u201d has sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, but they would have been even bigger in the United states if they\u2019d toured and promoted here more heavily. Instead, they were widely seen as a Swedish novelty act, a fad band, for decades.\n\nEven the arrival on Broadway of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d in 2001 didn\u2019t immediately change that. But almost a quarter a century later, anyone sitting in the Winter Garden Theatre, or merely reading the boffo grosses of the musical during the preview performances these last few weeks could see that U.S. audiences are as hungry as ever for the \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d brand, thanks in part to the movies and maybe the uptick in vinyl and disco nostalgia.\n\nAll the producers did this summer was stick the touring production on Broadway to fill an empty theater for the summer. It\u2019s the same diminutive set I saw just a few weeks ago and the cool jetty that arrived at the show\u2019s climax got cut years ago and has not returned. Why waste the money?\n\nFor those who\u2019ve seen that tour half a dozen times, the only surprise is the addition of more live musicians for Broadway, union minimums being a helpful thing in this case. Actual acoustic sounds have replaced some pre-programmed tracks. Awesome! Benny Andersson\u2019s synth work on the Yamaha GX1 and the Moog Polymoog is legendary but \u201cMamma Mia\u201d combined the original sound with Martin Koch\u2019s clever theatrical arrangements, and it needs lots of humans in the pit.\n\nHappily, that touring cast starred Christine Sherrill as Donna, a star who lacks only name recognition. Sherrill\u2019s massive but vulnerable belt is ideally matched for this material. She\u2019s the best Donna of all time in my book, and I\u2019ve seen a dozen or more from London to Las Vegas. Never has a Donna better nailed \u201cThe Winner Takes It All,\u201d the show\u2019s brilliant idea to rehab a tragic break-up song that had been rendered weirdly up-tempo in Abba\u2019s original recording. The rest of the cast is just fine; the oldsters give the material respect while having fun, and the kids all seem delighted just to be there.\n\nI remember vividly seeing \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d at London\u2019s Prince Edward Theatre just prior to its opening. People went berserk with delight. The whole concept of a jukebox musical \u2014 an original story told with songs people already knew well \u2014 was unknown back then. Patrons giggled with excitement as they wondered how, say, \u201cDoes Your Mother Know?\u201d would be used since the order of the songs was hidden in the program.\n\nBack in 1999, the all-female team of writer Catherine Johnson, producer Judy Craymer and director Phyllida Lloyd crafted a brilliant ABBA delivery mechanism, nothing more, nothing less. It was a simple story about a single hippy mom who had slept with at least three guys on the beach in Greece and later produced a daughter, Sophie (Amy Weaver). As she prepares to get married at her mum\u2019s taverna, Sophie invites all three of her potential dads to the nuptials.\n\nAdd in two sidekicks for Donna (Jalynn Steele and Carly Sakolove), two for Sophie (Haley Wright and Lena Owens) and you had a story that understood that emotional mother-and-daughter stories are a goldmine in musical theater, since that is who likes to go see them.\n\n\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d has the youth POV (well, it did) and also lots of songs of parental regret (\u201cSlipping Through My Fingers\u201d and so on). I can\u2019t overstate my respect for the show; it\u2019s a masterpiece of its populist kind, much imitated but never equaled.\n\nSure, the chronology doesn\u2019t make sense any more. If the \u201cdot dot dot\u201d shenanigans were happening in 1979, as they say, Donna would be 70 now, which she\u2019s clearly not. But then maybe \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is still happening in 1999, given that no-one has phones or taverna websites or knows much about DNA tests. But no book refresh was forthcoming; \u201cMamma Mia\u201d remains timeless, stuck in the eternal ABBA time warp, much like the group\u2019s AI avatars who entertain in London, cheating age and mortality.\n\nThe big takeaway for me is that even as the U.S. underestimated this band, so Broadway underestimated this brand. It\u2019s one of a kind. Just watch how many people will come and have fun. Limited run? We\u2019ll see.",

  "summary": "The Broadway production of \"Mamma Mia!\" the Swedish band \"Abba,\" which sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, has been overlooked for its commercial success in the United States due to its lack of touring and promotion. The musical, which debuted on Broadway in 2001, has since proven popular in the U.S. due to the movies and an uptick in vinyl and disco nostalgia. Despite this, the producers decided to stick the touring production on Broadway this summer to fill an empty theater for summer. The production, featuring Christine Sherrill as Donna, is praised for its original sound and theatrical arrangements, and it requires lots of humans in the pit.

      "text": "CHICAGO \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a deal with the devil,\u201d sniped one New York producer about Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum\u2019s much-maligned deal to send \u201cAvenue Q,\u201d their Tony Award-winning musical, to Las Vegas. \u201cBroadway producers won\u2019t ever get slot machines in their lobbies.\u201d\nThe Strip has dealt the Great White Way a one-two punch in recent weeks. And even as the producers and Actors\u2019 Equity fight out union contracts for the road, Broadway and Sin City are sniping at each other like a pair of prizefighters wondering if the rules are fair.\nWhich they most assuredly are not.\nPopular on Variety\nFirst, it was announced that Seller and McCollum secretly had nixed the notion of an \u201cAvenue Q\u201d national tour in favor of a blue-chip sit-down at Vegas entrepreneur Steve Wynn\u2019s soon-to-open, upmarket gambling emporium Wynn Las Vegas. At least it was the road that got stiffed in Puppetgate, not Broadway.\nBut then, the producers of \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d said they really don\u2019t need New York at all, thanks very much, when they have a nice, lucrative gig at Paris, the Las Vegas hotel.\nThe populist London tuner opens Aug. 16 in Vegas. At a show press conference in mid-July with writer Ben Elton and former members of Queen, the hotel allowed in 1,000 members of the public along with the journos because it \u201chad the room.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that kind of egalitarian ploy flying in Gotham, where theater still relies on more of a top-down progression from the tastemakers to the punters buying the tix.\nThe big \u201cQ\u201d defection sent a good portion of the road and Broadway communities into an anti-Vegas snit. Meanwhile, Vegas types are fighting back.\n\u201cLas Vegans are used to being laughed at by East Coast artistes,\u201d columnist Anthony Del Valle wrote recently in the Las Vegas Review-Journal of the \u201cQ\u201d debacle, \u201cbut I have a hunch this is one time we may get to laugh back.\u201d\nAt the core of the debate is whether it actually serves Gotham producers to build up Vegas as a kind of Broadway West.\nSome think it does.\n\u201cAvenue Q\u2019s\u201d Seller says the deal with Wynn \u201cprotects the aesthetic integrity of the show\u201d by putting it in a cozy 1,200-seat theater, while also providing maximum return for investors.\nTo this way of thinking, Vegas provides another outlet for Broadway product beyond the traditional and increasingly problematic road \u2014 especially the kind of product that doesn\u2019t fit traditional 3,000-seat subscription models.\nAt a time when cruise ships are booking brand-name shows, surely it makes sense for Broadway producers to look beyond the traditional touring box.\nWhy take the risk on the road when you can go to Vegas, which is on track for more than 35 million visitors this year? Why risk lousy Gotham reviews for \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d when you can go straight to the people \u2014 in holiday spending mood? Tix for the Queen show start at $80 and top out at $113.50.\nAnd there are 10 \u2014 count \u2019em, 10 \u2014 shows per week on the Vegas slate.\n\u201cVegas is like being on tour without having to move around,\u201d says Chris Wink, the creative force behind the Blue Man Group, which has been going gangbusters for more than two years at the Luxor Hotel on the Strip in a retrofitted 1,200-seat theater. \u201cEveryone in the world passes through this hourglass.\u201d\nAnd, helpfully, legit crix don\u2019t matter much.\nWink and his cobalt cohorts pack as many as 14 shows a week into their theater (which gives them a potential weekly gross that exceeds the typical road house with an eight-show week).\nWink says the edgy likes of Penn & Teller and Cirque du Soleil \u201csoftened up\u201d the town for his brand of urbane Off Broadway fare. \u201cWe\u2019re rooting for \u2018Avenue Q,'\u201d Wink says. \u201cWe want Vegas to become a bona fide theater capital.\u201d\nSimilarly, Chicago\u2019s Second City comedy troupe struggled to find audiences and real estate in the likes of Cleveland and Detroit, but it packs them in at up to 12 shows a week at the Flamingo Hotel, where it has been playing since 2001.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a captive audience here,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, Second City\u2019s producer. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go up to 14 shows per week.\u201d\nNot that there haven\u2019t been plenty of Vegas legit-style duds.\nAfter a decent start, \u201cChicago\u201d quickly spluttered out at the Mandalay Bay \u2014 in the same theater where \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d does boffo business now. De La Guarda didn\u2019t work here, either.\nAnd in a city that seems to reinvent itself every five minutes, trying to figure out what works is largely futile.\nWithin the last few weeks, most of the big Vegas players have consolidated in an orgy of corporate acquisition.\nThese days, most of the big hotels are under the same ownership \u2014 which likely will make it more difficult to broker individual legit deals.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone from family to T&A to legit and back to T&A,\u201d says Ken Gentry, the busy road producer who has worked in Vegas in the past. \u201cThe one constant seems to be short and spectacular. I don\u2019t think most mainstream musicals will ever work there.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unlikely that thrush Linda Ronstadt will ever work there again: The Aladdin Hotel\u2019s booting of the singer for dedicating a number to filmmaker Michael Moore is an apt cautionary note for legit producers hoping to bring edgy or progressive fare to a city that\u2019s paradoxically conservative, Sin or no Sin.\nBut Barry Weissler is shopping a Vegas version of \u201cHairspray.\u201d And what\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d if not a mainstream musical (in West End terms, at least)? \u201cAvenue Q\u201d is hardly T&A, unless you count the \u201cfull puppet nudity\u201d touted in its ads.\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t seem a stretch to imagine that next year\u2019s Tony winner might attract the attention of some Vegas entrepreneurs: Such upcoming legit titles as \u201cBilly Elliot,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d \u201cAll Shook Up\u201d and \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Spamalot\u201d all sound like possibilities for the desert.\nVegas entertainment columnist Mike Weatherford argues that those who say \u201cAvenue Q\u201d is too edgy for the town ignore the place\u2019s libertarian, egalitarian instincts. Forgotten in the brouhaha is that \u201cQ\u201d is not even the main show in Wynn Las Vegas \u2014 that would be the latest spectacle from Franco Dragone, the force behind the long-running, mega-grossing \u201cO\u201d and \u201cMystere\u201d and director of Celine Dion\u2019s show.\nIn essence, says Weatherford, Wynn picks up the Bushies with Dragone and the younger, more liberal crowd with \u201cQ.\u201d The money of both parties has the same smell.\nThese days, Vegas deals are impossibly varied. Both Wink and Leonard argue that producers expecting hotels to subsidize their shows don\u2019t know anything about how Vegas has changed \u2014 most entertainment now is expected to be its own profit center.\nThen again, Caesar\u2019s Palace gets no direct revenue from the Celine Dion extravaganza in the hotel \u2014 which is controlled by Concerts West; Caesar\u2019s merely gets several thousand people walking directly to its slots and tables.\nThat was enough for Caesar\u2019s to bankroll a state-of-the-art theater. Neither New York nor the road can compete with that."

      "text": "MAMMA MIA!\nA mother. A daughter. Three possible dads. And a trip down the aisle you\u2019ll never forget! Mamma Mia!, the worldwide musical phenomenon, comes home to Broadway\u2019s Winter Garden Theatre for a special limited return engagement beginning August 2nd.\nThe international musical sensation that has kept audiences dancing in the aisles for 25 years. Mamma Mia! is the Broadway getaway that audiences can\u2019t wait to escape to, and this August it returns to the Winter Garden Theatre for a special limited engagement. You already know you\u2019re gonna love it \u2013 get your tickets today.\nMamma Mia! on Broadway Show Tickets\nHISTORY\nShubert has owned the Winter Garden Theatre longer than any of its other venues. The playhouse occupies the second American Horse Exchange, built by William K. Vanderbilt in 1896, when Longacre (now Times Square) was the center of the horse and carriage trade. By 1911, when the Shuberts leased the Exchange, horses had given way to the automobile and legitimate stage was making inroads north of 42nd St. The Winter Garden was converted into a theatre in 1911, and had brief interludes as a movie house from 1928 to 1933 when Warner Brothers leased it, and again in 1945, when United Artists ran it.\nARCHITECTURE\nArchitect William Albert Swasey converted the existing horse exchange building into a theatre by turning the showring into an auditorium with only one balcony, and decorating it with a garden motif. The existing space dictated that Swasey design a playhouse that was unusually wide (the proscenium opening is still the widest of all Shubert theatres), which brought the audience closer to the stage. Swasey left the Horse Exchange\u2019s trusses exposed, covered the ceiling in sky blue canvas, trimming both it and the walls with latticework. Garlands and leaves entwined the box fronts and proscenium arch. The stage at one point included a water tank, and in its first decade extended a runway out into the audience, dubbed by audiences \u201cThe Bridge of Thighs.\u201d\nTwelve years after the theatre opened, Herbert J. Krapp completed a major renovation of the interior which eliminated the runway, lowered the ceiling and proscenium arch, and covered the trusses, adding elegant ornamentation and bringing the theatre more in line with the traditional Adamesque style used in other Shubert venues. In 2001 after Cats closed, architect Francesca Russo oversaw a multimillion dollar restoration of the theatre to its Twenties' glory.\nSpotlight on Broadway: Winter Garden Theatre from Spotlight on Broadway on Vimeo.\nAccess Information\nTheatre is not completely wheelchair accessible.

The 1960s also witnessed a number of hits. Leading the list were The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1960); Funny Girl (1964), which made Barbra Streisand a major star; and Mame (1966) with Angela Lansbury.\nIn the 1970s, both popular and cutting-edge productions played at the Winter Garden. Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman\u2019s Follies (1971) harkened back to the theatre\u2019s early history as home to a follies-type revue. Gypsy (1974) was revived with Angela Lansbury, Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman offered Pacific Overtures (1976), and Gilda Radner came to Broadway in Gilda Radner \u2014 Live from New York (1979). 42nd Street (1980) opened at the playhouse before moving to the Majestic. In 1982 Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Cats premiered and ran until September 2000, the second longest-running show in Broadway history. Mamma Mia!, based on the songs of ABBA, debuted in 2001 and remained here until 2013 before moving to the Broadhurst Theatre. More recently the Winter Garden was home to Rocky the Musical (2014), Wolf Hall (2015) and Andrew Lloyd Webber's School of Rock (2015).\nTHEATRE SPECS\nWinter Garden Theatre\n1634 Broadway\nBetween West 50th and 51st Streets\nNew York NY 10019\n| Year Built | 1911 | |\n| Seating Capacity | ||\n| Orchestra | 1045 | |\n| Mezzanine | 486 | |\n| Boxes | 36 | |\n| Standing | 33 | |\n| Total | 1600 | |\n| Included in Numbers Above: | ||\n| Orchestra Pit | 32 | |\n| Wheelchair | 20 | |\n| Aisle Transfer Arm | 16 | |\n| Theatre Dimensions | |\n| Proscenium Opening: | 44' 10\" |\n| Height of Proscenium: | 24' 4\" |\n| Depth to proscenium: | 40' 0\" |\n| Depth to front of stage: | 44' 2\" |\n| Stage Type: | Proscenium |"

Check out photos of the new marquee at the Winter Garden Theatre.\nReview: MAMMA MIA! at The Paramount Theater\nby Amelia Divine - Jun 11, 2025\nThere is something about Mamma Mia! that just feels like summer. Maybe it is the breezy Greek island setting, maybe it is the glittery ABBA soundtrack, or maybe it is because this show operates entirely on pure joy. The Paramount\u2019s current production leans into that joy, delivering an experience that feels more like an event than a standard night at the theater. The audience came ready for it too, with people in disco lam\u00e9, breezy resortwear, and go-go boots.\nReview: MAMMA MIA at Broadway In Tucson\nby Zach Wetzel - May 22, 2025\nMAMMA MIA at Broadway in Tucson is an energetic crowdpleaser! I spent my childhood listening to the music of ABBA and watching various iterations of MAMMA MIA. The bar was very high for me on this one. I am pleased to say that Broadway in Tucson delivers a stunning and captivating performance with excellent visuals and vocals combined.\nReview: MAMMA MIA at Orpheum Theatre\nby Steve Murray - May 2, 2025\nIt\u2019s hard not to be swept up in the Mamma Mia juggernaut.

Wins Me Over at Last \ufffd\" Dr. Phillips Center\nby Aaron Wallace - Jan 17, 2025\nSilly stories like this work better on stage, where the particulars of the real world aren\u2019t around to underscore implausibility. It\u2019s quite a setup: 20-year-old bride-to-be Sophie has never known a father, but by the time the prologue is over, she has already swiped her mom\u2019s diary, identified three old flames as the could-be dad, invited each of them to a remote Greek island for her upcoming wedding, and concocted an elaborate rouse to keep all of this from her betrothed, her mother, the men, and her mom\u2019s two best friends. The objective: lay eyes on each potential pop for a \u201cvibes check\u201d in hopes of finally IDing her dad.\nReview: MAMMA MIA! Presented by Broadway Across America at Kentucky Performing Arts\nby Taylor Clemons - Dec 5, 2024\nIt\u2019s been over 9 years since Mamma Mia played it\u2019s final performance on Broadway. The show was a Broadway mainstay for nearly 15 years before closing in 2015, and no production since has truly been able to capture the pure joy of what makes the show so great. At the height of its success, it spawned a star studded and successful film adaptation; and post closure, a film sequel. After the show\u2019s broadway closure, some non-equity tours did their best, but something felt off. I\u2019m beyond overjoyed to report that the shows current iteration (billed as the 25th anniversary tour), is nothing short of delightful and miraculous merriment.\nMAMMA MIA!

The musical is currently playing to sold out audiences in Toronto, ON before continuing its North American Tour through June 2025.\nReview: MAMMA MIA! at Ed Mirvish Theatre\nby Ilana Lucas - Oct 14, 2024\nThe 1999 ABBA jukebox juggernaut is back again at the Ed Mirvish Theatre, full of cheery, dance-heavy numbers, a simple, wacky plot, and plenty of shiny spandex outfits.\nSee what our critic had to say.\nReview: MAMMA MIA! at the Aronoff Center\nby Ana-Brit Asplen - Sep 9, 2024\nMamma Mia! is an absolute blast of a musical when it\u2019s done right, and the current North American touring production goes above and beyond. Accepted as a classic with its charming story, energetic music using hit songs from the 70s disco band ABBA, and the energetic performances that fill the stage, this show is still a hit."
