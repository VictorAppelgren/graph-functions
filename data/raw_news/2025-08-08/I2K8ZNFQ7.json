The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.
