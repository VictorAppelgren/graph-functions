  "title": "Russia makes battlefield advances as Putin-Trump meeting looms",
  "description": "While the Russian advances are small for now, an expert with the Institute for the Study of War said the next couple of days and weeks will be consequential.",
  "content": "Russian forces have made a tactical breakthrough in the front lines in a push that is likely designed to boost Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s hand ahead of his meeting with President Donald Trump later this week.\n\nThe Russians\u2019 moves toward the Ukrainian city of Dobropilla are \u201csmall-scale penetrations\u201d for now, but they \u201ccertainly will seek to try to mature these tactical successes into a larger breakthrough and a larger penetration and seize more territory,\u201d George Barros, an expert with the Institute for the Study of War, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nWhile the Russian advances are small for now, Barros said the next couple of days and weeks will be consequential.\n\nTrump and Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday in what will be the Russian leader\u2019s first trip to the United States since 2015. Their meeting came at the request of the Kremlin, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nPutin has not met face to face with a U.S. president since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He met with then-President Joe Biden in Geneva in June 2021, their only in-person interaction during Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting that the Russians chose this moment to do this push, to achieve this informational effect, and show the maps what\u2019s happening because Putin wants to go into the summit on Friday and have the international headlines be that this meeting is happening on the backstage of Russian battlefield breakthroughs,\u201d Barros added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes the Russian army is not \u201cpreparing to end the war. On the contrary, they are making movements that indicate preparations for new offensive operations.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s goal with this meeting is \u201cto walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war,\u201d Leavitt said on Tuesday.\n\nZelensky was not invited to join Trump and Putin\u2019s meeting, though the U.S. leader said he intends to call European leaders, Zelensky included, shortly afterward. Trump also said his meeting with Putin would be followed by a meeting between Putin and Zelensky and that he would be willing to join them.\n\nTrump has discussed the possibility of land swaps for both sides as part of an agreement to end the war, including the possibility of Russian forces leaving occupied Ukrainian territory, though he has refrained from discussing specifics.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the leaders of Europe for their clear support of our independence, territorial integrity, and precisely such an active approach to diplomacy that can help end this war with a dignified peace,\u201d Zelensky said on social media on Tuesday. \u201cIndeed, we all support President Trump\u2019s determination, and together we must shape positions that will not allow Russia to deceive the world once again.\u201d\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has raged for about three and a half years, has largely become a war of attrition in which the front lines have remained mostly unchanged for years. Russia has been unable to accomplish its initial goal of toppling the Ukrainian government \u2014 experts say that goal is unattainable \u2014 but Russia adjusted from those goals early into the war. It has lost hundreds of thousands of service members to make minimal advances on the battlefield.\n\nRussia has unilaterally annexed four territories in Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. The Russians carried out referendums they claimed showed those areas voted to join the Russian Federation, but almost no country has recognized those as legitimate.\n\nRussian officials have said they want the U.S. and West to recognize that land as Russian territory as part of a deal, even though it includes territory that Russian troops do not currently occupy, a recognition the Ukrainians have strongly refused.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian troops have been fighting in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which is primarily made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, since 2014. Russia has still been unable to capture the entire region, but it is looking to do so in the negotiations.\n\nPutin \u201cwants Ukraine to give it up to him without having to fight for it,\u201d retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane said on Fox News, referencing what\u2019s known as Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress belt,\u201d a group of four fortified large cities and smaller towns that run north to south in the Donetsk oblast.\n\nUkraine has spent more than a decade reinforcing these areas to prevent annexation.\n\nRussia has \u201cabout 65% to 70% of the Donbas oblasts, and what [Putin] wants to take charge of is this \u2018fortress belt\u2019 we refer to. It\u2019s about 15 miles going north to south, five cities along there that have all been fortified. This is in the Donetsk oblast, and he\u2019s been trying to take it since 2014 when he failed then, and for the last two years, he failed to take it,\u201d Keane said.\n\nRUSSIA BREAKS THROUGH MAIN UKRAINIAN DEFENSE LINE AHEAD OF ALASKA MEETING WITH TRUMP\n\n\u201cWhat makes this important? Because the terrain beyond that to the north is all farmland, not very defensible, and it\u2019s on a pathway right to Kharkiv, which is the second largest city in Ukraine,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s attempt to strengthen its positions right before an expected meeting is a tactic it has used before, Barros noted, citing the Minsk talks in 2014 and 2015.",

      "text": "Russian troops achieved one of the biggest breakthroughs of the war in eastern Ukraine, with some units making it through Kyiv\u2019s primary defensive line just days ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s peace summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.\nSince September 2022, the war in Ukraine has largely been marked by slow, attritional warfare between entrenched combatants, with advances marked by meters rather than miles. Moscow has mastered this attritional form of fighting, using a combination of small assault squads, first-person view drones, artillery, and glide bombs to wear down Ukrainian fortifications slowly. Over the weekend, this strategy finally bore fruit when Russian forces achieved one of the largest breakthroughs of the war, advancing nearly 10 miles, past Ukraine\u2019s main line of defenses in Donetsk oblast.\nThe pro-Ukrainian mapper DeepState, which compiles its maps from open-source intelligence and testimonies from Ukrainian soldiers, added the unprecedented advance to its map on Sunday, located between the two major axes of advance around the strongholds of Pokrovsk and Konstantynivka.\nAccording to DeepState, the Russian army utilized its numerical superiority to identify a weak point in the line and ruthlessly exploited it. Soldiers advanced as far as the Dobropillya-Kramatorsk highway, one of Ukraine\u2019s main logistical arteries. The outlet blamed local commanders, who it alleged were covering up the worsening situation.\n\u201cThe situation is developing quite chaotically, because the enemy, having found gaps in the defense, is seeping into the depths, trying to consolidate quickly, accumulate for further advancement, while some individuals in the command of a certain brigade either do not understand the full depth of the problem, or present the situation as \u2018controlled,'\u201d it said in a post on Telegram. \u201cHowever, the military themselves, who are holding the defense there and are trying to understand what is happening, do not agree with this.\u201d\nIf events continue, DeepState warned that the city of Dobropillya, located behind Pokrovsk, could collapse, leaving the troops defending the latter surrounded.\nWord quickly spread throughout the Ukrainian military and OSINT networks, triggering a panic. One of Ukraine\u2019s most famous military commanders, Bohdan Krotevych, former commander of the Azov Brigade, gave an urgent warning to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation.\n\u201cI sincerely don\u2019t know what exactly is being reported to you, but I\u2019m informing you: on the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka line, without exaggeration, it\u2019s complete chaos. And this chaos has been growing for a long time, worsening with each passing day,\u201d he said. \u201cA stable line of combat contact, as such, effectively doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nThe current advances have left the city-strongholds of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad encircled and Konstantynivka semi-encircled, Krotevych said. The development would be among the most significant Russian tactical victories in the past few years if confirmed.\nHe went on to excoriate unnamed Ukrainian officers along the line who had allowed the deterioration.\n\u201cThe systemic problem began with the depletion of reserves, the widespread fragmentation of units across the entire front line, reports of \u2018captured villages\u2019 being touted as victories amidst failures of entire sectors, the allocation of mobilization resources to \u2018cronies,\u2019 and the complete lack of strategic or even operational vision of the theater of operations among parts of the military leadership,\u201d Krotevych said.\nBild writer Julian Ropcke, known for his fervent support for Kyiv, gave an even more blunt assessment.\n\u201cCalling it a strategic catastrophe would still be an understatement,\u201d he said, adding that Kyiv doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of what was happening, echoing Krotevych\u2019s thesis that local commanders were misleading their superiors.\nOSINT analyst Clement Molin published a map illustrating the severity of the breakthrough. It showed Russian forces were now behind Donetsk\u2019s line of defenses, which had slowed its advance for nearly three and a half years of war. If Kyiv can\u2019t manage to plug the gap, Russian troops could cut west or north, cutting off two of the anchors of the \u201cNew Donbas Line\u201d of defenses.\nIn accordance with the sensitive military operations being carried out, official Russian and Ukrainian sources were murky about the exact details of the developments. Preliminary OSINT reports seemed to suggest that the initial push was made by Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups, or DRGs, special units trained to infiltrate enemy lines and wreak havoc. Whether concentrated regular units have been able to consolidate these gains is uncertain.\nA Ukrainian military Telegram channel in Dobropillya suggested that Russian DRG units may operate within the city itself, a development that would mean an even larger breakthrough.\nRussian forces mounted on motorcycles, a tactic they\u2019ve spearheaded over the past few months, likely achieved the speed of the breakthrough. With armored vehicles more vulnerable than ever due to both sides\u2019 omnipresent drone usage, each side has found it expedient to use the motorcycles\u2019 mobility to maneuver small assault units quickly.\nThe breakthrough also illustrates the full extent of Ukraine\u2019s severe manpower problems. Russia\u2019s \u201cTriple Chokehold\u201d tactic \u2014 using a combination of small assault units, FPV drones, and glide bombs in tandem \u2014 has maintained near constant pressure on Ukrainian troops all across the front line. Fierce offensives over the past several months have spiked casualties on both sides, but Ukraine\u2019s much smaller population is less able to cope.\nAnalysts have pointed out for months that Ukraine has increasingly relied on drones for flexible defense, with defensive lines manned by increasingly small teams. The weekend\u2019s developments show the catastrophic effect of a collection of those teams being taken out, with Russian formations able to pour through the breakthrough. A lack of Ukrainian reserves prevents them from plugging severe breaks in the line.\nZELENSKY POURS COLD WATER ON TRUMP\u2019S ALASKA PEACE TALKS, REJECTS LAND SWAP\nAs OSINT analyst Pasi Paroinen pointed out, Ukraine\u2019s lack of operational reserves means it must take reinforcements from other parts of the line, weakening those parts for Russia to exploit.\nThe increasingly critical situation for Ukraine leaves it in a worsening spot as Trump and Putin travel to Alaska to discuss the future of the war and Ukraine itself."
