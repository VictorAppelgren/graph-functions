      "feedback": "The draft is a solid first‑pass but falls short of the Argos “elite” bar in several ways:\n\n1. **Causal depth & first‑principles** – The narrative jumps from Fed cuts to mortgage spreads without anchoring in real‑rate differentials, term‑premium dynamics, or the Fed’s reaction function. Add a concise causal chain: (i) Fed policy → 10‑yr yield → real‑rate differential (UST‑10y – US‑inflation) → mortgage spread; (ii) Balance‑sheet contraction → term‑premium shift → spread. Cite the Fed’s policy statement (BSV8LPNDM) and the Treasury yield data (LF0UUL917) explicitly.\n\n2. **Handle mapping & magnitude** – Each claim must map to a canonical handle with a sign and magnitude. For example: “Fed cuts in 2025 will lower the 10‑yr yield by 10–20 bp → mortgage rate falls 10–20 bp” (handle: ust10y, mortgage_rate). Quantify the range and horizon (2025‑26). Also map “inflation spike” to handle: us_core_cpi (positive shock → 5–10 bp rise).\n\n3. **Catalyst window** – The draft mentions 2024‑25 but lacks a precise window. Specify: “Fed policy decisions on 2025‑02‑01, 2025‑05‑01, 2025‑08‑01” and “CPI/ PCE releases every month” as the catalyst dates. Link each to the causal chain.\n\n4. **Scenario structure** – Present a base case, upside, downside in a table or bullet format, each with a clear transmission path and numeric impact. E.g., upside: 2025‑04 Fed rate cut → 10‑yr yield ↓15 bp → mortgage rate ↓15 bp. Downside: 2025‑07 CPI 3.5% → Fed pause → 10‑yr yield ↑10 bp → mortgage rate ↑10 bp.\n\n5. **Avoid generic platitudes** – Replace “Fed may cut rates” with the specific policy stance from BSV8LPNDM: “Fed likely to cut rates in Q2‑Q3 2025 if inflation remains below 2.5%.” Provide the source.\n\n6. **Citation density** – Every substantive claim must have an inline (ID) citation. The draft currently cites only BSV8LPNDM and LF0UUL917; add citations for the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction (e.g., a Bloomberg or Fed release ID if available) and for the term‑premium estimate (e.g., a Bloomberg Treasury analytics ID).\n\n7. **Alignment with SECTION FOCUS** – The draft is fine on horizon (multi‑year) but needs to explicitly state the structural anchors: real‑rate differential, term‑premium, BoP, policy reaction function. Add a short paragraph summarizing these anchors and how they drive the mortgage rate.\n\n8. **Drift check** – The sentence “The Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction, which has been a key driver of upward pressure on long‑term rates, continues to exert a modest drag on the mortgage_rate, keeping it above the 6 % floor” drifts from the core causal chain. Either re‑frame it to show how contraction → term‑premium → spread or remove it.\n\n**Actionable edit instructions**  \n- Insert a causal chain diagram (textual) linking Fed policy → ust10y → real‑rate diff → mortgage_rate.  \n- Add a table of scenarios with dates, catalyst, impact on ust10y, mortgage_rate, and magnitude (bp).  \n- Map each claim to canonical handles (ust10y, mortgage_rate, us_core_cpi) with sign and range.  \n- Cite BSV8LPNDM for Fed policy stance, LF0UUL917 for current rates, and add a new ID for the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction data.  \n- Remove or re‑frame the drift sentence about the balance‑sheet contraction.  \n- Conclude with a concise confidence rating (e.g., “moderate”) and a watch list of specific data releases (Fed minutes, CPI, Treasury yields).",
