  "description": "",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2018s former personal attorney Michael Cohen has predicted that Trump might set his sights on the fortune of tech magnate Elon Musk following their recent spat.\n\nWhat Happened: Cohen thinks Trump\u2019s jealousy of Musk\u2019s position as the wealthiest man in the world could drive him to target Musk\u2019s wealth.\n\nMusk, who is the CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, had earlier contributed $250 million to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and was chosen to spearhead a cost-reduction initiative under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nEarlier speaking with MSNBC, Cohen said, \"I said from the very start that this bromance was going to come to an end. I'm going to go one step even further, again, and I'm going to say Trump will ultimately go after Elon's money next because it bothers him that he is the richest man in the world.\"\n\nCohen, now a prominent critic of Trump, speculates that Trump could utilize DOGE to probe how Musk and his businesses \u201cexploited the United States of America\u201d and try to \u201creclaim\u201d government subsidies given to Tesla.\n\nAlso Read: Ex-Trump Lawyer Sent This Message To Elon Musk After Feud With Donald Trump Erupted\n\nHowever, White House communications director Steven Cheung dismissed Cohen\u2019s forecasts, describing him as a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d person spreading \u201cfalsehoods and deception\u201d.\n\nWhy It Matters: The conjecture by Cohen, if it materializes, could lead to a significant shift in the dynamics between Trump and Musk.\n\nThe latter\u2019s wealth, largely attributed to his leadership at Tesla, has been a subject of public interest. Musk\u2019s contribution to Trump\u2019s campaign and his role in DOGE further intertwine their professional relationship.\n\nAny action by Trump targeting Musk\u2019s fortune could potentially impact Tesla\u2019s operations and its standing in the market. However, these are mere predictions at this point, and it remains to be seen how the situation unfolds.\n\nEx-Trump Family Attorney Raises Alarms Over Trump's Actions as President: \u2018I Have Never Been As Concerned'",

  "summary": "Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, has predicted that Donald Trump may target Elon Musk's billions of dollars following a spat between the two men. Cohen believes that Trump's jealousy of Musk's position as the wealthiest man in the world could motivate him to target Musk's wealth. He also suggested that Trump could use this money to investigate how Musk and his businesses exploited the United States of America and try to reclaim government subsidies given to Tesla. However, White House communications director Steven Cheung dismissed Cohen's predictions, describing him as a \"deeply disturbed\" person spreading \"falsehoods and deception\". Cohen's prediction could potentially impact Tesla's operations and its standing in the market.",

      "text": "- Michael Cohen offers a helping hand to Elon Musk in his escalating battle with Donald Trump.\n- Musk's public denouncement of Trump's policies stirs potential upheaval in tech and political circles.\n- The next correction is closer than you think. Find out how Tom Gentile plans to trade it, live on Wednesday.\nIn the midst of a public spat with President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc., has received an unexpected offer of support from Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney.\nWhat Happened: Last month Cohen reached out to Musk following a series of heated exchanges between the Tesla CEO and President Trump on social media.\nMusk, who was once a strong supporter of Trump and even headed the Department of Government Efficiency, publicly denounced Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s criticism of Trump, which included allegations of the president\u2019s involvement in the Epstein files, and his claim that the Republicans would not have won the 2024 elections without his support, could have far-reaching effects on the tech industry, the business world, and American politics, considering the significant influence wielded by both Trump and Musk.\nCohen, who had his own public disagreement with Trump and served a prison sentence for various charges, has since become a vocal critic of the president.\nHe reached out to Musk on X, with a message: \u201c@elonmusk I told you this would happen. If you want to know how to fight political guerrilla warfare, DM me! Otherwise, you lose.\u201d\nIn a subsequent Substack post, Cohen cautioned Musk that Trump has \u201cthe full weight of the federal government behind him,\u201d and that Musk \u201cmade the classic mistake of believing he was untouchable.\u201d\n\u201cLet me make something crystal clear: no one; not Bannon, not Jared, not Rudy, not me, and definitely not Elon, has ever been more important to Trump than Trump. The \u2018bromance\u2019 is never about you. It\u2019s about what he can extract from you. Your loyalty. Your power. Your credibility. Your money. And when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s not just over; it\u2019s scorched earth,\u201d he wrote in the Substack.\nThe public feud between Musk and Trump is not just a personal disagreement. It has the potential to impact the tech industry and the broader business sector, given the substantial influence both individuals have.\nCohen\u2019s offer to assist Musk in navigating this political minefield could signal a shift in alliances and power dynamics, with potential implications for future political and business developments.\nRead Next\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- Abbe Lowell raises alarm over potential damage Trump's actions could pose to U.S. institutions.\n- Lowell & Associates attracts key figures in fight to uphold constitutional checks and balances.\n- Get special access to three exclusive \"Top 10 Stocks\" power lists today, updated daily.\nAbbe Lowell, a prominent lawyer who has represented members of President Donald Trump\u2018s family, expressed serious concerns about the potential harm that the current administration could cause to the country\u2019s institutions.\nWhat Happened: Lowell, who defended Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump during Robert Mueller\u2018s Russian investigation, has voiced concerns about the pressure the White House is putting on the nation\u2019s institutions.\nLowell fears that these institutions may not be able to withstand the current strain. Speaking with the Financial Times, Lowell said, \u201cI have never been as concerned as to whether our system can withstand the pressure it is being put to.\"\nHe also said that the White House is \"pushing the tree to the point that it could break,\" noting that during Trump's first term, critics of the president said democracy was \"tested but didn't break.\"\nLowell, who has also represented prominent Democrats like Bill Clinton and Hunter Biden, was hired by Kushner and Ivanka in 2017 as the Russia investigation escalated. He is now warning that Trump\u2019s actions in his second term could break the constitutional \u201cwall\u201d that separates the courts from executive power.\n\"The crack you put in the wall today becomes the gash tomorrow,\" Lowell told Congress back in 1998. Reflecting on that now, he told the outlet, \"That wasn't a bad prophecy\u2014the structure is more than cracked, though not yet crumbled.\"\nLowell has established Lowell & Associates to fight against what he calls government \u201cover-reach,\u201d and has already attracted several defectors from other law firms.\nHis clients include New York Attorney General Letitia James and former DHS official Miles Taylor, who are both hoping that Lowell\u2019s aggressive approach can counter a series of executive orders targeting various institutions.\nWhy It Matters: Lowell\u2019s concerns highlight the increasing tension between the executive branch and the nation\u2019s institutions.\nHis strategy of building cases on First Amendment grounds, rather than presidential authority, could be crucial in challenging the administration, especially given a Supreme Court that \u201cbelieves in an executive branch with broad power.\u201d\nLowell\u2019s new firm, Lowell & Associates, could play a significant role in this battle, especially with high-profile clients like Letitia James and Miles Taylor on board.\nAs the pressure on the nation\u2019s institutions continues to mount, the legal strategies employed by Lowell and his team could have far-reaching implications for the balance of power in the U.S.\nRead Next\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.
