      "feedback": "The draft strengths are clear Regime A framing and Ford-specific microdata, but the causal chain should be tightened into a single, testable model (Regime A → inflation → higher discount rates and risk premia → Ford cash-flow impacts from EV drag, capex constraints, and margin pressure) with explicit first-principles links to revenue, margin, and ROIC; prune or clearly label GM content as a benchmark to preserve strict Ford focus, otherwise it muddies horizon and causal reasoning; formalize a three- or four-scenario structure (Base/Bull/Bear, plus a regime-transition invalidation) with explicit triggers and clear invalidation criteria (e.g., near-term tariff outcome on July 9, Jackson Hole guidance, Orion/Fairfax/FZ ramp milestones; EV-margin inflection and battery-cost trajectory as longer-term catalysts) and define what constitutes a break from the scenario; quantify every qualitative claim by anchoring to numbers in the sources (EV drag ~$1.3B in Q2, Ford margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10%, yield ~5%, forward P/E ~8–10x with some sources up to 10.3x, tariff regime specifics around 25% in the GM example) and attach in-text IDs to each, while reconciling any conflicts by choosing the most credible anchor or by presenting a transparent band; fix the citation discipline so every fact with a numeric claim carries an ID and ensure critical signals (tariff outcome, Jackson Hole language, 13F moves by Berkshire, EV-margin trajectory) are explicitly tracked as the near-term catalysts; finally, ensure alignment with SECTION FOCUS by delivering four items only if you exercise the Up/Down format, each line strictly in the form Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability% with concrete numbers, and keep every sentence compact and one-shot to avoid filler.",
