  "description": "Israel's political-security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City, as the country expands its military operations despite intensifying criticism.",
  "content": "JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Israel's political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take control of Gaza City, as the country expands its military operations despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating almost two-year-old war.\n\n\"The IDF will prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, referring to the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\nWhile Netanyahu said on Thursday Israel intended to take military control of the entire Gaza Strip, the plan approved on Friday focused specifically on Gaza City, the largest city in the enclave, located in its north.\n\nAxios reporter Barak Ravid, citing an Israeli official, said on X the plan involved evacuating Palestinian civilians from Gaza City and launching a ground offensive there.\n\nAsked if Israel would take over the entire coastal territory, Netanyahu told Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill Hemmer in an interview on Thursday: \"We intend to.\"\n\nBut he said Israel wanted to hand over the territory to Arab forces that would govern it. He did not elaborate on the governance arrangements or which Arab countries could be involved.\n\n\"We don't want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don't want to govern it. We don't want to be there as a governing body,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli officials described a previous meeting this week with the head of the military as tense, saying military chief Eyal Zamir had pushed back on expanding Israel's campaign.\n\nAmong the scenarios being considered ahead of the security meeting was a phased takeover of areas in Gaza not yet under military control, one government source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEvacuation warnings could be issued to Palestinians in specific areas of Gaza, potentially giving them several weeks before the military moves in, the person added.\n\nIn its Friday statement, Netanyahu's office said the vast majority of the political-security cabinet members believed that \"the alternative plan presented in the cabinet would not achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages.\"\n\nTwo government sources said any resolution by the security cabinet would need to be approved by the full cabinet, which may not meet until Sunday.\n\nTotal control of the territory would reverse a 2005 decision by Israel by which it withdrew Israeli citizens and soldiers from Gaza, while retaining control over its borders, airspace and utilities.\n\nRight-wing parties blame that withdrawal decision for the militant Palestinian group Hamas gaining power there in a 2006 election.\n\nIt was unclear whether Netanyahu was foreseeing a prolonged takeover or a short-term operation. Israel has repeatedly said it aims to dismantle Hamas and free Israeli hostages.\n\nHamas in a statement called Netanyahu's comments \"a blatant coup\" against the negotiation process.\n\n\"Netanyahu's plans to expand the aggression confirm beyond any doubt that he seeks to get rid of his captives and sacrifice them,\" the statement said.\n\nArab countries would \"only support what Palestinians agree and decide on,\" a Jordanian official source told Reuters, adding that security in Gaza should be handled through \"legitimate Palestinian institutions.\"\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera the group would treat any force formed to govern Gaza as an \"occupying\" force linked to Israel.\n\nEarlier this year, Israel and the United States rejected an Egyptian proposal, backed by Arab leaders, that envisaged the creation of an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the war.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis want the war to end in a deal that would see the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment. President Donald Trump has declined to say whether he supported or opposed a potential full military takeover of Gaza by Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government has insisted on total victory over Hamas, which ignited the war when it staged a deadly October 2023 attack on Israel from Gaza.\n\nThe U.N. has called reports about a possible expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza \"deeply alarming\" if true.\n\nThe idea, pushed especially by far-right ministers in Netanyahu's coalition, of Israeli forces moving into areas they do not already hold in the enclave has also generated alarm in Israel.\n\nThere are 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of whom Israeli officials believe 20 are alive. Most of those freed so far emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.\n\nA senior Palestinian official said Hamas had told Arab mediators an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza would lead to a resumption in ceasefire negotiations.\n\nIsraeli officials accuse Hamas of seizing aid to hand to its fighters and to sell to finance its operations, accusations the militant group denies.\n\nVideos released last week of two living hostages showed them emaciated and frail, stirring international condemnation.\n\nRecent images of starving children from Gaza have also shocked the world and fuelled international criticism of Israel over the sharply worsening conditions in the enclave.\n\nHamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but now controls only fragmented parts, insists any deal must lead to a permanent end to the war. Israel says the group has no intention of going through with promises to give up power afterwards.",

      "text": "Gaza death toll hits 60,000 as global monitor demands action to avert famine\nFamine fears and the new death toll are grim milestones in a conflict that began almost two years ago when Hamas attacked Israel.\n- Officials in the Hamas-controlled Gaza strip say the war has now killed 60,000 Palestinians.\n- Israel says 5,000 aid trucks entered Gaza in two months.\n- The new Palestinian toll does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Thousands more bodies are believed to be buried under rubble.\nCAIRO \u2212 A worst-case scenario of famine is unfolding in Gaza and immediate action is needed to avoid widespread death, a hunger monitor warned on Tuesday, as the number of Palestinians reported killed in the conflict with Israel crossed the 60,000 threshold.\nThe hunger alert and the new death toll are grim milestones in a conflict that began almost two years ago when Hamas attacked Israel, sparking an offensive that has laid waste to much of the enclave and ignited hostilities across the region.\nThe alert by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) raised the prospect that the man-made starvation crisis in Gaza could be formally classified as a famine, in the hope that this might raise the pressure on Israel to let in far more food.\nStarvation, malnutrition, disease\nWith international criticism growing, Israel announced steps over the weekend to ease aid access. But the World Food Program (WFP) said July 29 it was not getting the permissions it needed to deliver enough aid since Israel began humanitarian pauses on Sunday.\n\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths,\" the IPC said, adding that \"famine thresholds\" have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip.\nIt said it would quickly carry out the formal analysis that could allow it to classify Gaza as \"in famine.\"\nFor famine to be declared, at least 20% of the population must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\nGaza health authorities have been reporting more and more people dying from hunger-related causes. The total stands at 147, among them 88 children, most of whom died in the last few weeks.\nImages of emaciated Palestinian children have shocked the world, with Israel's strongest ally, President Donald Trump, declaring that many people were starving. He promised to set up new \"food centers.\"\nIsrael has denied pursuing a policy of starvation. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Tuesday that the situation in Gaza was \"tough\" but there were lies about starvation there.\nDeadliest conflict\nThe death toll of 60,000 announced by Gaza health authorities, whose figures are often cited by the U.N. and have previously described as reliable by the World Health Organization, underlines this as the deadliest war in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe previous deadliest conflict between Israel and the Hamas Islamist group - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 - was in 2014, when 2,100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, while Israel lost 67 soldiers and six civilians.\nIsrael launched its latest offensive in response to Hamas' attacks on October 7, 2023, when militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage - Israel's deadliest ever day.\nThe new Palestinian toll does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Thousands more bodies are believed to be buried under rubble, meaning the true toll is likely to be significantly higher, Palestinian officials and rescue workers say.\nIsraeli airstrikes overnight killed at least 30 Palestinians in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, Gaza health authorities said. Doctors at Al-Awda Hospital said at least 14 women and 12 children were among the dead.\nThe hospital also said that 13 people had been killed and dozens wounded by Israeli fire along the Salahudeen Road as they waited for aid trucks to roll into Gaza.\nA total of 55 Palestinians were killed in attacks overnight, Gaza health authorities said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFifty of the hostages seized on October 7 remain in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be alive.\nThe latest talks aimed at securing a ceasefire and freeing the hostages collapsed last week. Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel would keep fighting until the hostages were freed and Hamas' military and governing capabilities destroyed.\nOnly half of food aid approved\nSaar said 5,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the last two months, and that Israel would assist those wanting to conduct airdrops - a delivery method that aid groups say is ineffective and tokenistic.\nRoss Smith, a senior regional programme adviser at the World Food Program, told reporters in Geneva by video: \"We're getting approximately 50% of what we're requesting into Gaza since these humanitarian pauses started on Sunday.\n\"We are not going to be able to address the needs of the population unless we can move in the volume that we need.\"\nAfter an 11-week Israeli blockade, limited U.N.-led aid operations resumed on May 19 and a week later the obscure new U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - backed by Israel and the United States - began distributing food aid.\nThe rival efforts have sparked a war of words - pitting Israel, the U.S. and the GHF against the U.N., international aid groups and dozens of governments from around the world.\nIsrael and the U.S. accuse Hamas of stealing aid - which the militants deny - and the U.N. of failing to prevent it. The U.N. says it has not seen evidence of Hamas diverting much aid. Hamas accuses Israel of causing starvation and using aid as a weapon.\nThe IPC said 88% of Gaza was now under evacuation orders or within militarized areas, and was critical of GHF efforts.\nIt said most of the GHF food items \"require water and fuel to cook, which are largely unavailable.\"\nThe IPC's Famine Review Committee said: \"Our analysis of the food packages supplied by the GHF shows that their distribution plan would lead to mass starvation.\"\nGHF said its aid boxes are based on the same ingredient lists used by other aid groups and meet standards for total calories and nutritional value."

      "text": "One meal a day. $20 for an egg. Choosing which kid gets fed. Starvation stalks Gaza\nOne meal a day. Forced to choose which of her kids get fed. In the market, because all the banks are closed and there is a cash liquidity crisis, $20 for a single egg; $1,400 for a bag of flour that might last 20 days.\nSuch is the plight of Gazans like Amal Nassar, 35, an English teacher from Deir Al-Balah in the central part of the Palestinian enclave. Nassar, her three children and her husband are among more than 2 million Gazans who remain trapped almost two years since the war that began after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\"We don't have enough to eat,\" Nassar said in a WhatsApp message over the weekend. USA TODAY has written about Nassar's story of giving birth to her daughter Mira in a war zone without access to pain relief.\nOn July 28, for the second day running, Israel paused its military operations in Gaza to \"improve the humanitarian response.\" That follows a series of alarming warnings from world leaders and global officials, from the United Nations' World Health Organization and from dozens of humanitarian agencies that malnutrition and even starvation in Gaza is on a \"dangerous trajectory.\"\nThe United Nations' World Food Programme says a third of Gaza's population does not eat for several days at a time. One in 4 Gazans, it says, are \"enduring famine-like conditions.\" The Hamas-run health ministry, the chief source of health data in Gaza, says more than 100 people have died from malnutrition in recent days.\nIsrael disputes claims it is intentionally starving Gazans\nIsrael has rejected claims that it is intentionally starving Gaza's population. It accuses the United Nations of failing to collect and distribute aid sitting on Gaza's border. For nearly two years, it has also accused Hamas of stealing aid for Gaza's desperate and hungry population and using it as a weapon of control.\n\"There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said July 28. He called those suggestions a \"bold-faced lie,\" prompting a response from President Donald Trump while he was on a trip to Scotland.\n\"From what I see on TV, I can say those kids look starving,\" Trump said. ''We\u2019re sending a lot of money and a lot of food. The children in Gaza must receive food and security immediately.\"\nGoing hungry in Gaza\nRecent reports indicate there's not much evidence of systematic Hamas aid theft. Amid growing international pressure, Israel has allowed the United Arab Emirates and Jordan to resume aid drops of flour, sugar and canned foods in Gaza. But aid workers say airdrops are not as effective as convoys of trucks.\nEven large transport planes can't carry as much aid as truck convoys. They can also be dangerous. It's not uncommon for aid dropped from planes to injure or even kill people who are trying to get to them.\n\"We need more food to be able to enter Gaza,\" said Beckie Ryan, the Gaza response director for CARE, an aid group. Ryan is in Deir Al-Balah, where CARE runs a health clinic. She said \"everyone is hungry.\" Her clinic has seen a spike in cases of children who are either malnourished or acutely malnourished, she said, and soaring summer temperatures combined with limited water supplies are making things worse.\nRyan also said cases like Nassar's were fairly typical in Gaza right now. Most people are limited to one meal a day. They are having to chose which of their children gets food. Because no cash has been allowed into Gaza for almost two years and markets accept only cash, those who are still lucky enough to be earning a salary are having to pay as much as double to effectively buy the cash they need to pay for the limited goods for sale.\nRyan said there are \"multiple layers\" that explain why it has been so hard to get food to Gazans. But the most important thing is \"access to the thousands of trucks that are sitting in Egypt and Jordan,\" she said. \"It's the quickest and most efficient way. Right now our ability to move those trucks is extremely limited.\"\nFor Nasser, where the food comes from or who's to blame for the lack of it is of secondary importance.\nShe said she and her husband don't dare go near distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American contractor. They are too scared. It is backed by the United States and Israel but not the United Nations. The international body has reported hundreds of deaths of Palestinians trying to access these centers. Some of those deaths have been linked, by the United Nations, to Israeli gunfire and shelling; the foundation has accused the United Nations of using \"false and exaggerated statistics\" over the deaths.\nNasser said weeks can go by without her family eating a single piece of fresh fruit or a vegetable. She said one diaper for her daughter, Mira, can cost as much as $10 with the extra fees for cash. She uses plastic bags when she can't afford diapers, but they give Mira rashes that bleed. She said she constantly worries about her children, and they are losing weight. She herself is newly pregnant, exhausted and often feels dizzy.\n\"Our situation,\" she said, \"is really horrible.\""

      "text": "'Every ounce of food': Trump presses Israel on starvation in Gaza; 'children look very hungry'\nPresident Trump disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that no starvation is taking place among the people of Gaza.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 President Donald Trump said he disagrees with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that no starvation is taking place among the people of Gaza, and urged Israel to let more food in.\n\"Those children look very hungry,\" Trump said July 28 when asked by a reporter whether he agrees with Netanyahu's assessment. \"But we're giving a lot of money and a lot of food, and other nations are now stepping up.\"\n\u201cI want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food,'' he said.\nTrump made the remarks ahead of a bilateral meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Turnberry, Scotland, where the second-term U.S. president arrived July 25 for a four-day trip.\nAs images of emaciated children in Gaza have alarmed the world, Netanyahu denied Israel is conducting a starvation campaign, calling such accusations a \"bold-faced lie\" and even rejecting that starvation is occurring.\n\u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza and there is no starvation in Gaza,\" Netanyahu said July 27.\nThe Gaza health ministry said July 28 that at least 14 people had died in the past 24 hours of starvation and malnutrition, bringing the war's death toll from hunger to 147, including 89 children, most of them in just the last few weeks.\nTo help get additional food into Gaza, Israel on July 27 announced a halt in military operations for 10 hours a day in parts of Gaza and new aid corridors as Jordan and the United Arab Emirates airdropped supplies into the enclave.\nTrump, speaking alongside Starmer at his golf resort, said the United States had provided $60 million for humanitarian aid, and other nations would have to step up.\nTrump said he discussed the Gaza conflict with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on July 27, and she told him European countries would ramp up their assistance.\nStarmer called the mounting starvation in Gaza a \"humanitarian crisis\" and an \"absolute catastrophe,\" adding that \"the people in Britain are revolted by what they're seeing on their screens.\"\nIsrael cut off all supplies to Gaza from the start of March and reopened the territory with new restrictions in May. Israel says it abides by international law but must prevent aid from being diverted by militants, and it blames Hamas for the suffering of Gaza's people.\n\"You have a lot of starving people,\" Trump said, later criticizing the Hamas militant group for not agreeing to release more Israeli hostages, living and dead. Trump said he told Netanyahu that Israel's approach would likely have to change.\n\"I told Bibi that you have to maybe do it a different way.\"\nContributing: Reuters\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Terrible thirst hits Gaza with polluted aquifers and broken pipelines\nGAZA/CAIRO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Weakened by hunger, many Gazans trek across a ruined landscape each day to haul all their drinking and washing water - a painful load that is still far below the levels needed to keep people healthy.\nEven as global attention has turned to starvation in Gaza, where after 22 months of a devastating Israeli military campaign a global hunger monitor says a famine scenario is unfolding, the water crisis is just as severe according to aid groups.\nThough some water comes from small desalination units run by aid agencies, most is drawn from wells in a brackish aquifer that has been further polluted by sewage and chemicals seeping through the rubble, spreading diarrhoea and hepatitis.\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency responsible for coordinating aid in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, says it operates two water pipelines into the Gaza Strip providing millions of litres of water a day.\nPalestinian water officials say these have not been working recently.\nIsrael stopped all water and electricity supply to Gaza early in the war but resumed some supply later though the pipeline network in the territory has been badly damaged.\nMost water and sanitation infrastructure has been destroyed and pumps from the aquifer often rely on electricity from small generators - for which fuel is rarely available.\nCOGAT said the Israeli military has allowed coordination with aid organisations to bring in equipment to maintain water infrastructure throughout the conflict.\nMoaz Mukhaimar, aged 23 and a university student before the war, said he has to walk about a kilometre, queuing for two hours, to fetch water. He often goes three times a day, dragging it back to the family tent over bumpy ground on a small metal handcart.\n\"How long will we have to stay like this?\" he asked, pulling two larger canisters of very brackish water to use for cleaning and two smaller ones of cleaner water to drink.\nHis mother, Umm Moaz, 53, said the water he collects is needed for the extended family of 20 people living in their small group of tents in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.\n\"The children keep coming and going and it is hot. They keep wanting to drink. Who knows if tomorrow we will be able to fill up again,\" she said.\nTheir struggle for water is replicated across the tiny, crowded territory where nearly everybody is living in temporary shelters or tents without sewage or hygiene facilities and not enough water to drink, cook and wash as disease spreads.\nThe United Nations says the minimum emergency level of water consumption per person is 15 litres a day for drinking, cooking, cleaning and washing. Average daily consumption in Israel is around 247 litres a day according to Israeli rights group B'Tselem.\nBushra Khalidi, humanitarian policy lead for aid agency Oxfam in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories said the average consumption in Gaza now was 3-5 litres a day.\nOxfam said last week that preventable and treatable water-borne diseases were \"ripping through Gaza\", with reported rates increasing by almost 150% over the past three months.\nIsrael blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza and says it provides adequate aid for the territory's 2.3 million inhabitants.\nQUEUES FOR WATER\n\"Water scarcity is definitely increasing very much each day and people are basically rationing between either they want to use water for drinking or they want to use a lot for hygiene,\" said Danish Malik, a global water and sanitation official for the Norwegian Refugee Council.\nMerely queuing for water and carrying it now accounts for hours each day for many Gazans, often involving jostling with others for a place in the queue. Scuffles have sometimes broken out, Gazans say.\nCollecting water is often the job of children as their parents seek out food or other necessities.\n\"The children have lost their childhood and become carriers of plastic containers, running behind water vehicles or going far into remote areas to fill them for their families,\" said Munther Salem, water resources head at the Gaza Water and Environment Quality Authority.\nWith water so hard to get, many people living near the beach wash in the sea.\nA new water pipeline funded by the United Arab Emirates is planned, to serve 600,000 people in southern Gaza from a desalination plant in Egypt. But it could take several more weeks to be connected.\nMuch more is needed, aid agencies say. UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said the long-term deprivations were becoming deadly. \"Starvation and dehydration are no longer side effects of this conflict. They are very much frontline effects.\"\nOxfam's Khalidi said a ceasefire and unfettered access for aid agencies was needed to resolve the crisis.\n\"Otherwise we will see people dying from the most preventable diseases in Gaza - which is already happening before our eyes.\"\n(Reporting by Ramadan Abed in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo and Olivia Le Poidevin in Geneva; writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene calls crisis in Gaza 'genocide,' first Republican lawmaker to do so\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said there is a \"genocide\" happening in Gaza, becoming the first Republican lawmaker to use the term to describe the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the enclave.\n\"It\u2019s the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza,\" Greene wrote on X.\nHers is an uncommon statement in a caucus that has rallied around Israel since October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.\nIsrael has strongly rejected claims that the country is perpetuating a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nRecently the Israeli military announced it would pause action in certain parts of Gaza for hours each day and increase aid drops in the enclave. Reports of mass starvation have spread since Israel first cut off supplies to the region in March, then reopened aid lines, with new restrictions, in May.\nMore than 125 people have died due to malnutrition, including 85 children, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said over the weekend. A 5-month-old baby, Zainab Abu Haleeb, died of malnutrition at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza on July 26.\nIn recent weeks, more than 800 people have been killed while trying to reach food, according to the United Nations, mostly in shootings by Israeli soldiers posted near controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution centers.\n\"I can unequivocally say that what happened to innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th was horrific,\" Greene wrote in an earlier social media post over the weekend. \"Just as I can unequivocally say that what has been happening to innocent people and children in Gaza is horrific.\"\n\"This war and humanitarian crisis must end!\"\nHer post on July 28 calling Israel's attack on Gaza a genocide was part of a direct criticism of her Republican colleague Rep. Randy Fine, who was elected in April to fill the seat vacated by former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.\nFine, a Jewish member of Congress and staunch defender of Israel, has been outspoken on social media, denying the crisis in Gaza in multiple posts and writing in another, \"starve away.\""

      "text": "Netanyahu wants full military control of Gaza, Hamas calls it a 'coup'\nThe U.N. has called reports about a possible expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza \"deeply alarming.\"\n- The U.S. State Department didn't take an immediate stand on Netanyahu's comment. A spokesman said Washington is focused on getting aid into Gaza and securing the return of hostages held by Hamas.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The State Department declined to take a stand on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to take full control of Gaza, focusing instead on a humanitarian aid plan for the war-torn Palestinian territory and securing the return of hostages held by Hamas.\n\"There can be no long-term prosperity with Hamas as a governing force, or otherwise, within Gaza,\" department spokesman Tommy Piggot said on August 7. \"So that's what our policy, that's where our focus is.\"\nNetanyahu said Israel intends to take military control of all of Gaza, despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating almost two-year-old war in the Palestinian enclave.\n\"We intend to,\" Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill Hemmer when asked if Israel would take over the entire coastal territory. \"We don't want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don't want to govern it. We don't want to be there as a governing body.\"\nNetanyahu made the comments to Fox News shortly before a meeting he was due to have on August 7 with a small group of senior ministers to discuss plans for the military to take control of more territory in Gaza.\nNetanyahu convened the security cabinet following a three-hour meeting this week with the head of the military, which Israeli officials described as tense, saying the military chief had pushed back on expanding the campaign.\nThe militant Islamist group Hamas called Netanyahu's statement \"a coup\" amid ceasefire negotiations.\nOpinion polls show that most Israelis want the war to end in a deal that would see the release of the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's government has insisted on total victory over Hamas, which ignited the war with its deadly October 2023 attack on Israel.\nThe idea of Israeli forces pushing into areas they does not already control in the shattered Palestinian enclave has generated alarm in Israel. The mother of one hostage on August 7 urged people to take to the streets to voice their opposition to expanding the campaign.\n\"Someone who talks about a comprehensive deal doesn\u2019t go and conquer the Strip and put hostages and soldiers in danger,\" Einav Zangauker wrote on X in comments directed at Netanyahu.\nThe Hostages Families Forum, which represents captives held in Gaza, urged military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir to oppose expanding the war and called on the government to accept a deal that would bring the war to an end and free the remaining hostages.\nDefence Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that the military would carry out the government\u2019s decisions until all war objectives were achieved. Israeli leaders have long insisted that Hamas be disarmed and have no future role in a demilitarised Gaza and that the hostages be freed.\nThe U.N. has called reports about a possible expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza \"deeply alarming\" if true.\nThere are 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of whom Israeli officials believe 20 are alive. Most of those freed so far came about as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen some hostages released collapsed in July.\nA senior Palestinian official said Hamas had told Arab mediators that an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza would lead to a resumption in ceasefire negotiations.\nIsraeli officials accuse Hamas of seizing aid to hand out to its fighters and to sell in Gazan markets to finance its operations, accusations that the militant group denies.\nVideos released last week of two living hostages showed them emaciated and frail, triggering international condemnation.\nHamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but now controls only parts, insists any deal must lead to a permanent end to the war. Israel says the group has no intention of going through with promises to give up power afterwards.\nThe Israeli military says it controls about 75% of Gaza. Most of Gaza's population of about 2 million has been displaced multiple times over the past 22 months and aid groups are warning that the enclave's residents are on the verge of famine.\n'A homeless beggar'\n\"Where should we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough,\" said Aya Mohammad, 30, who, after repeated displacement, has returned with her family to their community in Gaza City.\n\"You know what displacement is? Does the world know? It means your dignity is wiped out, you become a homeless beggar, searching for food, water and medicine,\" she told Reuters.\nClose to 200 Palestinians have died of starvation in Gaza since the war began, nearly half of them have been children, according to Gaza's health ministry.\nRabeeha Jamal, 65, a mother of six, has remained in her house in Gaza despite warnings in the past from the Israeli military to leave. For now, she said she intends to stay.\n\"Not until they force us, if the tanks roll in, otherwise, I will not go running in the street to be killed later,\" she said, calling for an end to the war. \"We don't have anywhere to go.\"\nNetanyahu is under intense international pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement, but he also faces internal pressure from within his coalition to continue the war. Some far-right allies in his government have pushed for a full occupation of Gaza and for Israel to reestablish settlements there, two decades after it withdrew.\nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told reporters August 6 he hoped the government would approve the military taking control over the rest of Gaza.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken to Gaza in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israeli communities.\nMore than 61,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel's assault on Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, which said 98 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire across the enclave in the past 24 hours.\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "Israel says it will allow controlled entry of goods into Gaza via merchants\nAug 5 (Reuters) - Israel says it will allow gradual and controlled entry of goods to Gaza through local merchants, an Israeli military agency that coordinates aid said on Tuesday, as global monitors say famine is unfolding in the enclave, impacting the hostages Hamas holds.\nIsrael's COGAT said a mechanism has been approved by the cabinet to expand the scope of humanitarian aid, allowing the entry of supplies to Gaza through the private sector.\nThe agency said the approved goods include basic food products, baby food, fruits and vegetables, and hygiene supplies.\n\"This aims to increase the volume of aid entering the Gaza Strip, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the U.N. and international organisations,\" it added.\nIt was unclear how this aid operation would work given the widespread destruction in Gaza.\nPalestinian and U.N. officials say Gaza needs around 600 aid trucks to enter per day to meet the humanitarian requirements - the number Israel used to allow into Gaza before the war.\nImages of starving Palestinians including children have alarmed the world in recent weeks, while a video released by Hamas on Sunday showing an emaciated captive drew sharp criticism from Western powers.\nIsrael in response to a rising international uproar, announced last week steps to let more aid reach Gaza, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, approving air drops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys.\nHamas said it was prepared to coordinate with the Red Cross to deliver aid to hostages it holds in Gaza, if Israel permanently opens humanitarian corridors and halts airstrikes during the distribution of aid.\nIsrael and the United States urged the U.N. in May to work through an organisation they back, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which employs a U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. veterans.\nThe U.N. refused as it questioned GHF neutrality and accused the distribution model of militarising aid and forcing displacement.\nPalestinians were killed near GHF sites where limited aid was distributed, with the U.N. estimating that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food since May, most near the organisation's distribution sites.\nGHF denies that there have been deadly incidents at its sites, and says the deadliest have been near other aid convoys.\nThe war in Gaza began when Hamas killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage in an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli figures.\nIsrael's offensive has since killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.\nAccording to Israeli officials, 50 hostages now remain in Gaza, only 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas, thus far, has barred humanitarian organisations from having any kind of access to the hostages and families have little or no details of their conditions.\n(Reporting by Alexander Cornwell; Writing by Tala Ramadan and Nayera Abdallah; Editing by Kim Coghill and Michael Perry)"
