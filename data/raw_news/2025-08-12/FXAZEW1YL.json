  "title": "ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.78",
  "description": "ConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.78 per share on the 2nd of September. This...",
  "content": "ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.78 per share on the 2nd of September. This means the annual payment will be 3.3% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Based on the last payment, ConocoPhillips was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 21.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 38% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ConocoPhillips\n\nAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.92 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.12. Dividend payments have grown at less than 1% a year over this period. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. ConocoPhillips has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 28% per annum. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that ConocoPhillips could prove to be a strong dividend payer.\n\nOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think ConocoPhillips might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for ConocoPhillips that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

AI outperforms humans in detecting diseases like cancer from scans, tailors treatments using genetic and lifestyle data, and streamlines hospital workflows with tools like predictive analytics and automated transcription. It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases. Despite challenges like data privacy, bias, and integration costs, AI\u2019s ability to improve accuracy, access, and affordability could save billions and extend lives, marking a seismic shift in
