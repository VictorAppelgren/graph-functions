      "feedback": "To lift this to world-class quality, clamp the four items to a single, crisply defined Up/Down format with strict adherence to the sources and a transparent, evidence-backed probabilistic view: rebuild the two Up lines and two Down lines as pure, one-sentence entries in the exact format you specified, each anchored to concrete, source-backed triggers (e.g., EV losses narrowing and a margin around the observed 4.3% EBIT, the $50B EV capex envelope through 2026, forward P/E ~10x and ~5% dividend yield, 95 deals/$12.9B in 2025, and the Moscow risk event with NL5YYTLF2) and tie every watch condition to a verifiable event or threshold from the material; ensure time windows are consistent (0–3 weeks, 3–6 months) and that Watch statements are precise (e.g., margin progress toward a durable level as per 22PL3Q360, policy-space activation per NL5YYTLF2, IPO momentum per Q7VVGNSQE) with probabilities calibrated to the strength and number of signals (avoid generic placeholders, and provide explicit bands like 40–60% for Up cases with multiple high-signal catalysts and 20–50% for Down cases with macro/regime risk). Strengthen first-principles grounding by embedding Ford’s ROIC, EV profitability dynamics, and capex discipline directly into the trigger logic (e.g., EV losses around $1.3B and ROIC ≈10.1% as the backbone for an inflection signal) and ensure the end-state rationale clearly maps to regime transitions (A→B→C) with explicit invalidation criteria (policy-space non-materialization within 6 quarters). Finally, tighten citation discipline so every numerical assertion or claim is accompanied by the exact IDs from the SOURCE MATERIAL (24–36-hour sanity check: ensure no non-sourced assertions slip in) and reconcile any potential conflicts (e.g., dividend dynamics vs. EV margin risk) within the same probabilistic framework.",
