  "content": "On Thursday, Eli Lilly and Co.\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) weight loss rival Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), along with smaller firms, Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:TERN), Viking Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX), and Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) are trading higher.\n\nLilly released topline data from the Phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial evaluating orforglipron that showed an average weight loss of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% (2.2 lbs) with placebo, below the 15% expectations. Orforglipron could be the first small-molecule weight-loss pill if it launches in 2026.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts described this as a \u201conce-in-a-blue-moon\u201d miss for Lilly\u2019s otherwise dominant obesity franchise. They highlighted that orforglipron\u2019s 9.1% placebo-adjusted weight loss at the 36 mg dose underperformed compared to weekly subcutaneous Wegovy, which delivers 12\u201313% weight loss.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Administration Plan Signals Shift Toward Weight-Loss Drug Coverage For Medicare Patients\n\nAdditionally, gastrointestinal side effects were comparable to Wegovy, but orforglipron had a higher treatment discontinuation rate (5.1\u201310.3% vs. 7.0% for Wegovy, 2.6% for placebo).\n\nThey also noted early plateauing of weight loss and persistent side effects as potential liabilities for orforglipron, as previously flagged during the ACHIEVE-1 presentation at the American Diabetes Association.\n\nThis rare underperformance opens the door for smaller biopharma competitors, analyst Andy Hsieh of William Blair noted.\n\n\u201cFrom a stock perspective, we believe that Eli Lilly\u2019s rare miss from its otherwise impenetrable obesity franchise could create an opening for smaller competitors,\u201d he added.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s oral semaglutide 25 mg achieved a 16.6% weight loss vs. a 2.7% reduction with placebo after 68 weeks. CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks in one study and 15.7% in another.\n\nViking is expected to report Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral results of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735 in obesity in the second half of 2025. Analyst Andy Hsieh expects the data readout could be as early as later this month.\n\nResults from a 28-day Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of VK2735 in healthy volunteers with a BMI \u226530 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 8.2%.\n\nPersistent weight loss effects were observed at follow-up visits through Day 57, ranging up to 8.3% from baseline, four weeks after the last dose of VK2735 was administered.\n\nStructure Therapeutics, which is advancing the oral small molecule aleniglipron that resembles orforglipron but with a shorter half-life, is expected to report results from two Phase 2 studies, ACCESS and ACCESS II, in the fourth quarter.",

Register Now \u2192\nOn Sunday, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published results from Novo Nordisk A/S\u2018 NVO phase 3 REDEFINE 1 trial of CagriSema plus lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with obesity or overweight who have a weight-related medical complication and without diabetes.\nCagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme).\nCagriSema is an investigational product that combines the GLP-1 RA, semaglutide, with an amylin analog, cagrilintide.\nREDEFINE 1 Trial\nIf all patients adhered to treatment, CagriSema resulted in a greater weight loss of 22.7% at 68 weeks versus 2.3% in the placebo group.\nWhen evaluating the treatment effect regardless of adherence, those treated with CagriSema achieved a statistically significant weight loss of 20.4% at 68 weeks versus 3.0% for the placebo group.\nIn addition, a supportive secondary analysis showed that half (50.7%) of trial participants with obesity treated with CagriSema reached the threshold for non-obesity (BMI < 30 kg/m2) at the end of treatment, from a mean BMI of 38 kg/m2 at the start of treatment.\nIn the placebo group,10.2% reached that threshold at 68 weeks.\nSelect confirmatory secondary endpoints showed that if all participants adhered to treatment, 40.4% of those receiving CagriSema achieved a weight reduction of \u226525%.\nAdditionally, 23.1% lost \u226530% of their body weight.\nWhen applying the treatment policy estimand, 34.7% of participants treated with CagriSema achieved \u226525% body-weight reduction, and 19.3% achieved \u226530%.\nIn a prespecified analysis of 252 participants, the relative reduction in fat and lean soft-tissue mass from baseline to week 68 was -35.7% (fat mass) and -14.4% (lean soft-tissue mass) for those treated with CagriSema versus \u20135.7% and \u20134.3% for the placebo group, respectively.\nThese data, along with the related phase 3 REDEFINE 2 study conducted in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes, were presented at the American Diabetes Association.\nREDEFINE 2 Study\nIf all participants adhered to treatment, the estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was \u201315.7% with CagriSema versus \u20133.1% with placebo.\nWhen applying the treatment policy estimand, the estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was \u201313.7% with CagriSema versus \u20133.4% with placebo.\nA greater proportion of participants receiving CagriSema, compared with placebo, reduced their body weight by >5% (83.6% vs. 30.8% of participants), \u226510% (65.6% vs. 10.3%), \u226515% (43.9% vs. 2.4%), and \u226520% (22.9% vs. 0.5%;)\nThe safety results from CagriSema in REDEFINE 2 were similar to those reported in the REDEFINE 1 trial.\nNovo Nordisk initiated the REDEFINE 11 trial with the first patient visit in early June 2025. REDEFINE 11 will explore further weight loss potential and safety of CagriSema 2.4 mg / 2.4 mg through a longer trial duration and other protocol changes compared to REDEFINE 1 and 2.\nMarket Reaction\nNVO experienced a decline of over 7% in premarket trading on Monday; the market\u2019s reaction suggests that Novo Nordisk\u2019s CagriSema has been perceived to have a less favorable side effect profile when compared to Eli Lilly And Co\u2019s LLY orforglipron.\nIn Eli Lilly\u2019s ACHIEVE-1 trial, the most common adverse events for participants treated with orforglipron (3 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg, respectively) were diarrhea (19%, 21% and 26%) vs. 9% with placebo, nausea (13%, 18% and 16%) vs. 2% with placebo, dyspepsia (11%, 20% and 15%) vs. 7% with placebo, constipation (8%, 17% and 14%) vs. 4% with placebo, and vomiting (5%, 7% and 14%) vs. 1% with placebo.\nIn REDEFINE 1, adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal (79.6% in the CagriSema group vs. 39.9% with placebo), including nausea (55% vs. 12.6 %), constipation (30.7% vs. 11.6%), vomiting (26.1% vs. 4.1%) and mainly were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.\nAdding to the investor concerns, William Blair analysts expressed disappointment, stating, \u201cWe had hoped that the amylin component could provide a higher magnitude of weight loss among patients living with type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the hypothesis did not come to fruition, and in our view, there is no evidence to suggest CagriSema should be prescribed over Zepbound in any subpopulation, based on the available data released to date.\u201d\nAnalyst Andy Hsieh further elaborated that the \u201chigh frequency of adverse events could fuel uncertainty over the asset\u2019s differentiation against approved (Zepbound) or late-stage investigational (retatrutide and MariTide) compounds.\u201d\nPrice Action: At the last check on Monday, NVO stock was down 7.10% to $68.53 during the premarket session.\nRead Next:\n- Eli Lilly\u2019s Investigational Oral Pill Shows Weight Loss Benefits With Lingering Side Effect Concerns\nImage via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Register Now \u2192\nThe Trump administration is preparing a pilot program that could allow some Americans on Medicare and Medicaid to access popular and costly weight-loss medications.\nThe plan, still in development, would permit state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk A/S\u2019 NVO Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly And Co\u2019s LLY Mounjaro and Zepbound for weight management, according to internal documents reviewed by The Washington Post.\nThe pilot would also include Eli Lilly\u2019s GLP-1 drug Orforglipron, pending its expected approval in 2026.\nThe initiative, set to launch in April 2026 for Medicaid and January 2027 for Medicare, would run through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).\nThis testing lab explores new payment models to improve care and reduce health care spending.\nWhile Medicare covers these drugs mainly for Type 2 diabetes, some private insurers already approve them for weight loss.\nThe proposal comes after the Trump administration rejected a Biden-era plan to provide coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss under Medicare and Medicaid.\nThough not yet finalized, the Washington Post report on Friday added that the new pilot could move forward without requiring a formal public comment process.\nAlso Read: Congress Sounds Alarm Over Illegal Weight-Loss Drug Imports From China\nCovering these drugs is not without significant cost concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Medicare could spend around $35 billion on GLP-1 coverage for obesity between 2026 and 2034. These medications typically cost $5,000 to $7,000 annually per patient.\nStill, experts like David Rind, chief medical officer at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, argue the price is reasonable given the potential for substantial health improvements.\nSome states are already moving ahead. Thirteen state Medicaid programs currently cover GLP-1s for obesity, despite looming worries about reduced federal Medicaid funding due to a recent tax law overhaul.\nOn Thursday, Trump issued a 60-day ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding that they lower drug prices in the U.S. or face severe consequences.\nTrump urged drugmakers to offer all existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices in other developed countries, adopt most-favored-nation pricing for all new drugs across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers, and push back against \u201cforeign freeloading nations\u201d in pricing negotiations.\nAlso, Ozempic may enter the realm of price negotiations between drug manufacturers and Medicare.\nOzempic is poised to become eligible for negotiations when the next batch of drugs is chosen in 2025, leading to price adjustments in 2027.\nRead Next:\nPhoto by KK Stock via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

LLY stock plunged on Thursday after the company released topline data from the Phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial evaluating orforglipron, an investigational oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.\nThe trial included over 3,000 obese patients with a weight-related medical problem and without diabetes.\nAt 72 weeks, all three doses of orforglipron met the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints compared to placebo.\nAlso Read: Trump Administration Plan Signals Shift Toward Weight-Loss Drug Coverage For Medicare Patients\nFor the primary endpoint, orforglipron 36 mg lowered weight by an average of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% (2.2 lbs) with placebo using the efficacy estimand. CNBC writes that Wall Street\u2019s expectations were around 15%.\n59.6% of participants taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost at least 10% of their body weight, while 39.6% lost at least 15%.\nFor comparison, Novo Nordisk A/S\u2019 NVO oral semaglutide 25 mg achieved a 16.6% weight loss vs. a 2.7% reduction with placebo after 68 weeks.\nCagriSema achieved a weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks in one study and 15.7% in another.\nThe company said orforglipron was also associated with reductions in known cardiovascular risk markers, including non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure in pooled analyses across all doses.\nIn a pre-specified exploratory analysis, the highest dose of orforglipron reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels by 47.7%.\nThe most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, the company said in a statement on Thursday.\nAbout 10.3% of patients in the 36 mg group discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% on placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 21.9% (6 mg), 22.5% (12 mg), and 24.4% (36 mg) for orforglipron vs. 29.9% with placebo.\nLilly says it is on track to submit orforglipron to global regulatory agencies by year-end and is making substantial investments to meet anticipated demand at launch.\nQ2 Earnings\nEli Lilly also released better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday and raised 2025 guidance.\nThe U.S. pharma giant reported second-quarter revenue of $15.56 billion, up 38% year over year, beating the consensus of $14.39 billion, driven by a 42% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6% decrease due to lower realized prices.\nKey products revenue grew to $10.40 billion in the quarter, led by Zepbound and Mounjaro.\nThe company reported an adjusted EPS of $6.31, up from $3.92 a year ago, beating the consensus of $5.53.\nFor the second quarter, worldwide Mounjaro revenue increased 68% to $5.20 billion. U.S. revenue was $3.30 billion, an increase of 37%, reflecting strong demand, partially offset by lower realized prices.\nRevenue outside the U.S. increased to $1.90 billion compared with $677.2 million in the same quarter a year ago, primarily driven by volume growth, including entry into new markets.\nU.S. Zepbound revenue increased 172% to $3.38 billion, primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices.\nVerzenio (a breast cancer drug) revenue increased 12% to $1.49 billion, driven by volume growth.\nGuidance\nEli Lilly raised fiscal year 2025 sales guidance from $58 billion-$61 billion to $60 billion-$62 billion versus the consensus of $59.45 billion.\nThe obesity drug maker raised 2025 adjusted earnings guidance from $20.78-$22.28 per share to $21.75-$23.00 versus the consensus of $21.59.\nPrice Action: LLY stock is trading lower by 7.04% to $693.85 premarket at last check Thursday.\nRead Next:\nImage via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "13-Week Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Oral VK2735 Dosed Once Daily\nResults Expected in 2H25\nSAN DIEGO, March 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Viking\") VKTX, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders, today announced the completion of subject enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735, the company's dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. VK2375 is being developed in both oral and subcutaneous formulations for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders such as obesity. Viking expects to report data from the study in the second half of 2025.\nThe Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735 dosed as an oral tablet once daily for 13 weeks. The trial enrolled approximately 280 adults who are obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2), or adults who are overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition. Enrolled patients have been evenly randomized to one of six dosing arms or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in body weight from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment. Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate a range of additional safety and efficacy measures.\n\"As with our previous Phase 2 study of subcutaneous VK2735, interest in participating in the Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral study was high and drove an efficient rate of enrollment,\" said Brian Lian, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Viking Therapeutics. \"Despite its larger size, VENTURE-Oral was rapidly enrolled, highlighting the continued enthusiasm for new obesity therapeutics such as VK2735. We look forward to reporting data from this trial in the second half of 2025.\"\nViking previously reported positive results from a 28-day Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial of the tablet formulation of VK2735 in healthy volunteers with a BMI \u226530. Cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 8.2%. Persistent weight loss effects were observed at follow-up visits through Day 57, ranging up to 8.3% from baseline, four weeks after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. An exploratory assessment of the proportion of subjects achieving at least 5% weight loss after 28 days demonstrated that up to 100% of VK2735-treated subjects achieved \u22655% weight loss, compared with 0% for placebo. Based on a preliminary evaluation of weight loss trajectories at multiple dose levels, the company believes that continued treatment beyond 28 days may provide further reductions in body weight.\nIn the MAD trial, oral VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability through 28 days of once-daily dosing at doses up to and including 100 mg. The majority (99%) of observed treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate, with the majority (90%) reported as mild. Similarly, all observed gastrointestinal adverse events were reported as mild or moderate, with the majority (84%) reported as mild.\nConcurrent with the development of oral VK2735, Viking is also advancing a subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 through clinical development. The company previously announced positive data from the Phase 2 VENTURE study of subcutaneous VK2735, with the trial successfully achieving its primary and all secondary endpoints. Patients receiving VK2735 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 14.7%. Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for all doses starting at Week 1 and were maintained throughout the course of the study. Weight loss in all treated cohorts appeared to be progressive through 13 weeks and did not show evidence of plateauing. VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability in the VENTURE study, with the majority of observed adverse events being reported as mild or moderate. The company plans to initiate Phase 3 development with the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 in the first half of 2025.\nAbout GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists\nActivation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor has been shown to decrease glucose, reduce appetite, lower body weight, and improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or both. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently marketed in various dosage strengths and forms as Ozempic\u00ae, Rybelsus\u00ae, and Wegovy\u00ae. More recently, research efforts have explored the potential co-activation of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor as a means of enhancing the therapeutic benefits of GLP-1 receptor activation. Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently marketed in various dosage strengths and forms as Mounjaro\u00ae and Zepbound\u00ae.\nAbout Viking Therapeutics, Inc.\nViking Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine disorders, with three compounds currently in clinical trials. Viking's research and development activities leverage its expertise in metabolism to develop innovative therapeutics designed to improve patients' lives. Viking's clinical programs include VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders. Data from a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 trial evaluating VK2735 (dosed subcutaneously) for metabolic disorders demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile as well as positive signs of clinical benefit. Concurrently, the company is evaluating an oral formulation of VK2735 in a Phase 2 trial. Viking is also developing VK2809, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of lipid and metabolic disorders. The compound successfully achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints in a recently completed Phase 2b study for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In a Phase 2a trial for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated LDL-C, patients who received VK2809 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL-C and liver fat content compared with patients who received placebo. The company's newest program is evaluating a series of internally developed dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists (or DACRAs) for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders. In the rare disease space, Viking is developing VK0214, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). In a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) form of X-ALD, VK0214 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated, while driving significant reductions in plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and other lipids, as compared to placebo.\nFor more information about Viking Therapeutics, please visit www.vikingtherapeutics.com.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding Viking Therapeutics, Inc., under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Viking's expectations regarding its clinical and preclinical development programs, anticipated timing for reporting clinical data and cash resources.
