  "title": "Is \u2018Camp Rock 3\u2019 happening? Jonas Brothers fans think so",
  "description": "Rumors about 'Camp Rock 3' have been swirling since Demi Lovato's epic reunion with the Jonas Brothers",
  "content": "Nick Jonas, Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas at the premiere of \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" in 2010. ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nDemi Lovato surprised fans with a performance at a recent Jonas Brothers concert, and some people are convinced that the appearance means \u201cCamp Rock 3\u201d is coming.\n\nAs of now, there is no official confirmation that a third \u201cCamp Rock\u201d movie is being made. However, sites like Pop Tingz and FilmBuzzr have reported that the project is set to begin filming in September, with Lovato and the Jonas Brothers onboard.\n\nIndustry insider Daniel Richtman also claimed in a June Patreon post that \u201cCamp Rock 3\u201d is in the works with \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d creator Tim Federle at the helm. He reported that the movie will feature a new character named Sage.\n\nLovato starred alongside Joe, Nick, and Kevin Jonas in the 2008 Disney Channel Original \u201cCamp Rock\u201d and its 2010 sequel, \u201cCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\u201d Lovato played Mitchie Torres, a naturally talented camper with a lot to prove, and Joe played her love interest, Shane Gray, a spoiled pop star with a secret sweet side.\n\nLovato took the MetLife Stadium stage on Sunday, August 10, at the Jonas Brothers\u2019 first show of their Jonas20: Greetings from Your Hometown Tour. She and Joe performed a duet of the \u201cCamp Rock\u201d tunes \u201cThis Is Me,\u201d \u201cGotta Find You,\u201d and \u201cWouldn\u2019t Change a Thing.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Disney Channel stars: Where are they now?\n\nThe heartwarming reunion comes five years after Lovato told Harper\u2019s Bazaar that she was no longer in touch with the Jonas Brothers. The \u201cSkyscraper\u201d singer briefly dated Joe in 2010, and there are unconfirmed rumors that she had a fling with Nick circa 2016. Based on the MetLife Stadium duet, Lovato is now on good terms with both brothers.\n\n\u201cCamp Rock 3\u201d is just a rumor for now, but here\u2019s hoping that we get some more concrete answers soon. Lovato\u2019s reunion with the Jonas Brothers was everything, but 2000s kids want more!\n\n\u201cCamp Rock\u201d and \u201cCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam\u201d are available to stream on Disney+.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "\u201cBig Brother 27\u201d alum Jimmy Heagerty has thick skin, but he\u2019s still hurt by how his former allies Mickey Lee and Morgan Pope talked about him behind his back.\n\u201cListen, all\u2019s fair in love and game. I expect the gameplay. \u2026 [But] knowing for weeks that they had been making fun of my mannerisms \u2026 it just felt nasty,\u201d Jimmy told NJ.com after he was eliminated from the CBS reality series. \u201cRespectfully, they\u2019re two 30-year-old women, and you\u2019d think they\u2019d be a little more mature than that. I was pretty shocked, as a 25-year-old, to be watching that back and to feel like I had a little bit more maturity than they did.\u201d\nOne live feeds clip of Mickey and Morgan imitating Jimmy\u2019s use of slang has made the rounds on social media. Some viewers claimed that the conversation came off as homophobic.\n\u201cOh, my God, the tea is scalding hot. And why is it hot, Mickey?\u201d Morgan asks in the clip.\n\u201cBecause [our alliance with Jimmy], Triple Threat, has been exed. \u2026 Gay-asp,\u201d Mickey replies.\nJimmy feels that Mickey and Morgan\u2019s final two alliance name, The Tea Party, could also be interpreted as a dig at him.\n\u201cTheir final two [alliance name] was almost a play on what I say in the house all the time. I don\u2019t know, I thought it was interesting,\u201d Jimmy told NJ.com. \u201cI\u2019m not making any snap judgments or anything like that. Unlike them, I\u2019m gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and would prefer to talk to them about their intention and things like that. But the perception definitely wasn\u2019t good.\u201d\nJimmy was evicted by a vote of 9-2 on Thursday, August 7, after Mickey named him as a replacement nominee during her Head of Household reign. Mickey and Morgan stopped trusting Jimmy after learning that he\u2019d been trying to make a deal with their rival Keanu Soto.\nWhile Mickey and Morgan felt that Jimmy\u2019s conversations with Keanu were a betrayal, Jimmy doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\u201cWith Mickey and Morgan, I had put my trust in them 100 percent. Everything I did was always thinking about Triple Threat above all else. Turns out, that was a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI was making an effort to build a bridge with Keanu, because I knew he was looking at Mickey and Morgan as targets. And the last thing we wanted was to end up on the block together.\u201d\nJimmy said he wanted to lay the groundwork to protect himself and at least one of his Triple Threat allies in the event that Keanu became HoH.\n\u201cSo [then] hopefully he\u2019d only put up somebody like Morgan, and that would allow Mickey and I not just to whip votes, but to fight for Morgan potentially in [the] Veto [competition],\u201d Jimmy explained. \u201cMickey and Morgan never gave me a chance to defend myself. \u2026 My intention cannot be defined by their perception. \u2026 I was neutralizing [Keanu] as a threat to Triple Threat, not throwing them under the bus for the sake of my own game.\u201d\nREAD MORE: \u2018Big Brother\u2019 star makes history with chaotic attempt to change vote live on air\nJimmy\u2019s elimination continued a pattern of season 27 Heads of Household nominating their own allies for eviction. Vince Panaro put Kelley Jorgensen on the block week one despite having a final two deal with her, and Lauren Domingue sent home Adrian Rocha even though they were loosely aligned and he wasn\u2019t coming after her.\nJimmy told NJ.com that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d thinks the BB Blockbuster twist \u2014 which forces HoHs to nominate three people for eviction instead of two \u2014 is contributing to the bewildering trend.\n\u201cI think people are trying to lean on playing safe rather than making game moves, because they\u2019re too worried about damage control,\u201d he said. \u201cThis game can mess with a lot of people\u2019s heads. You can allow people to distract you from what you know to be true.\u201d\nJimmy noted that he respects current Head of Household Ava Pearl for nominating Vince Panaro and Zach Cornell even though it\u2019s made waves in the house.\n\u201cI think a lot of HoHs this season haven\u2019t stood on business. And I think Ava\u2019s standing on business,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBig Brother\u201d airs on CBS and Paramount+ Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.

Love ya too.\u201d\nJon shares eight children with his ex-wife, Kate Gosselin: twins Cara and Mady, 24, and sextuplets Collin, Alexis, Hannah, Aaden, Leah, and Joel. The family\u2019s life was documented on the reality series \u201cJon & Kate Plus 8\u201d from 2007 to 2009.\nAfter Jon and Kate divorced in 2009, the TLC show was rebranded to \u201cKate Plus 8,\u201d which aired until 2017 with a hiatus between 2011 and 2015.\nJon, Collin, and Hannah have been estranged from Kate and the other Gosselin children for years. During an October 2024 interview with the U.S. Sun, Collin claimed that his mother was \u201cphysically aggressive\u201d and verbally abusive when he was a child. He also alleged that Kate forced him to live in a locked room in the basement monitored by cameras.\n\u201cI just remember being isolated from my siblings and constantly taking the fall for her emotions or the tough things going on in her life,\u201d Collin claimed.\nREAD MORE: Reality TV alum slams costars for \u2018making fun\u2019 of him: \u2018Just felt nasty\u2019\nKate\u2019s lawyer Richard Puleo lawyer told The U.S. Sun at the time that he didn\u2019t think Kate would \u201cintentionally harm\u201d Collin.\n\u201cShe did what she did to protect herself and her family,\u201d Puleo said, claiming that Collin had exhibited \u201ctroubled behavior\u201d in his youth.\nKate previously made her own allegations about Collin.\n\u201cMy son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years,\u201d she alleged in a July 2023 statement to People, noting that she felt \u201cbacked into a corner\u201d to speak out after Collin accused her of abuse. \u201cFor the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs. The decision to admit him was made by emergency room doctors following one of his many attacks/outbursts \u2014 this one involving his use of a weapon.\u201d\nKate further claimed that Collin\u2019s \u201cunpredictable and violent behavior has sadly continued regularly towards Jon, Hannah and others around him\u201d and called him \u201ca very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help.\u201d\nCollin\u2019s sister Mady also spoke out via her Instagram Story at the time, claiming that Collin had \u201cphysically threatened me and every member of my immediate family.\u201d\nJon subsequently slammed Kate\u2019s claims via a statement from his rep to the U.S. Sun.\n\u201cKate posting cruel false accusations regarding Collin seems to be just another way for her to justify her inexcusable horrific past behavior toward him,\u201d the rep said at the time. \u201cTrue love for a child wouldn\u2019t include a mother attacking their son to the public.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing child abuse, call or text Child Help Hotline at 1-800-422-4453.\nMore TV News and Updates\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "There\u2019s a new Veto holder on \u201cBig Brother 27.\u201d\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for the Wednesday, August 13, episode of \u201cBig Brother.\u201d Stop reading if you don\u2019t want to read live feed spoilers.\nEarlier this week, Ava Pearl became the new Head of Household and nominated Zach Cornell, Vince Panaro, and Keanu Soto for eviction. While Keanu has been a house target for weeks, Zach and Vince had never touched the block before.\nFor the first time this season, none of the nominees won the Power of Veto, as Katherine Woodman pulled out the win. Could this be the week that Keanu finally leaves the house after weeks of his fellow houseguests trying to get him out?\nWas the Veto used this week?\nAs of this writing, the Veto meeting has not taken place yet. However, Katherine has expressed her intention not to use the Veto on any of the nominees. She is not aligned with any of them, so it makes sense for her to keep nominations the same.\nWhile Katherine likely won\u2019t use the Veto, a secret power just might change Ava\u2019s nominations anyway. Back in week two, Zach won the power to take himself off the block after a Veto meeting. Ava will likely name Morgan Pope as the replacement nominee, as she is closely aligned with both Zach and Vince.\nWho is going home on \u2018Big Brother\u2019 this week?\nThe three nominees will each have one final chance to earn their safety in the live BB Blockbuster competition on Thursday, August 14th. Keanu has proven himself to be a fierce competitor, but he\u2019s also never taken part in a BB Blockbuster before.\nIf Keanu doesn\u2019t win the BB Blockbuster, he will likely go home on Thursday. No one wants to compete against him, and he\u2019s already evaded eviction three times.\nWhen is \u2018Big Brother\u2019 on next?\nThe Veto competition and meeting will play out during the next episode, which airs on CBS and Paramount+ on Wednesday, August 13, at 8 p.m. ET. The live BB Blockbuster competition and eviction airs on Thursday, August 14, at 8 p.m. ET.\nHow to watch the \u2018Big Brother\u2019 live feeds\nThe \u201cBig Brother\u201d live feeds are available to anyone with a Paramount+ subscription. Once logged into Paramount+, simply navigate to the \u201cBig Brother\u201d page and select the live feeds.\n\u201cBig Brother\u201d airs on CBS and Paramount+ Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.

      "text": "Demi Lovato announced in May 2021 that they identify as nonbinary and use they/them pronouns. The following story features previous pronouns that Demi used at the time of the interview.\nIn a large, stately private dining room off the restaurant at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, Demi Lovato is sipping chamomile tea. Despite the formality of the environment, Lovato seems relaxed, in a gray Erewhon sweatshirt and matching sweatpants. It\u2019s early March, before the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and a succession of shutdowns, quarantines, and stay-at-home orders would transform daily life as we know it (or knew it). The 27-year-old singer is about to release \u201cI Love Me,\u201d the empowering first single off her next album, due out later this year, on the heels of well-received performances at the Super Bowl and the Grammys. The appearances marked Lovato\u2019s unofficial return to the public sphere following a near-fatal drug overdose two years ago that caused her to be hospitalized for almost two weeks. But Lovato\u2019s focus has been on how to maintain her physical, emotional, and mental health and re-enter the world with a renewed sense of purpose and possibility\u2014a world that would soon feel much more uncertain.\nLovato\u2019s comeback has been greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by both the music industry and her fans. Her new music is confessional and bold, but she speaks carefully as she reflects on some of the events in her life over the past two years that inspired it. \u201cI would hate for a detail to become the headline when I\u2019ve worked so hard for my music,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut I will say that I\u2019ve really appreciated the patience the public has given me over the past year and a half to figure my shit out, because I think the mistake I made when I was 18, when I went into treatment, was that I went back to work six months later,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut at the same time I\u2019ve also sat back on the sidelines for two years. I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut, while the tabloids have run wild. And my album is finally the place where I get to set the record straight on everything.\u201d\nOn July 24, 2018, Lovato was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, following a 911 call made from her Hollywood Hills home. She was reportedly found unconscious and administered Narcan, which is used to treat opioid overdoses. Lovato is reticent about revisiting the relapse after six years of sobriety and the sequence of events that led to her overdose. But she says she was aware, in the hospital, of the great number of messages of support that were posted on social media and sent her way. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re in a moment like that because you don\u2019t feel worthy of it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut looking back, I understand that I was just someone going through something, and people were really supportive and were there for me, and it meant everything.\u201d She continues, after a pause, \u201cIt also kind of made it a little challenging because I did deal with that in the public eye\u2014that was the way some people found out. I had relatives who got alerts on their phones. We didn\u2019t even get to call them before they saw what happened.\u201d\nLovato says she hopes that her experience might have a destigmatizing effect, encouraging others who struggle with addiction to seek help. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to focus on is the outpouring of love and support,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made it okay for someone they know to ask for help.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like everyone knows Demi because she\u2019s so open,\u201d says Lovato\u2019s friend, singer Sam Smith. \u201cI am enamored by her strength and willingness to tell her story, and also her openness about still not being perfect and still learning in front of everyone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more loved,\u201d Lovato adds. \u201cWhich is really cool because I\u2019m single as all hell right now.\u201d\nLovato was raised in Dallas. Her mother, Dianna De La Garza, had been a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and a singer herself, and her father, Patrick Lovato, was a studio engineer and musician. Her parents divorced when she was two, and Lovato did not maintain a relationship with her birth father, who she has said was an addict. (He died of cancer in 2013.)\nLovato rose to fame on the Disney Channel in her teens, starring with the Jonas Brothers in the film Camp Rock and the sitcom Sonny With a Chance. During that time she also developed an eating disorder, and began using alcohol and drugs, entering treatment for the first time at age 18. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while in recovery. When Lovato looks back on her Disney days now, she views them through a new lens. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the opportunities that I got. Do I wish that I\u2019d had more downtime? Yes. I think when you are a teenager and you\u2019re given your big break, you\u2019ll do anything to make it happen,\u201d she says. \u201cI do feel that a lot of the way some of my life was handled and lived led to me kind of having a bit of a downfall, just because I was so overworked and I wasn\u2019t dedicating enough time to my mental health or my personal life.\u201d\nIn 2018, Lovato parted ways with her longtime manager, Phil McIntyre, and last year signed with Scooter Braun, who has steered the careers of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.\nThrough Braun, Lovato reconnected with Grande, whom she now considers a good friend. \u201cI love the fact that Ariana and I have such a supportive friendship because it\u2019s hard to find. Two women who are in a competitive industry\u2014the whole world seems to want to pit women against each other, so it would be so easy to do that,\u201d Lovato says. \u201cI always long for friendships with women. I think it\u2019s so sacred. And actually, late last year, the night of the winter solstice, I had about 16 girls [for a] group meditation, and we set our intentions for the new year. It was so beautiful, and that divine feminine energy is what has picked me up and carried me through some of my darkest times.\u201d\nDating is one aspect of Lovato\u2019s life that she says she\u2019s still working through. Her last high-profile relationship was with the actor Wilmer Valderrama, whom she was with intermittently for six years, after the two met in 2010, beginning when Lovato was 18 (Valderrama was 29 at the time). In January, Valderrama announced his engagement to model Amanda Pacheco. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for him and I wish him nothing but the best, but we\u2019re not in each other\u2019s lives, haven\u2019t spoken in a long time,\u201d says Lovato. \u201cBut I think I needed that because I needed to learn to be okay on my own. When you get into a relationship with somebody at that young of an age and then you spend six years with somebody, you don\u2019t really get to learn about yourself.\u201d Lovato, who identifies as bisexual, was on Raya\u2014the exclusive dating app for celebrities and the celebrity- adjacent\u2014but she was recently rejected by the service (presumably inadvertently) after deleting her account and trying to get back on again following the end of a relationship. \u201cI just deleted it out of respect to the person I was with, then we broke up and I went to get back on. And I was like, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need to be on this because I think I\u2019m supposed to be alone right now.\u2019\u201d\nNevertheless, Lovato says she can envision a day when she\u2019ll feel ready to settle down with someone, whoever they might be. \u201cWhen I imagine my life in the future, I don\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m looking for a man who I want to have two or three kids with.\u2019 I think it could be so much fun to share children with a woman \u2026 So I don\u2019t know what my future will look like, and I\u2019m open to anything,\u201d she continues. \u201cPeople always ask me, \u2018What\u2019s your type?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Have you seen my history?\u2019 There is no type. It is solely off connection. I wish I could say, \u2018I only date attractive people.\u2019 But I don\u2019t,\u201d she says, laughing.\nI ask Lovato if she is still in contact with the Jonas Brothers. She shakes her head no. \u201cI talk to Miley [Cyrus],\u201d she says pointedly. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome, and I love her to death and always will, always have. But I think she\u2019s kind of the only one from that era that I still stay in touch with.\u201d\nAccording to Lovato, she\u2019s not currently close with Selena Gomez either. (The two were inseparable in their early Disney years.) Gomez, though, posted a supportive Instagram story after Lovato\u2019s performance at the Grammys. \u201cWhen you grow up with somebody, you\u2019re always going to have love for them. But I\u2019m not friends with her, so it felt \u2026\u201d Lovato stops herself. \u201cI will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best.\u201d\nIn addition to the album, Lovato is also making her return to acting this year in the Netflix comedy Eurovision, with Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, and Pierce Brosnan. \u201cMy eating disorder kept me from going back to acting for years,\u201d Lovato says. \u201cBut I finally came to a place with my body where I thought, \u2018Why am I going to let this stop me when it\u2019s just my shell?\u2019 \u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped letting my weight control my life.\u201d\nLovato says she may tour again too, but suggests that there could be some changes to her live act. \u201cThere is one song I\u2019ll probably never perform again, that was actually one of my hits, because of something that happened during my overdose,\u201d says Lovato. \u201cIf you have a song called \u2018Broken Leg,\u2019 and you went and broke your leg, you\u2019re not going to want to sing that song ever again, probably.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a superhuman, truly,\u201d says Lovato\u2019s friend, actor and fellow Disney alum Matthew Scott Montgomery. \u201cSo I think I was naive to some of what was going on. A lot of situations where, from the outside, things may have seemed like they would be too much, she would fight harder and push through it. She\u2019s a fighter in every sense of the word.\u201d\nFor now, Lovato is embracing her independence. \u201cMy life motto was \u2018powering through it,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cBut when you power through your life all day, every day for 10 years, you\u2019re ignoring all that pain or you\u2019re just trying not to self-destruct \u2026 . It\u2019s not really living.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling it out as things go,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut I finally feel free.\u201d\nThis article originally appears in the May 2020 issue of Harper's BAZAAR, available on newsstands April 21.\nHair: Chris McMillan at the Chris McMillan Salon for Drunk Elephant; Makeup: Hung Vanngo; Manicure: Lisa Jachno for OPI; Production: Nathalie Akiya at Kranky Produktions; Prop Styling: Jack Flanaga"
