  "title": "Don't Get Suckered, There's Only One Good Type of Backup Battery",
  "description": "It's not always obvious what your battery is made of.",
  "content": "When you\u2019re shopping for a portable power station, there are a lot of confusing numbers to figure out\u2014but the most important detail to consider isn\u2019t a number at all! It's what your battery is made of.\n\nI\u2019ve purchased several portable power stations for my home. Some are big enough to contain over 3,800 watts of capacity. That\u2019s enough to keep our fridge running for over a day. Some are 1000 watts and better sized to power a hot plate or a TV. Our 300Wh units are best for phones and gaming handhelds.\n\nWhat they all have in common isn\u2019t their size, but their battery chemistry. In other words, they\u2019re all made of the same type of battery\u2014and it\u2019s different from the kind you used to find under your car\u2019s hood or inside most phones.\n\nThey\u2019re all lithium iron phosphate batteries, also known as LiFePO4 or LFP.\n\nLiFePO4 batteries, technically, are still lithium-ion batteries. The difference is the battery chemistry. In contrast with the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) lithium batteries common to our portable devices, LiFePO4 batteries use lithium iron phosphate as the cathode (or negative side) and uses carbon as the anode (or positive side).\n\nThese batteries aren\u2019t energy dense, so they aren\u2019t small, which is why you don\u2019t see them inside smartphones. But they come with many advantages that make them superior for supplying backup power.\n\nBatter chemistry determines how many years of use you may get out of any given battery. This information is typically indicated in two ways. One is the number of charge cycles, which refers to the number of times you can charge and discharge your battery before it stops holding a charge as effectively. The other might be in years, with phrases such as \u201cin 10 years, the battery will charge to 80% of its current capacity.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, this is two ways of saying the same thing. A battery that lasts 800 charge cycles can charge and discharge every day for around three years before it degrades. A battery that lasts 5000 cycles will still be going strong in a decade.\n\nWhile a non-LiFePO4 battery like the Jackery Explorer 300 can go 500 cycles before being reduced to 80% capacity, the LiFePO4 Jackery Explorer 300 Plus can last for 3000 cycles before seeing the same reduction in how much energy it can store. This is why LiFePO4 batteries also tend to come with longer warranties.\n\nLiFePO4 Is Far Less Likely to Catch Fire\n\nBatteries are ways of storing high amounts of energy in a small amount of space. While they\u2019re not as easy to ignite as a tank of gas, they do still come with the risk of fire. When lithium-ion batteries catch fire or explode, it's usually the result of short-circuiting, which can happen for various reasons.\n\nWhen mishaps happen, lithium-ion batteries can experience what\u2019s known as thermal runway. This leads to a fire that is self-generating until the battery fully discharges. This is why when some electric cars catch fire, firefighters focus on containing rather than extinguishing the fire.\n\nLiFePO4 batteries are many orders of magnitude safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries. Not only are they unlikely to catch fire, but they release so much less energy that even if they\u2019re punctured, they\u2019re more likely to release smoke than flames. You can see this in a drill test that Will Prowse showcased on his YouTube Channel.\n\nThis is why most built-in home backup batteries increasingly use LiFePO4 batteries instead of other battery chemistries.\n\nLiFePO4 Can Be Stored at 100%\n\nAs mentioned, most lithium-ion batteries don\u2019t like to be fully charged. While you can charge batteries to 100%, most prefer to be at 80% or lower (but not too low\u2014they don\u2019t like to sit around at under 20%, either). This means that if you buy a 1024Wh portable power station with lithium-ion batteries, it\u2019s best stored with a capacity of 819Wh. If the power goes out unexpectedly, you don\u2019t actually have access to as much power as you might have expected when buying the unit.\n\nA LiFePO4 battery can be stored at 100% just fine. This is because the battery is constructed out of different materials that respond differently when holding that many electrons.\n\nInstead of buying a built-in home battery, my wife and I opted to spend less money on several portable power stations instead. They\u2019re all LiFePo4 batteries stacked in our pantry at around 90\u2013100%. I wouldn\u2019t feel nearly as comfortable storing as many batteries made of an older battery chemistry\u2014at least not one this large. Nor would I spend this much money on batteries that need to be replaced in just a few years. But with LiFePO4, safety and longevity have largely been addressed.\n\nThat's not to say these batteries are perfect. If nothing else, they're expensive, which is reason enough to keep an eye on other emerging battery chemistries like sodium-ion. Yet until then, LiFePO4 is the way to go.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Opting for portable solar generators over a built-in home battery is cheaper, offering comparable storage at a much lower price.\n- Portable power stations allow for easy expansion without the need for contractors.\n- Using multiple portable power stations prevents a single point of failure and is a mobile solution that can go with you on adventures, when moving, or when evacuating.\nThis winter, my wife and I decided it was time to invest in a home energy backup plan. Instead of a built-in home battery like a Tesla Powerwall, we decided to buy an abundance of Anker portable power stations instead.\nIt Comes Down to Cost\nThere's a trade-off that comes with opting for portable solar generators over a built-in home backup battery, but there's one primary reason we decided to go with the former: cost. You can get comparable storage for as low as half the price by going with a portable system. This is one case where portability actually costs you less.\nWe have solar panels on our roof that use Enphase IQ inverters. That means we'd likely go with an Enphase IQ battery system rather than Tesla's Powerwall. Quotes for either setup tend to start at around $12,000 to $15,000 for a 10kWh battery. That's not much power, all things considered, so systems can easily hit double or triple that as you increase the storage. These latter numbers are the estimates we were faced with when inquiring about built-in battery storage.\nWith Anker's SOLIX line of portable power stations, we have a lower upfront cost, and we can spread the investment out over time. We don't need to buy 30kWh all at once. We can get a generator plug installed near our home breaker, buy an Anker F3800 for under $3,000, and plug it in. This way, we can power things like our well pump and septic tank, which stop working in our rural home when the power's out.\nAnker SOLIX F3800 Power Station\nThe Anker SOLIX F3800 is a large portable power station with a 3840Wh LiFePO4 battery. This electric generator can power an RV, is great for emergencies, and delivers loads of power whenever you need it.\nWill this unit last for days? Not on its own. But without pulling out any solar panels, we know we have enough power to handle critical loads for the majority of the power outages that we face. Where we live, power outages are generally handled within a few hours.\nWe Can Expand Without Calling an Electrician\nAfter getting an electrician to install our generator plug, we no longer need to involve a contractor to upgrade our system. Our electrician put in a standard interlock kit that is compatible with any generator.\nIf we decide to throw part of our tax refund next year at a few expansion batteries, we can double our storage without having to get a quote from a solar company. We can buy them from Amazon or Best Buy if we so choose. If we want to switch brands or buy an upgraded model in a few years, we can do that, too.\nNot only that, but we have varied options in the way we expand. We didn't just get a couple of F3800s. We also have two Anker SOLIX C1000's and two Anker SOLIX C300's (basically the same as the Anker C300 DC, but with three AC ports).\nAnker SOLIX C300 DC\n- Dimensions\n- 4.9 \u00d7 4.7 \u00d7 7.9 in\n- Weight\n- 6.17 lbs\nThe Anker SOLIX C300 DC is a versatile and portable power station with a 288Wh capacity and 300W output. It features multiple charging ports, including two 140W two-way USB-C ports, and can be recharged via an AC outlet, solar panel, or car charger. This makes it perfect for outdoor adventures, travel, and emergency backup power.\nAltogether, that's just over 10kWh of power spread out across six batteries. The next time a major sale comes, I can grab a couple more batteries and increase our total storage as easily as buying a new phone.\nThere's No Single Point of Failure\nWith a built-in battery, all of your home power goes dark if that battery drains. If said battery fails to begin charging again when the sun comes back up for whatever reason, you're stuck without power.\nWith power distributed across multiple stations, we don't have to deal with a single point of failure. If we check our battery backups and one is down, we still have others to depend on. If a C1000 fully drains after powering a fridge for a day, I can swap it out with another before we go to bed.\nAnker SOLIX C1000 Portable Power Station\n- Brand\n- Anker\n- Dimensions\n- 14.8\u00d78.07\u00d710.5 in\nThe new Anker SOLIX C1000 is a compact yet powerful 1800W portable power station. It packs 11 different ports, 2400W AC power surge, built-in lighting, and more. Charge all your gear or be prepared for an emergency.\nI can have one set of batteries charging outside while the others are in use. In the long run, I'd like to have twice as many batteries as we need to get through a day so that I can alternate charging days indefinitely.\nOur Power Can Leave Home With Us\nLet's not overlook the \"portable\" aspect of these power stations. There are many perks to this. If we invest thousands into this system, all of it can go with us if we were to ever move. The same is true if we find ourselves needing to evacuate during an emergency (okay, the F3800s would admittedly have to stay home).\nThis also creates abundant options for how we recharge our solar generators. Not only can I drag one out into the front yard and plug in solar panels, but I can load one into a vehicle, take it to a relative's house that has power, recharge the unit, and bring it back home.\nMy wife and I both drive EVs. Our models don't have AC outlets, but our next vehicles potentially could. That means we could recharge our 4kWh batteries using the 60-80kWh batteries inside our vehicles. That is many days' worth of power for critical loads.\nOur smaller stations can go with us on road trips. Portable power can be helpful for camping, cookouts, and any number of outdoor events. There are also plenty of times when it would be nice to recharge devices inside the car. Abundant power and fast charging is handy to have around during the second or third charging stop on an EV road trip when the kids have each drained their tablets and are crying over who gets to use the one charging cable.\nSadly, We Can't Use the Panels on Our Roof\nThere are downsides to going with solar generators rather than a full, integrated home battery. The primary issue comes down to how we recharge the batteries. Our home has a large solar array on top that gets direct sun almost year-round. It shuts down when the power goes out, and our solar generator can't tap into those panels. Instead, we needed to buy portable solar panels instead.\nYou don't technically need to buy portable panels for portable generators. You can order the same rigid solar panels that go on a roof and wire them up, depending on the power station you're working with. A downside of Anker SOLIX products is that their solar input is limited in such a way that it's hard to reach their max speeds using any panels other than Anker's.\nEven then, the F3800's max input speed of 2400 watts is small compared to how much solar power is available to something like a Powerwall. Portable power systems may be cheaper than going with an integrated home battery, but the slow ability to recharge them means you have to operate from a mindset of limited power, prioritizing your critical loads rather than using power as you normally would when the grid is up.\nCharging Solar Generators Takes Physical Effort\nIntegrated home batteries are like standby gas or propane generators. They automatically kick in when the grid goes down, and they continue to pull energy in as they operate. You don't have to do anything. Portable power stations are like portable gas generators. While you don't have to go outside and fill them up, running an extension cord into the house, you do have to go outdoors to charge them.\nCharging isn't that big an issue with smaller units like the C1000 and 100w panels (like the Anker 625 100w panels, since replaced with Anker's PS100). 200w panels aren't as light, and 400w panels are actually a bit heavy (they're big and bulky, too).\nAs for the F3800, well, it weighs only around a dozen pounds less than I do. I can move the thing, but not easily. It's better to invest in a long extension cord that can connect to solar panels outdoors than try to place this thing out in the yard. Frankly, charging this system isn't a viable option for everyone.\nStill, even if the largest unit is heavy, the C300 is light enough for a child to carry to their room. I want my kids to be able to grab one to power a Nintendo DS or a night light. The slightly larger C1000 can last over two days if it's only being used to heat up quick meals.\nWith so much battery-powered tech, we can feel largely comfortable going about our day-to-day lives even if all the home outlets don't work. Having an abundance of portable battery banks gives us that freedom, and we can build up that abundance bit-by-bit (like adding a solar-powered umbrella or using a battery-powered cooler instead of a fridge) without getting giant quotes from solar companies each time we do."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nSodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries use sodium ions instead of lithium ions to store and deliver power. Sodium is much more abundant and environmentally friendly than lithium, but there are still several challenges left to make sodium-ion batteries the new battery champion.\nBatteries are becoming crucial to everyday life, and whoever comes up with a better battery has the world on a platter. Sodium-ion batteries are a top contender to the crown held by lithium-ion batteries, but what exactly makes them special?\nWhat Is a Sodium-Ion Battery?\nSodium-ion batteries are batteries that use sodium ions (tiny particles with a positive charge) instead of lithium ions to store and release energy. Sodium-ion batteries started showing commercial viability in the 1990s as a possible alternative to lithium-ion batteries, the kind commonly used in phones and electric cars.\nHow Sodium-Ion Batteries Work\nSodium-ion batteries, also called Na-ion batteries, use a chemical reaction to store and release electrical energy. Like all batteries, they have two electrodes (a positive electrode and a negative electrode) separated by an electrolyte, which is a special substance that allows ions (tiny particles with a positive or negative charge) to move between the electrodes.\nSodium-ion batteries work similarly to lithium-ion batteries, but they use sodium ions instead of lithium ions. The choice of materials for the electrodes and electrolytes can affect the performance and lifespan of the battery, so researchers are constantly experimenting with different combinations to find the best combination of cost, performance, and safety. Generally, the cathode (the negative electrode) and electrolyte contain sodium.\nWhat Makes Sodium-Ion Batteries Great?\nLithium-ion batteries rule the roost at the moment, and there's plenty of research to make them even better than they are right now. Still, sodium-ion batteries have a few distinct advantages over them.\n- Sodium is a much more abundant element than lithium, making it easier and cheaper to obtain. This could make sodium-ion batteries less expensive to manufacture than lithium-ion batteries and more environmentally friendly to boot!\n- Sodium-ion batteries have the potential to offer similar energy density as lithium-ion batteries, making them suitable for a wide range of similar applications, although they aren't quite there yet.\n- Sodium-ion batteries are generally considered safer than lithium-ion batteries, as they are less prone to overheating and catching fire. Although several experimental lithium batteries have shown incredible resistance to damage that would make current batteries explode.\nThe Drawbacks of Sodium-Ion Batteries\nThere's no such thing as perfect battery technology, and there are a few reasons sodium-ion batteries haven't taken over from lithium yet.\n- Sodium-ion batteries have a lower voltage (2.5V) than lithium-ion batteries (3.7V), which means they may not be suitable for high-power applications that require a lot of energy to be delivered quickly.\n- They have a slower charge/discharge rate than lithium-ion batteries, which may not be suitable for applications that require a lot of power to be delivered quickly (such as electric vehicles).\n- Sodium-ion batteries still have limited charge cycles before the battery begins to degrade, and some lithium-ion battery chemistries (such as LiFeP04) can reach 10,000 cycles before degrading.\nApart from these technical pros and cons, the manufacturing chain for sodium-ion batteries still has some kinks to sort out before it can become a widespread commercial product. Not to mention that engineers and scientists are working on solutions to this battery technology's remaining weak points.\nThe Present and Future Potential of Sodium-Ion Batteries\nResearchers and companies around the world are working to improve the performance and commercial viability of sodium-ion batteries. Some key areas of focus include improving the energy density and voltage of sodium-ion batteries, as well as increasing their lifespan and charge/discharge rate.\nIf these efforts are successful, sodium-ion batteries could become a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries in the future. They could potentially be used in various applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems.\nIn 2022, researchers at the US Department of Energy made a major breakthrough in improving the durability of sodium-ion batteries. By changing some of the chemistry in the battery, the prototype coin-sized batteries lasted in excess of 300 cycles while maintaining more than 90% capacity. However, even without this new approach to chemistry, it seems that sodium-ion batteries are about to hit mass production anyway.\nSodium-Ion Mass Production Has Already Started\nIn December of 2022 it was reported that a company named HiNa in partnership with Chines state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation, had started mass production of sodium-ion batteries. The first generation of HiNa batteries offer energy density figures of 125Wh/kg, which is around half that of lithium-ion batteries. However, these batteries are rated for around 4500 charge cycles, which is significantly more than typical lithium-ion batteries.\nTypical lithium iron phosphate batteries offer energy densities similar to sodium-ion batteries, and the rated number of charge cycles is also similar. That puts sodium-ion batteries in direct competition with these batteries for applications such as backup inverter power or electric vehicles.\nThe next generation of these HiNa batteries are slated to have a 200Wh/kg energy density, and subsequent generations are expected to exceed that. Considering that some electric cars using lithium batteries have an energy density below 250Wh/kg, these early mass-produced sodium-ion batteries have serious potential to reduce the cost of power storage.\nHowever, just like LiFeP04 batteries, don't expect this technology in your smartphone or laptop any time soon. In these small devices, energy density is still the most important consideration. However, don't be surprised if your electric car or solar power battery system gets a little saltier in the near future."

      "text": "While lithium-ion batteries are, on the whole, incredibly safe they do very very occasionally catch fire or explode. When it happens, like with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 fiasco or HP\u2019s more recent laptop recall, it\u2019s always big news. So what\u2019s going on and why do batteries sometimes go out with a bang? Let\u2019s find out.\nRechargeable lithium-ion batteries\u2014the kind of battery that\u2019s inside your laptop, phone, tablet, and pretty much every other modern gadget you own, as well as electric cars and airplanes\u2014are responsible for the portable device revolution. Without lithium-ion batteries, I wouldn\u2019t be able to write this article sitting in a coffee shop; instead, I\u2019d need to be plugged into a power source the whole time.\nWhat\u2019s Inside a Lithium-Ion Battery?\nTo understand why lithium-ion batteries sometimes fail, you need to know what\u2019s going on under the hood. Inside every lithium-ion battery, there are two electrodes\u2014the positively charged cathode and the negatively charged anode\u2014separated by a thin sheet of \u201cmicroperferated\u201d plastic that keeps the two electrodes from touching. When you charge a lithium-ion battery, lithium ions are pushed by electricity from the cathode, through the microperferations in the separator and an electrically conductive fluid, and to the anode. When the battery discharges, the reverse happens with the lithium ions flowing from the anode toward the cathode. This is the reaction that powers your laptop.\nSmall batteries, like those found in smartphones, usually have only a single lithium-ion cell. Larger batteries, like those in laptops, normally have between 6 and 12 lithium-ion cells. The batteries in electric cars and airplanes can have hundreds of cells.\nWhat Makes a Lithium-Ion Battery Explode?\nThe very thing that makes lithium-ion batteries so useful is what also gives them the capacity to catch fire or explode. Lithium is really great at storing energy. When it\u2019s released as a trickle, it powers your phone all day. When it\u2019s released all in one go, the battery can explode.\nMost lithium-ion battery fires and explosions come down to a problem of short circuiting. This happens when the plastic separator fails and lets the anode and cathode touch. And once those two get together, the battery starts to overheat.\nThere are a number of reasons that the separator can fail:\n- Bad Design or Manufacturing Defects: The battery is poorly designed, as with the Galaxy Note 7. In that case, there wasn\u2019t enough space for the electrodes and separator in the battery. In some models, when the battery expanded a little as it charged, the electrodes bent and caused a short circuit. Even a well designed battery can fail if quality control isn\u2019t kept tight enough or there\u2019s some defect in manufacturing.\n- External Factors: Extreme heat is nearly guaranteed to cause a failure. Batteries left too close to a heat source---or caught in a fire---have been known to explode. Other external factor can cause a lithium-ion battery to fail, too. If you drop your phone too hard (or too many times), there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll damage the separator and cause the electrodes to touch. If you pierce the battery (either by accident or deliberately), then you\u2019ll almost certainly cause a short circuit.\n- Charger Problems: A badly made or poorly insulated charger can also damage a lithium-ion battery. If the charger shorts or generates heat near the battery, it can do enough damage to cause failure. That's why we recommend using only official chargers (or at the very least, high quality third party ones from reputable brands). Lithium-ion batteries do have built in protections to stop them overcharging. While very rare, if these safety precautions fail, overcharging is a good way to overheat a battery.\n- Thermal Runaway and Multiple Cells: While not relevant to single cell batteries like those found in most smartphones (the iPhone X actually has two cells), only one battery cell needs to fail for the whole battery to go. Once one cell overheats, you get a domino effect called \u201cthermal runaway.\u201d For batteries with hundreds of cells---like those in the Tesla Model S---thermal runaway has the potential to be a really big problem.\nEven though examining why battery sometimes fail paints a frightening picture, lithium-ion batteries are a safe and mature technology. The fact that it\u2019s always news when a battery explodes unexpectedly shows how rare an event those big failures are. Battery manufacturers put a lot of safeguards in place to prevent batteries failing, or at least mitigate the damage a failure can cause.\nPhoto credit: wk1003mike/Shutterstock.com."
