  "title": "49ers Star Christian McCaffrey Secures Equity Stake In Startup Footwear Company",
  "description": "49ers running back Christian McCaffrey recently secured an equity stake in While on Earth, a startup footwear and apparel company that launched last fall.",
  "content": "Since entering the NFL in 2017, San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey has been among the most productive players in the league when healthy. He\u2019s also earned tens of millions of dollars in salary, signed several lucrative endorsement deals and invested in various companies. Most recently, McCaffrey secured an equity stake in While on Earth, a startup footwear and apparel company that launched last fall.\n\nMcCaffrey previously invested in Hyperice, a manufacturer of therapy devices for athletes and consumers, and Oura Ring, a manufacturer of a fitness and sleep tracker. In addition, he invested in BodyArmor before Coca-Cola assumed full control of the sports drink company in 2021 in a deal that valued BodyArmor at $6.5 billion.\n\nWith While on Earth, McCaffrey is not only an investor but he received a \u201cvery meaningful\u201d equity stake, according to Todd Meleney, the company\u2019s CEO and co-founder, although Meleney would not disclose the percentage or the company\u2019s valuation. McCaffrey has met several times over the past few months with Meleney and other executives and provided feedback on the company\u2019s designs and plans for future growth. McCaffrey had a sponsorship deal with Nike since his rookie season, but he chose to not renew the contract and instead partnered with While on Earth.\n\nWhile on Earth plans on introducing signature McCaffrey sneakers and gear next year, although the company does not make football cleats, so McCaffrey can wear another brand of cleats during practices and games. McCaffrey wore Nike cleats during practices this month, and he will be wearing Nike uniforms during the season because the company has an exclusive uniform deal with the NFL through the 2038 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been offered any kind of deal quite like this, where it was all stars aligned,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cI was at a point where I was like, this would be really cool to be a part of something bigger than myself, and something from the start\u2026.I thought this would be an amazing challenge and something that would last, not just in my career, but would transcend that time of my career.\u201d\n\nMeleney was one of the first employees at Nobull, a footwear and apparel company founded in 2015 by former Reebok employees Marcus Wilson and Michael Schaeffer. Meleney eventually became Nobull\u2019s chief marketing officer and helped secure sponsorships with the PGA Tour, CrossFit Games and the NFL. Meleney left Nobull in 2023 shortly before billionaire Mike Repole\u2019s private equity firm acquired a majority stake in Nobull.\n\nAfter Meleney departed Nobull, he teamed with former CrossFit athletes Brooke Wells and Mat Fraser to found While on Earth. The company raised a seed funding round in the \u201clow seven figures,\u201d according to Meleney, meaning the low-millions of dollars range. In September 2024, While on Earth launched its first sneaker, a training and casual shoe that sells for between $150 and $160 on the company\u2019s website and in select retail stores. The company also sells shirts, shorts, hats and other apparel.\n\nAlthough McCaffrey only recently invested in While on Earth, he received the title of a co-founder. Meleney said that he was impressed with McCaffrey\u2019s intelligence, honest feedback and interest in the company. He expects McCaffrey will have a voice in helping While on Earth get into running and other categories next year and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this thread in the market around how celebrities are endorsing brands,\u201d Meleney said. \u201cWhile that is certainly true, this relationship with Christian is really unique because he's genuinely a part of building the company. That started from the minute he and I formalized our relationship, and we think it's something that's going to last for a really long time in the market.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey, meanwhile, said he has been interested in investing since attending Stanford University, where he was an All-American and finished in the top 10 of the Heisman Trophy voting in 2015 and 2016. After the Carolina Panthers selected McCaffrey with the eighth overall pick in the 2017 draft, he received financial advice from his father, Ed McCaffrey, who played in the NFL for 13 seasons.\n\nDuring his time with the Panthers, McCaffrey also kept in touch with people he knew from his college days who worked in private equity and venture capital. When he was traded to the 49ers in 2022, he said the investment opportunities \u201cexploded times 10.\u201d With While on Earth, McCaffrey said he is excited about having a say in the company and how it will compete in a competitive industry dominated by established companies such as Nike and adidas.\n\n\u201cOne of my investment advisors used to say before you invest in anything, you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do you like the people involved and do you like the product?\u2019,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cThose two questions got answered very quickly with While on Earth. I look at it as I'm going to attack this the same way I attack football. I'm going to put my all into it, and hopefully it succeeds.\u201d",

      "text": "The Coca-Cola Company Acquires Remaining Stake in BODYARMOR\nFast-Growing Beverage Company Continues to Gain Share and Outgrow U.S. Sports Drink Category\nATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Coca-Cola Company today announced that it has acquired full ownership of BODYARMOR, a line of sports performance and hydration beverages that is incremental to the Coca-Cola beverage portfolio and has significant potential for long-term growth.\nIn 2018, Coca-Cola initially acquired a 15% stake in BODYARMOR with a path to full ownership, based on a pre-determined discount. Coca-Cola is paying $5.6 billion in cash for the remaining 85% of the company.\nBODYARMOR will be managed as a separate business within Coca-Cola\u2019s North America operating unit and will continue to be based in New York. Under a separate consulting and transition-services agreement, the executive leadership team, including Co-founder and Chairman Mike Repole and President Brent Hastie, has agreed to continue to work to maintain the brand\u2019s successful momentum in the market. They are committed to executing BODYARMOR\u2019s 2022 plan and working on vision and strategy for 2023 and beyond.\nBODYARMOR will continue to be distributed by the U.S. Coca-Cola bottling system. When Coca-Cola made its initial investment in 2018, BODYARMOR gained access to the Coca-Cola system, which enabled BODYARMOR to accelerate its growth to meet explosive consumer demand for premium sports and hydration beverages. BODYARMOR is currently the #2 sports drink in the category in measured retail channels, growing at about 50% to drive more than $1.4 billion in retail sales.\n\u201cBODYARMOR has been a great addition to the system lineup over the last three years, and the company has driven continuous innovation in hydration and health-and-wellness products,\u201d said Alfredo Rivera, president of the North America operating unit of The Coca-Cola Company. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring BODYARMOR into The Coca-Cola Company and work with Mike Repole and his leadership team on the next stage of growth.\u201d\n\"Ten years ago, we set out with a vision to create a better-for-you sports drink with a goal of becoming the #1 global sports drink,\u201d Repole said. \u201cOur talented leadership team under Brent Hastie, our 400 dedicated employees and incredible Coca-Cola bottling partners have helped us build this remarkable brand. If it wasn\u2019t for Kobe Bryant\u2019s vision and belief, BODYARMOR would not have been able to achieve the success we had. I couldn\u2019t be more excited to become part of the Coca-Cola family and set our sights on the future.\u201d\nAs part of the agreement, Coca-Cola and Repole will also collaborate on the company\u2019s still beverages portfolio, including marketing, packaging and innovation strategies across multiple brands.\nCoca-Cola\u2019s acquisition of BODYARMOR will be funded through cash on-hand and is consistent with an M&A and capital allocation framework that focuses on accelerating growth, expanding capabilities and driving efficiencies. Coca-Cola pursues brands and products that are complementary to the overall portfolio and have growth opportunities for the long term.\nFor more information about BODYARMOR products and athlete partnerships, visit their website at https://www.drinkbodyarmor.com/\nAbout The Coca-Cola Company\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a total beverage company with products sold in more than 200 countries and territories.

      "text": "When Coca-Cola announced this week that it\u2019s paying $5.6 billion to buy the 85% it doesn\u2019t already own of sports drink maker BodyArmor, it marked a serious windfall for some famous investors, including NBA star James Harden and tennis phenom Naomi Osaka. The late Kobe Bryant\u2019s estate is reportedly in line for a $400 million-plus payout.\nBut no one is cashing in more than Mike Repole, BodyArmor\u2019s cofounder, chairman and largest shareholder. Forbes estimates that, thanks largely to this week\u2019s deal, Repole has a net worth of at least $1.5 billion. Repole declined to comment on his fortune.\nA serial sports drink entrepreneur, this isn\u2019t the first time Repole, 52, has struck a lucrative deal with Coca-Cola. Born to a waiter and a seamstress, Repole grew up in Queens, New York and studied sports management at St. John\u2019s University before becoming a salesman for a small company called Mistic Beverage. In the late 1990s he cofounded Glaceau\u2014which makes the popular Vitaminwater and Smartwater brands. By 2007, the business reportedly employed 600 people and was doing about $400 million in annual revenue, thanks to key marketing deals with Jennifer Aniston and rapper 50 Cent. Repole sold it to Coca-Cola that year for $4.1 billion. The next year, he plowed some of his take into a majority stake in the maker of Pirate\u2019s Booty, the white-cheddar cheese rice and corn puffs brand, which he later sold to B&G Foods for nearly $200 million. He also made an early investment in Kind, the snack bar maker, which was sold to candy conglomerate Mars last year at a reported $5 billion valuation.\nBodyArmor was started in 2011, when Repole teamed up with Lance Collins, who had previously sold the Fuze Beverage and NOS Energy Drink brands to Coca-Cola. The Queens-based business has made a splash peddling electrolyte-rich drinks (essentially an alternative to Gatorade) to professional athletes and thirsty fans. Today, BodyArmor boasts a 400-person staff and $1.4 billion in retail sales, according to a Coca-Cola statement announcing the deal. The brand had nearly 8% of the U.S. sports drink market in 2020, according to industry data from Euromonitor.\nFrom its start, BodyArmor attracted an impressive roster of investors. Repole deployed a similar playbook as with Glaceau, signing big names like Harden and Osaka in exchange for equity. His first big break came when Kobe Bryant discovered BodyArmor while rehabbing from a torn Achilles tendon. The late basketball star paid $6 million for 10% of BodyArmor in 2013, making him the company\u2019s fourth-largest shareholder, according to Fox Business. In 2015, Keurig Dr Pepper snapped up an 11.7% stake for $20 million, and shelled out another $6 million a year later to increase its ownership to 15.5%. Then, in 2018, Coca-Cola paid $300 million for a 15% share of the company, valuing it at $2 billion.\nThat deal likely netted Repole tens of millions of dollars from a cash dividend, but it also got him in trouble. Two years ago, the bottling subsidiary of Keurig Dr Pepper (then called Dr Pepper Snapple Group) sued Repole and BodyArmor for suddenly transferring distribution rights to Coca-Cola, alleging it violated a prior agreement. BodyArmor called the lawsuit meritless in a 2019 press release. The complaint was partially dismissed in December 2020.\nRepole ran into trouble at Pirate\u2019s Booty, too. The crunchy snack\u2019s creator, Robert Ehrlich, sued Repole\u2019s Driven Capital Management in 2015, alleging \u201cfrat boy\u201d actions by Repole and associates in order to \u201cattack [Ehrlich\u2019s] self-confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d In response, Repole told Forbes at the time: \u201cThese claims are so outlandish and ridiculous that I laughed out loud the first time I read them and they aren\u2019t even worth addressing.\u201d A spokesperson for Repole said the lawsuit is no longer ongoing; a lawyer for Ehrlich did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThis week\u2019s deal marks Coca-Cola\u2019s largest acquisition so far of another brand. It will bolster the beverage behemoth\u2019s quest for a bigger share of the U.S. sports drink market, of which rival PepsiCo\u2019s Gatorade commanded a 65% share in 2020, according to Euromonitor. (In 2006, PepsiCo paid $13.4 billion in stock and assumed debt to buy Quaker Oats and its Gatorade subsidiary.) Between BodyArmor and Powerade, which Coca-Cola released in 1988, Coca-Cola will control roughly 26% of the U.S. sports drink market, Euromonitor data shows.\nWhat\u2019s next for the newest beverage billionaire? Repole\u2014an avid equestrian, who owns more than 200 thoroughbred race horses\u2014will stay on as BodyArmor\u2019s chairman, Coca-Cola said in a press release, and will collaborate on the company\u2019s portfolio of still beverages. \u201cBuilding brands and building teams are a lot of fun,\u201d Repole told Forbes in 2014. \u201cGatorade has been the number one sports drink for 50 years, but in 10 years, I want BodyArmor to be the number one sports drink in the United States. In 15 years, I want BodyArmor to be the number one sports drink globally.\u201d"
