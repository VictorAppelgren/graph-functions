      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Intro sentence** – “The S&P 500 (spx) is poised for a 3–6‑month swing that hinges on the confluence of tech‑sector concentration, Fed policy, sticky inflation, tariff‑driven price pressures, and a potential consumer‑liquidity squeeze from rising ARM mortgage costs.”  \n   *Action*: Add a brief magnitude (e.g., “potential 1–3 % swing”) and a catalyst window (e.g., “Q3 2025 earnings, September Fed meeting, Sept 5 payrolls”) to anchor the claim.\n\n2. **Tech‑concentration claim** – “The index’s top ten names now comprise 40 % of its weight, an all‑time high that amplifies downside risk if even a few of those tech giants report weak earnings in the next quarter (FAN5RYW6T).”  \n   *Action*: Specify the exact quarter (e.g., “Q3 2025”) and quantify the expected downside (e.g., “up to 2 % drop if earnings miss by 5 %”).  \n\n3. **Fed‑cut conditionality** – “A weak earnings cycle in this concentrated cohort could trigger a sharp pullback, especially if the labor market continues to show weak growth and the Federal Reserve cuts rates in September to support a cooling economy (FAN5RYW6T).”  \n   *Action*: Add a magnitude range for the pullback (e.g., “1–3 % decline”) and tie the Fed cut to the September 2025 FOMC meeting.  \n\n4. **ARM‑payment impact** – “Adjustable‑rate mortgage (ARM) holders are experiencing higher monthly payments as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has climbed from 2.91 % to 4.39 % in recent months, pushing a significant share of households toward a paycheck‑to‑paycheck cycle (KX6AOMQZ5).”  \n   *Action*: Include a concrete impact on discretionary spending (e.g., “reduces discretionary spending by ~3 % in Q3 2025”) and link to the spx via tech earnings.  \n\n5. **Dollar pressure sentence** – “This consumer‑liquidity squeeze also pressures the U.S. dollar, as reduced domestic spending can weaken the currency relative to peers, which in turn can affect the earnings of multinational tech firms (KX6AOMQZ5).”  \n   *Action*: Either remove or explicitly tie the dollar move to spx earnings (e.g., “a 0.5 % DXY decline would cut multinational tech earnings by ~1 % in Q4 2025”).  \n\n6. **Base‑case magnitude** – “The base‑case scenario projects a 1–3 % decline in the S&P 500 over the next 3–6 months…”  \n   *Action*: Anchor the decline to specific catalysts: Q3 earnings releases (July‑Sept 2025), September payrolls, Fed meeting, inflation data (Oct 2025), ARM payment trend.  \n\n7. **Alternative scenario** – “An alternative scenario, in which the Fed holds rates steady and the labor market remains resilient, would see the index hold or rise modestly by 0–1 %…”  \n   *Action*: Add dates for the Fed meeting (Sept 2025) and labor‑market data release (e.g., September jobs report).  \n\n8. **Risk list** – “Key risks to the base case include (1) a sharper than expected earnings decline in the top tech names…”  \n   *Action*: Quantify “sharper” (e.g., “>5 % earnings miss”) and tie to Q3 earnings release dates.  \n\n9. **Watch‑list signals** – “Watch‑list signals for the next 3–6 months are the September payrolls report, the Fed policy meeting, Q3 earnings releases for the top ten tech names, the next inflation data release, and consumer‑spending and ARM‑payment metrics.”  \n   *Action*: Provide exact dates (e.g., Sept 5 payrolls, Sept 12 Fed meeting, Oct 15 CPI, etc.) and link each to the spx impact (e.g., “a 0.5 % CPI rise would push the Fed to keep rates, tightening the market”).  \n\n**Overall**: Ensure every substantive claim includes a sign (+/-), a magnitude range (bp/%), a horizon (3–6 months), a catalyst window with a specific date, and a clear causal transmission to the spx. Remove or tighten any sentences that drift outside the spx focus or lack a direct causal link.",
