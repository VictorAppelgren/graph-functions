  "title": "How CEOs Can Reframe Sustainability As Vital To Business",
  "description": "This week's Forbes CEO newsletter explores how a former mining exec highlights environmental actions as ways to build revenue and ensure a company\u2019s future.",
  "content": "The principles of environmental sustainability are taking a beating in the United States. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, canceled subsidies and added more permitting hurdles for wind and solar power, relaxed restrictions on coal mining, and moved to repeal scientific findings that allow the federal government to regulate emissions.\n\nStill, sustainability remains of utmost importance to companies. A recent report from EcoVadis found that only 7% of companies have actively cut back on their sustainability efforts this year. The vast majority\u201487%\u2014have increased or maintained their investment in sustainability since the beginning of the year. Nearly a third say they\u2019re spending more on sustainability measures this year, but talking about what they\u2019re doing less.\n\nThese companies are committed to sustainability because it\u2019s good business. More than half of company executives and vice presidents say it helps attract and retain customers. Nearly two-thirds said that supply chain sustainability is a competitive advantage. And Forbes Research found that seven out of 10 executives say investor expectations drive their sustainability efforts, with 63% of them saying they are confident in sustainability\u2019s positive impact on the economy as a whole.\n\nHow can executives continue to promote sustainability in their companies while external forces are attacking its foundational principles? Today\u2019s edition of Forbes CEO centers on that question. I talked to Mark Cutifani, a member of the Council on Sustainability Transformation, about how to walk that tightrope. He told me it\u2019s a matter of framing: Sustainability ensures the future of your business and can deliver financial results.\n\nThis is the published version of Forbes\u2019 CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every week.\n\nThe Council on Sustainability Transformation is a relatively new group. It was launched in January by ERM, the international sustainability advisory firm, and is made up of current and former top leaders across industries and governments. The goal of this group is to work with C-suite executives and board members of companies large and small, providing them practical knowledge to operationalize sustainability principles.\n\nThe council puts together white papers targeted at top executives. Earlier this summer, they published one that details how to continue delivering sustainability as the world\u2014and leaders\u2019 attitudes\u2014change toward sustainability. The overriding message: Don\u2019t give up, just reframe the way that you present it.\n\nThe leaders who are on the Council on Sustainability Transformation are used to reframing the way sustainability is presented. While they include experts on sustainability, including former EU commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard, some\u2014like Cutifani\u2014come from industries that are not traditionally aligned with sustainability. Cutifani spent his career in mining, spending nine years as CEO of global mining company Anglo American.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put the sustainability concept in that broader business framework, but it\u2019s about delivering results,\u201d Cutifani said. \u201cWhen we talk about climate change and other issues, these are the threats that we see coming at us.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest problems about the entire discussion around sustainability, Cutifani said, is that it tends to get narrowed down to a single issue. Instead of talking about the role that businesses should play in the greater society\u2014which is where Cutifani said the talk should be\u2014it\u2019s about components, like carbon emissions or water pollution. It\u2019s important for business leaders to be able to reset the discussion to the big picture.\n\nCutifani recalls one time that an investor crudely asked him why Anglo American was engaged in ESG\u2014the acronym commonly referring to environmental stewardship, social responsibility and corporate governance. Cutifani broke it down in terms of ROI. Through ESG initiatives, the company focused on safety, and had dramatically reduced the number of worker fatalities. They were avoiding costly financial penalties and potential litigation by keeping the areas in which they were working clean, causing minimal harm to surrounding communities. These initiatives not only protected communities and land near the mines, but they didn\u2019t draw protesters\u2014and, he noted, picketers tend to draw unwanted and international attention. And all of this is keeping operating costs down, Cutifani said, which is important in a volatile industry such as mining.\n\nWith that explanation, the investor agreed that everything Anglo American was doing should continue, and remarked that no one had ever explained sustainability and ESG like that. Cutifani responded that it was an industry mistake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not had anybody who\u2019s had a problem with the word \u2018sustainability\u2019 when I put it in that context,\u201d Cutifani said.\n\nOne of the problems, Cutifani said, is people don\u2019t understand how business works\u2014or they take it all out of context. Cutifani said he tells people who didn\u2019t know what industry he works in that he is with one that has the most significant net positive net environmental footprint on earth. And when those people guessed which industry that might be, Cutifani said no one has ever said mining.\n\nBut, he said, mining actually fits the bill. Minerals obtained through mining are used for fertilizers, which helps grow the food to feed the planet. Reservoirs are created for mining, and the industry creates methods to filter out contaminants so the water can be used for drinking and other purposes. Pipes that carry that water are made from metal that is mined, and the full infrastructure relies on metal\u2014or plastic, which comes from petroleum that is also mined.\n\nCutifani knows that the mining industry isn\u2019t perfect. There are many ways it can improve its environmental footprint, become more efficient, create less pollution and use less energy. But, he said, there are positive contributions they are making to the environment, and industry leaders shouldn\u2019t be afraid to talk about them.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is encourage people not to hide from the debate. Because if you hide from the debate, then it \u2026 becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d Cutifani said. \u201cIf somebody says, \u2018These things are no good,\u2019 \u2026 we're going to go backwards in areas that ultimately have a very high cost to society.\u201d\n\nCutifani said that company leaders need to take charge. That often means doing things that might be uncomfortable and that some might not like, but it\u2019s vital.\n\nThe newest white paper from the Council on Sustainability Transformation looks at how the current political situation might make some companies take more of a wait-and-see approach to environmental initiatives\u2014and why they shouldn\u2019t. Businesses that are holding back could undermine their growth potential. The white paper points out that nearly 90% of individual investors around the globe are interested in putting their funds toward sustainable assets. Additionally, there\u2019s a thriving consumer market for sustainable items. For CPGs, the annual growth rate for more sustainable products is a third higher than their counterparts.\n\nThere also could be opportunities to strategically bring together long-term sustainability goals with business and geopolitical ones. The study points out that these kinds of solutions are often overlooked because they require deep systems-level thinking. But some of these types of initiatives\u2014like diversifying energy sources, altering supply chains or rethinking packaging\u2014could save money, make a company more resilient in times of geopolitical or economic upheaval, and increase profitability.\n\nEngaging with everyone is important, Cutifani said, as is keeping your eyes on the long-term strategy of your company. Regardless of which politicians are in power and their viewpoints on sustainability matters, Cutifani said it is the CEO\u2019s responsibility to explain how the company creates value\u2014and why company decisions relating to sustainability contribute to that value.\n\n\u201cYou have to be the spokesperson for both your company and the industry, or you risk having the wrong debates threaten the survival of your company,\u201d Cutifani said.\n\n\u201cAnd for those leaders that don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve got to engage, they can scrub the word \u2018leader\u2019 from their name, because they\u2019re not,\u201d Cutifani continued. \u201cThat is the role of a leader: To ensure that we\u2019re in the debates and we\u2019re taking on the conversations to make sure we promote the value that we create, and secondly, we explain how we\u2019re going to do better on those things that we need to improve on.\u201d\n\u2022 Wholesale food distributor United Natural Foods hired David Best as president and chief executive officer of retail, effective August 17. Best previously served as president and chief operating officer of Coborn\u2019s Inc., and has also held leadership roles at General Mills and Target.\n\u2022 Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson appointed Artie Starrs as president and chief executive officer, effective October 1. Starrs most recently worked as CEO of Topgolf International, and he will succeed Jochen Zeitz, who is transitioning into a senior advisor role.\n\u2022 Communications infrastructure firm Crown Castle selected Christian Hillabrant as its next president and chief executive officer, effective September 15. Hillabrant previously worked as the CEO and chairman of the Management Board at Vantage Towers AG.\n\nLeaders often find themselves in high-pressure situations, and the way they handle themselves will make a huge difference. Bose CEO Lila Snyder explains how her time as a college cheerleader taught her the importance of poise in all situations.\n\nThe honorees on this year\u2019s Forbes 50 Over 50 list show that savvy businesswomen build wisdom as time goes on. Several recipients shared pieces of advice that they wished they could have given themselves in the past.\n\nLast week, President Trump called for the resignation of which company\u2019s CEO over their potential ties to China?\n\nSee if you got the answer right here.",

      "text": "Trump is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement (again), reversing U.S. climate policy\nPresident Donald Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement \u2014 again.\nUnder the international climate accord, first negotiated in 2015, countries around the world agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming and forestall the worst impacts of climate change.\nTrump has argued the agreement imposes unfair burdens on the American economy, and he withdrew the U.S. during his first term in office. The U.S. officially rejoined under President Joe Biden in 2021.\nOn Monday, Trump started the process over again, signing an order onstage before supporters at the Capital One Arena, just hours after taking office.\n\"I'm immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris climate accord rip-off,\" he said during earlier remarks, to loud cheers from the audience. \"The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity.\"\nChina is currently the largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, though it also leads the world in the deployment of renewable energy. U.S. emissions have been decreasing since the mid-2000s, but it remains the largest historical contributor of total carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe move to exit the Paris Agreement wasn't a surprise, given that Trump's campaign signaled the departure months ago.\nBut it comes after the hottest year on record, as major wildfires are still burning in Los Angeles, and just months after devastating hurricanes hit communities from Florida to North Carolina. Climate change is increasing the risk from hurricanes, driving more extreme rainfall, and making more intense and destructive wildfires more likely.\nEnvironmental groups harshly criticized the decision. Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental watchdog group, said the human and economic consequences of climate change will only grow if the U.S. doesn't do its part to limit warming.\n\"Even now\u2026we're seeing these droughts, storms, heat waves, flooding, sea level rise accelerating,\" Cleetus said. \"It is just stunning already the kinds of impacts that are unfolding.\"\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris Agreement, said in a statement that the U.S. pulling out of the deal is unfortunate. But, she said, international climate action \"has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country's politics and policies.\"\n\"This moment should serve as a wake-up call to reform the system, ensuring that those most affected \u2013 communities and individuals on the front lines \u2013 are at the center of our collective governance,\" Tubiana said.\nAn ambitious global tool \u2014 that has so far fallen short\nUnder the Paris Agreement, nearly every country in the world agreed to a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\nBut the world is not currently on track to meet these goals. Last year was the hottest in human history, as global average temperatures hovered around that 1.5 degree Celsius level of warming.\nAs part of the Paris Agreement's terms, countries submit targets for emissions reductions and provide periodic updates on their progress. Before Biden left office, he announced a new U.S. goal: to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60% from peak levels by 2035, a goal that would likely require a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. That target is now moot.\nIn the order signed Monday, Trump directed his U.N. ambassador to submit formal notice of the U.S. exit. (Trump's nominee for ambassador to the U.N., New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.) While the order says U.S. withdrawal will be effective \"immediately\" once notice is given, the Paris Agreement itself stipulates that the process takes a full year.\nThough Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement during his first term in office, it wasn't easy to leave. The administration was bound by restrictions on exiting the accord during its first few years. It ultimately took nearly four years before the U.S. was actually out of the agreement, said David Waskow, who leads international climate policy and politics at the World Resources Institute.\n\"That is very different this time,\" Waskow said.\nLeaving the accord could prove damaging, Waskow said, by potentially sidelining the U.S. from some clean energy and green tech markets and reducing leverage with other countries. That could hamper some of Trump's broader economic goals for the U.S.\nTrump has been hostile to many renewable energy initiatives and other climate measures, including efforts to promote electric vehicles. His nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, acknowledged the reality of human-caused climate change in his confirmation hearing, but has indicated the Trump administration would seek to roll back many environmental regulations.\nRevoking Biden-era climate efforts\nTrump also issued a barrage of other orders Monday aimed at boosting fossil fuels and undoing Biden-era initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions. He declared a national energy emergency and revoked many of Biden's executive orders on climate change. New orders instruct agencies to roll back restrictions on offshore drilling and reconsider protections for Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\nTrump also issued a moratorium on new wind power projects on federal lands, pausing new leases and permits for both onshore and offshore wind farms. He revoked an executive order that compelled government regulators to assess the risks of climate change to the financial system. And he instructed agencies to review any regulations that might \"burden the development of domestic energy resources.\"\nThat could include major Biden administration climate policies, including EPA rules limiting emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants and new fees on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.\nJulia Simon contributed reporting to this story."

      "text": "President Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to bolster the country\u2019s declining coal industry, relaxing restrictions on coal mining, leasing and exports in what the White House said was an effort to meet the energy-intensive needs of artificial intelligence data centers.\nThe executive orders were the latest moves by the Trump administration that clash with global aims to reduce coal power and cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change.\nStanding before dozens of coal miners in uniform shirts and hard hats, Trump introduced the orders, repeatedly referring to \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d\nCoal is considered the dirtiest fossil fuel and historically the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Burning fossil fuels, which unleashes carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, is the primary contributor to global warming.\nTrump\u2019s executive actions will keep open some coal plants that were set for retirement, allow coal leasing on public lands to resume and will direct the Department of Energy and other federal agencies to assess how electricity from coal-fired power plants can meet rising demand for power from artificial intelligence.\nThe orders come as the Environmental Protection Agency under its new administrator, Lee Zeldin, has been aggressively rolling back various environmental regulations over the past month, including ones that target pollution from power plants and emissions generated by oil and gas companies.\nThe coal industry has been in decline in the U.S. for more than a decade. In 2023, coal generated about 16% of total electricity in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration \u2014 down sharply from roughly 45% in 2010. The rise of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, have also lessened the country\u2019s reliance on coal.\nThe push to revive the coal industry also runs counter to most Americans\u2019 priorities, according to the latest public opinion research from Yale University.\nThe national survey found that two-thirds of Americans support a transition away from fossil fuels like coal to entirely clean energy by 2050. The research also found even broader support for regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, with 74% of those surveyed in favor of such regulations. Coal power produces more than twice as much carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity as gas power plants.\nBurning coal to generate electricity could also cost Americans three to four times more than clean energy, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Adding coal power would cost $89 per megawatt hour, compared with $31 for onshore wind or $23 for solar.\nIn widespread job cuts last week across the Department of Health and Human Services, the Trump administration also eliminated several entire divisions focused on the safety of mining workers.\nCritics were quick to denounce Trump\u2019s executive orders, with former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy saying the action will exacerbate climate change and damage public health.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as clean coal,\u201d McCarthy, who also served as White House national climate adviser in the Biden administration, said in a statement. \u201cJust as Trump\u2019s tariffs are hitting Americans\u2019 wallets, his administration is wasting taxpayer dollars to prop up an expensive, dangerous, and dirty industry when we have abundant, cheaper, better, and safer clean energy.\u201d\nThe rise of artificial intelligence has spurred a hunt for new energy resources, with some in tech pushing money toward more sustainable sources including nuclear energy. But the demand for energy from AI is expected to test even the relatively big and robust U.S. system, with some calling for greater investment in an effort to keep up with international rivals, most notably China.\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs projected that the expansion of AI data centers will increase global power demand by 165% in the next five years."

We asked, and they answered.\nBy Erin Spencer Sairam, Senior Contributor\nThe Forbes 50 Over 50 list showcases what it means to find success on your own terms, in your own time. The 200 women on this year\u2019s list are thriving in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and beyond as they launch companies, lead boardrooms, engineer breakthroughs and start movements.\nSome steadily climbed ladders to get to where they are today. Others built their own. And many used their positions of power to help others climb, too. Along the way, each blazed a trail that earned them the kind of wisdom that\u2019s impossible to shortcut. Now, with time as their teacher and success on their side, we asked the women on this year\u2019s list what they might say if they could sit down with their younger selves. Their responses offer salient reminders to give yourself more grace, to take bigger leaps and trust that the non-linear path just might be the one you were always meant to follow.\nHere\u2019s a sampling of what they told us:\nMaribel P\u00e9rez Wadsworth\n52 | President & CEO, Knight Foundation\n\u201cYou have to create your own turn. Young people\u2014and especially young women and people of color\u2014are so often told that they\u2019re not ready for the next thing, the big promotion, that it isn\u2019t their turn. I wanted to be a reporter, but when I tried out for my high school paper, the teacher told me it wasn\u2019t my turn\u2014even though I was a senior, so it would never be my turn. When I applied for a leadership job early in my career, the boss took my aside and told me it wasn\u2019t my turn. But soon I realized that I had the power to create my turn. I\u2019d tell young me that she can always create her turn\u2014by doing the work, by learning and improving, by always raising her hand, even when she may not feel she\u2019s ready.\u201d\nJo Cato\n60 | Founder, CEO & President, Periwinkle Group\n\u201cBe brave. The unfamiliar will shape you more than the familiar ever could. You left your home country as a young woman with just $20 in your pocket and no family waiting on the other side. That wasn\u2019t just a move\u2014it was a leap of faith. And while the loneliness will sting and the setbacks will test you, know this: your courage will open doors not just for you, but for countless others who will rise because you dared to go first. Don\u2019t shrink to survive. Expand to lead. Your difference is your advantage.\u201d\nLisa Suennen\n59 | Managing Partner, American Heart Association Ventures\n\u201cAlways take the job where you like the people. In the end, there is no clear career path, only great people along a path that reveals itself along the way.\u201d\nKelly Bishop\n81 | Actor, Author\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t do it. I often hear from young people whose parents tell them not to pursue something because it isn\u2019t secure. Do it anyway. Try it. Find a way.\u201d\nVicki Sato\n77 | Chair, VirBiotechnology\n\u201cLearn languages, at least one modern and useful one. It broadens one's worldview.\u201d\nJen Zeszut\n53 | Cofounder & CEO, Goodles\n\u201cYour kiddos are going to turn out OK. Working so hard while they are little and missing so many field trips and school plays is NOT messing them up for life! All three kids will grow up striving to find some kind of work or life purpose that fills them with as much joy and passion as they saw their mom bring to her work. (In fact, one is going to follow your footsteps and start a bunch of little companies all before the age of 20!)\u201d\nAmy Weaver\n58 | CEO, Direct Relief\n\u201cDon\u2019t cling too hard to the career path you think you should follow, or focus only on the next logical step up the ladder. Embrace the jumps to the side. You may feel like you are zigzagging, but with each non-linear move, you will gain new skills, meet new people, and collect experiences \u2013 these will be your building blocks. When I think about the most pivotal moments in my own career, not one of them was a straightforward promotion or an obvious next step. Each transition was either a lateral move to a new field or location or sometimes even a step backward to create a longer runway. And now as I look back, it feels like I\u2019ve been climbing in a straight line to exactly where I am meant to be.\u201d\nVanna White\n68 | Co-host, Wheel of Fortune\n\u201cFollow your heart. Follow your dreams. It can happen.\u201d\nAlexis McGill Johnson\n52 | President & CEO, Planned Parenthood\n\u201cTrust yourself to lead. Don\u2019t just step into power, step and stand in it fully. The work is long, but the line for leadership is short. Seize each moment of leadership with all the power that you have. Don\u2019t be tentative\u2014just drive it like you stole it!\u201d\nElyce Arons\n62 | Cofounder & CEO, Frances Valentine\n\u201cDon't smoke cigarettes.\u201d\nVictoria Coleman\n65 | CEO, Acubed\n\u201cParty more. I\u2019ve probably only been to one real party. And pick your bets.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump EPA moves to repeal landmark \u2018endangerment finding\u2019 that allows climate regulation\nTrump EPA moves to repeal landmark \u2018endangerment finding\u2019 that allows climate regulation\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Tuesday proposed revoking a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.\nThe proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule would rescind a 2009 declaration that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The \u201cendangerment finding\u201d is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.\nRepealing the finding \u201cwill be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,\u201d EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Tuesday.\n\u201cThere are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\u201d Zeldin said on the conservative \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast. \u201cThey created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.\u201d\nThe EPA proposal must go though a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. Environmental groups are likely to challenge the rule change in court.\nZeldin called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks announced at the same time in what he said was \u201cthe greatest day of deregulation in American history.\u2019' A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin\u2019s plan.\nUnder the Obama and Biden administrations, his predecessors at EPA \u201ctwisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,\u2019' Zeldin said Tuesday at an event in Indiana announcing the proposed rule change.\nTailpipe emission limits also targeted\nThe EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles, a rule Trump incorrectly labels an EV \u201cmandate.\u201d The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.\nEnvironmental groups said Zeldin\u2019s action seeks to deny reality even as weather disasters exacerbated by climate change grow worse in the U.S. and around the world.\n\u201cAs Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,\u2019' said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIt boggles the mind and endangers the nation\u2019s safety and welfare.\u201d\nUnder Zeldin and Trump, \u201cthe EPA wants to shirk its responsibility to protect us from climate pollution, but science and the law say otherwise,\u2019' she added. \u201cIf EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\u201d\nThree former EPA leaders have also criticized Zeldin, saying his March announcement targeting the endangerment finding and other rules imperiled the lives of millions of Americans and abandoned the agency\u2019s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they\u2019re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,\u201d Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under Republican President George W. Bush, said after Zeldin\u2019s plan was made public.\nThe EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report \u201con the legality and continuing applicability\u201d of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases.\nBut environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\nPassing court muster could be an issue\nThe EPA proposal \u201cseeks to deny settled science by creating legal distinctions that have no basis in the law,\u201d said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice. Rather than take seriously its responsibility to protect public health, \u201cthe Trump administration is pretending that the pollution causing climate change is not hurting us, even as we suffer more devastating climate disasters every year,\u201d she said.\nIf finalized, repeal of the endangerment finding would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change.\n\u201cThe endangerment finding is built on a rock-solid scientific foundation that has gotten even stronger over time,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. The finding \u201chas supported commonsense solutions that reduce pollution, give us cleaner air and protect our health and our jobs,\u201d he said.\nClimate scientists warned that overturning the endangerment finding would undermine decades of scientific progress and damage the credibility of U.S. institutions tasked with protecting the environment. The 12 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2009, and heat-related deaths are rising while wildfires are now more frequent and severe, said Scott Saleska, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.\n\u201cTo repeal the endangerment finding now would be like a driver who is speeding towards a cliff taking his foot off the brake and instead pressing the accelerator,\u201d Saleska said.\nJim Walsh, policy director of the environmental group Food & Water Watch, used a more explosive metaphor. \u201cLee Zeldin\u2019s assertion that the EPA shouldn\u2019t address greenhouse gas emissions is like a fire chief claiming they shouldn\u2019t fight fires,\u2019' he said. \u201cIt is as malicious as it is absurd.\u201d\n___\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/us-environmental-protection-agency."

      "text": "When Lila Snyder began cheerleading at the University of Miami (Fl), she learned a crucial lesson: Sometimes leadership means showing up with confidence, even when you\u2019re still finding your footing. Snyder, who cheered for the school\u2019s 1991 national champion football team, learned in real-time that she not only had to have the skills for the pressurized job, but she also had to appear like she was enjoying the moment\u2014even when that wasn\u2019t how she felt.\n\u201cYou look scared to death,\u201d her coach told her during the National Championship game in front of 100,000 fans and a televised audience.\n\u201cI am scared to death,\u201d she admitted.\nHis reply stuck with her: \u201cYour job is to act like this is fun.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the light turned on for Snyder, who in 2020 was named the first female CEO of Bose. Cheerleading became her proving ground\u2014not just for performance, but for poise.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that, as you\u2019re taking these risks and failing, you\u2019ve got to act a little bit like you belong there,\u201d the groundbreaking CEO explained in a recent interview. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t feel it inside. You build confidence by doing that.\u201d\nRaised in Toledo, Ohio, Snyder enrolled at Miami as an undergrad. Cheering for the high-performance team, which was packed with NFL prospects, gave her a rare behind-the-scenes view of what winning looked like. She saw it wasn\u2019t just a matter of talent. It was also a factor of chemistry, toughness, hard work\u2014and confidence.\nSlowly but surely, she settled herself. While the job may have been daunting, Snyder knew in the back of her mind that she would solve it. That\u2019s just who she has always been. Growing up, she prided herself on a love of finding solutions, whether that was coming home eagerly to begin the day\u2019s math homework or when she was working with her father in the garage, fixing cars and appliances.\nToday, uncomfortable situations are nothing for her to worry about. In fact, she has long sought them out. \u201cThe framework that I liked to use when I was earlier in my career was at least once a week to do something uncomfortable,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cAsk to meet someone, ask someone for feedback, raise your hand to do something. Do something that makes you feel a little bit anxious and a little bit uncomfortable.\u201d\nThe moment you feel settled or satisfied is the moment you begin to let your edge dull. Winning is a result of preparation and of never slowing down. \u201cChampionships,\u201d Snyder said, \u201care won in the offseason. I saw the work that went on in February and March and April. To consistently win at a high level, you have to keep your foot on the gas and you can\u2019t have those letdown moments where you say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take it easy for a little while.\u2019\u201d\nInternalizing those rules helped her once she left \u201cThe U.\u201d After Miami, Snyder went on to earn her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at MIT. Then she rose up the ranks of the business world to find herself as the first female CEO at the iconic audio company, Bose. But for those who know her, that success is no surprise. Throughout her life, she has always been willing to ask questions and to listen closely to the responses she received.\nThe same is true for another CEO, Amway\u2019s Michael Nelson. An avid runner who grew up playing baseball, Nelson says it\u2019s crucial for business leaders to ask questions\u2014especially when evaluating themselves. When you\u2019re a leader, it can seem crucial to have an unflinching vision for the future. But Nelson thinks differently. \u201cA company has to ask itself if you are happy with the culture and values you have within the company,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\nPro baseball player Cal Raleigh does the same thing for his game. In the offseason, Raleigh told ESPN\u2019s Mina Kimes, he evaluated himself like another catcher might. He wondered what pitches he would call to try and get himself out. Then he\u2019d practice accordingly. \u201cYou have to learn the game from the other side of the ball,\u201d he said. \u201c[Then] apply it to your own self, as well. How would I get myself out or how would I pitch to myself?\u201d That way, the 2025 MLB MVP candidate said, you can make yourself better.\nSnyder agrees. It\u2019s crucial to look in the mirror. And sometimes when you do, you have to show off those pearly whites! \u201cI learned how to put myself out there,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd you have to figure it out. Talk about being uncomfortable! I was uncomfortable almost all the time.\u201d"

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday urged Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign \u201cimmediately,\u201d lowering Intel\u2019s stock in premarket trading after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned the company over Tan\u2019s ties to Chinese firms.\nKey Facts\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \u201cThere is no other solution to this problem.\u201d\nCotton reportedly wrote a letter to Intel board chair Frank Yeary earlier this week asking whether the board was aware of Tan\u2019s connection to Chinese firms and a criminal case involving Cadense Design, where Tan served as CEO before being hired at Intel in March, as Cotton cited his \u201cconcern about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security.\u201d\nCotton questioned whether Tan divested from Chinese companies linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, whether Tan adequately disclosed other ties and what measures Intel took to address those concerns.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Intel said it would address Cotton\u2019s concerns with him directly, noting the company and Tan are \u201cdeeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem.\u201d\nIntel said in a statement the company, its board and Tan are \u201cdeeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with\u201d Trump\u2019s agenda.\nTan sent a memo to Intel employees saying there was \u201ca lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles\u201d while noting he has \u201calways operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are engaging with the [Trump administration] to address the masters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts.\u201d\nTangent\nIntel\u2019s shares traded down nearly 2% in premarket trading, returning some losses after the stock fell more than 5% in the minutes after Trump\u2019s social media post.\nWhat Are Intel Ceo Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s Ties To China?\nReuters reported in April that Tan has invested in several China-based companies through Walden International, his venture capital firm, and two Hong Kong holding companies. With Walden International, Tan became an investor in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China\u2019s largest chip foundry, in 2001 and served on the firm\u2019s board until 2018. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2020 for its ties to the Chinese military, and Tan exited his investment the following year. Walden was also involved in a joint investment in Intellifusion, a surveillance company blacklisted by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2020 for alleged involvement in human rights abuses.\nKey Background\nTan was appointed as Intel CEO in March, as the company cited him as an \u201caccomplished technology leader with deep semiconductor industry experience.\u201d Tan previously served as the CEO of Cadence Design from 2009 to 2021 and as its executive chairman from 2021 to 2023. Cadence Design pleaded guilty earlier this year after the DOJ claimed the company sold hardware, software and semiconductor design intellectual property to a Chinese military university, which was believed to be involved in simulating nuclear blasts. The U.S. does not prohibit U.S. citizens from holding stakes in Chinese companies, unless those firms have been added to the Treasury Department\u2019s Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies list, which explicitly bans those investments. In April, Reuters reported Tan had not directly invested in any company under the Treasury\u2019s list."
