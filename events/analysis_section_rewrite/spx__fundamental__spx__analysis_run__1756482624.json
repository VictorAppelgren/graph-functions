      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**  \n1. **Evidence & Citations** – Add inline citations for every quantitative claim that is not already referenced. For example:  \n   - “AI adoption drives larger, longer‑term engagements” → cite the article’s statement that “accelerating enterprise adoption of AI is driving a surge in demand for advanced data engineering, cloud migration, and platform modernization projects” (H86O3XRUJ).  \n   - “Platform expansion (DIAL, AI/RUN)” → cite the article’s mention of proprietary platforms (H86O3XRUJ).  \n   - “Bench cost cuts / utilization gains” → cite the post‑Ukraine restructuring details (H86O3XRUJ).  \n   - “Wage inflation / talent competition” → cite the risk section (H86O3XRUJ).  \n   - “Low‑code/no‑code threat” → cite the risk section (H86O3XRUJ).  \n   - “Geopolitical risk in Eastern Europe” → cite the risk section (H86O3XRUJ).  \n\n2. **Quantify Upside/Downside Ranges** – Replace vague “10–15 % upside/downside” with a precise range derived from the consensus fair‑value spread:  \n   - Upside: 19–20 % (from $170.28 to $212.69).  \n   - Downside: 10–15 % (if margin falls below 7.9 % or revenue growth drops below 8 %).  \n   Cite the fair‑value data (H86O3XRUJ).  \n\n3. **Catalyst Window** – Explicitly state the catalyst window for margin recovery: **Q3 2025–Q4 2026** (post‑Ukraine bench optimization completion). Cite the article’s timeline for restructuring completion (H86O3XRUJ).  \n\n4. **Remove Unsupported Speculation** – Flag and delete or re‑phrase sentences that lack direct evidence:  \n   - “The structural regime transition will occur around 2028, when the company’s earnings trajectory reaches maturity and the platform business matures; thereafter, growth may decelerate to a 4–5 % CAGR as the market saturates.”  \n   - “A 10–15 % upside to equity is plausible if margin expansion hits the upper bound of the 8.9 % target and revenue growth stays above 8 % CAGR; a downside of 10–15 % emerges if low‑code adoption accelerates or talent costs rise sharply.”  \n   Replace with data‑driven projections (e.g., “If 2026 earnings hit $580 M and margins reach 8.9 %, the 19–20 % upside materializes; if 2026 earnings fall below $520 M or margins stay at 7.9 %, a 10–15 % downside is realistic”).  \n\n5. **Causal Chain Clarity** – Tighten the causal chain:  \n   1. AI platform rollout → larger, longer‑term engagements → higher revenue.  \n   2. Post‑Ukraine restructuring → bench cost reduction → margin lift.  \n   3. Talent upskilling → higher productivity → wage‑inflation drag mitigated.  \n   4. Low‑code threat → potential revenue compression.  \n   5. Geopolitical instability → cost spikes or project delays.  \n   Use bullet points or a short diagram (if format allows).  \n\n6. **Maintain Focus** – All sentences remain strictly about EPAM; no mention of other assets or indices.  \n\n7. **Confidence Statement** – Conclude with a concise confidence rating (e.g., “Moderate‑high confidence given the clear structural drivers and recent upgrade; contingent on talent and geopolitical stability”).  \n\n**Result** – The revised analysis will be concise, evidence‑anchored, and fully aligned with the Argos standards, ready for top‑macro PMs and risk committees.",
