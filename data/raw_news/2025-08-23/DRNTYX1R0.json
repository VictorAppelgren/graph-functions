  "title": "NFL preseason winners, losers: Stars still await deals, but Jaxson Dart waits for no one",
  "description": "The league's 49-game exhibition slate came to a close Saturday night. And while the stakes were low, the moments were big for several players.",
  "content": "\u2022 Star hold-ins like Micah Parsons ... are still awaiting their just rewards.\n\u2022 One of the Giants' first-round picks might be August's MVP \u2013 if there was such a thing.\n\u2022 The returns for rookie quarterbacks were generally quite solid, though Cleveland's Shedeur Sanders (and his brother) ended on low notes.\n\nThe rehearsals are over, the exhibitions are done, and the figurative football bullets are set to fly after the NFL\u2019s 2025 preseason officially reached its conclusion Saturday night.\n\nThere\u2019s only so much to glean from pro football in August. The game plans are typically diluted, the stars are typically in sweats, and even legions of fans are typically home and maybe not even paying attention. Still, some key positional battles and compelling performances have been on display over the past month. How much of it translates into regular-season relevance? Stay tuned.\n\nBut, for now, here are your winners and losers from the freshly completed preseason:\n\nYep, the Force is strong in this one. Dart, the Giants\u2019 Round 1 rookie quarterback and an avid \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan, would probably be the prohibitive preseason MVP if such an award existed. He passed for 372 yards, three TDs and crafted a 113.1 QB rating while rushing for another 52 yards and a score. He even fed teammate Jameis Winston a \u201cW\u201d during Thursday night\u2019s walkover of the New England Patriots. (Priceless content, Padawan.)\n\nPerhaps most important, his swag has sent an infusion of optimism through the Giants' fan base. Dart may not be a Jedi master just yet or even an NFL QB1. But don\u2019t be surprised if his powers prove too strong for incumbent starter Russell Wilson before long. \u201cI feel like whenever my number is called that I\u2019m going to go out there, and I\u2019m going to play my game, and I\u2019m going to ball,\u201d Dart said Thursday.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Dart, one of two QBs taken in the first round of this year\u2019s draft. No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward of the Tennessee Titans appeared comfortable and steady as he heads into his rookie season, even if his numbers don't necessarily bear that out. Tyler Shough, a second-round pick of the New Orleans Saints, also has a shot to be a Week 1 QB1. The Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Jalen Milroe and Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Kyle McCord had their moments, too. And, of course, so did highly scrutinized Cleveland Browns rookies Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel, who will both apparently make their team\u2019s 53-man roster (despite Sanders\u2019 rough showing Saturday afternoon).\n\nThe buzz Dart has generated alone was a welcome spark for a franchise badly in need of it. But the G-Men looked resurgent in many other aspects while winning all three of their games in dominant fashion \u2212 by a collective score 107-47. There\u2019s a nice collection of young talent on this team, Dart joined by the likes of fellow rookie LB Abdul Carter, second-year WR Malik Nabers and others. Given how difficult their schedule projects, the Giants may not improve much from last season\u2019s 3-14 finish, but they could also be positioned to take off in 2026. It\u2019s worth wondering if coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen have already sewn enough hope to save their jobs beyond this year.\n\nNaturally, the 40-year-old guy is the only Browns quarterback who didn\u2019t get hurt this summer, allowing Flacco to fairly easily beat out Kenny Pickett, Gabriel and Sanders for Cleveland\u2019s starting gig to begin the season. The Super Bowl 47 MVP is also quite simply one of the game\u2019s good guys and an easy one to root for \u2026 if you don\u2019t actually have a rooting interest. Flacco sliced up the Los Angeles Rams while playing into the second quarter Saturday, his only preseason action of the month.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 first-round pick not only made a strong impression in camp, he showed his wares on the field \u2013 his first professional TD catch a spectacular one. With fellow WRs Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan expected to be weeks away from playing, Egbuka should be starting early \u2026 and could be a quasi-sneaky find for your fantasy roster.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 second-year kicker drilled a 70-yarder \u2212 eclipsing the regular-season record by 4 yards \u2212 in his first game this month and hit a 59-yarder Saturday. Of Little's seven August field goals, four were from 50+ yards.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens' rookie kicker looks quite comfortably installed as the replacement for disgraced and departed Justin Tucker. Loop hit all eight of his extra-point tries in preseason and was 9-for-11 on field goals, including five from at least 50 yards. His misses were from 46 and 50 yards. Don't be surprised if Loop winds up as the league's leading scorer given the numerous opportunities he's likely to get this season.\n\nThey added RB James Cook to a long list of players who landed extensions this year \u2013 preventing his negotiations from spilling over into the regular season. They haven\u2019t embarrassed themselves on \u201cHard Knocks\u201d \u2013 yet \u2013 and seem generally ready to make another strong run at their first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nNFL RECORD PROJECTIONS: How many games will Buffalo win in 2025?\n\nAs head coach Andy Reid has been historically inclined to do, he played his starters extensively this month. And they generally looked pretty good, the first teamers shining Friday night against the Bears while scoring 17 points on their first three possessions. \u201cThis is a little step but it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d said QB Parick Mahomes, who was not sacked in August behind his reconfigured offensive line.\n\nIn a bid to get off to a better start \u2013 coach Zac Taylor is 1-11 in his career during Weeks 1 and 2 \u2013 they played starters like QB Joe Burrow and WR Ja\u2019Marr Chase this month, and their high-scoring chemistry seems to be carrying over from 2024. We\u2019ll see what that means in September.\n\nHe\u2019s healthy on the heels of a season cut in half by a serious hamstring injury and was encased in bubble wrap throughout the preseason ahead of the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 game Sept. 4 in Philadelphia, when they and the Eagles kick off the 2025 regular season. Not only that, with so much attention on teammate Micah Parsons\u2019 contract impasse, there\u2019s been little relatively little heat on Prescott and his high-profile team heading into what could be the 30th consecutive season in which \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d fails to make the Super Bowl.\n\nThe No. 3 overall pick of the 2021 draft was the Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 leading passer and second-leading rusher this preseason. After making a strong case to be Justin Herbert\u2019s backup, Lance might finally be in the right situation with coach Jim Harbaugh to get his long-stagnant career finally on track.\n\nAll All-Pro-caliber players. All hold-ins. All still, maybe not so patiently, awaiting much-deserved contract extensions. But, hey, at least all of them got to more or less coast through training camp and preseason while their mostly younger, mostly less accomplished teammates had to grind through the heat. The entire trio should be fresh for Week 1 \u2026 assuming they\u2019re actually in uniform by then.\n\nAll All-Pro-caliber players. All hold-ins. All still, maybe not so patiently, awaiting much-deserved contract extensions. Assuming those deals eventually come, all three players must then try to vigilantly avoid the soft tissue injuries that so often plague players forced to deal with business instead of football at this time of year. Yet maybe it shouldn\u2019t be a foregone conclusion all will find a middle ground. Parsons and Hendrickson, in particular, have been at loggerheads for months and more \u2013 both have even expressed a desire to be traded \u2013 in their bids to extract raises from owners, Dallas\u2019 Jerry Jones and Cincinnati\u2019s Mike Brown, respectively, very much set in their ways ... for better or worse. Kinda hard to fathom why three teams with playoff aspirations have chosen to play with fire this long over stars who are arguably their most important players, quarterbacks notwithstanding.\n\nLance can relate to Richardson\u2019s seemingly premature demise. The No. 4 overall pick of the 2023 draft for the Indianapolis Colts, he now finds himself backing up Giants washout Daniel Jones going into Week 1. Maybe Richardson, a raw but sublimely talented dual threat passer who\u2019s 8-7 as an NFL starter, can work his way back into the lineup and flourish. But it currently feels like he might need a change of scenery in order to fulfill his estimable potential.\n\nThe second-year man with the howitzer attached to his right shoulder was acquired by the Cowboys via an offseason trade with the Patriots to be Prescott\u2019s backup. Milton played much better Friday night, albeit mostly against Atlanta Falcons backups, but generally left much to be desired in his other appearances \u2013 and for a team that had to rely so heavily in recent years on QB2 Cooper Rush, now Baltimore's backup. At some point, Prescott has to shed that aforementioned bubble wrap ...\n\nIn a bid to get off to a better start \u2013 coach Zac Taylor is 1-11 in his career during Weeks 1 and 2 \u2013 they played starters this month \u2026 and they continued their 2024 pattern of getting scorched, whether by front-line opponents or backups. Might help having Hendrickson out there, fellas. We\u2019ll see what that means in September.\n\nCaleb Williams and the offense looked fantastic in a Week 2 whitewash of the Bills, who, notably, didn\u2019t play their starters at Soldier Field. Yet the Bears' first team looked just as bad in Friday\u2019s loss at Kansas City, Williams seemingly reverting to some of the indecision and bad habits that plagued him as a rookie. \u201cIt was not the start we wanted from our (starters), really on offense, defense or special teams\u201d said Chicago rookie head coach Ben Johnson. \u201cOffensively, the first two possessions were really sloppy football that has plagued us in and out of camp so far and unfortunately that is what we got here tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Bears should be better in 2025, but it might take a minute for that improvement to show up in the win column.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 first-round defensive lineman could miss up to a month of his rookie season after suffering a sprained MCL on Thursday. Definitely a bummer.\n\nHe\u2019s finally back on the practice field after missing most of training camp with a disc issue in his back. Stafford seems on track to play in Week 1 \u2026 but is a 37-year-old with a bad back going to last until Week 18 and hopefully beyond for a team with serious Super Bowl aspirations?\n\nAfter getting traded from the Washington Commanders to the San Francisco 49ers, he\u2019s been relegated from starting in D.C. to backup running back duties behind Christian McCaffrey heading into his walk year.\n\nAfter not getting traded by the Falcons \u2013 yet \u2013 he\u2019s still a backup quarterback in search of something more.\n\nAfter getting cut by the Las Vegas Raiders amid fairly bizarre circumstances in July, the talented defensive tackle remains without a job.\n\nHeading into his second NFL season \u2013 after missing all of his rookie campaign with a knee injury \u2013 he\u2019s got all of two career preseason appearances (one of them this year) under his belt as he prepares to take over for Sam Darnold as the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 starting quarterback. What could go wrong in September given McCarthy\u2019s scant professional experience?\n\nPittsburgh opted not to play him at all in preseason even though he\u2019s new to the roster and OC Arthur Smith\u2019s playbook. Maybe it\u2019s no biggie given Rodgers got some live work against the Bucs in a joint practice and knows a thing or two about thriving in a league he's been MVP of four times \u2026 even if the Steelers open against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium, where Rodgers infamously blew out his Achilles in Week 1 two years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never a fan when guys don\u2019t play in the preseason, especially at the quarterback position,\u201d said NFL Network analyst and former two-time league MVP Kurt Warner. \u201cLast year wasn\u2019t (Rodgers\u2019) best year \u2026 would\u2019ve loved to see him get out there and just play a little bit \u2013 with a new system, with the new guys, get that feel back.\u201d\n\nHe watched one son, Shedeur, play like a rookie who deserved to be drafted in the fifth round Saturday afternoon. In the evening, he saw another son, Shilo, an undrafted free agent trying to stick on Tampa Bay\u2019s roster, get ejected for throwing a punch against the Bills. As Coach Prime has been known to say, \u201cOh Lawd.\u201d\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter.",

      "text": "Will Browns keep 4 QBs? GM offers update on roster cuts, Shedeur Sanders\nMost NFL teams carry a maximum of three quarterbacks on their 53-man rosters. The Cleveland Browns may buck that trend during the 2025 NFL season.\nBrowns general manager Andrew Berry was asked during Cleveland's 19-17 preseason Week 3 win over the Los Angeles Rams whether the team would consider keeping four quarterbacks past Tuesday's 53-man roster deadline. His answer?\n\"Honestly, it\u2019s not much of a decision for us,\" Berry told announcers Chris Rose and Joe Thomas on the Browns broadcast, per the Akron Beacon Journal.\nBerry's comments came as Cleveland navigated a logjam in its quarterback room. The Browns named 40-year-old Joe Flacco their starter but had three young signal-callers behind him in which they invested 2025 NFL Draft capital.\nThat included third-round rookie Dillon Gabriel, fifth-round rookie Shedeur Sanders and Kenny Pickett, whom the Browns acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson and a 2025 fifth-round pick during the offseason.\nThus far, Berry has been pleased with the performance of Cleveland's quarterbacks.\n\"All four guys have done what we\u2019ve asked,\" Berry said. \"We have a room that we like all the guys in there.\"\nAs such, the 38-year-old executive doesn't view carrying four quarterbacks \"as a problem.\"\n\"We more see it as an opportunity,\" he explained. \"The reality of it is, you have a 53-man roster. You can build your [48-player] game day roster, unless you\u2019re wiped out from injury, you can be pretty creative.\"\nWhat might that creativity look like? Berry outlined the Browns could choose to carry one less linebacker or safety, given the overlap those positions sometimes have in Cleveland's defense.\nEither way, it appears Cleveland's lean is to keep four quarterbacks on its initial 53-man roster. That would make the second consecutive season the Browns have taken such an approach.\nIn 2024, the Browns kept Deshaun Watson, Jameis Winston, Thompson-Robinson and Tyler Huntley past the 53-man roster deadline. That arrangement only lasted a couple of days, however, as Huntley was released on Aug. 29, 2024 after Cleveland was unable to trade the veteran.\nSanders, the team's current fourth-string quarterback, will be hoping to avoid a similar fate in 2025. The rookie was lauded by Berry, who spoke well of the Colorado product's progress and in Kevin Stefanski's pro-style offense.\n\"He\u2019s going from a college offensive system where\u2026 imagine you were fluent in English and now you have to learn Mandarin,\" Berry said on the Browns broadcast. \"His growth, really since the spring on, you know, with the mental side of things, having command of the offense, has been real impressive.\""

      "text": "Hard Knocks on HBO: 20 most memorable moments from NFL training camp docuseries\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 5, the 20th season of the preseason edition of HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" kicks off as NFL Films' sports reality documentary series follows the exploits of the Buffalo Bills as they prepare for the 2025 season.\nThis is the first time that the Bills will be featured on \"Hard Knocks.\" This also is the first time that a team that made the playoffs in the previous two seasons was selected for the HBO docuseries.\nIf viewers are lucky, the Bills \u2014 who boast the reigning league MVP in quarterback Josh Allen, have won five consecutive AFC East titles and are coming off an AFC championship game appearance \u2014 will provide a moment or two that could be considered among the best the show has ever produced.\nSo cue up David Robidoux's iconic theme music, and enjoy 20 of the most memorable moments from the training camp/preseason edition of \"Hard Knocks\":\n(Warning: Many of the videos below contain NSFW language.)\n20. 2021 Cowboys \u2014 Team HQ drone tour\nIn what was a largely forgettable season of \"Hard Knocks,\" it's probably telling that the highlight was a three-minute drone ride through the Cowboys' extravagant headquarters (a.k.a. The Star) in Frisco, Texas.\nThe video's cool, but also emblematic of a season that lacked substance.\n19. 2018 Browns \u2014 Carl Nassib, financial advisor\nCarl Nassib was one of a healthy number of breakout stars when the \"Hard Knocks\" crew followed the Cleveland Browns in 2018 \u2014 he revealed that he believes aliens are real and didn't appreciate offensive coordinator Todd Haley making fun of his first name.\nBut the moment that was most memorable was Nassib giving financial advice to his teammates.\n\"Who knows what compound interest is? This is real (expletive),\" Nassib says. \"Financial advisors are everywhere. They\u2019ll (expletive) take your money and they\u2019ll take one percent of everything you got, and you\u2019ll be like 'Oh it's one percent it doesn\u2019t (expletive) matter.' It matters. It matters a (expletive) lot.\"\n18. 2024 Bears \u2014 GM Ryan Poles gets emotional\nBears general manager Ryan Poles was himself a training camp cut back in 2008 after joining Chicago as an undrafted offensive lineman out of Boston College, and finds the cutdown day process to be grueling \u2013 \"To me, it's one of the worst days of this job. It's hard to tell that many people that their dream is ending.\"\nOne cut in particular got to Poles \u2026 defensive back Adrian Colbert.\nIt was Colbert's release \u2013 and the emotional toll it took on Poles \u2013 that played at the heart of \"Hard Knocks\" viewers. After Colbert takes a seat in the general manager's office, a tearful Poles excuses himself for a moment to collect himself. There's silence as Colbert patiently waits, knowing full well what's to come.\n17. 2023 Jets \u2014 Tanzel Smart, 'car-coochie board' enthusiast\nThe second time the New York Jets were featured on \"Hard Knocks\" wasn't quite as memorable as the first back in 2010, but it did feature an additional snack-related moment from the team.\nThirteen years after Rex Ryan's famous rant, fringe roster player Tanzel Smart added \"charcuterie boards\" to the \"Hard Knocks\" bingo card.\nIt all started when defensive end/theater aficionado Solomon Thomas said he'd like to take his teammates to a Broadway show. Smart responded, \"I want to go to a Broadway show. I want to eat a car-coochie board.\" Thomas is quick to correct his teammate, \"charcuterie.\"\nThree weeks later, Smart was sporting a \"I want to eat a car-coochie board\" T-shirt on the show.\n16. 2022 Lions \u2014 Dan Campbell's 'grit' speech\nDan Campbell's introductory press conference as Detroit Lions head coach in January 2021 was a preview of what was to come when cameras got up close and personal with the colorful coach for \"Hard Knocks.\"\nThe man who promised that the Lions were going to kick teams in the teeth and bite kneecaps in his first press conference with the team did not disappoint from the jump.\nAfter breaking down the team's simple rules \u2014 don\u2019t be late, don\u2019t be overweight, don\u2019t disrespect teammates or the game \u2014 Campbell trumpeted what his Lions would need to do go from laughing stock to contenders. Campbell used the ocean as a metaphor and quoted a Metallica song, but it was when he espoused the virtues of his team mantra, grit, that things went a bit sideways.\n\"To me, it means we\u2019ll play anywhere. We\u2019ll play you on grass. We\u2019ll play you on turf. We\u2019ll go to a (expletive) landfill. It doesn\u2019t matter,\" Campbell said. \"Doesn\u2019t matter if you have one ass cheek and three toes, I will beat your ass.\"\n15. 2019 Raiders \u2014 'I'm into (expletive) nightmares'\nOakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden provided a number of zingers for the \"Hard Knocks\" cameras. From his familiar \"knock on wood if you're with me\" slogan to telling receiver Keelan Doss that he's \"more excited to see you play than I am to see my wife, and I haven't seen her in two weeks.\"\nGruden's speech to open the 14th season of \"Hard Knocks\" was intense.\n\"Everybody right now has dreams, don't they guys?\" Gruden says. \"I got a dream of winning the Super Bowl. I got a dream of being in the Pro Bowl. I'm not really into dreams, anymore. I'm into (expletive) nightmares. Guys with me on that?\n\"You gotta end somebody's dream. You gotta take their job. You gotta take their heart. You guys clear about this NFL (expletive) now? We're not trying to go to the Peach Bowl. We're not trying to go to the Gator Bowl or the Bluebonnet Bowl. We're trying to go to the Super Bowl.\"\nThe Bluebonnet Bowl, by the way, hasn't been played since 1987.\n14. 2012 Dolphins \u2014 Vontae Davis gets traded\n\"Hard Knocks\" viewers had grown accustomed to players getting dealt the devastating news that they'd been released and \u2014 for many \u2014 that their pro football dreams were over.\nDuring the 2012 series with the Miami Dolphins, people saw a player learn he was being traded. It was awkward. Immediately after Dolphins GM Jeff Ireland delivers the news to Davis, the new Indianapolis Colts cornerback wants to call his grandmother. Ireland levels with him.\n\"You know Vontae, you're kind of up and down,\" Ireland tells him.\nIt worked out well for Davis, who went on to become a two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Colts.\n13. 2010 Jets \u2014 Darrelle Revis' return caps season\nDarrelle Revis' offseason holdout played out on reality television as \"Hard Knocks\" followed the Jets, giving viewers an inside-the-team headquarters view of the intense negotiations.\nBy the season finale, a deal was struck and \"Revis Island\" appeared at practice to the applause of his teammates. It was an appropriate capper to one of the best seasons of \"Hard Knocks.\"\n12. 2019 Raiders \u2014 Antonio Brown's eventful camp\nAntonio Brown never played a down for the Oakland Raiders, but he sure did take up a lot of air time during the 2019 edition of \"Hard Knocks.\"\nFrom showing up to training camp in a hot-air balloon \u2014 \"float like a butterfly, sting like AB\" \u2014 to his refusal to wear a league-mandated helmet \u2014 \"This lid? This lid ugly as (expletive) yo.\" But, Brown showing viewer's his cryotherapy-damaged feet that prevented him from practicing was quite something.\n\"Yeah, I (expletive) got circumcised on my feet, you know,\" Brown said.\n11. 2016 Rams \u2014 Jeff Fisher's 7-9 rant\nWhen \"Hard Knocks\" followed the Los Angeles Rams, version 2.0, in 2016, the team was coming off its second 7-9 finish in three seasons. Fisher had seen enough nonsense during a morning practice session and laid into his team.\n\"You follow me?\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI am not (expletive) going 7-9 or 8-8 or 9-7, OK? Or 10-6 for that matter. This team is too talented. I am not going to settle for that, OK? I know what I am doing. We had some 7-9 (expletive) this morning. Now, Deon\u2019s gone. That is 7-9 (expletive). We don\u2019t need it.\"\nThe \"Deon\" who Fisher references is wide receiver Deon Long, who was released for violating a team rule (bringing a female visitor to his dorm room).\nAfter a 4-9 start to the 2016 season, Fisher was fired by the Rams.\n10. 2012 Dolphins \u2014 Chad Johnson gets cut after arrest\nA day after an arrest on a domestic violence charge, Johnson was called into the office of head coach Joe Philbin and subsequently released.\nJust three years earlier, Johnson \u2014 then known as Chad Ochocinco \u2014 was one of the stars of \"Hard Knocks\" featuring the Cincinnati Bengals, talking about his catchphrases such as \"child please\" and \"kiss da baby.\"\nWhen Johnson's brief tenure with the Dolphins came to an end, so did his NFL career.\n9. 2018 Browns \u2014 Coaches meeting\nIt was quite apparent during the 2018 edition of \"Hard Knocks\" that Hue Jackson wasn't long for the head coach's chair, and it all started in the first episode.\nJackson, coming off an 0-16 season, was questioned by then-running backs coach Freddie Kitchens over his decision to not dress injured players at practice, specifically running back Duke Johnson. Todd Haley, then the offensive coordinator, came to Kitchens' defense. Jackson wasn't having any of it.\n\"The chair I sit in, it's a little different than the chair you guys sit in. I get to watch from a different lens. I think you guys can all respect that,\" Jackson said. \"At the end of the day, I get to drive this bus. And I'm going to get it the way I want it.\"\nJackson was fired that season after the Browns started 2-5-1.\n8. 2016 Rams \u2014 Player denies dinosaurs existed\nDefensive end William Hayes provided much-needed levity in what was a rather dull season featuring the newly relocated Rams in their first season in Los Angeles. Hayes had some thoughts, most notably that dinosaurs are a hoax and that mermaids exist. A \"mermaid\" showed up to Rams practice, too, much to the delight of Hayes.\nLess than a year later, the dinosaur-denier Hayes was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for \"a stapler and a coffee machine.\"\n7. 2015 Texans \u2014 Vince Wilfork shows up in overalls\nEntering his first season with the Houston Texans, Vince Wilfork opted to embrace his new home by showing up to training camp shirtless and wearing overalls and cowboy boots. Wilfork had a starring role in the show, as he also took on U.S. World Cup winner Carli Lloyd in a field goal contest.\n6. 2018 Browns \u2014 Jarvis Landry delivers epic speech\nLandry, entering his first season with the Browns, unleashed a 1,080-word, expletive-laced speech in the receivers room.\n\"I don\u2019t know what the (expletive) has been going on here, and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s been going on here, but this \u2014 if you\u2019re not hurt, if your hamstring ain\u2019t falling off the (expletive) bone, if your leg ain\u2019t broke, I don\u2019t know, you should be (expletive) practicing. Straight up. That (expletive) is weakness. That (expletive) is contagious as (expletive), and that (expletive) ain\u2019t going to be in this room,\u201d Landry said.\nBrowns rookie receiver Blake Jackson later staged a spoof of Landry's speech, and the results were hilarious.\n5. 2007 Chiefs \u2014 Dance off\nBernard Pollard has moves.\n\"This is how we do it in Fort Wayne. We got dancers. We got dancers in Fort Wayne. I'm gonna show y'all.\"\nYou were warned.\n4. 2015 Texans \u2014 J.J. Watt puts in work\nJ.J. Watt was an intense dude on the football field, and NFL Films caught how dedicated the defensive end was to his craft. Watt first is shown lifting 1,000-pound tires. Later, there's a post-practice workout when Watt practices pass-rushing moves on tackling dummies, takes on blocking sleds, catches balls from the JUGS machine and, for good measure, does some running.\nA year earlier, during the Falcons' \"Hard Knocks\" series, Watt \u2014 then embarking on the second of what would be three NFL defensive player of the year seasons \u2014 made a dramatic entrance and proceeded to dominate Falcons rookie lineman Jake Matthews (in front of his Hall of Fame father, too) during a scrimmage. So, when the Texans were announced to be the \"Hard Knocks\" team the following year, you just knew Watt would be one of the attractions. He didn't let viewers down.\n3. 2001 Ravens \u2014 Shannon Sharpe and Ray Lewis impressions\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens were the so-called guinea pig in this experiment by NFL Films and HBO back in 2001. The highlight of the first season of \"Hard Knocks\" was the rookie talent show, which featured spectacular impersonations of future Pro Football Hall of Famers Shannon Sharpe and Ray Lewis.\n2. 2018 Browns \u2014 Bob Wylie on stretching and the Normandy invasion\nCleveland Browns offensive line coach Bob Wylie went viral for a couple things during 2018's excellent \"Hard Knocks\" season. There's Wylie's stomach every time he says, \"set hut!\"\nThen, of course, there was the epic rant about stretching and D-Day.\n\"Did you know, World War I and World War II, all those guys that fought in that war ... they did pushups, jumping jacks, situps, climb the rope and ran. None of this fancy (expletive). And they won two World Wars,\" Wylie said. \"Do you think they were worried when they were running across Normandy about (expletive) stretching?\"\nNo, they weren't. And there are no reports of pulled hamstrings in the history books, either.\n1. 2010 Jets \u2014 Let's go eat a snack!\nThis is the transcendent \"Hard Knocks\" moment.\nCoach Rex Ryan wasn't pleased with his New York Jets, and gave them a verbal dressing-down that ended with what is the most famous line ever uttered on \"Hard Knocks.\"\n\"Let\u2019s make sure we play like the (expletive) New York Jets and not some (expletive) slap (expletive) team. That\u2019s what I want to see tomorrow. Do we understand what the (expletive) I want to see tomorrow? Let\u2019s go eat a (expletive) snack.\"\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "Shilo Sanders ejected after throwing punch at Bills TE Zach Davidson\nTampa Bay Buccaneers safety Shilo Sanders was ejected from the team's preseason finale against the Buffalo Bills after throwing a punch at Bills tight end Zach Davidson.\nSanders' ejection occurred at the end of a play that saw Bills quarterback Shane Buechele throw a 1-yard pass to Elijah Moore. Sanders was engaged with Davidson, who was blocking him and continued to push the rookie safety down the field after Moore had already been tackled.\nAfter Davidson delivered a final push to Sanders, the Colorado product took a swing at the 6-7 tight end. He landed a blow to the left side of Davidson's helmet, prompting an immediate flag from the officials.\nSanders was quickly disqualified from the contest, bringing to an end his first NFL preseason. The Bills scored an 11-yard touchdown one play after his exit from the game.\nBuccaneers coach Todd Bowles was asked during a postgame news conference about his message to Sanders after the play.\n\"You can't throw punches in this league. I mean, that's inexcusable,\" Bowles said. \"They're gonna get you every time. Gotta grow from that.\"\nSanders racked up three total tackles across his three preseason games with the Buccaneers, as he battled for a spot on Tampa Bay's 53-man roster. He was listed as a third-string safety behind Antonie Winfield Jr., Tykee Smith, Kaevon Merriweather and Christian Izien on the Buccaneers' most recent depth chart update.\nNow, the 25-year-old rookie's wait to see if he made Tampa Bay's 53-man roster will begin in earnest.\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "Colts name Daniel Jones starting QB over Anthony Richardson Sr.\nThe Indianapolis Colts have made their choice at quarterback.\nDaniel Jones has been named the starter ahead of incumbent first-stringer Anthony Richardson Sr., coach Shane Steichen announced Tuesday.\n\"He\u2019s our starting quarterback for the season,\" Steichen said of Jones. \"I don\u2019t want to have a quick leash on that. I feel confident in his abilities.\"\nThe Colts signed Jones to a one-year, $14 million contract this offseason amid continued turbulence with Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft who was benched last season for Joe Flacco amid a series of struggles and a request to exit a game due to fatigue. Richardson later returned to the lineup but has started just 15 games in two years and his 47.7% completion percentage in 2024 ranked last among all regular starters in the NFL.\nThroughout the offseason, Steichen harped on consistency as the key factor for the eventual winner of the competition. He returned to that theme Tuesday in explaining his decision-making process.\n\"You guys heard me talk about the consistency, and that's really what I was looking for,\" Steichen said. \"Really the operation at the line of scrimmage, the checks, the protection, the ball placement, the completion percentage - I think all that played a factor in it. Daniel did a great job doing it, and (Richardson) made strides in that area, but I do feel like he needs to continue to develop in those areas.\"\nJones, meanwhile, returns to the starting ranks after he was benched and subsequently released by the Giants last November during his sixth season with the team.\nDespite Jones' struggles the last two seasons, during which he threw 13 interceptions in 16 games, Steichen said the Colts had ample reason to believe the quarterback could helm an efficient offense.\n\"Well, I think that he\u2019s proven that he\u2019s played good football in that 2022 season,\" Steichen said. \"He had a hell of a year that year. I think that the highest completion rate in Giants franchise history that season. I know he's had his ups and downs, but everyone's journey is different, and I feel confident in his abilities.\""

      "text": "What are Commanders up to after Brian Robinson trade? Give them time to show us\n- Coming off a run to the NFC title game, Commanders seemed to fortify their roster yet agreed to trade Robinson on Friday.\n- Washington has also been slow to award WR Terry McLaurin, a longtime leader, a new contract.\n- But there are still two weeks to smooth things over and reveal a plan before the Giants come to play in the Week 1 opener.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what the Washington Commanders are doing \u2026 same. But let\u2019s not suggest they don\u2019t deserve the benefit of the doubt despite their recent maneuvers (or lack thereof).\nFriday\u2019s agreement to trade starting running back Brian Robinson Jr. to the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 in what effectively and belatedly becomes a Robinson-for-Deebo Samuel swap \u2212 landed with a perplexing first impression, particularly given what had occurred otherwise during the offseason.\nComing off a magical ride to the NFC championship game last season, spearheaded by Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels and a wholly new regime, the Commanders punctuated \u2013 well ahead of schedule \u2013 their return to NFL relevance. Then GM Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn spent a good chunk of the spring signaling a Lombardi Trophy push as their wunderkind quarterback entered his second season \u2013 meaning at least two more to go before Daniels is even eligible for the nine-figure extension he probably already deserves.\nPeters made a deal in March for Samuel, an often dynamic player if one who\u2019s often banged up and has limitations as a receiver. He\u2019s also in a walk year. Also acquired was left tackle Laremy Tunsil, who has a reputation as one of the league\u2019s better blockers \u2026 and for forgetting the snap count. Aging leaders like LB Bobby Wagner, TE Zach Ertz and QB2 Marcus Mariota all re-signed. OLB Von Miller joined, too, hoping for a Super Bowl ring with his third different team. Rookies Josh Conerly Jr. and Trey Amos appear to have the chops to be immediate and key contributors.\nIt all seemed to make sense, reloading and maybe upgrading in a bid to potentially deliver mortal blows to the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, who rule the NFC East and KO\u2019d the Commanders decisively in that NFC title game.\nBut lately?\nThe Commanders have been dragging their feet amid WR Terry McLaurin\u2019s desire for a new contract \u2013 and if ever there was a good soldier, it\u2019s McLaurin, who also deserves a medal for willingly being front and center for his teammates while unfailingly performing at a high level throughout the final tumultuous years of the Danny Snyder era. And, even then, despite a brief holdout and a training camp largely spent in street clothes, it felt like McLaurin would \u2013 will? \u2013 probably get his bag and smoothly reassimilate into Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense as the Batman to Samuel\u2019s Robin.\nBut exporting Robinson, who had nearly 1,000 yards from scrimmage and eight touchdowns in 2024? It\u2019s still a bit of a surprise, even though the writing appeared on the Commanders Park walls in recent days. Quinn excused Robinson from Monday\u2019s preseason loss to the Cincinnati Bengals and had the good sense and class to inform the player and team of the situation before kickoff. Afterward, rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt scored on a 27-yard TD run. Third-year man Chris Rodriguez Jr. started at tailback and rushed six times for 62 yards.\n\u201cThese are some really tough, tough decisions,\u201d Quinn said Thursday, when Robinson remained on the roster.\n\u201cSo, I'm definitely looking at those and that's what's keeping me up (at night).\u201d\nRECORD PROJECTIONS: How many games will Commanders win?\nThere\u2019s no question that Quinn and Peters see a bigger picture than fans, reporters and maybe even some Commanders players can envision \u2013 and maybe it will come into focus sooner than later. Maybe the hype surrounding Croskey-Merritt, who's been turning heads since being plucked out of Arizona in the seventh round is legit and no one will mourn Robinson\u2019s departure in a month. Heck, no one in this town saw Alfred Morris coming when he rushed for a team record 1,613 yards as rookie in 2012 \u2013 directly benefiting from the presence of dual threat QB Robert Griffin III for what it\u2019s worth.\nPerhaps the combo of Daniels, veterans Austin Ekeler and Rodriguez plus Croskey-Merritt actually elevates a run game that ranked third in the league in 2024 even though no Commander rushed for as many as 900 yards. And it\u2019s not like anyone will confuse Robinson's pedestrian production \u2212 by NFL standards \u2212 with Christian McCaffrey, the dynamic runner he'll now backstop. And yet Robinson was a generally reliable pass protector and a guy willing to fight for hard yards so Quinn and Kingsbury didn\u2019t have to overly rely on Daniels, whose electric legs produced a team-high 891 yards in 2024.\nYet it's hard to ignore the potential fraying to the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d mantra Quinn has leaned on throughout his career. Robinson, a pending free agent due a modest $3.4 million in 2025, gets shipped out for a song two weeks before the season \u2013 for whatever the team\u2019s reasons were, contractual or performance or both. Worse, McLaurin, a beloved team leader and perhaps the offense's second-most important component, continues twisting in the wind for a club projected to have more than $60 million worth of salary cap space in 2026, per OverTheCap.\nBut Quinn is attuned to the NFL's business side, much as he seems to be tiring of questions regarding Robinson and, especially, McLaurin, who\u2019s now off the PUP list but not yet practicing. As for Peters, who previously worked for the Niners, he witnessed his former boss, John Lynch, routinely drive hard bargains late into the summer and make many tough decisions \u2013 most worked out fine.\nThe Commanders only have 16 days until the regular season starts. Also, the Commanders have 16 days until the regular season starts. Much will doubtless be revealed before they open against the division rival New York Giants on September 7, a game that maybe isn\u2019t the layup it appeared to be even two weeks ago.\nBut in this brief interim, maybe a Washington squad loaded with veterans and led by a galvanizing coach deserve a little time and grace before anyone on Capitol Hill, Richmond, Ashburn, Landover or anywhere else in the greater DMV (D.C.-Maryland-Virginia) area pushes the panic button.\nBut just a little.\nAll NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "I want Shedeur Sanders to succeed. But Browns QB looked awful vs. Rams | Opinion\n- But his game against the Los Angeles Rams was brutal. His critics will use it as fuel.\n- Sanders completed 3 of 6 passes for 14 yards and was sacked five times. He looked lost.\nI want Shedeur Sanders to succeed. There, I said it.\nI believe Sanders has been held to brutal and unfair standards by the NFL and some fans. I think he's paying for the \"sins\" of his father, Deion Sanders, who some coaches and front offices in the league don't like because Deion is so flamboyant.\nThis is not breaking news. I've heard this. Talked about this. Others have. The league wanted to teach Shedeur (and his father) a lesson, and they did just that with the draft.\nWhen Eric Dickerson said this recently, it was dismissed by some as a cranky old man yelling at clouds. It's not that I believe Dickerson, it's that this is the NFL. You cover the NFL long enough and you know how the league works. They are Weyland-Yutani from \"Alien.\" They are The Company. With the league, all is possible.\n\"I tell you this much,\" Dickerson said, \"what I heard from someone that's in the NFL that the NFL told [teams], 'Don't draft him, do not draft him. We're going to make an example out of him.' And this came from a very good source, a very good source.\"\nDickerson added: \"He said that \u2013 I won't say who \u2013 somebody called the Cleveland Browns and said, 'Don't do that, draft him,'\" Dickerson said. \"Because they weren't going to draft him either. ... They were forced into drafting him because somebody made a call to them.\"\nThis all sounds like conspiratorial nonsense, but again, we're talking about Weyland-Yutani here.\nI buy at least some of it.\nHowever. Having said that.\nThere is an unmistakable truth about what we saw with Sanders on Saturday against the Rams. Sanders was terrible. Just absolutely awful. It was genuinely shocking to see.\nThis was a different Sanders than we saw in his game against Carolina several weeks ago. Then he completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns. He was fluid, dynamic and skilled. He looked like a player who could push for the starting job. Sanders was that good.\nThen came this game. It was the oppo-Sanders. He was 3 of 6 for 14 yards in five drives. Sanders was also sacked five times. Some of those sacks weren't his fault. Some of them were. But he looked absolutely lost.\nMaybe he was still hurting from an oblique injury that sidelined him for a few days. We also don't know everything about the players who were on the field around him. Maybe they weren't very good. But what's certain is that neither was he.\nHis bad outing also comes on the day that Dillon Gabriel looked good. Gabriel looked so good that the battle between him and Sanders came to an obvious end. Gabriel won. Gabriel won because overall he was more consistent. Not spectacular. But good and consistent. He looks reliable, and that's what an NFL head coach wants from his quarterback.\nWhat Sanders' outing will do is cause people to say: we told you so. We told you he was overrated. There was no conspiracy, you lunkheads. He was a media creation (I wish I had this kind of power.)\nAnd right now, sitting here \u2013 and it's painful to admit \u2013 Sanders' critics look more right than the people who want to see him succeed. And, again, I'm the latter.\nThat's what you'll hear and maybe that is correct. Maybe Sanders is overrated and teams knew something about his skillset that we didn't. I don't believe this. I'd like to see more from Sanders before coming to that conclusion, but that's what will be said about him. And to be clear it's not unfair.\nIt's wrong, but it's not unfair.\nSanders has shown flashes of talent, and if I were the Browns, I'd keep him on the roster, and see all that's there. That seems to be the likely conclusion, but who the hell knows.\nI want Sanders to succeed ...\n... but this day was bad."

      "text": "How long is Jalen McMillan out? Injury update, return date for Buccaneers' WR\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have no shortage of talent on offense \u2013 but they are about to test the limits of that.\nChris Godwin continues to face an uncertain timeline for a return to action following a season-ending ankle injury in 2024. Now, Jalen McMillan is poised to join that club as he deals with a neck injury that will sideline him for the foreseeable future.\nThe second-year pro out of Washington emerged as a key piece of Tampa's offense, especially after Godwin went down in Week 7.\nMcMillan finished the season by scoring touchdowns in five straight games, capping off his rookie year with 37 receptions, 461 yards and eight touchdowns.\nThe Bucs are fortunate in that they are built to withstand these injuries. With them continuing to mount, however, it remains to be seen how much more they can take.\nHere's the latest on McMillan and how long he could be out.\nWhat is Jalen McMillan's injury?\nMcMillan is dealing with a severe neck strain after taking an awkward fall onto his head and neck during the team's second preseason game on Aug. 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe receiver was flipped by Steelers' cornerback, Daryl Porter Jr. McMillan was able to walk off the field under his own power and was taken to the hospital for evaluation. He was wearing a neck brace, but able to return to Tampa with the team.\nHead coach Todd Bowles told reporters on Tuesday that the injury shouldn't be career-threatening.\nHow long is Jalen McMillan out?\nMcMillan is set to land on injured reserve to start the season, which will keep him out a minimum of four games. The receiver could miss time beyond those initial four games, however, with the Tampa Bay Times' Rick Stroud reporting that McMillan could be out through the team's Week 9 bye.\nJalen McMillan return date\nMcMillan could miss around half of the 2025 regular season, pushing his return date to November at the earliest.\nBuccaneers WR depth chart\nWith McMillan set to be sidelined and Godwin still on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, here is a look at the Buccaneers' remaining WR depth chart:\nEvans remains the clear WR1, but Tampa's depth will be tested in a big way without McMillan and potentially Godwin. Egbuka, the team's first round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, is the beneficiary in this case. The former Ohio State star should see a lot more playing time and opportunity in his rookie year.\nPalmer and Shepard are depth pieces that have each had their moments in Tampa, while Johnson was a seventh-round pick in the draft."

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders shined vs. Panthers. Will performance shake up Browns' QB depth chart? | Opinion\n- Listed as fourth-string on the Browns' depth chart, Shedeur Sanders got the start vs. the Panthers\n- He finished 14-for-23 for 138 yards and threw two touchdowns\n- What does his performance mean for the Browns' QB competition?\nCHARLOTTE, NC \u2013 So much for the narrative that Shedeur Sanders was set up to fail.\nNo, there\u2019s another way to look at this after the fifth-round rookie quarterback essentially aced his test for the Cleveland Browns in their preseason opener on Friday night.\nSanders was hardly perfect while handling a heavy workload in the 30-10 exhibition win against the Carolina Panthers.\nBut boy was he good. Sanders, 23, threw two touchdown passes to Kaden Davis that looked as if they were guided by laser. He had a few Harry Houdini moments, escaping at least four would-be sacks. He flowed off-script, like on a 30-yard completion that fellow rookie Luke Floriea hauled in with one hand. And he never committed a turnover.\nYet afterward, Sanders (14-of-23, 138 yards, 106.8 passer rating) bemoaned missing on a couple throws that got away.\n\u201cDid I play up to par?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\nWell, he\u2019s entitled to his opinion, too. So, just imagine what Sanders, listed as fourth-string on the depth chart, might have done if he had worked some practice reps with the starters or the second team. Sanders has yet to have a single rep with the first team during training camp, and has had only a handful with the 2\u2019s. He\u2019s the guy seen during practices working alone on an adjacent field.\nWith Kenny Pickett and rookie Dillon Gabriel, listed behind Joe Flacco, nursing hamstring injuries, Sanders got his chance to start and shine.\nSome suggested he was set up to fail because of his limited practice reps. Sanders, though, has a totally different view.\n\u201cI think overall in life, I don\u2019t want anybody to make excuses,\u201d said Sanders, who led college football in completion percentage in his final year playing for his Hall of Fame father, Deion, at Colorado in 2024 \u2013 then dominated the news cycle during the three-day NFL draft as his stock tumbled from a projected first-round pick to a Day 3 selection.\nSet up to fail?\n\u201cYou ask God for something. It\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to complain about it? So, it\u2019s two ways you can look at it. You can look at it and be thankful and take full advantage of the opportunity. Or you can look at it like \u2018Dang. This is what I\u2019ve been asking for, but I\u2019m not prepared.\u2019 I\u2019ve been able to sleep at night, knowing I was going to be playing. And then I just prepared as normal. Then that switch kicked in. When you\u2019re out there on the field, it feels different. Ball\u2019s ball. Ball has never been a problem for me.\u201d\nSanders may have just played himself into a serious contender for the Browns\u2019 starting job. After all, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski has maintained that it\u2019s an \u201copen\u201d competition. And if that\u2019s the case, Sanders, who played 45 snaps on nine series (excluding a kneel-down at the end of the first half), has at least earned the chance to get reps with the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s.\nStefanski evaded that question when I asked during his postgame news conference and also wouldn\u2019t touch the topic of the competition. The rookie wouldn\u2019t light a match, either.\nSanders: \u201cI just think about when I got out there, doing what I\u2019ve got to do. Everything else is not in my hand, so why worry about it? I just don\u2019t think that deep into everything because it\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to be able to control. Why put energy into something that you can\u2019t control? The most you can do is hey, man, if you get your opportunity and your number\u2019s called, perform it. At least to the bare minimum to win the game.\u201d\nThere\u2019s fresh videotape out there now, however, showing Sanders making splash plays like he did at Colorado and demonstrating keen instincts during his big audition. It\u2019s a starting point. Never mind that the Browns didn\u2019t play starters and Carolina played first-teamers for only a couple series.\nAs LeBron James so eloquently put it in a post on X, Sanders\u2019 performance shouldn\u2019t be discounted because he didn\u2019t play with or much against starters.\nAh, social media. Sanders was such a trending topic on Friday night, just as he was during the NFL draft.\nHis famous father, aka Coach Prime, didn\u2019t hesitate to put out a post amid the buzz.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Deion asked on X.\nStefanski and his staff \u2013 including Bill Musgrave, the Browns quarterbacks coach who was a teammate of Deion\u2019s on the San Francisco 49ers squad that won Super Bowl 29 \u2013 can assess so many layers of Sanders\u2019 performance.\nIf you wanted to script a test to cover all of the bases, the Browns couldn\u2019t have done much better than compiling the \u201csituational football\u201d scenarios from Friday night. Sanders operated in a nine-play drive and a two-play drive. On another possession, he faced back-to-back third-and-long plays, converting the first one after he rolled out and bolted from the pocket for a 9-yard run. Another time he powered under the pile to convert a quarterback sneak. Both of his TD passes came while positioned in the red zone. Another series had him backed up deep in his own end, then throwing from the end zone. At the end of the half, a hurry-up drill.\nSaid Stefanski: \u201cThe situations were invaluable for Shedeur, for all of our offense.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s this other situation, reflecting uncharted territory for Sanders. Someone asked about his patience, given the scant opportunities while buried on the depth chart.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different things and different life lessons you\u2019ve got to go through,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t gone through this situation that I\u2019m in, ever. So, it\u2019s really just a test from God. I was just thankful that I was able to see the light of day and get out there and play.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s so striking that he produced so much from so few practice reps.\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with being uncomfortable,\u201d he declared. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I\u2019ve got pockets of finding my rhythm. I\u2019ve got to get into that quicker, regardless of anything. But overall, I felt like me out there.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without the time, I couldn't do it without the play-calling,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, I\u2019m just thankful to have the joy of just being on the field overall. And carrying the responsibility to do the right thing. So, that\u2019s two badges under my belt already.\u201d\nAnd with that, Sanders re-wrote the narrative.\n\u201cMy vow is to definitely make change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd change was made.\u201d\nWhich adds some major intrigue to the Browns' quarterback situation.\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on social media:\nOn X: @JarrettBell; On Bluesky: jarrettbell.bsky.social"

      "text": "New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart looks like a future star\n- Jaxson Dart's preseason stats (372 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INTs) are impressive.\n- Jaxson Dart is reminiscent of a young John Elway.\n- Russell Wilson's time as the Giants' starting quarterback could be brief.\nYes, we know Jaxson Dart in the preseason was going against future plumbers and Canadian Football League players. (Not that there's anything wrong with that. Plumbers make a lot of cash and Canada is lovely this time of year.) Yes, we know it's preseason. Yes, things will be different when he goes against real NFL defenses. Yes, yes, yes.\nAll true but just, for a moment, look at these numbers for all of Dart's preseason:\n32 of 47 passing.\n372 passing yards.\nThree passing touchdowns.\nZero interceptions.\nSix rushes for 52 yards and a score.\nIn 12 drives.\nSorry to go all single paragraph on you with the stats, but that's a monster preseason. I'm not saying he's John Elway, but he reminds me of a young John Elway.\nMike, what the hell are you doing? Keep Elway's name out of your mouth. It's preseason. Take a Xanax.\nI've tried to stay calm, but in watching Dart closely this preseason you see in him what you do with young players who eventually become good in the NFL. Or great. There's a comfort Dart displays that is almost uncanny. He doesn't get rattled and looks like he's been in the league for years.\nIt was clear that Dart was a good athlete. We saw that in college. But many times that athleticism doesn't translate into the pros. Even in the preseason. But, hoo boy, is it translating for Dart.\nNew York Giants coach Brian Daboll has insisted that Russell Wilson is the starter, but yeah that won't last. There's almost zero chance Wilson starts the entire season, injuries or no injuries. It would be stunning if Wilson lasted past Week 5.\nDude, calm yourself. Calm. Yourself.\nYou calm down. I'm just telling you what's going to happen. This is incredibly predictable, and if I'm wrong I know you people won't hesitate to remind me.\nIn all seriousness, what he's done is impressive. He started against the New England Patriots in the team's Thursday preseason finale and made an impact early when he scrambled and found Gunner Olszewski on a short pass. Olszewski ran for 50 yards. That drive ended with Dart throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass.\nGiants receivers dropped five passes, and it didn't matter to Dart. Learning experience.\nOnce, he got carried away on a scramble, didn't go out of bounds, and got hit from behind. Cameras caught Daboll telling Dart: \"Slide.\" Learning experience.\nPreseason is to regular season what a starship is to a shuttlecraft. In preseason, no defensive coordinator is spending the week hardcore game-planning against you. Dart isn't seeing sophisticated blitzes and schemes. He's facing complete blandness and not even close to what the NFL has to offer in terms of defensive athletes.\nBut when I watch him, I don't feel like the game is above him. Or too difficult, and I think he can adapt.\nHe'll make mistakes, sure. He's a rookie. Dan Marino made mistakes. So did Elway. (There you go with Elway again.)\nThere will be ups and downs and risks but what he did in the preseason was fairly telling.\nLooking at the Giants schedule, the team seems unlikely to start him in the season opener against Washington. That would be a little much. Then come games against Dallas, Kansas City, the Chargers and the Saints. If Wilson is struggling, that Saints game might be a place to make a change.\nYes, we know Jaxson Dart in the preseason was going against future plumbers and CFL players. But watch out, Russell Wilson.\nWatch out."

      "text": "Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs starters play more than expected vs Bears\nThe Kansas City Chiefs hosted the Chicago Bears tonight in their final preseason tuneup before the regular season begins.\nThe final preseason game often sees few, if any, starters taking snaps throughout the game. Playing starters in a game that doesn't matter in the long run of the season and puts them at a risk of injury. NFL teams typically use this last game situation to make decisions about depth players on the roster ahead of final cuts on Aug. 26.\nSomeone forgot to tell the Chiefs that.\nTwo-time NFL MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs' starting offense played the opener three series against the Bears. They scored a touchdown, field goal and another touchdown on Mahomes' three drives.\nMahomes connected with wide receiver Rashee Rice for a touchdown on his final snap of the game.\nBackup quarterback Gardner Minshew entered the game on the Chiefs' next drive and led the offense on a 13-play, 59-yard drive culminating in a 23-yard Harrison Butker field goal to take a 20-3 lead over Chicago.\nThe Bears also played their starters more than anticipated. Quarterback Caleb Williams played the entire first half and gave Chicago their first touchdown of the game on a three-yard pass to Rome Odunze."

      "text": "Winners and losers of Justin Tucker's NFL suspension? Sorry, there are only losers here\nWinners and losers. They so often provide an informative, analytical and even fun framing device whenever notable NFL (or fill-in-the-blank sport) news occurs. Whether it\u2019s the aftermath of a big game, trade, draft, you name it \u2013 there are typically two sides of a coin to examine.\nThat wasn\u2019t the case Thursday, when the league issued its 10-week suspension to former Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, whose banishment takes effect Aug. 26 \u2013 whether or not the free agent is employed by then.\nAnd, yeah, some rookie you've never heard of will probably benefit from the fact that Baltimore had already cut ties with Tucker, creating an open job to compete for in training camp. But there are no winners from this sad saga. There are most definitely losers, though, and they are as follows:\nJustin Tucker\nDuh. On one hand, he ought to be grateful the NFL\u2019s announcement was, per usual, devoid of details regarding his violation of the league\u2019s personal conduct policy. And unlike the penalty the league levied against Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson three years ago, in what can only be described as similar circumstances \u2212 at the time, 24 women had filed civil suits against him involving allegations of sexual misconduct during massage therapy sessions \u2212 Tucker has not been fined nor ordered to undergo treatment or an evaluation. Watson was and had to pay $5 million.\nBut Tucker is radioactive. Last season was decidedly the worst of his 13-year career. Still the most accurate kicker in NFL history, he converted a career-low 73.3% of his field-goal attempts. It gave the Ravens a convenient excuse to cut a 35-year-old who was at the top of his positional compensation scale. And in light of the sexual misconduct allegations made by Baltimore-area massage therapists for incidents that reportedly occurred between 2012 and 2016, no team was likely to touch Tucker before the league completed its investigation into the matter \u2013 and there will undoubtedly be less consideration for him now given he won\u2019t be eligible to return until Nov. 11.\nBut this runs deeper. Again, the NFL didn\u2019t offer details as to why it has suspended Tucker, though The Baltimore Banner reported lurid ones in spades. All the while, Tucker, a practicing Catholic, has denied them, characterizing the website\u2019s reporting as \u201cunequivocally false\u201d \u2013 yet also won\u2019t appeal his suspension. Take that for what it\u2019s worth.\nAt this point, it seems unlikely Tucker plays in the NFL again. And what appears to be the final chapter of his once enviable career has probably delivered a fatal broadside to his Hall of Fame candidacy given the high bar his position already demanded.\nBaltimore Ravens\nIn a statement issued last month and attributed to executive vice president and GM Eric DeCosta, he said, \u201cSometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,\u201d when explaining why the Ravens released Tucker with three years left on his four-year, $22 million extension.\nAnyone paying more than a scintilla of attention knew the move involved far more calculus than that, but that\u2019s how the Ravens chose to frame it.\nThey missed the mark.\nThis is the same organization that was spotlit by the Ray Rice situation in 2014, when the team's top running back was seen on video assaulting his fianc\u00e9e in an elevator. He was eventually released and never played another NFL snap after being indefinitely suspended.\nFollowing the issuance of Watson\u2019s penalty in 2022, head coach John Harbaugh said of the Ravens\u2019 stance about player misconduct, \u201cBasically, we\u2019re kind of zero tolerance. You have to know the truth, you have to try to understand the circumstances, but we\u2019ve stayed away from that particular situation \u2212 when we draft players, when we sign them as free agents.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that we have that policy.\u201d\n(For what it\u2019s worth, the Ravens just spent a second-round pick on linebacker Mike Green, who\u2019s been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past.)\nAny profession has people who are less-than-savory characters. The NFL is no different, but its scandals make headlines that members of Fortune 500 companies (or far less notable ones) rarely draw.\nIt\u2019s just baffling the Ravens \u2013 a well-run, first-rate organization by nearly every other measure, on or off the field \u2013 would further jeopardize their brand. They undoubtedly carefully parsed their announcement signaling Tucker's departure. DeCosta also thanked him for his \"many contributions\" to the franchise (meaning its win total).\nIt\u2019s fine that the club took its time before cutting the cord while doing its own due diligence on the matter. But given the circumstances, \"The Ravens have released Justin Tucker\u201d always seemed to be about the extent of what he deserved.\nThe victims\nIn the event crystal clarity is needed here, victims are not \"losers.\" But the NFL's verdict offers further credence that they've lost too much.\nAccording to The Banner\u2019s reporting, 16 massage therapists from eight local spas shared horror stories about Tucker\u2019s alleged misconduct. It\u2019s important to note he has not been charged with a crime, and the statute of limitations in Maryland to file a civil action against him is long past.\nSadly, this is often how it goes whenever women are exploited. They won\u2019t see a penny in the aftermath of their trauma, which could be very difficult to escape for the balance of their lives.\nNobody's lost more than them, and that can't be forgotten.\nAll NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "Caleb Williams' 2025 preseason debut was perfect \u2013 but don't go nuts, Bears fans\n- Caleb Williams excelled in his first preseason game running Ben Johnson's offense.\n- Chicago looked great on both sides of the ball after what seemed like a highly successful offseason.\n- Still, there are plenty of reasons fans should keep expectations in check for at least another year.\nSavvy consumers of NFL football know better than to put too much stock into a preseason performance. Hopefully the same applies to anyone writing about the NFL for a living \u2026 though some of us have been known to get a bit too lathered up after, say, watching the Chicago Bears look like a potential juggernaut, steamrolling the Buffalo Bills, presumably a Super Bowl contender, 38-0 Sunday night in a nationally televised game.\nPump. The. Brakes.\nAnd yet ...\nChicago quarterback Caleb Williams made his game day debut Sunday, albeit in a contest that doesn\u2019t count, in rookie head coach Ben Johnson\u2019s offense. And Williams looked awesome. Finally.\nYes, he was in for all of two drives. Yes, he was facing Buffalo defenders likely vying for middle-of-the-depth-chart jobs (at best) in 2025. No, he likely wasn\u2019t seeing exotic schemes designed to confuse and frustrate him. Sure, Chicago\u2019s second possession stalled after six plays and resulted in a punt.\nBut did you see that first drive?\nMaybe before we obsess over the moment, we should review the last 16 months or so.\nIt was just a year ago that optimism was soaring \u2013 raises hand \u2013 in Chicago, Williams, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2024 draft, seemingly landing in as favorable a situation as any top pick ever had considering the talent that would be surrounding him. But he didn\u2019t. Turns out the guy picked after Williams, Jayden Daniels, was the one who instantly turned a woebegone franchise around and maybe had the best rookie season of all time while leading the Washington Commanders to the NFC title game \u2212 a performance that reset the bar for Williams.\nWhile Daniels excelled, Williams was torpedoed by his own bad habits, a brutally tough division and an organizational infrastructure simply unable to cultivate him \u2013 no accomplished offensive coordinator, no wizened backup quarterback to lean on, apparently no one to advise him to just get rid of the damn ball and live to fight another play. Chicago went 5-12, head coach Matt Eberflus becoming the first in more than a century of Bears football to be fired before the completion of a season.\nBut this year already feels different, even if the scrutiny is somehow heightened.\nSure, there has been virtually a daily summer dose of social media clips, whether in proper context or not, of Williams struggling and venting his frustration during practice while trying to ingest his new playbook. He\u2019s publicly welcomed Johnson\u2019s unsparing approach and meticulous schemes even as the coach has attempted to temper expectations around his new quarterback and team \u2013 one that reeled one of the hottest coaching candidates in years, aggressively retooled (especially along the line of scrimmage) during free agency and seemingly had a strong draft engineered by GM Ryan Poles.\nThen came Sunday.\nThere was Williams, opening the game by repeatedly feathering balls to his tight ends, reliable Cole Kmet and first-round rookie Colston Loveland. Then he zipped a pass to veteran slot man Olamide Zaccheaus, the catch-and-run resulting in a 36-yard touchdown reminiscent of the dozens and dozens Johnson had orchestrated while successfully lording over the Detroit Lions attack amid a high degree of difficulty and productivity over the previous three seasons.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Williams\u2019 numbers \u2013 which included five completions on six throws for 97 yards during that initial march. He was accurate. He was decisive. He showed off his patented pocket mobility but didn\u2019t overextend himself \u2013 a wise decision in the heat of relatively meaningless August action. He even dirted a ball at the feet of his lineman when a play failed to develop rather than hoping to make something out of nothing \u2212 gambits that often worked during a college career that included a Heisman Trophy but not so much against professionals.\n\u201cI think getting started fast is important, it was one of our goals coming into this game,\" Williams said during Fox's broadcast. \"Kinda set the tone for the team, the season.\u201d\nIt was indeed a snippet of what would portend a successful 2025 Bears campaign.\n\u201cThe challenge is to keep it headed in that direction,\" Johnson said Sunday.\nRegardless, whether preseason or regular season, these are building blocks Chicago can build with on its new foundation. Williams will doubtless have to play hero ball at times in 2025, but it doesn\u2019t need to be in the first quarter. He doesn\u2019t need to absorb unnecessary punishment \u2013 he was sacked a league-high 68 times as a rookie \u2013 while reverting to jailbreak football, which Johnson will doubtless attempt to drill out of him.\nThe Bears have won nine NFL championships in their proud history but just one in the Super Bowl era, which began in 1966. Williams knows.\n\u201cYou come to a place like this, with a lot of history, and you want to be able to make something of it,\" he said.\nBut he's got time. Johnson has time. Poles has time. A young and promising roster has time. However it's time to shine almost certainly won't come in 2025.\nA successful Bears season will require patience from the hard-driving Johnson as his new charges progress with his offense. If he\u2019s not getting incessantly grilled on local talk radio the way predecessors like Eberflus and Matt Nagy did, then that\u2019s a win. If Johnson isn\u2019t making himself mad while his players master his system \u2013 no trick plays revealed Sunday \u2013 even though the Lions took off almost immediately during his first season as their play caller, then that\u2019s a win.\nA successful Bears season will include new coordinator Dennis Allen getting the defense back near the top of the heap \u2212 and pitching a shutout under any circumstances is a positive development. A successful Bears season will likely see second-year wideout Rome Odunze blossom into a No. 1-caliber target.\nA successful Bears season might not result in anything better than a third-place finish in the NFC North, arguably the league's toughest division and one that could realistically produce three playoff entries. A really successful Bears season would include at least a split with the hated Green Bay Packers.\nBut for a team nearly 15 years removed from its last playoff win but just one from picking its latest would-be savior and just seven months from hiring a man who might finally be a worthy successor to Mike Ditka? Third place, perhaps eight wins, and maybe the first 4,000-yard passing effort in 106 seasons would represent realistic progress \u2013 and maybe the appropriate kindling to fan legitimate Super Bowl flames in 2026.\nAll NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "'I bust my (expletive)': Jerry Jones defends Cowboys' marketing over winning\n- A new Netflix docuseries, \"America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys,\" explores the Dallas Cowboys' sustained popularity despite a lack of recent championships.\n- Cowboys owner Jerry Jones attributes the team's value and popularity to his hard work and marketing efforts.\n- Jones defends Dallas' performance, citing its overall win record the past three decades and near misses in playoff runs.\nAgain, for maybe the 29th time over the years, I had to ask Jerry Jones to explain how the Dallas Cowboys \u2013 the most valuable sports franchise on the planet \u2013 have sustained such immense popularity despite continually falling short of winning championships.\nThen again, why ask? Just look around. Or watch.\nThere\u2019s a fresh answer with the compelling eight-part docuseries, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys,\u201d that dropped this week on Netflix.\nIt reminds us that no team does drama quite like the Cowboys.\nAnd it reinforces the fact that no team markets itself quite like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team.\u201d\n\u201cI explain it by hard work. I bust my ass,\u201d Jones, referring to the franchise\u2019s value and popularity, told USA TODAY Sports over lunch recently in his training camp office in Oxnard, California. \u201cThis exact same hard work that is going on in the football. I work my ass off. And that hasn\u2019t slowed down. This is the busiest I\u2019ve ever been at training camp.\u201d\nAll that busy work, though, hasn\u2019t resulted in a contract extension for All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons, whose \u201chold-in\u201d attempt for a new deal has juiced the summer episode of the NFL\u2019s longest-running soap opera. And Jones freely admits he doesn\u2019t mind the drama.\nAfter all, the rift with Parsons keeps the Cowboys ticking on the relevance meter.\nThe docuseries, meanwhile, adds more layers to the buzz. Sure, the rise and fall of Jerry\u2019s Cowboys \u2013 who haven\u2019t even advanced to the NFC title game in the 29 years since winning a third Super Bowl crown during the 1990s \u2013 deserves documentary treatment. There are electric characters. Rich storylines. Fascinating details. Heaps of controversy.\nYet despite revealing perspectives shared by the likes of Michael Irvin, Troy Aikman and Charles Haley, among others, the docuseries feels too much like a slick, PR-crafted production. I mean, did they really need those cheesy Western-themed backdrops and effects?\nAlso, for all the candid revelations from Irvin \u2013 who provided backstory from his 1996 drug possession trial and spilled the tea on the \u201cWhite House\u201d near the team\u2019s headquarters, where some players engaged in booze, drugs and sex escapades \u2013 there was no such depth relating to multiple controversies attached to Jones.\nNot that I\u2019m surprised. Somebody had to sign off on all the access and cooperation that gave the project its juice. Rather than delve into the team owner\u2019s stance a few years ago against national anthem protests by NFL players or touch the since-settled legal issues linked to a woman alleging to be Jones\u2019 illegitimate daughter, the directing duo of brothers Chaplain and Maclain Way portrayed Jones in a manner he would undoubtedly approve of.\nSure, Jones ignited controversy from the start of his ownership in 1989 when he, well, aptly replaced the legendary Tom Landry with Jimmy Johnson. And during the mid-\u201890s he sued NFL partners in breaking off to secure his own massive marketing deals. Look at how that controversy turned out: Forbes, in its latest compilation, values the franchise at $12.8 billion. And Jones, who bought the team for roughly $150 million, is in the Hall of Fame, having forever changed the NFL business landscape as the league\u2019s most powerful owner.\nYet it will be tough for longtime Cowboys fans to waltz down memory lane without connecting the nostalgia with the current state of affairs. The final episode of the docuseries titled, \u201cThe Drought,\u201d covers the 29 years since Super Bowl 30.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the common denominator? Jones. I get it,\u201d Jones said.\nThen Jerry, who is on his eighth head coach since Johnson but will indeed get testy when asked about turning over the reins as GM, digs in.\n\u201cHow long has it been since Buffalo won the Super Bowl?\u201d he said, knowing that the five-time defending AFC East champion Bills have never won a Super Bowl. \u201cBuffalo hasn\u2019t been chopped liver. They\u2019re solid. They\u2019re probably in the top third of the NFL.\u201d\nThe Cowboys, meanwhile, posted three consecutive 12-5 records under since-departed coach Mike McCarthy, with two NFC East titles, before sinking to an injury-riddled 7-10 finish in 2024.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t get as convicted that the way we\u2019re doing it, that our approach to trying to win a Super Bowl, that that needs to change,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m so defensive.\u201d\nHe knows. The visibility that comes with being the NFL\u2019s biggest draw just increases the heat when they flop, year after year, in chasing another Super Bowl.\nPut another way, Jones says, \u201cThe ass-kicking that comes with this doesn\u2019t deter me at all.\u201d\nOf course, Jones, 82, can still sell it. When he maintains that over the past three decades the Cowboys are among the top six teams in the NFL for victories, it illustrates how hope is such a tangible resource.\n\u201cThat shows that you\u2019re not defunct,\u201d he said. \u201cFair? I know we\u2019re in range to have success.\u201d\nBut still. A 29-year drought?\n\u201cOn two or three occasions, if not for a nano-second, a nano-factor, we would\u2019ve been in the Super Bowl,\u201d he said, including the would-be Dez Bryant catch in a 2014 NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay, as an example. \u201cSo, I hang my hat on those times.\n\u201cAnd I hang my hat on the fact that nobody gets to be in 20 of them. Maybe they experienced four of them, or three of them, or like Charles (Haley), five. Thirty years sounds like you should be in half of them. I don\u2019t look at it that way. I look at it like how many people have never been in one? I look at the three (Dallas won in the \u201890s) and I feel like I at least have three years left, or four or five years left, and there\u2019s always the promise that I can get it this season. Or get it next season.\u201d\nNow that\u2019s some serious spin. The scene from Dallas\u2019 last playoff game \u2013 a blowout loss against the Packers in a 2023 NFC wild-card round matchup at JerryWorld that was the worst postseason setback in the franchise\u2019s history \u2013 certainly provided compelling images for the final episode of the docuseries. Jones was in the locker room consoling players, including Parsons \u2013 the man now embroiled in a contract dispute.\nHe hugged Parsons and whispered that the blowout wasn\u2019t the fault of the star player. To which Parsons mumbled, \u201cI just wanna win.\u201d\nWhat a contrast to the vibe from the early episodes, which detailed how Johnson established a tone. The coach once refused to allow meal service on the team\u2019s chartered flight home after a disturbing loss. And in a classic tirade his first year, Johnson bellowed, \u201cThe asthma field is over there!\u201d after one player explained why he collapsed while running wind sprints.\nSure, times have changed. Some of the drills Johnson ordered during his demanding training camps wouldn\u2019t be tolerated today, under the collective bargaining agreement. Even so, somebody has to win big. And that is no longer the Cowboys\u2019 way.\nAt least when it comes to winning on the field. Otherwise, business is booming for a franchise still commanding a huge presence on the NFL relevance map.\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on social media: On X: @JarrettBell\nOn Bluesky: jarrettbell.bsky.social"

      "text": "Raiders release Christian Wilkins after one season. Why?\nTwelve months ago, the Las Vegas Raiders made defensive tackle Christian Wilkins one of the highest-paid defenders in the league with a huge deal in free agency.\nOne year later, the two have parted ways. The Raiders have released Wilkins, they announced Thursday night on social media, one year into the five-year, $110 million deal they signed him to last offseason.\nWilkins suffered a Jones fracture in his foot in Week 5 against the Denver Broncos last season and missed the rest of the year. He had surgery to repair the fracture and was placed on the reserve/PUP list on July 18.\nLess than a week later, the franchise released him.\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Wilkins and the Raiders disagreed on another surgery to repair his foot. Las Vegas reportedly wanted him to have that done while Wilkins declined.\n\"We have decided that it is in the best interests of the organization to move on from Christian Wilkins and he has been informed of his release from the team,\" the Raiders said in a statement. \"The franchise has a commitment to excellence on and off the field. With no clear path or plan for future return to play from Christian, this transaction is necessary for the entire organization to move forward and prepare for the new season.\"\nLas Vegas has already paid Wilkins nearly $22 million of the $57 million in guaranteed money included in his contract signed last offseason. The Raiders voided the remaining $35.2 million of his contract in June, per ESPN's Adam Schefter, but Wilkins has filed a grievance with the NFL Players' Association over that.\nRaiders DT depth chart\nWith Wilkins now out, here's a look at the rest of the depth chart at defensive tackle for Las Vegas:\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

      "text": "Rams QB Matthew Stafford ends mystery, returns to practice\nThe Los Angeles Rams welcomed back their franchise quarterback on Monday.\nThe Rams posted a video of Matthew Stafford walking onto the practice field dressed in full pads.\nStafford's practice participation is great news for a Rams team as they ramp up toward the regular season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be able to have Matthew out there. He did a good job (Monday). I thought he looked good, but I don\u2019t really have any updates,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cWe are gonna keep it a day and really a week at a time.

      "text": "2025 NFL record projections: Who wins Super Bowl 60? (Hint: not the Eagles)\n- Win-loss outlooks for all 32 teams, with one going 14-3.\n- We fully project and seed the 2025 playoff field.\n- And since we're not picking the Eagles to win Super Bowl 60, guess who will ...\nWith few exceptions \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 most of the NFL's 32 squads have fully taken shape, though a few important positional battles and contract standoffs await resolution. Still, this is the time of year when most clubs project confidence and optimism that, if everything falls into place, they could wind up in the playoffs and maybe even vie for a Super Bowl berth.\nYet the cold truth for most is that some level of disappointment awaits \u2013 whether that\u2019s a tough loss on Super Sunday or winding up with a top-five draft pick in 2026 (though that would be an optimal outcome in some quarters). Remember, this is a zero-sum game. Despite the good vibes emanating from most clubs, there's no avoiding the reality of math \u2212 meaning for every 14-win team, there's a mirror image somewhere with 14 losses.\nSo how will it all shake out? With every roster basically finalized (and maybe optimized) for the season ahead, let's try to forecast the 2025 season with record projections for every outfit.\n(A note on methodology: Using the most current information amid a few iterations of this exercise, I predict winners and losers for all 272 regular-season games to arrive at my projections. The outcomes allow me to apply tiebreakers, when needed, to determine and slot the 14-team playoff field \u2013 seedings in parentheses \u2013 before arriving at a champion. Warning, past performance is no guarantee of future returns.)\nAFC East\n(2) Buffalo Bills (13-4): Barring an injury to reigning league MVP Josh Allen, a sixth consecutive division title seems all but inevitable. Following their Sunday night opener against Baltimore, the Bills play six consecutive non-playoff teams from 2024 \u2013 an entire circuit through the AFC East with three other games against NFC South crews \u2013 which could catapult them to a very good start, which also includes home games in four of the first five weeks. Buffalo could also finish with a strong kick, four of its final five games against opponents who didn\u2019t reach the postseason last year.\nNew England Patriots (8-9): Could the hiring of coach and team legend Mike Vrabel plus an influx of talent into a roster that needed it allow the Pats to double their 2024 win total? From Week 6 through their Week 14 bye, New England faces just one team that reached last season\u2019s playoffs, a stretch that could set the Patriots up for a wild-card charge of their own.\nNew York Jets (7-10): Rookie coach Aaron Glenn has probably inherited a more talented team than his former boss, Dan Campbell, did in Detroit \u2013 Campbell\u2019s 2021 Lions losing 13 games. But these Jets could get off to a slow start, four of their first six games against clubs that reached the 2024 postseason, including a \u201chome\u201d game against Denver in London. But if new QB Justin Fields and his talented fellow youngsters jell over the course of the season, they could build momentum going into 2026 \u2013 nine of their final 11 opponents failing to reach the playoffs last season.\nMiami Dolphins (5-12): Will HC Mike McDaniel, who enters the season under some pressure from ownership, even make it to the stretch drive? If he does, the Fins\u2019 final five games are either in outdoor northern cities and/or against teams that had winning records in 2024 \u2026 and, historically, his team hasn\u2019t played well in either of those circumstances.\nAFC North\n(1) Baltimore Ravens (14-3): Could this finally be the year QB Lamar Jackson takes his team all the way? An upgraded secondary should address what was Baltimore's Achilles for much of 2024. And how good is an offense that seems to (somehow) get an improved version of Jackson every year, including 2024 when he was probably robbed of a third league MVP? Consider that recently signed WR DeAndre Hopkins, likely a future Hall of Famer, is probably the sixth option when you consider an attack that has a second tight end like \u2026 Isaiah Likely. Yes, I like, like, like these Ravens \u2013 and considering they have a midseason stretch when they play two games in 27 days, good way to stay fresh as they pursue a second No. 1 playoff seed in three seasons.\n(6) Pittsburgh Steelers (11-6): Optimism was riding high as new/old QB Aaron Rodgers assimilated with his new mates in the sweltering Latrobe, Pennsylvania, camp environment. There\u2019s little question this roster is stacked, more so after a bold offseason plan executed by coach Mike Tomlin and GM Omar Khan. Whether it coalesces remain to be seen. Five of the Steelers' first six opponents didn\u2019t make the playoffs last year, perhaps a nice layout as Rodgers and Co. work out the kinks, though that stretch also includes a trip to Dublin. But four of the final six games are against 2024 division winners, and Pittsburgh collapsed down the stretch last season against strong competition. Still, it does feel like there\u2019s enough ammo here to end the franchise\u2019s run without a playoff win at nine years.\n(7) Cincinnati Bengals (9-8): Since QB Joe Burrow was drafted in 2020, they\u2019re 1-9 collectively in Weeks 1 and 2 \u2013 the lone win coming in 2021, when Cincy reached Super Bowl 56. The ongoing drama with All-Pro DE Trey Hendrickson seems to portend another rough start \u2013 and the Bengals open at Cleveland, where they rarely win, followed by a stretch of six games that includes five 2024 playoff opponents. Starting in October, the Bengals leave Ohio once in a six-week period, so perhaps that\u2019s when they catch fire. Still, as much money as they\u2019ve already spent this offseason, the Stripes seem to have fallen further behind Baltimore and Pittsburgh, teams that finished ahead of them last season.\nCleveland Browns (3-14): Whoever wins their high-profile four-way quarterback competition will still be the division\u2019s weakest QB1. And with so many other question marks, especially on offense, it does feel like a team that has two first-round picks next year is already somewhat aimed toward the 2026 draft.\nAFC South\n(4) Houston Texans (10-7): With a new offensive coordinator (Nick Caley), reconfigured line, an already beaten-up group of running backs and three 2024 division winners awaiting in the season\u2019s first five weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if the Texans get off to a slow start. But they also appear to remain the least-flawed team in what seems like a fairly weak division and play three of their final four games at home.\nJacksonville Jaguars (8-9): Though they\u2019re not projected to advance to the Super Bowl 60 tournament in this scenario, this could be a team that surprises \u2013 especially if rookie HC Liam Coen can elicit results from QB Trevor Lawrence at least somewhat comparable to what he got from Baker Mayfield in Tampa last year. There\u2019s a fair amount of established talent on this roster, and that doesn\u2019t include rookie WR/CB Travis Hunter, who\u2019s now its highest-profile member. Over the season\u2019s final six weeks, the Jags face just one 2024 playoff team.\nTennessee Titans (5-12): A team set to start a rookie quarterback, No. 1 pick Cam Ward, will start out swimming in even deeper water with four of its first six games on the road. But maybe Ward gets on a subsequent roll with three successive games in Nashville following a Week 10 bye.\nIndianapolis Colts (4-13): Even if they were settled behind center \u2013 which Indy most certainly is not \u2013 a schedule loaded with the entirety of the AFC and NFC West was going to present a serious challenge for a team that\u2019s generally hovered around .500 since QB Andrew Luck retired six years ago.\nAFC West\n(3) Denver Broncos (12-5): The focus will naturally be on Year 2 of the Bo Nix-Sean Payton union, which comes off a spectacular honeymoon. However the Broncos don\u2019t get enough attention for an elite offensive line nor a defense which may be the league\u2019s best \u2013 particularly after it was further fortified by free agency and the draft. After playing the Jets in London on October 12, the Broncos will only make one road trip over the ensuing 48 days \u2013 a good time to gain altitude at altitude. But ending K.C.\u2019s nine-season run atop the division won\u2019t be easy \u2013 particularly when the Chiefs get a bye ahead of their trip to Denver and, later, host the Broncos on Christmas, which lands on a Thursday.\n(5) Kansas City Chiefs (11-6): Coming off what was probably the flimsiest 15-victory regular season in league history (average margin of victory 7.1 points), could they actually win four fewer games, relinquish the divisional throne \u2026 and still functionally be a better team when the playoffs start? Absolutely, especially with RB Isiah Pacheco and WRs Hollywood Brown and Rashee Rice healthy, though a suspension could still likely curb the latter\u2019s contributions. But don\u2019t be surprised if the dynasty stumbles out of the gate as the new offensive line takes shape \u2013 while weathering a trip to Brazil before Arrowhead welcomes the Eagles, Ravens and Lions for its first three home dates.\nLos Angeles Chargers (9-8): Coach Jim Harbaugh took the 49ers to the Super Bowl during his second year in San Francisco, so it\u2019s tempting to foresee the Bolts making a quantum leap, too, despite how badly they performed in last season\u2019s playoffs. But the offense still seems a bit light on weaponry \u2212 despite WR Keenan Allen's return \u2212 the defense lost some stalwarts in free agency, and the Chargers must navigate a schedule that includes nine dates with 2024 playoff squads. The loss of LT Rashawn Slater to a season-ending knee injury is a crushing blow.\nLas Vegas Raiders (5-12): They should be more competitive and entertaining with coach Pete Carroll, QB Geno Smith and titillating rookie RB Ashton Jeanty aboard. Yet it\u2019s hard to envision the Silver and Black making up any ground in an otherwise loaded division and, despite DE Maxx Crosby\u2019s presence, this defense could be regularly overrun. Doesn\u2019t help when a team from Sin City is forced to play three 1 p.m. kickoffs in the Eastern time zone in the season\u2019s first five weeks.\nNFC East\n(1) Philadelphia Eagles (12-5): Viewed through the lens of a single season, the 2024 Eagles are probably one of the top three or four teams of the 21st century, so little reason to think they won\u2019t be really strong again despite significant personnel losses on the defensive side. But though the Chiefs have made it seem routine, defending an NFL title is exceptionally hard \u2013 and the Eagles have to do it with a first-place schedule that includes the entirety of the AFC West and NFC North. Brutal. And awesome as Saquon Barkley, 28, was last season \u2013 maybe the best season a running back has ever had \u2013 it would be more realistic, given his personal history, to expect he misses a few games with injuries than an encore performance. It wouldn\u2019t be a shock if the Eagles repeat \u2026 but history is decidedly with the field.\n(7) Washington Commanders (10-7): Their Cinderella run exceeded everyone\u2019s wildest imagination \u2013 especially that of a long-suffering fan base. But are expectations ratcheted up a bit too much now? Washington\u2019s schedule is basically as challenging as Philly\u2019s yet also includes a stretch between Weeks 4 and 8 with just one home game. After what was arguably the greatest rookie season in league history, maybe QB Jayden Daniels takes an MVP step in 2025. But if he plateaus or even suffers something of a sophomore slump ... and/or pricey veteran acquisitions like Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel don\u2019t live up expectations ... and/or if this defense proves suspect \u2013 especially up front \u2013 then the Commanders\u2019 season could be defined following a Week 12 bye, a gauntlet that includes the Broncos, Vikings, Cowboys and Eagles \u2026 twice.\nDallas Cowboys (9-8): They\u2019re almost always relevant when QB Dak Prescott survives a full season or close to it \u2013 which he didn\u2019t in 2024. But the Cowboys are adjusting to a rookie head coach, Brian Schottenheimer, still have a glaring concern at tailback, have yet another change at defensive coordinator (Matt Eberflus) and are currently playing contractual games with DE Micah Parsons, arguably the franchise\u2019s best player. Also? Eagles, Chiefs, Lions, Vikings, Chargers, Commanders, i.e. the murders\u2019 row Dallas must face from Weeks 12-17. Woof.\nNew York Giants (2-15): A team coming off a 3-14 season somehow draws the league\u2019s toughest schedule based on opponents\u2019 2024 winning percentages (.574). So much for competitive balance. This record projection isn\u2019t indicative of the young talent on this roster, including WR Malik Nabers, LT Andrew Thomas, rookie OLB Abdul Carter and others. But it\u2019s very hard to find wins on this schedule or expect QB Russell Wilson will enjoy a renaissance at age 36, especially when pressure to play quarterback of the future Jaxson Dart as the season wears on is only likely to incrementally grow.\nNFC North\n(2) Green Bay Packers (12-5): Unlike the rest of their divisional rivals, they should benefit from continuity. And if QB Jordan Love remains healthy during the regular season, rookie Matthew Golden makes the consistent impact not always provided by this receiving corps and they get off to a strong start \u2013 and the early part of the schedule sets up nicely \u2013 the Pack might just find themselves in the Super Bowl.\n(5) Detroit Lions (11-6): They\u2019re going to have to adapt \u2013 without coordinators Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn and six other staff members from a team that earned the NFC\u2019s top playoff seed in 2024, to say nothing of the retirement of tough-as-rawhide C Frank Ragnow. Talent remains in abundance, and the return of DE Aidan Hutchinson should bring a needed jolt to the defense. But finding synchronicity could be tough, especially with four of the first six games on the road.\nMinnesota Vikings (9-8): They\u2019re going to have to adapt \u2013 to new QB1 J.J. McCarthy, who lost his entire rookie season with a knee injury and watched Sam Darnold blossom into a Pro Bowler during his on-field absence. Similar to his time at the University of Michigan, McCarthy should have everything a quarterback could want in a supporting cast, including a fantastic coach in Kevin O\u2019Connell. But the Vikes will have to weather WR2 Jordan Addison\u2019s three-game season suspension to start the season. And following their (voluntary) two-week European vacation, they\u2019ll have the Eagles, Chargers, Lions and Ravens lined up on the opposite side of a Week 6 bye. Replicating last season\u2019s 14-3 record \u2013 or even something close to it \u2013 seems like a long shot.\nChicago Bears (7-10): They\u2019re going to have to adapt \u2013 to Johnson, their new head coach, who\u2019s changing the culture, scheme and expectations (yet again) after this organization\u2019s disastrous 2024 campaign. And the learning curve is amplified by a schedule that, statistically, is second only to the Giants\u2019 in terms of difficulty. Six of the Bears\u2019 final eight opponents made the playoffs last season.\nNFC South\n(4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8): They probably don\u2019t get enough credit for their recent dominance of the division, which they\u2019ve won the past four seasons \u2013 albeit by an average of one game since the start of the 2022 campaign. That could again be the case with teams like the Panthers and Falcons at least displaying the potential to be threats. The Bucs could also be hamstrung as long as LT Tristan Wirfs, arguably their best player, remains sidelined by recent knee surgery expected to cost him at least a handful of games \u2013 and against formidable defenses. But even if they endure a rocky start, Tampa Bay could finish with a surge \u2013 its last six games against teams that didn\u2019t make the playoffs in 2024.\nCarolina Panthers (8-9): They\u2019re a chic playoff pick in some quarters after QB Bryce Young and the rest of the team got off the mat during the encouraging second half of last season. WRs Xavier Legette and Tetairoa McMillan, the club\u2019s most recent first-rounders, could further elevate this offense in 2025. But a defense that was resoundingly the NFL\u2019s worst by most important metrics in 2024 remains a looming question despite the return of dominant DE Derrick Brown. Still, a fast start could be in the offing as the Panthers won\u2019t face a 2024 playoff outfit until Week 8.\nAtlanta Falcons (7-10): So much boils down to the quarterback position, but especially here. Michael Penix Jr. flashed in three starts as a rookie but is hardly a proven commodity. QB2 Kirk Cousins is battle-tested \u2026 and his presence is likely to add to the burden of Penix, who will almost undoubtedly struggle at some point \u2013 and perhaps from the jump, Atlanta facing four postseason squads from last season among its first five opponents.\nNew Orleans Saints (2-15): A rookie head coach (Kellen Moore). Likely a rookie quarterback (Tyler Shough) or one coming off a rough rookie season (Spencer Rattler). Schematic changes on both sides of the ball. The biggest questions here seem to be if players like RB Alvin Kamara and WR Chris Olave remain beyond the trade deadline and/or if hometown hero Arch Manning winds up returning, though Saints fans would have to wait until 2027.\nNFC West\n(3) San Francisco 49ers (11-6): On the opposite side of the scheduling scale from the Giants, the Niners, little more than a year removed from an overtime loss in Super Bowl 58, drew the league\u2019s easiest schedule (.415 opponent winning percentage in 2024) \u2013 one that includes all of the AFC and NFC South teams and three additional last-place operations from last year. San Francisco opens with four 2024 non-playoff teams and finishes with seven of the same. Make no mistake, a new-look defense has much to prove, and the team\u2019s best players \u2013 RB Christian McCaffrey, LT Trent Williams, WR Brandon Aiyuk \u2013 have to stay on the field, though Aiyuk (knee) is likely still a few months away.\n(6) Los Angeles Rams (11-6): Again, it\u2019s worth noting that this team came the closest to knocking off the loaded Eagles on the road to Super Bowl 59, the Rams nearly pulling off the upset \u2026 on the road \u2026 in the snow. Imagine what they can do with a promising young defense one year better, not to mention being somewhat past the LA wildfires that affected this team and its city last January. So much hinges on the health of QB Matthew Stafford, 37, whose back has kept him sidelined during training camp, though by design, according to reports. But if he can continue posting on game day, as he usually does, he and his team have a legit shot at a second ring in a five-season span.\nArizona Cardinals (9-8): They went from bad (4-13) in HC Jonathan Gannon\u2019s first year to quietly middling last season (8-9). If QB Kyler Murray and the young players around him can take another collective step forward, a postseason return seems very much in play \u2013 especially if they can leverage a schedule that opens against six teams that didn\u2019t reach the playoffs in 2024. However the Cards will only have two home games after Thanksgiving.\nSeattle Seahawks (9-8): A tiebreaker cost them a playoff berth last season. They might be on the razor\u2019s edge once again but not for lack of trying. Heading into his second year, coach Mike Macdonald and GM John Schneider have done more than retool this roster \u2013 especially a passing game that has a new coordinator (Klint Kubiak), quarterback (Darnold) and receiver (Cooper Kupp). Yet it's also fair to expect these Seahawks to be far more reliant on the run, per Macdonald\u2019s wishes. Seattle seems more philosophically calibrated for the long haul, but that could mean another round of uneven performances in the near term.\nAFC playoffs\nWild card: (2) Bills def.

      "text": "Joe Flacco, Russell Wilson and others remain starting NFL QBs, and here's why\n- Joe Flacco, 40, was named Cleveland's QB1 on Monday.\n- Graybeards like Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers are also set start in 2025.\n- Why not opt for a youth movement behind center immediately? Let us count the ways.\nJoe Flacco is once again a QB1 in the NFL. So is Russell Wilson. And Aaron Rodgers. Geno Smith, too. Heck, even Daniel Jones is back to starting.\nA kneejerk reaction of \u201cWhy?\u201d would be understandable as it relates to these apparently faded stars and/or has-beens, yet there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all NFL answer to that question. However old men \u2013 in terms of football years anyway \u2013 serving as Band-Aids for teams in some manner of distress actually make a lot of sense for nearly all parties involved.\nIt\u2019s no secret franchise quarterbacks don\u2019t grow on trees. There are maybe 12 teams in the league that can confidently claim they\u2019re securely settled at the position for the foreseeable future, both in terms of performance and finances. Maybe. (And, admittedly, \"the foreseeable future\" in the NFL has been known to shift as suddenly as the timeline of a \u201cTerminator\u201d movie.)\nThere might be another dozen or so clubs hoping they\u2019ve got the right guy on their roster, and early returns from the likes of C.J. Stroud or Drake Maye or Bo Nix, for example, suggest that\u2019s probably at least a solid assumption.\nThen you\u2019ve got Flacco\u2019s Cleveland Browns. And Rodgers\u2019 Pittsburgh Steelers. And Wilson\u2019s New York Giants. And Jones' Indianapolis Colts. And Smith\u2019s Las Vegas Raiders. With the probable exception of Smith, each of these organizations will likely start 2026 with another guy behind center. So why tread water with any of these temps now given each of these teams \u2212 save Pittsburgh \u2212 seems very likely bound for a last-place finish in 2025?\nBecause pro football is a unique game. It requires collective buy-in and, to some degree, selflessness other team sports don\u2019t while also featuring a position \u2013 the ever tone-setting quarterback \u2013 which typically determines the fates of so many others on and off the field. A wideout can\u2019t just post 25 points and 10 rebounds and call it a night \u2013 and certainly won\u2019t routinely catch nine balls for 130 yards and TD without a reliable guy throwing to him. A linebacker on a great defense can\u2019t hit .350 for an otherwise bad team and go home under the illusion his job is secure. Head coaches and general managers can\u2019t opt to tank in the NFL with the assurance they\u2019ll retain their posts after a 2-15 death march \u2026 or that such a theoretical gambit would even actually bring the can\u2019t-miss player who would undoubtedly revitalize an organization and fan base \u2026 or that the other guys on the roster would even co-sign burning one of the (maybe) four years they get in the league with the consequential poor tape that may not earn them a subsequent shot to play elsewhere.\nAnd so you turn to retread field generals and hope for the best \u2013 whatever that might be.\nIn 2023, free agent Flacco, now 40, literally rose from his couch and saved Cleveland\u2019s season with a Comeback Player of the Year performance that landed the Browns a surprising playoff berth. He was reinstalled as the starter Monday. Last season \u2212 rightly or wrongly \u2212 Wilson took the baton in Pittsburgh and got the Steelers back into postseason. Smith surprisingly managed it, too, while supplanting Wilson in Seattle in 2022. What did it mean for those squads? Galvanized locker rooms. Captivating runs for their cities. Maybe fleeting hopes of a Nick Foles-esque magic carpet ride like the Philadelphia Eagles experienced in 2017 \u2013 or even the memorable heater Flacco and the 2012 Baltimore Ravens converted into a Super Bowl 47 triumph 12 years ago.\nBut more than likely, you\u2019re enjoying short-term gains in exchange for playoff disappointment and probably another ticket to the QB hamster wheel. The Browns, Steelers, Seahawks, New York Jets \u2013 four-time league MVP Rodgers, 41, wasn\u2019t the savior they\u2019d hoped for \u2013 and Giants have been stuck in neutral for years while playing quarterback roulette rather than meaningfully solving the position. Same goes for the Colts, so hopeful that Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, would be their post-Andrew Luck solution even as the layovers of Gardner Minshew, Flacco and Jones suggest otherwise \u2212 erstwhile Giants franchise face Jones tabbed Tuesday to start Week 1.\nYet what\u2019s the alternative?\nAll 32 teams are deadlocked with 0-0 records ahead of their 2025 regular-season openers. Now is the time to hope Flacco or Wilson can catch lightning in a bottle, unlikely as it is that they contain it for 18 or more weeks. Yet young teammates can hope the graybeards get them on the road to the promised land and provide wisdom that seeds their own careers.\nIf not? Then time for new prayers.\nThat\u2019s when Cleveland turns to Shedeur Sanders and/or Dillon Gabriel after they\u2019ve had an opportunity to observe the gargantuan ask ahead of them while the Browns wait to see if Tom Brady 2.0 \u2212 or even Tom Brady 0.7 \u2212 emerges from the QB chrysalis. Similar situation for Giants rookie Jaxson Dart, confident and ready as he already seems. But why deploy him if there\u2019s an experienced alternative like Wilson to navigate the outset of what is the league\u2019s hardest schedule based on opponents' 2024 winning percentages?\nIf the vet sinks instead of swimming, then the rook gets the belated benefit of better-informed playing time while the team likely continues sailing toward a poor record that provides better options the next year anyway.\nIt\u2019s rare to see a young quarterback start, struggle and later come through a potentially confidence-shattering benching intact. It would also be folly to prematurely tab a youngster who either isn\u2019t ready or saddled with a substandard supporting cast \u2212 think Sam Darnold with the Jets \u2212 watch him flounder and then ask someone like Wilson to make lemonade with a 2-9 record. As former running back Ricky Watters once infamously said, \u201cFor who, for what?\"\nAt least Rodgers, his teammates and Steelers coach Mike Tomlin know they\u2019re all chips in for 2025 \u2026 even if they\u2019re gambling that a pair of jacks will help them secure the pot no matter how bad a hand and draft bankroll that might produce six months hence.\nAnd so these franchises forge ahead \u2013 hoping for the best, knowing worse is likelier \u2212 desperately wishing their circumstances in the NFL\u2019s version of purgatory have miraculously changed a year from now.\nAll NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "Trey Hendrickson trade destinations? Texans, Eagles among best fits\n- The All-Pro pass rusher was given permission to seek a trade earlier this year and is now reportedly back on the block.\n- Hendrickson is due $16 million in 2025, the final year of his contract with Cincinnati.\nThe inability of Trey Hendrickson and the Cincinnati Bengals to strike a new deal \u2026 may lead to an entirely different type of deal.\nNFL Network reported Sunday that the team is \u2013 once again \u2013 open to trading its All-Pro pass rusher given the sides appear no closer to bridging their contractual impasse.\nHendrickson is due $16 million in 2025, his contract set to expire next March. However the financial market for top-tier defensive ends and outside linebackers has changed drastically, T.J. Watt, Myles Garrett, Danielle Hunter and Maxx Crosby all signing extensions averaging at least $35 million annually over the past six months. Watt and Garrett are both at a $40 million-plus-per-year threshold, and Dallas Cowboys superstar Micah Parsons is expected to exceed that at some point in the near future.\nHendrickson, 30, hasn\u2019t expressed a desire to reset his positional compensation scale but does want long-term security and a raise commensurate with his performance \u2013 Bengals owner Mike Brown even admitting last month that the four-time Pro Bowler has earned one.\nHendrickson led the NFL with 17\u00bd sacks last season, and the 35 he\u2019s racked up since 2023 also pace the league over that period. According to Pro Football Reference, his 54 pressures were seven more than any other player in 2024 \u2013 that production occurring for a decidedly subpar Bengals defense that ranked 25th overall last season, when Cincinnati came up one win short of the playoffs.\nAfter a brief holdout to start training camp, Hendrickson reported July 30 but has been holding in as his standoff with the team continues.\n\"I can\u2019t do any more at this time to rush the passer on Sundays,\" he said last month. \"The hay is in the barn. It\u2019s just whether we agree or not.\n\"Moving forward, we\u2019ll see what transpires.\"\nAnd maybe that\u2019s a trade. Hendrickson was given permission to pursue one last March \u2013 which happens to be when Bengals wideouts Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Tee Higgins got massive extensions \u2013 but nothing materialized before the draft. Notably, per Over The Cap, the team has more than $80 million in projected cap space between this year and next, which would seemingly be more than enough to find some middle ground with Hendrickson.\nMoving forward, it remains to be seen if Cincinnati blinks at the negotiating table with its lone defensive star or potentially lower its asking price on the trade market, especially since most teams in the league have much less flexibility in August than springtime to consummate what is effectively a trade-and-sign, which would presumably require both draft compensation ahead of actual compensation for Hendrickson.\nBut let's play along anyway as this saga continues to unfold. Here are seven potential teams to monitor that might have the need and wherewithal to make a move for Hendrickson:\nDetroit Lions\nThe NFC\u2019s failed No. 1 playoff seed last season, the Lions were undermined by a defense that was crippled by the loss of DE Aidan Hutchinson in Week 6 and never recovered. Pairing Hendrickson and Hutchinson would instantly give Detroit the league\u2019s best couplet of quarterback hunters \u2013 the similarity of their last names would surely launch a nickname and marketing campaign, too \u2013 and at a time when the team could use a boost given the murderers\u2019 row the NFC North currently is and as this organization tries to recover from the loss of coordinators Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn to head coaching jobs elsewhere. But is pursuing Hendrickson truly realistic? He might just be the player who could finally get this club over the Lombardi hump. However GM Brad Holmes\u2019 2026 budget is already underwater, and his most pressing roster issue for the immediate future should be extending Hutchinson, whose rookie contract balloons to fifth-year option paychecks 13 months from now.\nHouston Texans\nDo they need a player like Hendrickson? He\u2019d surely be a luxury given the presence of Hunter and fellow DE Will Anderson, who combined for 23 sacks in 2024. But no one else on this roster had more than five last season and deepening the rotation \u2013 both Hunter and Hendrickson are 30 \u2013 is an option any defensive coordinator wants, not to mention the ability to have such a talented trio on the field during obvious passing downs. The Texans would have to move some money around in all likelihood to make it work, but GM Nick Caserio has been especially aggressive over the past 18 months in a bid to optimize his roster while QB C.J. Stroud remains on his rookie contract. Caserio also owns an extra second- and fourth-round pick in next year\u2019s draft, giving him extra wiggle room to consummate a deal with Cincinnati that few other teams have.\nIndianapolis Colts\nThey ranked near the bottom of the NFL with 36 sacks last season (among many other major defensive deficiencies) and hired a new coordinator, Lou Anarumo, this offseason \u2013 and he just happens to be the same guy under whom Hendrickson flourished over the past four years in Cincy. Indy has ample financial bandwidth to make an offer that would approximate what Crosby and Hunter are making. The Colts also have several young edge players \u2013 notably Kwity Paye and Laiatu Latu \u2013 who might greatly benefit from watching a master craftsman like Hendrickson. And while he doesn't play quarterback, perhaps supercharging the defense is an appropriate way to ease some pressure on whomever the Colts tab to be their QB1 in 2025.\nLos Angeles Chargers\nThey have $116 million in projected cap room between this year and next, most in the league. Khalil Mack, 34, is the Bolts\u2019 best pass rusher, and the team hopes Tuli Tuipulotu can fill the void after Joey Bosa became a cap casualty in March. Hendrickson would certainly add what\u2019s probably a needed shot of adrenaline to this defense \u2013 especially if the Chargers hope to compete for a divisional throne that\u2019s long been the property of Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nNever discount EVP/GM Howie Roseman, who\u2019s built three Super Bowl rosters over the past eight seasons \u2013 two of them earning rings \u2013 and may have another on his hands with or without Hendrickson. Roseman was rumored as a suitor for Garrett when the Browns superstar requested a trade earlier this year before taking a pile of money to remain in Cleveland. While Philly doesn\u2019t seem to be in desperate need of another defensive weapon, it did lose Josh Sweat and Milton Williams to free agency and Brandon Graham to retirement during the offseason. Youngsters Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt are projected to start on the edge, and both have flashed the promise that led Roseman to draft them. But neither has the production or experience of Hendrickson, who\u2019d probably be a more realistic potential target here anyway than Garrett ever was.\n2025 NFL record projections: How many games will Eagles win, and does that include Super Bowl 60?\nSeattle Seahawks\nThe NFC West is shaping up to perhaps be the most tightly packed division in the league, so a major acquisition would figure to make a difference for any of its members. The Seahawks are projected to have nearly $90 million in cap space (counting 2026) and haven\u2019t been shy about overhauling their roster despite a 10-7 finish in 2024 that fell a tiebreaker short of postseason qualification. Yet the \u2018Hawks are also hoping to apply pressure with players like DeMarcus Lawrence, Boye Mafe, Uchenna Nwosu and Derick Hall \u2013 a group pockmarked with injury and inconsistency concerns that have never been an issue for Hendrickson over the past five seasons. And if anyone knows what he brings to the table, it's HC Mike Macdonald, who saw Hendrickson wreck shop frequently while serving as the Ravens' defensive coordinator.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nHendrickson would have to adapt to a base 3-4 scheme but standing up isn't a huge ask of a veteran. Meanwhile, GM Jason Licht would have to deviate from the draft, develop and extend philosophy that\u2019s worked so well for this organization. But the perennial NFC South champs could certainly use more production off the edge as they try to hold off would-be challengers like the Falcons and Panthers, and Licht has the funds to fit Hendrickson under the cap \u2013 even after taking a $14 million flier on soon-to-be 31-year-old Haason Reddick for the upcoming campaign. Tampa would also represent something of a homecoming for Hendrickson, who hails from nearby Apopka, Florida.\nAll NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter."

      "text": "New Giants QB Jaxson Dart models his unique eye black after Anakin Skywalker as lifelong 'Star Wars' fan\nHopefully he doesn't turn to the dark side in New York\nThe New York Giants have a new quarterback in Jaxson Dart, who made a name for himself at Ole Miss not only as a passer but for his signature eye black, often smudged above and below just his right eye. It turns out the 2025 first-round draft pick took inspiration from a galaxy far, far away for the style choice, revealing recently that the eye black is a \"tribute\" to Anakin Skywalker, who bears a scar over his eye in \"Star Wars.\"\n\"I [started] it back in my junior year of high school,\" Dart explained to ESPN. \"The first time I saw it was on an LSU defensive back. ... I did it on one eye, and somebody pointed out to me [the similarities] -- one of my friends who's also a huge 'Star Wars' fan -- and ever since then, I've kinda run with it.\"\nDart told \"SportsCenter\" ahead of the draft that he's been a \"Star Wars\" fan since he was a kid, even enjoying a childhood birthday party in which his dad dressed up as Darth Vader. With longer hair and the one-eye makeup, he most resembles Anakin from \"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,\" which just so happens to be his favorite of the \"Star Wars\" saga ... and back in movie theaters for the 20th anniversary of its release.\nDrafted 25th overall on Thursday after the Giants traded up to select him, Dart is expected to sit behind veteran Russell Wilson to open his 2025 rookie season. Whether he brings balance to the Force in New York thereafter remains to be seen, but for the time being, he is, in fact, the chosen one."

      "text": "Key word for Cam Ward? Patience. The Titans still have a long way to go\n- Titans won rookie QB's second preseason start, but his numbers weren't pretty.\n- Ward completed just two passes Friday but didn't get much help from teammates.\nATLANTA \u2013 Cam Ward\u2019s best throw during his abbreviated preseason shift on Friday night came at the right time with the perfect aim. The Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback scanned the defense, set his feet and lofted a second-and-long spiral with precise arc. It hit the intended target in his hands. Textbook.\nOne problem: Van Jefferson dropped it.\nBut man, was that a beautiful throw.\n\u201cReally, next play, that\u2019s all you can do,\u201d Ward reflected. \u201cI\u2019ve got to throw the ball better.\u201d\nWhen the rookie went on to explain that he might have put the football a tad out of reach, it sounded more like a team leader serving up some cover for his veteran receiver.\nIn any event, it was another lesson for Ward, 23, to absorb from a second preseason lab test that was filled with adversity. Ward only played 11 snaps over three series, leading his unit to just one first down. Inside a ho-hum stat line \u2013 he completed 2-of-7 passes for 42 yards, with a scant passer rating of 52.1 \u2013 there were misfires on back-to-back third downs that would\u2019ve made for difficult catches. Even more glaring were the two penalties by offensive lineman that stunted drives.\n\u201cWhat I learned from this game is to not shoot ourselves in the foot with penalties,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI think we had a chance to score the three times I was out there, but we always had to overcome something.\u201d\nBrian Callahan knows. The Titans\u2019 second-year coach is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the progress he\u2019s seen with Ward as they head into the final week of the preseason. He gave his rookie high marks for the operational elements of playing quarterback, which says something about absorbing X\u2019s and O\u2019s, calling plays in the huddle and making certain that the unit is lined up properly. And there\u2019s no question about the zip in Ward's arm.\nYet Callahan also knows that it is much bigger than the progress of one man \u2013 even one as dynamic as Ward, whose college resume includes a record 158 touchdown passes.\nCallahan couldn\u2019t fully assess Ward\u2019s night without bemoaning the early penalties.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really on him,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those things where we need to do better around him.\u201d\nThat speaks to a big takeaway as the development of Ward commands attention. It is going to take a village. As much as Ward may make strides during his NFL transition, there\u2019s a possibility that it could be dwarfed by the growing pains of the whole unit.\nOf course, the snapshot from Friday night needs proper context. It was only an exhibition, with vanilla schemes and game plans. And Ward\u2019s top two receivers, Calvin Ridley and Tyler Lockett, sat out as proven veterans tend to do this time of year.\nStill, Ward\u2019s confident words after two days of joint practices with the Falcons \u2013 he was noticeably sharper on Wednesday after sputtering on Tuesday \u2013 bear repeating.\nHe proclaimed that the Titans have the makings of a Top 10 NFL offense and that his wide receiver group is among the five best in the league.\nYou can\u2019t knock a man for talking up his teammates. That\u2019s part of the appeal with Ward, who is full of can-do spirit, supported by his rise from being a zero-star recruit to the top pick in the draft. He believes. He wants to speak it into existence. Yes, it starts with the mind.\nYet there was a reason the Titans had that No. 1 pick. They finished with an NFL-worst 3-14 record in 2024. They ranked 27th in the league in scoring, averaging 18.3 points per game. Quarterbacks took 52 sacks last season, fourth-most in the league.\nIn other words, there\u2019s a lot to fix around Ward. It will take time, along with a significant talent upgrade. If Ward can survive the process, then that Top 10 vision can come to life. Perhaps. Someday.\nIn the meantime, patience.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for the real football to start,\u201d Ward said.\nThe Titans open the regular season on Sept. 7 at the Denver Broncos, who have one of the best defenses in the NFL \u2013 and the receipts to prove it.\nThe rookie learning curve for Ward is just beginning, and promises to get even tougher.\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on social media:\nOn X: @JarrettBell; On Bluesky: jarrettbell.bsky.social"

  "argos_summary": "The NFL preseason has ended, highlighting standout performances from rookie quarterbacks such as Giants\u2019 Jaxson Dart, who posted a strong stat line and sparked optimism, and Browns\u2019 Shedeur Sanders, who impressed in a game against the Panthers.
