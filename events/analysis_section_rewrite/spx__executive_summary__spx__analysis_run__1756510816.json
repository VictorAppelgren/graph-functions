The only drift is the second sentence, which implies an impact on the S&P 500 but does not explicitly name the index. Add “spx” to make the causal link crystal:  \n\n> “A 0.1–0.2 % lift from the EPAM upgrade could lift **spx** by 0.1–0.2 % and compress the UST10Y by 5–10 bp over the next 3–6 months, but this equity‑yield transmission is fragile if EPAM Q2 earnings miss expectations, Fed minutes signal tightening, or CPI data spikes (H86O3XRUJ).”\n\nEverything else is correctly cited, concise, and decision‑useful. No further edits are needed.",
