  "title": "Israel minister who led prayers at a controversial holy site has a record of provocative actions",
  "description": "Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has led prayers at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, sparking international condemnation",
  "content": "It was the latest act of defiance by the 49-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel\u2019s most influential politicians.\n\nHere is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:\n\nWhy was the visit considered a provocation?\n\nSince Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Palestinians consider the mosque a national symbol and view visits by Jewish leaders as provocative and as a potential precursor to Israel seizing control over the compound. Most rabbis forbid Jews from praying on the site, but there has been a growing movement in recent years of Jews who support worship there. Ben-Gvir has long called for greater Jewish access to the holy site.\n\nBen-Gvir was visiting to mark the Jewish holiday of Tisha B\u2019Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples, key events in Jewish history.\n\nVisits like Ben-Gvir\u2019s are legal. Israeli media said the visit was the first time that a sitting minister actively and vocally led prayers. Ben-Gvir also called for Israel to conquer and declare sovereignty over all of the Gaza Strip and encourage \u201cvoluntary\u201d migration from Gaza in order to end the war and bring the hostages back. Palestinians say the migration plan is a disguise for forced expulsions.\n\nIn response to Ben-Gvir's visit, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the status quo at the site had not changed and would not change to allow Jewish prayer.\n\nBen-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. The army banned him from compulsory military service when he was a teen, deeming his views too extreme.\n\nBen-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late radical rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.\n\n\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.\n\nTwo years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O\u2019Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.\n\nThe political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.\n\nBen-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.\n\nWith a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.\n\nBen-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents. In an episode in 2022, he brandished a pistol and encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood. In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country\u2019s police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.\n\nAs national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.\n\nBen-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir\u2019s Jewish Power party, into power.\n\n\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve been on a mission to save Israel,\u201d Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. \u201cMillions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.\u201d\n\nBen-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure \u2014 encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu\u2019s contentious attempt to overhaul the country\u2019s legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.\n\nBen-Gvir temporarily resigned from Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet earlier this year to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\nThe ceasefire ran from Jan. 19 to March 1. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remained of their homes, and there was a surge of humanitarian aid.\n\nBen-Gvir's resignation did not stop the ceasefire, but it did weaken Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition. Ben-Gvir rejoined the cabinet when Israel ended the ceasefire and returned to active combat in Gaza in March 2025.\n\nLast week, the Netherlands banned Ben-Gvir and far-right Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich from entering the country. Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway imposed financial sanctions on the two men last month.",

      "text": "UK and others sanction 2 far-right Israeli Cabinet ministers for \u2018inciting extremist violence\u2019\nUK and others sanction 2 far-right Israeli Cabinet ministers for \u2018inciting extremist violence\u2019\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway said Tuesday they have imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli government ministers for allegedly \u201cinciting extremist violence\u201d against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nThe decision by Western governments friendly to Israel was a sharp rebuke of Israel\u2019s settlement policies in the West Bank and of settler violence, which has spiked since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, key partners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, are champions of Israeli settlement who support continuing the war in Gaza, facilitating what they call the voluntary emigration of its Palestinian population and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.\nThey could now face asset freezes and travel bans.\nIn a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the five countries said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich \u201chave incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.\u201d\nU.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the two men \u201chave been inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months\u201d and \u201cencouraging egregious abuses of human rights.\u201d\n\u201cThese measures are directed at individuals who directly contribute to extremist settler violence,\u201d said Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. \u201cThe measures are not directed against the state of Israel itself.\u201d\nNew Zealand\u2019s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wednesday that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u201chave severely and deliberately undermined\u201d prospects for peace and security while \u201cinciting violence and forced displacement.\u201d\n\u201cOur action today is not against the Israeli people, who suffered immeasurably on October 7 and who have continued to suffer through Hamas\u2019 ongoing refusal to release all hostages,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cNor is it designed to sanction the wider Israeli government.\u201d\nSmotrich wrote on social media that he learned of the sanctions while he was inaugurating a new West Bank settlement. \u201cWe are determined to continue building,\u201d he said.\nBen-Gvir, also writing on social media, said \u201cwe overcame Pharoah, we\u2019ll overcome Starmer\u2019s Wall,\u201d referring to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nIsrael\u2019s government condemned the announcement, which came as traditional allies of Israel escalate denouncements of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, from the high civilian death toll to a monthslong blockade that led to famine warnings.\nIsrael\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the sanctions decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d He said he had discussed it with Netanyahu and they would meet next week to discuss Israel\u2019s response.\nHe said that the move threatened to harden Hamas\u2019 stance in ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza and to cut short Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza before it achieves its goals.\nBenny Gantz, an centrist Israeli lawmaker and political rival to Netanyahu, wrote that he \u201cvehemently\u201d disagreed with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, but said the move was a \u201cprofound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists around the world.\u201d\nNetanyahu is the target of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year over alleged war crimes in Gaza, part of a global wave of outrage at Israel\u2019s conduct during its 20-month war against Hamas. Netanyahu has denied the allegations and accused the court of being biased against Israel.\nThe Biden administration took the rare step of sanctioning radical Israeli settlers implicated in violence in the occupied West Bank \u2014 sanctions that were lifted by President Donald Trump.\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer who spent years campaigning for the sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u2014 along with violent West Bank settlers \u2014 described Tuesday\u2019s move as \u201chistoric.\u201d\n\u201cIt means the wall of immunity that Israeli politicians had has been broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that it took so long for Western governments to sanction Israeli politicians, and the fact that it\u2019s being done while Trump is president is quite amazing.\u201d\nMack added: \u201cIt is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.\u201d\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.\nSuccessive Israeli governments have promoted settlement growth and construction stretching back decades. It has exploded under Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts.\nThere are now well over 100 settlements across the West Bank that house more than 500,000 settlers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the territory\u2019s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers.\nMost of the international community considers the settlements illegal, and Palestinians see them as the greatest obstacle to an eventual two-state solution, which is still seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict.\n___\nLawless reported from London.

      "text": "Radical rabbi\u2019s followers rise in Israel amid new violence\nRadical rabbi\u2019s followers rise in Israel amid new violence\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 In the 1980s, Rabbi Meir Kahane\u2019s violent anti-Arab ideology was considered so repugnant that Israel banned him from parliament and the U.S. listed his party as a terrorist group.\nToday, his disciples march through the streets by the hundreds, chanting \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d and assaulting any they come across. This week, they took part in a wave of communal violence in Jerusalem and mixed cities across Israel in which Arabs and Jews viciously attacked people and torched cars.\nOn Thursday evening, there was more ethnic strife. In Tel Aviv, two Jewish men attacked a journalist covering a gathering of ultranationalists. In the central Israeli city of Lod, a Jewish man was shot and seriously wounded by an Arab man. In Jaffa, an Israeli soldier was attacked by a group of Arabs and was hospitalized in serious condition.\nIsraelis shocked by the violence have cast the right-wing extremism as a nasty aberration or a reaction to Palestinian violence. But to Arab citizens, who make up 20% of Israel\u2019s population, the heirs of Kahane are a natural outgrowth of a discriminatory system \u2014 normalized by some mainstream leaders who largely share their views.\nAdmirers of Kahane were elected to parliament in March as allies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, and one of the most prominent has become a fixture on Israeli TV.\nTheir resurgence has injected another element of volatility to the conflict. It\u2019s also part of a broader shift to the right in Israel, where Kahane\u2019s disciples are hardly alone in adopting a hard line toward the Palestinians and trafficking in anti-Arab rhetoric.\nRight-wing parties that support Jewish settlements and oppose Palestinian independence won a large majority of seats in March, and Netanyahu and other right-wing leaders have often cast Israel\u2019s Arab minority as a fifth column \u2014 unless they needed their votes.\nDuring his lone term in parliament in the mid-1980s, before he was banned, Kahane was shunned by colleagues, including the Likud, and frequently gave speeches to an empty chamber. His racist agenda called for banning intermarriage between Arabs and Jews, stripping Arabs of their Israeli citizenship, and the mass expulsions of Palestinians. At one point, he was suspended for waving a noose at an Arab lawmaker.\nKahane was banned from running in 1988, and two years later, he was assassinated by an Egyptian-American in New York. But his hate-filled ideology has remained influential in Israel.\nIn 1994, Kahane follower Baruch Goldstein opened fire in a holy site in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 Muslim worshippers and wounding over 100. That led both Israel and the U.S. to label his Kach movement and an offshoot, Kahane Lives, as terrorist groups.\nIn March, another admirer of the late rabbi, who for years had hung a picture of Goldstein on his living room wall, was elected to Israel\u2019s parliament.\nItamar Ben-Gvir joined the Knesset as part of Religious Zionism, a bloc of far-right parties that came together at Netanyahu\u2019s prodding so none would fall below the electoral threshold.\nSince then, Ben-Gvir has made frequent media appearances, displaying a cheerful demeanor and a knack for deflecting criticism as he banters with TV and radio hosts.\nIt\u2019s working: Ifat, a research firm, says Ben-Gvir is the third most interviewed politician on Israeli TV and radio, behind Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett, another right-wing politician.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good speaker and he knows how to play the game,\u201d said Shuki Friedman, an expert on Israel\u2019s far right at the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cOn one hand, he is addressing his supporters. ... On the other hand, he knows not to make mainstream Israelis too angry.\u201d\nHe has staged provocative visits to Arab areas and been a near-constant presence on the sidelines of recent clashes, rallying ultranationalist supporters to confront Palestinians and assert \u201cJewish Power\u201d \u2014 the name of his party.\nLast week, he set up an outdoor parliamentary \u201coffice\u201d in an Arab neighborhood of east Jerusalem where Jewish settlers are trying to expel Palestinians from their homes, setting off a melee. He later called for police to use live fire against Palestinian protesters at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.\nA long-range Hamas rocket, fired at Jerusalem on Monday, disrupted the Jerusalem Day parade, which celebrates Israel\u2019s annexation of east Jerusalem.\nThe mob violence erupted the next day. A Telegram channel displaying the Kahanist emblem \u2014 a yellow fist inside a black Star of David \u2014 swelled from a few hundred members to more than 6,000.\nIt was used to organize a crowd in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam on Wednesday that pulled an Arab from his car and beat him severely. The attack horrified Israelis and was widely condemned, including by far-right politicians. Israeli media reported the country\u2019s police chief blamed Ben-Gvir for inciting a Jewish \u201cintifada,\u201d the Arabic term used to refer to two Palestinian uprisings.\nAs a lawyer with a long history of defending Jewish extremists accused of attacking Arabs, Ben-Gvir has been careful not to run afoul of laws against incitement. He calls Kahane \u201crighteous and holy,\u201d but has tried to distance himself by saying he doesn\u2019t agree with everything the rabbi said.\nBen-Gvir first became a national figure when he famously broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.\n\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.\nIsrael has shifted even more to the right since then, driven by the failure of peace efforts, repeated rounds of violence and demographic shifts. Ben-Gvir\u2019s supporters are largely religious and ultra-Orthodox Jews, who tend to have large families.\nNetanyahu hoped to tap into that by assembling a far-right bloc with Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, another ultranationalist. Ironically, they foiled Netanyahu\u2019s plan by blocking his outreach to a small Arab party needed to secure a parliamentary majority.\nDan Meridor, a former justice minister and Likud heavyweight who helped lead efforts to ban Kahane from parliament in 1988, believes Netanyahu made a grave error in rehabilitating his followers.\n\u201cYou can just see the dramatic and very harmful change the Likud went through when they legitimized the Kahanists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt changed very tragically to me.\u201d\nPalestinian citizens of Israel, on the other hand, view Ben-Gvir as the latest in a long line of Israeli politicians \u2014 including Netanyahu \u2014 who have treated them as second-class citizens, if not enemies of the state. It\u2019s one of many grievances they point to in explaining the recent protests and clashes with police.\nDiana Buttu, a lawyer and analyst who is a Palestinian citizen of Israel, says it\u2019s easy for Israelis to dismiss the Kahanists as a fringe group.\n\u201cBut if you step back and look at this country through the eyes of a Palestinian, you see that at every single political level, in every single political party, there\u2019s been some form of anti-Palestinian racism.\u201d\n\u2014-\nAssociated Press writer Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed."

The spirit of returning Palestinians is not\nWatch live from Rashid Street in Wadi Gaza as Palestinians return to northern Gaza.\nWADI GAZA, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 They walked for hours loaded with whatever clothes, food and blankets they could carry. Many smiled, some hugged loved ones they hadn\u2019t seen for months. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians filled Gaza\u2019s main coastal road as they streamed back to homes in the north.\nThe mood was joyous, even though many knew their homes had been destroyed in Israeli offensives against Hamas that leveled large parts of Gaza City and the surrounding north.\nThe important thing was to go back, they said, to prevent what many had feared would be a permanent expulsion from their homes.\n\u201cBy returning, we are victorious,\u201d said Rania Miqdad, who was heading back to Gaza City with her family.\nIsmail Abu Mattar returned with his wife and four children to the ruins of their Gaza City home, which was partially destroyed by Israeli bombardment early in the war. Like many others whose houses are damaged, he planned to set up a tent nearby and start clearing the rubble.\n\u201cA tent here is better than a tent there,\u201d he said, referring to the vast, squalid tent camps that arose in central and southern Gaza where he and much of the territory\u2019s population have lived for months.\n\u201cWe had thought we wouldn\u2019t return, like our ancestors,\u201d said Abu Mattar. His grandparents were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians driven from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.\nA mass return on foot and by car\nUnder the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, Palestinians were allowed starting Monday to return north. U.N. officials estimated that some 200,000 people made their way back over the course of the day. The scenes of celebration were a sharp contrast to the misery and fear during the war as more than 1 million people fled south on the same routes to escape Israel\u2019s assaults.\nAssociated Press photos, videos and drone footage showed huge crowds heading north on foot along Gaza\u2019s main coastal road. On one side was the Mediterranean Sea; on the other stretched a landscape of destroyed buildings and bulldozed land left behind by withdrawing Israeli forces. Armed Hamas fighters were visible in some spots, a sign of the militant group\u2019s continued power in Gaza despite Israel\u2019s vows to eliminate it.\nFamilies carried bags of belongings and rolled up blankets. On their shoulders, men carried young children \u2014 or sacks of food and metal cannisters of cooking gas. Women balanced infants in their arms with satchels of clothes and jugs of water.\nA little girl dressed in teddy-bear pajamas held her younger sister\u2019s hand as they trailed their mother. A teenager strapped a pet carrier to his chest with his cat inside.\nOthers returned in cars and trucks piled high with mattresses and other belongings via a second route, Salah al-Din Road.\nMany were smiling. A child waved a \u201cV-for-victory\u201d sign. People tearfully hugged relatives and friends they\u2019d been separated from for months.\nOne old woman being pushed in a wheelchair sang a traditional Palestinian song of perseverance dating back to 1948.\n\u201cStand by each other, people of Palestine, stand by each other. Palestine is gone, but it has not bid you a final farewell,\u201d she sang with a smile on her face. Then she added, \u201cThank God, we\u2019re returning to our homes, after suffering so much ruin and hunger and disease.\u201d\nThe joy was tempered by war\u2019s cost and future\u2019s uncertainty\nThose returning crossed through the Netzarim corridor, a swath of land bisecting the Gaza Strip that Israeli forces turned into a military zone to seal off the north. The north saw some of the most intense Israeli offensives, aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters operating in densely populated areas.\nThroughout the war, Israel repeatedly ordered civilians to evacuate the north \u2013 for their safety, it said \u2013 but barred their return. Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms, Israeli troops pulled back from the main routes to allow returns and are eventually to pull out completely from the corridor.\nFor some, the joy of return was blemished by the deaths of loved ones.\nKamal Hamadah was returning to Gaza City, where his eldest son, his daughter and her children were killed by bombardment early in the war. Their bodies were left buried under rubble in the streets, even as the rest of the family fled south, he said.\nThen just over a month ago, another of his sons who fled with him was killed.\n\u201cWhen his mother learned we were going back home, she was struck by a great sadness that she was returning without the boy,\u201d he said.\nReturning home, Yasmin Abu Amshah had a happy reunion with her younger sister, Amany, who had stayed in Gaza City throughout the war. \u201cI thought it wouldn\u2019t happen, and we wouldn\u2019t see each other again,\u201d the 34-year-old mother of three said.\nHer four-story building was damaged but not destroyed, so she and other members of her extended family will stay there.\nThose returning face an uncertain future. If the ceasefire collapses, they could face new Israeli offensives. If peace lasts, it\u2019s not clear when Palestinians will be able to rebuild homes, leaving much of the population in temporary housing.\nIbrahim Hammad, his wife and five children walked five hours back to their neighborhood in Gaza City \u2013 knowing their house there had been destroyed by an airstrike in December 2023. His family will stay at his brother\u2019s house until he can clear a space in the ruins of his house to set up a tent.\n\u201cWe had to return, even to the rubble,\u201d the 48-year-old told the AP. \u201cHere we don\u2019t have a house, but our family is here, and we will help each other.\u201d\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

      "text": "Jewish prayers held discreetly at contested Jerusalem shrine\nJewish prayers held discreetly at contested Jerusalem shrine\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 As police protected them, three Jewish men stepped forward, placed their hands out at chest level and began reciting prayers in low tones in the shadow of Jerusalem\u2019s golden Dome of the Rock.\nJewish prayers at Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, were once unthinkable. But they have quietly become the new norm in recent years, flying in the face of longstanding convention, straining a delicate status quo and raising fears that they could trigger a new wave of violence in the Middle East.\n\u201cWhat is happening is a blatant and dangerous violation of the status quo,\u201d said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswani, a top official with the Waqf, the Jordanian-backed Islamic trust that administers the site. \u201cThe Israeli police must stop providing protection to extremists.\u201d\nThe hilltop compound is the holiest site for Jews, revered as the location of two ancient temples destroyed in antiquity. Three times a day for 2,000 years, Jews have turned to face it during prayers. It also is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.\nIsrael captured the hilltop, along with the rest of east Jerusalem and the walled Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move that was not recognized by most of the international community. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as capital of a future independent state.\nThe flashpoint site is the emotional epicenter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many rounds of deadly fighting in the decades-long conflict have erupted around it. The most recent was in May, when an Israeli police crackdown on stone-throwing Palestinian protesters inside the mosque helped precipitate an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and violent upheaval in Israeli cities.\nSince 1967, a loose set of rules known as the \u201cstatus quo\u201d have governed day-to-day operations at the site. Any actual or perceived changes to the status quo has the potential to ignite violence.\nFor decades, Jews avoided worship at the site for religious reasons. Many leading rabbis, including the country\u2019s Chief Rabbinate, ruled after the 1967 war that Jews \u201cshould not enter the entire area of the Temple Mount\u201d out of concern for ritual impurity and uncertainty over the exact location of the ancient Temple\u2019s holy of holies.\nBut attitudes are changing, particularly among Israel\u2019s hard-line, religious nationalist right wing.\nAmnon Ramon, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Policy Research, said the issue of Jewish prayer has transformed in recent decades \u201cfrom a matter that was on the fringe to a subject in the mainstream for the religious nationalist public.\u201d Most in that community appears to support some degree of Jewish worship there, as do a growing number of ultra-Orthodox Jews.\nNew Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who leads a small, hard-line religious party, caused an uproar last month on the Jewish fast day of Tisha B\u2019Av when he said Israel was committed to protecting \u201cfreedom of worship\u201d for Jews at the compound. His office quickly issued a clarification stating there was \u201cno change whatsoever\u201d in the status quo.\nRabbi Eliyahu Vebr, head of the Temple Mount Yeshiva, said that for over a year, he has entered the site daily, most of the time with at least 10 Jewish men necessary for a group prayer.\n\u201cSo long as things are not conspicuous, in a way that disturbs, the police allow it,\u201d he said. Some days there is friction with Muslim worshippers and authorities, he said, but mostly there isn\u2019t. Palestinian media, including those of the Islamist militant group Hamas, publish videos almost daily of \u201cJewish settlers storming the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\u201d\nFlanked by a detachment of paramilitary Border Police troopers, a quorum of 10 men entered the shrine on a recent morning and made their way to a secluded area of the eastern side of the compound. They prayed discreetly in hushed tones while a handful of guards from the Waqf watched from a distance.\nKiswani, who is the Waqf\u2019s director of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, said Muslim authorities have strongly protested the Jewish prayers, both to Israeli police and to the Jordanian government.\nBut he said Israeli police forcibly prevent Waqf personnel from approaching Jewish worshippers and in some cases, arrest or expel them. \u201cThe mosque is a pure right for Muslims alone, and there is no prayer in the mosque except for Muslims,\u201d he said.\nIsraeli police said its forces operate \u201cin accordance with the terms of visitation customary at the site,\u201d while maintaining public order. It said the regulations for visitors are determined by the government and court decisions.\nAkiva Ariel, a spokesman for Beyadenu, a Jewish activist group advocating for Jewish prayer at the site, said things began to change under the government of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who led the country for 12 years before he was ousted in May.\n\u201cThe police turn a blind eye\u201d to the worship, so long as it\u2019s done inconspicuously, Ariel said. During the recent visit, the men conducted the ancient blessing, in which priests make V\u2019s with each hand, spreading their ring and middle fingers, and quietly recited a special benediction, while others performed surreptitious bows while praying. But they did not don prayer shawls or phylacteries \u2014 small cases holding slips inscribed with passages of Scripture bound to the head and arm\u2014 that are customarily worn during morning prayers.\nFor many Jewish Temple Mount activists, the main aim is a place for Jewish worship at the site, Ariel said. \u201cThis is our holiest place. We aren\u2019t demanding that Muslim be evicted from here, heaven forbid,\u201d he said.\nPalestinians have long feared that Israel may change routines at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, such as partitioning the site, similar to a holy site in Hebron revered by Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque and by Jews as the Tomb of the Patriarchs.\nRamon said that Palestinians fear that if they give an inch, Israel may take a mile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how and when it will explode,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it definitely can happen.\u201d"

To pass, the vote would need 55% of the bloc\u2019s 27-member nations.\nThe \u20ac900 million investment program is focused on small businesses and \u201cdisruptive innovations\u201d that have \u201cpotential dual-use applications, such as in cybersecurity, drones, and artificial intelligence,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\nIt said the partial suspension of Israeli companies from applying for grants or equity investments worth \u20ac200 million annually is a targeted and reversible action and keeps intact Israel\u2019s access to roughly two-thirds of the program that is for civilian use.\nThe commission found Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza breached terms of a bilateral deal between Brussels and Israel known as an Association Agreement, according to senior officials tasked with communicating for the commission who were not authorized to speak publicly.\nEuropean countries pressure Israel to let in more aid\nEurope has widely soured on Israel over Gaza. Countries including Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands have sought to aggressively pressure Israel to let in more aid and cease military operations.\nIsrael has yet to reach the six points agreed in a new aid deal with the EU, which include adequate amounts of daily trucks allowed or newly opened border crossings, according to senior officials. EU aid teams have been prevented from entering Gaza despite recent humanitarian pauses.\nThe suspension is one of 10 options presented by the commission to member states. Other steps could be suspending an aviation agreement, blocking imports from settlements and curtailing travel for Israelis in the visa-free zone known as Schengen, according to a leaked document seen by The Associated Press and verified by two EU diplomats.\nLike the Netherlands, other nations could act on their own to sanction specific companies or individuals in Israel or the occupied West Bank.\nPressure has been mounting on the Dutch government, which is gearing up for elections in October, to change course on Israeli policy. Last week, thousands demonstrated at train stations across the country, carrying pots and pans to signify the food shortage in Gaza.\nThe government also will summon the Israeli ambassador to the Netherlands to urge Netanyahu to change course and \u201cimmediately take measures that lead to a substantial and rapid improvement in the humanitarian situation throughout the Gaza Strip,\u201d Veldkamp wrote.\nBen-Gvir and Smotrich remained defiant. In a statement on social media, Smotrich said European leaders were surrendering to \u201cthe lies of radical Islam\u201d and Jews may not be able to live safely in Europe in the future.\nBen-Gvir said in Europe \u201ca Jewish minister from Israel is unwanted, terrorists are free, and Jews are boycotted,\u201d but he will continue to act.\nIsrael says Hamas is the reason aid isn\u2019t reaching Gaza\nAfter international pressure, Israel over the weekend announced humanitarian pauses, airdrops and other measures meant to allow more aid to Gaza, but Palestinians say little or nothing has changed on the ground. The U.N. has described it as a one-week scale-up of aid and Israel has not said how long the latest measures would last.\nIsrael asserts Hamas is the reason aid isn\u2019t reaching Palestinians in Gaza and accuses its militants of siphoning aid to support its rule in the territory. The U.N. denies aid looting is systematic and says it lessens or ends entirely when enough aid is allowed to enter Gaza.\nNetanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, are wanted by the International Criminal Court over allegations of crimes against humanity. They are accused of using \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid and of intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Member states of the ICC are obliged to arrest the men if they arrive on their territory.\n___\nMcNeil reported from Brussels. Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv contributed to this report."

Now he is a Cabinet minister\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Death threats forced Irish pop singer Sinead O\u2019Connor to call off a peace concert in Jerusalem in the summer of 1997. At the time, a young man named Itamar Ben-Gvir took credit for the campaign against her.\nToday, he is Israel\u2019s national security minister.\nThe transformation of Ben-Gvir from a fringe Israeli extremist trying to take down O\u2019Connor\u2019s coexistence-themed concert to a powerful minster overseeing the Israeli police force reflects the dramatic rise of Israel\u2019s far-right.\nO\u2019Connor, a spirited singer and frequent source of controversy who rocketed to fame in 1990, died on Wednesday in London. While most people remember the star for her hit cover of Prince\u2019s ballad \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d or the uproar that followed her ripping up a photo of Pope John Paul II on live TV, many Israelis on Thursday recounted an open letter she wrote castigating Ben-Gvir.\nIncensed after hearing Ben-Gvir, who was then 21, boast in a radio interview that he had succeeded in scaring her away from Jerusalem, she sent the letter to The Associated Press and other news organizations.\n\u201cGod does not reward those who bring terror to children of the world,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote in a message addressing Ben-Gvir. \u201cSo you have succeeded in nothing but your soul\u2019s failure.\u201d\nOn June 16, 1997, O\u2019Connor \u2014 worried for her safety and her children \u2014 backed out of the concert organized by Israeli and Palestinian women\u2019s groups that had sought to promote Jerusalem as a capital for both people. Named \u201cSharing Jerusalem: Two Capitals for Two States,\u201d the event was set to take place just a few years after the signing of the Oslo Accords, which created the foundation for the Mideast peace process.\nPeace in the Holy Land was as controversial then as it is now, and hard-liners like Ben-Gvir oppose any division of Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as their capital.\nAhead of her summer concert, British and Irish embassies in Tel Aviv reported receiving death threats against O\u2019Connor. After her cancellation, fans and fellow peace activists expressed anger, surprise and dismay \u2014 some sealing their lips with black tape and protesting in the streets against Ben-Gvir and his allies.\nBack in 1997, Ben-Gvir was an activist in the Ideological Front, an offshoot of the racist Kahanist movement. Rabbi Meir Kahane\u2019s violent anti-Arab ideology was considered so repugnant in the 1980s that Israel banned him from parliament and the United States listed his party as a terrorist group.\nWhile Ben-Gvir did not take responsibility for threatening O\u2019Connor, he told Israeli radio that his efforts had compelled her to drop out.\n\u201cDue to us she is not arriving,\u2033 he said at the time. \u2033We are calling the pressure we put on her not to arrive a success.\u201d\nOn Thursday, as Israeli media remembered Ben-Gvir\u2019s campaign against O\u2019Connor, his office denied that he had ever threatened her.\n\u201cIndeed, Minister Ben-Gvir said he would protest against the show,\u201d his office acknowledged. \u201cThe show was canceled due to the work of thousands of demonstrators.\u201d\nHis office also noted that despite his criticism of O\u2019Connor\u2019s conversion to Islam and support for Palestinians, he would try to remember her \u201cfavorably because of the difficult life she lived.\u201d\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government \u2014 in which Ben-Gvir is a leading member \u2014 is the most right-wing and religiously conservative in Israeli history.\nThis week, the coalition passed the first part of its deeply contentious program to weaken the Supreme Court, a plan that has prompted mass street protests and plunged the country into its worst domestic crisis in years.\nOn Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site \u2014 a contested hilltop compound revered by both Jews and Muslims. The visit, while permitted under longstanding arrangements, was seen by Palestinians and Muslim countries as a provocation given Ben-Gvir\u2019s history.\nBen-Gvir, now 47, was convicted in his youth of inciting racism against Arabs and barred from serving in the Israeli army because he was considered too extremist. Until recently, he hung a portrait in his home of an Israeli gunman who killed 29 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque in 1994.\nAs national security minister, Ben-Gvir has repeatedly sparked backlash over his anti-Arab rhetoric and stunts. He has pushed for the creation of a national guard that critics fear could endanger Israel\u2019s Palestinian minority, toughened measures against Palestinian prisoners and ramped up home demolitions in the contested capital.\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s relationship to Israel only become more fraught following the botched concert. She became a supporter of the Palestinian-led campaign that calls for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israeli businesses, cultural institutions and universities. After the 2014 Gaza war, O\u2019Connor heeded the campaign\u2019s calls to pull out of a concert near Tel Aviv.\nBut the cancellation of her 1997 Jerusalem concert was remembered the most in Israel \u2014 a country in turmoil as Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir press ahead with their divisive, far-right agenda.\nIn her open letter to Ben-Gvir, O\u2019Connor described being haunted by televised images of Israelis and Palestinians beating each other in the streets of the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\u201cI felt saddened and frightened,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI asked God then \u2018How can there be peace anywhere on earth if there is not peace in Jerusalem?\u2019\u201d\nShe then added: \u201cI ask you that question now Mr. Ben Gvir.\u201d"

But Israel delayed the release to protest Hamas\u2019 practice of parading the captives before crowds during handovers. Hamas handed over the remains of four hostages overnight without any public display.\nIsrael released the 600 prisoners, but the Palestinian prisoners club, a group representing current and former prisoners, said Israel held back the release of 24 Palestinians detained in Gaza after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war. They include 23 teenagers and men aged 15 to 19 and a woman who is 35. The group were set to be released later on Thursday, along with 22 more minors and one woman whose names were subsequently added to the list.\nIsrael views the prisoners as terrorists. Palestinians often see them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long Israeli military occupation.\nNearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel for militant attacks or lesser offenses such as rock-throwing. Most are convicted in military trials that rights advocates say often lack due process. Some are incarcerated for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention. Israel says it\u2019s needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence.\nAmong those being released overnight into Thursday, 151 had been sentenced to life or long sentences for involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Forty-three were to be returned to the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, while 97 were to be sent into exile.\nAround 500 others had been detained in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war.\nIsraeli forces have arrested hundreds of people in Gaza and held them without trial. As part of the ceasefire, Israel committed to releasing more than 1,000 detainees who hadn\u2019t participated in the Oct. 7 attack.\nA look at some prominent prisoners released since the truce took effect on Jan. 19:\nNael Barghouti, 68\nBarghouti, 68, from the West Bank village of Kobar, has spent over 45 years in Israeli prison and was serving a life sentence. Guinness World Records has called him the world\u2019s longest-serving political prisoner. Israel says he is affiliated with Hamas.\nFirst arrested in 1978 for his role in an attack that killed an Israeli bus driver, he was among more than 1,000 prisoners released in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel re-arrested Barghouti in 2014 and says his offenses include intentional manslaughter, membership in an illegal organization, producing a bomb, possessing explosives and conspiracy. He will be deported.\nBilal Abu Ghanem, 31\nGhanem, 31, from east Jerusalem, was serving three life sentences and 60 years for a bus attack in 2015 that killed three Israelis. One of those killed was Richard Lakin, an American educator who marched for civil rights and coexistence between Muslims and Jews.\nGhanem, who Israel says is affiliated with Hamas, will be deported. Israel says his offenses include intentional manslaughter, membership in an illegal organization, building a bomb, possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a crime.\nAmmar Al-Ziben, 50\nAl-Ziben, 50, is from Nablus, in the West Bank. He was sentenced to 27 life terms for planning a bombing in a Jerusalem market in 1997 that killed 16 people, including a U.S. citizen.\nIsrael says he is affiliated with Hamas and his offenses include possession of firearms, incitement, forgery, throwing firebombs and attempted murder. He will be deported.\nAhmed Barghouti, 48\nHe is a close aide of militant leader and political figure Marwan Barghouti, who is still imprisoned. The two aren\u2019t closely related.\nAhmed Barghouti was given 13 life sentences for dispatching assailants to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s. As a commander in Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigades, an armed offshoot of the secular Fatah Party, he was also convicted of possession of firearms and attempted murder.\nHe was sent to Egypt.\nThe Sarahneh brothers\nThree brothers from east Jerusalem were released after more than 22 years in prison for their involvement in suicide bombings that killed Israelis during the second intifada. Israeli authorities brought Ibrahim, 55, and Musa, 63, to their homes in the West Bank.\nThe third brother, Khalil, 45, who was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life in 2002, was sent to Egypt.\nIbrahim Sarahneh\u2019s Ukrainian wife, Irena, had been sentenced to life in prison in 2002 for organizing with her husband a suicide bombing that killed two people in the Israeli city of Rishon Lezion. She was released in 2011 as part of a swap for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas.\nThe Aweis brothers\nHassan Aweis, 47, and Abdel Karim Aweis, 54, from the occupied West Bank, were released on Saturday after nearly 23 years in prison.\nHassan Aweis was sentenced to life in 2002 on charges of voluntary manslaughter, planting an explosive device and attempted murder. He was involved in planning attacks during the second intifada for the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade.\nAbdel Karim Aweis \u2014 sentenced to the equivalent of six life sentences for throwing an explosive device, attempted murder and assault, among other charges \u2014 was transferred to Egypt.\nIyad Abu Shakhdam, 49\nAbu Shakhdam was sentenced to the equivalent of 18 life sentences over his involvement in Hamas attacks that killed dozens of Israelis during the second intifada. They included a suicide bombing that blew up two buses in Beersheba in 2004, killing 16 Israelis, including a 4-year-old.\nAbu Shakhdam was arrested in the West Bank in 2004 following a gunfight with Israeli security forces in which he was shot 10 times.\nDuring 21 years in prison, his family said, he finished high school and earned a certificate for psychology courses. He was released on Feb. 8.\nJamal al-Tawil, 61\nAl-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank, spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings.\nMost recently, the Israeli military arrested al-Tawil in 2021, saying he had participated in riots and mobilized Hamas political activists in Ramallah, the seat of the semiautonomous Palestinian Authority, Hamas\u2019 main rival. He was held without charge or trial.\nToo weak to walk, al-Tawil was taken to a hospital after his release in Ramallah on Feb. 8.\nMohammed el-Halabi, 47\nThe Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a Christian aid organization, was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas in a case that drew criticism from rights groups. He was freed on Feb. 1.\nEl-Halabi and World Vision denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing.\nZakaria Zubeidi, 49\nA prominent militant leader in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade during the second intifada, Zubeidi later became a theater director in the Jenin refugee camp, where he promoted what he described as cultural resistance to Israel.\nHis jailbreak in 2021 \u2014 when he and five others used spoons to tunnel out of one of Israel\u2019s most secure prisons and remained at large for days before being caught \u2014 thrilled Palestinians and stunned the Israeli security establishment.\nIn 2019, after Zubeidi had served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again, accusing him of being involved in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries.\nZubeidi had been awaiting trial when he was sentenced to five years in prison for his jailbreak. He was released on Jan. 30 into the West Bank.\nMohammed Odeh, 52, Wael Qassim, 54, and Wissam Abbasi, 48\nThey hail from east Jerusalem and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for deadly attacks during the second intifada, they were handed multiple life sentences in 2002.\nThey were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students.\nAll were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25.\nMohammad al-Tous, 67\nAl-Tous held the title of longest continuously held prisoner in Israel until his release on Jan. 25, Palestinian authorities said.\nFirst arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the Fatah party activist spent a total of 39 years behind bars.

      "text": "Netanyahu says deal to release hostages held in Gaza has been reached after last minute snags\nNetanyahu says deal to release hostages held in Gaza has been reached after last minute snags\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday a deal to return hostages held in the Gaza Strip has been reached, after his office said earlier there were last minute snags in finalizing a ceasefire that would pause 15 months of war.\nNetanyahu said he would convene his security Cabinet later Friday, and then the government to approve the long-awaited hostage deal.\nNetanyahu\u2019s pre-dawn statement appeared to clear the way for Israeli approval of the deal, which would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and see dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The deal would also allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the remains of their homes in Gaza.\nIsraeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory on Thursday.\nNetanyahu said he had instructed a special task force to prepare to receive the hostages returning from Gaza, and that their families were informed the deal had been reached.\nIsrael had delayed a vote Thursday on the ceasefire, blaming a last-minute dispute with Hamas for holding up approval as rising tensions in Netanyahu\u2019s government coalition raised concerns about the implementation of the deal just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete.\nNetanyahu\u2019s office had accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas\u2019 new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May.\nHamas denied the claims, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, saying the militant group \u201cis committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.\u201d\nThe ceasefire agreement has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners, which the Israeli prime minister depends on to remain in power. On Thursday, Israel\u2019s hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approved the ceasefire. There was no immediate comment from Ben-Gvir following Netanyahu\u2019s announcement Friday.\nAP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on last minute issues with an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal.\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty called on Israel and Hamas to implement a Gaza ceasefire plan \u201cwithout any delay\u201d in an exclusive interview Thursday with The Associated Press. Egypt has been a key mediator between the enemies for years and a leading player in ongoing ceasefire negotiations.\nThe deal announced Wednesday would pause the fighting with a view to eventually winding down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.\nHamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.\nIsrael responded with a devastating offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed.\nThe military campaign has leveled vast swaths of Gaza, and pushed about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast.\nNetanyahu faces heavy internal pressure\nThe Israeli prime minister has faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose families have pleaded with Netanyahu to prioritize the release of their loved ones over politics.\nBut Israeli divisions over the deal were on stark display Thursday, as Ben-Gvir threatened to resign, saying the ceasefire was \u201creckless\u201d and would \u201cdestroy all of Israel\u2019s achievements.\u201d\nThe departure of Ben-Gvir\u2019s Jewish Power party would reduce the number of the ruling coalition\u2019s seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, from 68 to 62 \u2014 leaving Netanyahu\u2019s government with just the slimmest of majorities. Ben-Gvir said his party would return to the coalition if Israel resumes its war.\nBen-Gvir\u2019s resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal. But the move would destabilize the government at a delicate moment and could lead to its collapse if Ben-Gvir were joined by other key Netanyahu allies.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for instance, is vehemently opposed to the agreement and has demanded that Netanyahu promise to resume the war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire as a condition of his party staying in the coalition.\nA night of heavy Israeli strikes\nPalestinians in Gaza reported heavy Israeli bombardment Thursday. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires as a way to project strength.\n\u201cWe were expecting that the (Israeli) occupation would intensify the bombing, like they did every time there were reports of progress in truce talks,\u201d said Mohammed Mahdi, who was sheltering in Gaza City.\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry said the toll of 72 from Thursday\u2019s strikes only included bodies brought to two hospitals in Gaza City and the the number killed was likely higher.\n\u201cYesterday was a bloody day, and today is bloodier,\u201d said Zaher al-Wahedi, a Health Ministry official.\nThe Israeli military said it had struck approximately 50 militant targets across the Gaza Strip over the past day, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launch sites.\nAnxiety spread across Gaza on Thursday with the news of last-minute quarreling between Hamas and Israeli officials.\n\u201cWe ask our brothers in Hamas to communicate with mediators to end the war,\u201d said Omar Jendiya, in Deir al-Balah. \u201cEnough with the destruction and killing.\u201d\nA phased withdrawal and hostage release with potential pitfalls\nUnder the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to what\u2019s left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance.\nThe remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second \u2014 and much more difficult \u2014 phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory.\nCeasefire leaves questions about Gaza\u2019s future unanswered\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trump\u2019s team took credit for the breakthrough.\nLonger-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction.\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll in Gaza. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing it of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes.\nHamas has come under overwhelming pressure from Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza\u2019s largest cities and towns and seizure of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the 2023 attack, have been killed.\nBut its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues.\n___\nShurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

      "text": "Why did Netanyahu end the Gaza ceasefire?\nWhy did Netanyahu end the Gaza ceasefire?\nThe wave of Israeli strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday was the culmination of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to get out of the ceasefire with Hamas that he agreed to in January.\nSince the start of the war, Netanyahu has faced dueling, possibly incompatible pressures: Families of the hostages want him to cut a deal with Hamas to free them, while his far-right coalition partners want to continue the war with the aim of annihilating the militant group.\nOn Tuesday, he appeared to cast his lot with the latter \u2014 and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has backed Netanyahu\u2019s decision to unilaterally walk away from the ceasefire it took credit for brokering.\nBoth Israel and the United States blame the renewed hostilities on Hamas\u2019 refusal to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war proceed \u2014 which was not part of the ceasefire agreement. Israel has accused Hamas of preparing for new attacks, without providing evidence. The militant group has denied those allegations.\nHamas \u2014 which has yet to respond militarily to the Israeli strikes \u2014 has spent weeks calling for serious talks on the ceasefire agreement\u2019s second phase, which calls for the release of the remaining living hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.\nThose talks were supposed to begin in early February. Now they may never happen.\nWhat did the ceasefire agreement say?\nThe agreement reached in January, under pressure from the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump one, called for a phased ceasefire aimed at freeing all the hostages abducted in Hamas\u2019 Oct 7, 2023, attack and ending the war it caused.\nUnder the first phase, which ran from Jan. 19 to March 1, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remained of their homes, and there was a surge of humanitarian aid.\nEach side accused the other of violations, and Israeli strikes killed dozens of Palestinians the military accused of engaging in militant activities or entering no-go zones. But the truce held.\nStill, the second phase was always seen as far more difficult.\nThrough months of negotiations, Netanyahu had repeatedly cast doubt on it, insisting Israel was committed to returning all the hostages and destroying Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities \u2014 two war goals that many believe are irreconcilable.\nIn a TV interview last June, Netanyahu cast doubt on the possibility of a lasting ceasefire before Hamas is destroyed. \u201cWe are committed to continuing the war after a pause, in order to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas. I\u2019m not willing to give up on that,\u201d he said.\nOn Jan. 18, the eve of the ceasefire, he said \u201cwe reserve the right to return to war if necessary with the backing of the United States.\u201d\nWhy did Netanyahu back out of the ceasefire?\nAgreeing to a permanent ceasefire would almost certainly plunge Netanyahu into a political crisis that could end his nearly uninterrupted 15-year rule.\nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich had threatened to leave the coalition if Netanyahu progressed to Phase 2 instead of restarting the offensive. Opposition parties have promised to support him in any agreement that brings back hostages, but his coalition would still be severely weakened, making early elections likely.\nBy resuming the fighting, Netanyahu ensured Smotrich\u2019s continued support. After the strikes, the Israeli leader regained another far-right partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose party had bolted in January over the ceasefire but returned to the coalition Tuesday.\nBeyond the political jockeying, Netanyahu\u2019s stated goal of annihilating Hamas would have almost certainly eluded him had he stuck with the ceasefire agreement.\nHamas survived 15 months of Israeli bombardment and ground operations that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of Gaza. When the truce took hold, the militant group immediately reasserted its rule.\nThere\u2019s no agreement on who should govern Gaza after the war, and even if the Western-backed Palestinian Authority were granted nominal control, Hamas would have strong influence on the ground and could rebuild its military capabilities.\nFor many Israelis, especially Netanyahu\u2019s hawkish base and far-right allies, that would look like defeat. It would add to the criticism he already faces over security failures surrounding the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.\nHow did Netanyahu end the truce?\nAfter the first phase ended, Netanyahu said Israel had agreed to what he described as a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a seven-week extension of the truce and a vague promise to launch negotiations over a lasting ceasefire.\nHamas refused, pointing out that the new proposal was different from the one they had agreed to in January and again called for the immediate launch of talks on Phase 2.\nIt even offered to return an America-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages to get the talks back on track, an offer dismissed as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by Israel. Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while making \u201centirely impractical\u201d demands.\nIn an attempt to impose the new arrangement on Hamas, Israel halted the import of all food, fuel and other humanitarian aid to Gaza. It later cut off electricity, affecting a vital desalination plant. Israel also said it would not withdraw from a strategic corridor on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt, as stipulated in the agreement.\nIn recent days, Israel stepped up strikes across Gaza, targeting people it said were planting explosives or engaging in other militant activities. On Tuesday, at around 2 a.m., it launched one of the deadliest waves of strikes since the start of the war.\nWhat has Trump said about the ceasefire?\nTrump took credit for brokering the ceasefire in January, but since then has appeared to sour on it. He has warned that \u201call hell\u201d will break loose if Hamas does not immediately release the hostages, while saying that\u2019s a decision for Israel to make.\nTrump has also proposed that Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians be permanently relocated so the U.S. can take ownership of Gaza and develop it as a tourist destination. Netanyahu has embraced the plan, which has been universally condemned by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who say it would violate international law.\nThe White House said it was consulted ahead of Tuesday\u2019s strikes and supported Israel\u2019s decision.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"

      "text": "Who are the hostages released by Hamas?\nWho are the hostages released by Hamas?\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Hamas handed over the remains of four more Israeli hostages early Thursday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\nThey are the last four to be released during the first phase of the truce, which is set to end Saturday. Israel and Hamas have yet to negotiate the next phase, and dozens of hostages are still held in Gaza.\nHamas transferred the four bodies to the Red Cross early Thursday and they were brought back to Israel for forensic testing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office confirmed their identities and said that three of the four hostages were killed in captivity, without elaborating. The fourth was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hamas militants kidnapped the body, Netanyahu\u2019s office said.\nUnder the first phase of the truce, 25 Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others were handed over in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Five Thai citizens abducted while working in Israel on the day of the attack were freed last month in a separate deal.\nHamas-led militants took 251 hostages during their Oct. 7, 2023, attack that launched the war in Gaza. Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza, roughly half of whom are believed to be dead. The others were released in previous agreements, rescued, or their bodies were recovered.\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women or children.\nHere\u2019s a look at the hostages released so far:\nOhad Yahalomi, 49 when kidnapped\nOhad Yahalomi was shot in the leg as he and his family were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His wife and two daughters, one 10 and the other almost 2, escaped from a moped attempting to take them into Gaza and got away after running through fields for hours. Ohad and his oldest son, Eitan, then 12, were taken into Gaza but held separately. Eitan was released as part of a ceasefire in November 2023.\nYahalomi, who also had French citizenship, was a dedicated runner and swimmer and loved traveling across Israel, according to the hostage forum. Netanyahu\u2019s office said Yahalomi was killed in captivity.\nItzhak Elgarat, 68 when kidnapped\nElgarat was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz and was wounded in his hand, according to his brother, who spoke with him that morning.\nHis brother, Danny Elgarat, told Israeli media in July 2024 that they had received information from the Israeli military that Itzhak had likely been killed at some point in early 2024, though there was no official confirmation of his death. Netanyahu\u2019s office said Elgarat was killed in captivity.\nHostages who were returned in the 2023 ceasefire said they had seen Itzhak in captivity in the early months of the war, his brother told Israeli media.\nElgarat also had Danish citizenship. He loved to travel and was a passionate supporter of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team.\nShlomo Mantzur, 85\nMantzur was taken from Kibbutz Kissufim, while his wife of 60 years, Mazal, escaped. He was one of the founders of the kibbutz and had managed the chicken coops for many years. He had five children and 12 grandchildren. He loved working with his hands and studied jewelry-making and carpentry. Born in Iraq, he survived riots against Jews as a child and moved with his family to Israel as a young teenager, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\nMantzur was the oldest person taken hostage. Earlier this month, the Israeli military confirmed that Mantzur was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza.\nTsachi Idan, 49 when kidnapped\nIdan was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as militants shot through the door of their saferoom. Hamas militants broadcast themselves on Facebook live holding the Idan family hostage in their home, as his two younger children pleaded with the militants to let them go. Only Tsachi was taken to Gaza.\nIdan worked in tech and loved playing soccer, volleyball and tennis, according to the hostages forum. Netanyahu\u2019s office said Idan was killed in captivity.\nOmer Wenkert, 23\nWenkert, a restaurant manager known for his love of dancing and sports, was taken captive from the Nova music festival in southern Israel.\nSince his abduction, his family was concerned that Wenkert \u2014 from the southern Israeli town of Gedera \u2014 wasn\u2019t getting the medication necessary to treat his colitis, an inflammation of the large intestine.\nThey had not received a sign of life from him since November 2023, when Hamas published footage of Wenkert tied in the back of a pickup truck in his underwear.\nOmer Shem Tov, 22\nShem Tov, from the Israeli city of Herzliya, was abducted from the Nova music festival with his friends Maya and Itay Regev, former captives who were released in November 2023. He\u2019s a passionate musician and DJ, according to the hostage forum.\nOn the day of the Hamas attack on Israel, Shem Tov crammed into a car full of people trying to flee, but the militants shot at them. His family later saw footage of Shem Tov held by militants and bound in the back of a truck.\nTal Shoham, 40\nTal Shoham, from the northern Israeli village of Ma\u2019ale Tzviya, was visiting his wife\u2019s family on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri when Hamas militants burned the house where they were hiding, forcing them outside.\nShoham, who also has Austrian citizenship, was taken along with his wife, Adi Shoham; his daughter, Yahel, 3; son, Naveh, 8; mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran; his wife\u2019s aunt, Sharon Avigdori; and her daughter, Noam, 12. Three members of their extended family were killed during the attack.\nThe six extended family members were freed in November 2023. His wife, Adi, is a psychologist specializing in trauma.\nThe hostage forum said Shoham volunteered with Israel\u2019s emergency paramedic service and used to be a manager at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri\u2019s printing house.\nEliya Cohen, 27\nCohen was at the Nova musical festival when he was taken hostage while hiding in a bomb shelter. His fianc\u00e9, Ziv Abud, avoided capture by hiding under a pile of bodies.\nCohen is from Tzur Hadassah, a town north of Jerusalem. He works in marketing and real estate.\nHostages who have been released in the past weeks said they were held with Cohen, and he had lost more than 20 kilograms (44 pounds) and had a bullet in his leg that did not receive medical attention. He was held in tunnels, chained for most of the time, and was unaware Abud had survived, she said earlier this month.\nAvera Mengistu, 38\nMengistu had been held in Gaza since entering on his own in 2014. Mengistu is from Ashkelon, a city in southern Israel. His family had no idea if he was alive for nine years, until Hamas released a video of him in January 2023.\nMengistu, a member of Israel\u2019s Ethiopian minority, entered the territory by crossing a barbed wire fence into Gaza. After he crossed into the Gaza Strip, he was abducted by Hamas. The family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues and he had gone missing within Israel previously.\nHisham Al-Sayed, 36\nAl-Sayed crossed on his own into Gaza in 2015 and had been held since. He grew up in Al-Sayed, a small Bedouin Arab village near the city of Hura in the Negev Desert. In 2022, Hamas published a video showing him lying in bed with an oxygen mask, though he was conscious.\nHis father told Human Rights Watch that Al-Sayed had run away from home on many occasions. His family told Israeli media he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\u201cNo other hostages should face a decade in captivity,\u201d his family said in a statement shortly before Al-Sayed\u2019s release.\nThe Bibas family\nThe bodies of Ariel and Kfir Bibas were returned Thursday and the remains of their mother, Shiri Bibas, were returned Friday. Hamas said the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike, while Israel says forensic testing showed the boys were killed in captivity in November 2023. Shiri\u2019s husband, Yarden, was also abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, and was released earlier this month.\nA video of the family\u2019s abduction showed a terrified Shiri Bibas swaddling her two redheaded sons in a blanket as armed militants surrounded her. The footage ricocheted around the world in the hours after the attack.\nAriel was 4 years old at the time and Kfir was 9 months old, making him the youngest captive taken by Hamas. Ariel Bibas loved Batman and family photos showed the four Bibases dressed as the character.\nKfir, the infant with red hair and a toothless smile, became a symbol across Israel for the feelings of helplessness and anger over the hostages\u2019 captivity.\nOded Lifshitz, 84\nl\nThe body of Oded Lifshitz, one of the oldest hostages held by the militants, was returned Thursday. He was taken captive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was freed before the first ceasefire agreement.\nHis family said in a statement they had \u201choped and prayed so much for a different outcome.\u201d\n\u201cNow we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from us since October 7,\u201d they said. \u201cOur family\u2019s healing process will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned.\u201d\nOded and Yocheved Lifshitz are among the founders of Nir Oz. Oded, a journalist, campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. In retirement, he drove to the Erez border crossing on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip once a week to ferry Palestinians to medical appointments in Israel as part of a group called On the Way to Recovery.\nOded took pride in his work helping the traditionally nomadic Bedouin people of the Negev Desert, his daughter told The Associated Press, describing a case that went to Israel\u2019s High Court and resulted in the return of some of their land.\nSagui Dekel Chen, 36\nAn Israeli-American, Chen was working outside on his pet project, bus conversions, when militants stormed his kibbutz. He instructed his wife, Avital, to hide in the safe room with their two daughters. Chen, one of the first people to raise alarm of the infiltration on the kibbutz, was taken captive.\nAvital was seven months pregnant at the time of the attack; she gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December 2023.\nChen is an avid tennis player who co-founded an arts center for young people in southern Israel, according to the hostage forum.\nIair Horn, 46\nHorn is an Israel-Argentinian who was taken captive along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time.

The rest of his family was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023.\nSasha Troufanov works as an engineer for Amazon, according to the hostage forum. His family immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union 25 years ago.\nHe was held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza, which has released multiple videos of him in captivity, including one just hours before his release.\nEli Sharabi, 52\nEli Sharabi was taken captive by the militants from Kibbutz Beeri, a communal farm that was one of the hardest hit in the Hamas attack. His British-born wife, Lianne, and their teenage daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were killed by militants while hiding in their safe room. His brother, Yossi Sharabi, who lived next door, was killed in captivity. Hamas militants are holding his body, according to the hostage forum.\nEli Sharabi\u2019s home bore marks from the attack months later.

      "text": "Who is Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet?\nWho is Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet?\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet on Sunday to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\nThe resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections.\nIt was the latest act of defiance by the 48-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel\u2019s most influential politicians.\nHere is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:\nWhy did Ben-Gvir oppose the ceasefire deal?\nThe ceasefire will pause the war and free dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.\nAhead of the resignation, he said the ceasefire was \u201creckless\u201d and would \u201cdestroy all of Israel\u2019s achievements.\u201d\nIn his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country\u2019s police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.\nHe also has paid multiple visits to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site \u2014 the contested hilltop compound that houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque \u2014 including last month. In one such visit in July, he said he came to pray for the return of the hostages \u201cbut without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\u201d\nThe move, while legal, was seen as a provocation, violated a longstanding ban on Jewish prayer there, and threatened to disrupt months of sensitive negotiations. The site is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.\nRun-ins with the law\nBen-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. As a teen, his views were so extreme that the army banned him from compulsory military service.\nBen-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late racist rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.\n\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.\nTwo years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O\u2019Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.\nMoving to the mainstream\nThe political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.\nBen-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.\nWith a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.\nBen-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents, and in the past has encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood, while brandishing a pistol. As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.\nControversial minister\nBen-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir\u2019s Jewish Power party, into power.\n\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve been on a mission to save Israel,\u201d Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. \u201cMillions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.\u201d\nBen-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure \u2014 encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu\u2019s contentious attempt to overhaul the country\u2019s legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.\nIn May, Ben-Gvir criticized Joe Biden when the U.S. president threatened to withhold certain military aid if Israel invaded Rafah. Ben-Gvir, using a heart emoji in a post on the social media platform X, wrote that Hamas loves Biden.\nPolitical fallout\nBen-Gvir\u2019s departure does not endanger the ceasefire, and Netanyahu still has a narrow parliamentary majority needed to keep power.\nBut if other hard-liners follow suit, Netanyahu\u2019s government could collapse, which would trigger early elections.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probable that he has less survival time,\u201d said Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and analyst for Israeli public television station Kan News.\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid has said he will provide a political safety net to Netanyahu to ensure the government will not fall over the deal.\nBut such a partnership is unlikely to last beyond the ceasefire because the two men do not get along and would have a difficult time working together, said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel with the International Crisis Group."

      "text": "Extremist lawmaker surges ahead of elections in Israel\nExtremist lawmaker surges ahead of elections in Israel\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 Israeli lawmaker Itamar Ben-Gvir calls his Arab colleagues \u201cterrorists.\u201d He wants to deport his political opponents, and in his youth, his views were so extreme that the army banned him from compulsory military service.\nYet today, the populist lawmaker who was once relegated to the margins of Israeli politics is surging ahead in the polls ahead of November elections. He has received the blessing of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is poised to emerge as a major force that could propel the onetime premier back to power.\nBen-Gvir\u2019s stunning rise is the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflects a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that has brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and all but extinguished hopes for Palestinian independence.\n\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve been on a mission to save Israel,\u201d Ben-Gvir recently told reporters. \u201cMillions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.\u201d\nBen-Gvir, 46, has been a fixture of Israel\u2019s extreme right for more than two decades, gaining notoriety in his youth as a disciple of the late radical rabbi, Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he famously broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.\n\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.\nKahane\u2019s violent anti-Arab ideology -- which included calls to ban Jewish-Arab intermarriage and for the mass expulsion of Palestinians -- was considered so repugnant that Israel banned him from parliament and the U.S. listed his party as a terrorist group. Kahane himself was assassinated by an Arab assailant in New York in 1990.\nBut in recent years, his followers and some of his ideas have made their way to the Israeli mainstream \u2014 in large part thanks to Ben-Gvir.\nHe transitioned into politics last year after a career as a lawyer defending radical Jewish West Bank settlers. His intimate knowledge of the law has helped him test the boundaries of the country\u2019s incitement laws and avoid sanctions that have prevented some of his closest associates from running in elections.\nBen-Gvir, for instance, calls Kahane \u201crighteous and holy\u201d but also says he doesn\u2019t agree with everything his former mentor said. He\u2019s careful to limit his own calls for expulsion to those who engage in violence and lawmakers \u2014 Jewish or Arab \u2014 who he says undermine the state.\nBefore entering politics, he removed a photo of Baruch Goldstein -- a Jewish militant who gunned down 29 Palestinians in a mosque in 1994 -- from his living room. He no longer allows his supporters to chant \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d at political rallies. Instead, they are told to say, \u201cDeath to terrorists!\u201d\nSupporters say Ben-Gvir has changed, been misunderstood, or wrongly painted an extremist.\n\u201cPeople mature. People develop,\u201d said Nevo Cohen, Ben-Gvir\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThey stuck a label on Ben-Gvir that is totally wrong.\u201d\nBen-Gvir\u2019s office turned down an interview request. But he makes frequent appearances on Israeli TV and radio, displaying a cheerful demeanor, quit wit and knack for deflecting criticism as he banters with his hosts.\nHe also has tapped into a wave of anti-Arab and nationalist sentiment driven by years of violence, failed peace efforts and demographic changes. Ben-Gvir\u2019s supporters are largely religious and ultra-Orthodox Jews, who tend to have large families, and also come from the influential West Bank settler movement. Ben-Gvir himself lives in a hard-line settlement next to the West Bank city of Hebron, home to more than 200,000 Palestinians.\n\u201cHe is a populist demagogue. He plays on the sentiments of hate and fear of Arabs,\u201d said Shuki Friedman, an expert on Israel\u2019s far right at the Jewish People Policy Institute. \u201cHe interviews well, he is good on camera and he has had plenty of screen time that has given him legitimacy.\u201d\nIn the opposition over the past year, Ben-Gvir has positioned himself as a rabble rouser against the government -- the first ever to have an Arab party as a member. He publicly quarreled with Arab lawmakers in scenes captured on camera and widely broadcast.\nIn the tense run-up to last year\u2019s Gaza war, he staged provocative visits to Arab neighborhoods, rallying ultranationalist supporters to confront Palestinians and assert \u201cJewish Power\u201d \u2014 the name of his party.\nHe set up an outdoor parliamentary \u201coffice\u201d in an Arab neighborhood of east Jerusalem where Jewish settlers are trying to expel Palestinians from their homes, setting off a melee. He later called for police to use live fire against Palestinian protesters at a flashpoint holy site.\nHis surge in the polls has made him a central figure in Netanyahu\u2019s comeback strategy.\nNetanyahu is on trial for corruption, and the public is again torn over his fitness to rule. After four consecutive inconclusive elections, Netanyahu and his Likud party hope to break the logjam with Ben-Gvir\u2019s support.\n\u201cYes, Ben-Gvir is someone very militant and yes, sometimes a little provocative, but he is someone who cares about Israel,\u201d said Likud lawmaker and Netanyahu confidant Miki Zohar, who insisted Ben-Gvir would fall in line under a Netanyahu-led government.\nLast week, Netanyahu personally brokered a deal between Ben-Gvir and a rival far-right leader, Bezalel Smotrich, to ensure they run together. If they hadn\u2019t, Smotrich might not have made it into parliament, depriving Netanyahu of a critical source of support.\n\u201cJoining forces is the order of the day,\u201d Netanyahu said.\nOne recent poll forecast Ben-Gvir\u2019s alliance with 12 seats, which would make it parliament\u2019s fourth-largest. That means Netanyahu almost certainly would make Ben-Gvir a Cabinet minister if he can form a government.\nBen-Gvir has said his first order of business would be to pass a law allowing deportations of those who allegedly subvert the country and its security forces. He has proposed imposing the death penalty for \u201cterrorists\u201d and granting immunity to soldiers accused of committing violent crimes against Palestinians.\nThabet Abu Rass, the Arab co-director of the Abraham Initiatives, which promotes Jewish-Arab coexistence, said the mainstreaming of figures like Ben-Gvir is not only a threat to Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, but to the country as a whole.\nBy branding Arab members of parliament as traitors who should be expelled, Ben Gvir delegitimizes the political participation of Arab citizens \u2014 who make up around 20% of Israel\u2019s population \u2014 and the possibility of Jewish-Arab partnerships, Abu Rass said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous for the whole Israeli society,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring about the collapse of democracy.\u201d"
