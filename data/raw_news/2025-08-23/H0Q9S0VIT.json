  "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Ero Copper (TSE:ERO) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Ero Copper is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.11 = US$169m \u00f7 (US$1.8b - US$212m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nTherefore, Ero Copper has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 4.9% generated by the Metals and Mining industry.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ero Copper compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Ero Copper .\n\nSo How Is Ero Copper's ROCE Trending?\n\nIn terms of Ero Copper's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 34%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.\n\nOn a side note, Ero Copper has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.\n\nOur Take On Ero Copper's ROCE\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Ero Copper in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. In light of this, the stock has only gained 1.7% over the last five years. Therefore we'd recommend looking further into this stock to confirm if it has the makings of a good investment.",

  "summary": "Ero Copper (TSE:ERO) has been criticised for its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (PSP) relative to the capital employed in its business. The current ROCE is 11%, much better than the 4.9% generated by the Metals and Mining industry. However, this could be seen as a trend that suggests that the business is investing more into its business and its returns are increasing. Ero Copper's historical ROCe movements have not been well received since 2005, with its returns on capital falling to 11%. However, given capital employed and revenue both increased, it appears that the company is pursuing growth.",
  "shortSummary": "Ero Copper's ROCE is a weak relative to its recent returns due to declining returns and increased investment opportunities, but overall stock potentials remain high.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$315.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$158.18\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n7.2%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.6b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.07\n7D\n-0.7%\n1Y\n26.0%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.6b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.70\n7D\n0.1%\n1Y\n25.5%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.9b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$237.56\n7D\n3.2%\n1Y\n29.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$50.1b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$170.88\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-2.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$46.6b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.84\n7D\n1.2%\n1Y\n-15.0%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.5b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$101.66\n7D\n-1.7%\n1Y\n32.8%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.45\n7D\n0.7%\n1Y\n11.7%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.70\n7D\n-1.2%\n1Y\n19.7%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.4b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.70\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n-6.0%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$24.32\n7D\n4.4%\n1Y\n-28.9%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$31.20\n7D\n7.5%\n1Y\n38.4%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.4b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$24.47\n7D\n12.5%\n1Y\n17.6%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$526.3m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.53\n7D\n5.4%\n1Y\n-22.2%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$395.3m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.29\n7D\n-0.9%\n1Y\n-39.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$245.2m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.68\n7D\n-0.9%\n1Y\n-44.0%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$78.3m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.10\n7D\n-8.4%\n1Y\n1.7%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$39.5m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.82\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-56.6%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "Ero Copper\u2019s return on capital employed (ROCE) has dropped from 34% five years ago to 11% today, yet the company\u2019s sales are growing and it is reinvesting in its operations, which could support long\u2011term upside despite a modest 1.7% five\u2011year share\u2011price gain. The 11% ROCE still outperforms the metals and mining industry average of 4.9%, and analysts see potential for future earnings and revenue growth, though the stock\u2019s valuation and growth prospects remain modest. The article also highlights that Trump\u2019s 2025 energy policies are expected to boost midstream oil and gas firms\u2014such as Chevron, Kinder Morgan, and Williams Companies\u2014by accelerating infrastructure development and increasing demand for pipeline and storage services. Overall, the piece suggests further investigation into Ero Copper\u2019s investment strategy and the broader midstream sector\u2019s exposure to new federal energy initiatives.",
