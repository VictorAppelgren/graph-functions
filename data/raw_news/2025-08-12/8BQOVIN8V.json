  "content": "Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nI took a tour through a few 10Q reports this week to get a sense of how EV makers like Rivian and Lucid (or even legacy automakers that also sell EVs) feel about the one-two punch of tariffs and the end of the federal tax credit. Although these documents are loaded with legalese, it\u2019s clear that both economic developments are on the minds of their respective executive teams.\n\nRivian and Lucid both make specific and multiple mentions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the risk factors section of their 10Qs. The OBBBA eliminates certain tax credits for EV buyers and essentially devalues the zero-emissions regulatory credit market. Tariffs and trade policy risks also make cameos.\n\nLucid notes in its 10Q that it is assessing the impact of OBBBA. \u201cIf any of the Company\u2019s suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners experience financial distress, insolvency or disruptions in operations, they may be unable to fulfill their obligations or meet the Company\u2019s production and quality requirements.\u201d Meanwhile, Rivian tries to strike a \u201cglass half full\u201d tone by noting that 45X tax credit for domestic battery production remains.\n\nFord and GM also make mention of the OBBBA, although both spend more time talking about the potential effects of tariffs. GM says it\u2019s unable to estimate the financial impacts of the OBBBA, but notes it \u201ccould be material and may adversely affect electric vehicle profitability.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the unfortunate upshot (and potential third punch): A new 100% import tariff on semiconductor chips could squeeze automakers even more. Anyone who paid attention during the COVID pandemic remembers how supply constraints on chips hurt automakers. Industry experts estimate that a modern vehicle contains more than 1,000 \u2014 and in some cases more than 3,000 \u2014 chips. None of these companies want to go through this again.\n\nThe question is how they will qualify for exemptions; the Trump administration said it will award them to companies that manufacture the chips domestically. Automakers don\u2019t typically make chips, which means these companies may all turn to domestic suppliers. This is, of course, a TBD scenario since the administration has a history of changing policy, and it has yet to provide details on this 100% tariff and exactly how to secure an exemption.\n\nThe end result is uncertainty, the wet blanket of any enterprise.\n\nYou would think that a trade war with China and concerns about protecting American technology would discourage Chinese companies from setting up shop in the U.S. But lately, I have heard some chatter from a few birds in the industry that Chinese companies, specifically those working on autonomous vehicle technology or adjacent tech, are repatriating to the United States. Stay tuned as I dig into this one.\n\nGot a tip for us?

The urban air-mobility business, which went public via a merger with a blank-check company, enjoyed its fair share of buzz and controversy since its founding in 2014.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s owned by electric air-taxi developer Joby Aviation. The deal is worth up to $125 million and includes the Blade brand and its passenger business, which has operations in the United States and Europe. Blade\u2019s medical division isn\u2019t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.\n\nBlade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Joby.\n\nI wasn\u2019t exactly expecting this deal, but it sure does make sense. Blade has sought partnerships with other electric aircraft companies, including Wisk. And Joby will need the infrastructure if it wants to ramp up commercial operations \u2014 once its electric aircraft receives the Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City \u2014 notably, a dedicated lounge and terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as in Manhattan\u2019s West Side and East Side and on Wall Street.\n\nOther deals that got my attention this week \u2026\n\nDrone startup Destinus, which supplies weapons to Ukraine, plans to buy Daedalean, a Swiss company developing autopilot systems for aviation. The deal is reportedly for $223 million in cash and stock.\n\nJeh Aerospace, an Indian aerospace component-manufacturing company with headquarters in Atlanta, raised $11 million in a Series A round led by Elevation Capital, with participation from General Catalyst.\n\nUzum, the Uzbekistan-based express food delivery and fintech startup, raised $65.5 million in a round co-led by China\u2019s Tencent and the New York- and London-based VR Capital, with participation from U.S.-based FinSight Ventures.\n\nFoxconn has sold a former GM factory (and surrounding land) for $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million. Reminder: Foxconn never managed to scale production of EVs at the plant after three years of ownership. So what is to come of this factory? The buyer is reportedly SoftBank, and the plan is to turn this factory into an AI data center.\n\nLyft made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant\u2019s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nRivian filed a lawsuit to be able to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in Ohio. The company claims existing law unfairly benefits Tesla, which received a special exemption.\n\nRead this: A stunning and data-rich report on Uber\u2019s sexual assault problem.\n\nZoox has received an exemption from federal safety regulators to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. There is some considerable backstory here, so I recommend reading my article. TL;DR: This clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox robotaxis complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also puts an end to a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.\n\nThe Tesla news cycle just won\u2019t quit. And for some, it may feel contradictory. The company\u2019s board of directors approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth around $29 billion in shares, with the company citing the \u201cever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla\u2019s position at a critical inflection point\u201d as reasons for the payout. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has seen automotive revenues drop, is pushing to turn its AI and autonomy ambitions into moneymakers.\n\nTwo developments this week have chipped away at those aspirations. First, Tesla has shuttered its Dojo supercomputer program, ending its bid to develop in-house chips for driverless technology. And separately, a jury found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash and ordered it to pay around $242.5 million in punitive and compensatory damages. It\u2019s a notable case in which plaintiffs successfully argued there is a gap between how Tesla talks about its Autopilot driver-assistance system and its actual capabilities. (The Verge has an interesting interview with the attorney.)\n\nThe Autonocast, a podcast about the future of transportation that I happen to co-host, had a fun guest recently. Boris Sofman, who led Waymo\u2019s now-shuttered self-driving trucks program and co-founded Anki Robotics, came on the show to discuss his new autonomous vehicle technology startup Bedrock Robotics. Give it a listen!",

      "text": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given Zoox an exemption to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads and closed a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.\nThe decision, which was announced Wednesday, clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox\u2019s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which place requirements on vehicles such as having a steering wheel and pedals. Zoox had argued that it did and announced in July 2022 that it had self-certified; NHTSA balked. The agency opened an investigation in March 2023 to look into the matter, and specifically the process and data that Zoox had used to self-certify.\nThe investigation didn\u2019t slow Zoox\u2019s development and testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. In early 2023, Zoox began testing its custom-built robotaxis, which don\u2019t have a steering wheel or other traditional controls, on public roads near its Foster City, California headquarters. The company has since expanded its testing footprint to Las Vegas and San Francisco.\nZoox does not operate a commercial service yet. However, in San Francisco it has opened its robotaxis up to employees and hosted family and friends. Earlier this year, the company launched an Zoox Explorer program, aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas.\nFor now, the exemption allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially.\nNHTSA\u2019s announcement is connected to its new national framework, which the agency argues will make it easier for companies to deploy autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls \u2014 like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors \u2014 at scale.\nThe framework allows NHTSA to green-light the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zoox spokesperson Whitney Jencks said in an email that Zoox is working in close cooperation with NHTSA on this process, beginning with the demonstration exemption and followed by the commercial exemption.\nAs part of the agreement, NHTSA has closed its investigation into Zoox\u2019s self-certification of its AVs. Zoox has agreed to remove or cover all statements that its purpose-built vehicles comply with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards."

      "text": "Tesla is breaking up the team behind its Dojo supercomputer, ending the automaker\u2019s play at developing in-house chips for driverless technology, according to Bloomberg.\nDojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources.\nThe disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their own AI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\nIt also comes at a crucial time for Tesla.\nCEO Elon Musk has pushed to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\nTesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.\nIn 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up to Tesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal, which happened in October.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021. Venkataramanan presented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor.\nSources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers.\nDuring Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies.\n\u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said.\nThe news comes as Tesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay package to keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Tesla for more information.\nHave a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.\nJoby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a \u201cstrategically important\u201d acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade\u2019s passenger service.\nJoby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities.

      "text": "- Before Blade went public, spokesman Simon McLaren would rep the helicopter service in publications.\n- When Insider sought to confirm McLaren's identity, a Blade employee initially said McLaren was real.\n- Blade's CEO later said McLaren was created to interact with reporters and author a newsletter.\n- See more stories on Insider's business page.\nFor three years until his departure in January, Simon McLaren served as the director of communications for Blade, the urban-aviation startup that went public earlier this year at a valuation of more than $800 million. His work in that time was largely what you'd expect of a company spokesperson \u2014 except for the fact that Simon McLaren doesn't actually exist.\nAfter Insider sought to verify McLaren's identity, Blade CEO Rob Wiesenthal acknowledged in an interview that McLaren was a made-up persona invented by him and his colleagues and that Wiesenthal masqueraded as McLaren in telephone conversations with news outlets. The ruse lasted for years, duped numerous journalists, and included a puzzling public drama around McLaren's purported departure from Blade. None of it was real.\nNumerous news outlets quoted Simon McLaren as though he were a real spokesperson\nMcLaren has no substantial online presence outside a Blade email address, a Twitter account created in December, and a Medium profile created in November. His personal website, created in January, was registered through a proxy, and he uses a 1966 photo of the British racing driver Graham Hill across his accounts in place of a profile picture.\nStill, McLaren has been treated as a real human by a variety of news outlets since his apparent debut in the pages of Vanity Fair in 2018. McLaren served as the institutional voice of Blade in stories about the company's compliance with federal regulations, medical-supply shuttles, and negotiations with the town of East Hampton. He has been quoted by The New York Times, the New York Post, Curbed, The Washington Post, Fox Business, CNN, and Insider.\nMcLaren's most recent official press release appears to have been sent out in November, just as Blade began searching for outside representation. But his voice continued to live on in the form of short, opinionated blog posts, called \"Simon McLaren's Curious Content,\" that Blade began sending to subscribers of its email list in October. For 12 weeks, McLaren \u2014 under Blade's logo \u2014 weighed in on a number of pandemic issues, including moving to Miami, meeting over Zoom, and patronizing New York restaurants.\nWiesenthal says 'there are a lot of small companies' that invent fake spokespeople\nIn June, Insider attempted to reach McLaren at a Westchester County, New York, phone number that he had previously used to call an Insider reporter for an August interview and that had been publicized as belonging to McLaren on the Blade Twitter account in 2019. The call was answered by Lee Gold, Blade's chief of staff.\nWhen we asked why he was answering McLaren's phone, Gold said, \"I schedule for Simon as well.\" He added that he had met McLaren in person and that even though McLaren was no longer on staff at Blade, \"he sometimes will do some freelancing for us as a spokesperson.\"\nGold agreed to schedule an interview with McLaren, asking Insider to send a request via email. In a follow-up call, Gold said he hadn't seen McLaren in months and that an email to McLaren's address had bounced back. He then appeared to block my number. When reached again, he declined to answer further questions about McLaren.\nSoon after, Insider received a call from Wiesenthal, who acknowledged inventing McLaren. He described the practice of creating false personas and conducting interviews with reporters under false pretenses as a common practice among small companies.\n\"As a small company, everyone has to wear many hats,\" Wiesenthal said. \"When it was appropriate for a spokesman to respond to a press inquiry, rather than the CEO, given that we did not have a spokesman, we used the pseudonym.\"\nHe said that with the exception of McLaren's name and identity, the spokesman always told the truth.\n\"In the summer of 2020, as a private company we stopped using the press-inquiry pseudonym, and we now have an outside firm representing us, and we apologize to anyone who feels deceived when we used a pseudonym,\" he added.\nThe McLaren persona started out as a solution to a small untrained team, Wiesenthal said.\n\"I'm the only person who would speak to the press, unless by email directed by me. We just did not have a spokesperson, and people had to wear many hats,\" he said.\n\"There was no intention of being duplicitous. A lot of people wanted a name for a spokesman, and it was just not appropriate for a CEO to speak,\" he added. \"And a lot of people didn't have training on how to speak with the press. There are a lot of small companies that have done this and continue to do this, but at a certain point you outgrow it, and we outgrew it.\"\nWiesenthal said McLaren's career as a blogger and newsletter writer was a secondary project that evolved out of the pandemic, in part to keep Blade's marketing and creative teams busy.\n\"During the dark days of COVID, I really think it kept people going,\" Wiesenthal said. \"We had weeks where nothing was flying during the lockdown. But people wanted to engage and get people to work and communicate with our flyers, we weren't going to say, 'Fly to the airport.' So we wrote interesting things about what life was like in the city.\"\nBlade and McLaren parted ways shortly before the company went public\nWiesenthal, a former Sony executive and lifelong New Yorker, stepped down as the chief operating officer of Warner Music to launch Blade in 2015. The company, which describes itself as an \"urban air mobility platform\" and brokers flights on helicopters and chartered jets, attracted investments from heavyweights like Barry Diller and David Geffen before going public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company earlier this year. It now trades on the Nasdaq.\nThe SPAC deal coincided with McLaren's official exit from Blade. In January, just a few weeks after the company tapped the communications firm ICR to announce the merger, Blade sent out an unusual letter to subscribers explaining that McLaren would be leaving the company and taking the newsletter with him, in part because he could no longer abide Blade's attempts to edit his views.\n\"We are living in a uniquely polarizing time,\" the statement said. \"As such, despite how much we enjoy Simon McLaren's Curious Content and his unique perspective on what it's like to be a diehard New Yorker in this day and age, both Simon and the Company have decided that it's best that we part ways and transition his weekly newsletter from Blade to him.\"\nThe letter quoted McLaren explaining that he was no longer an appropriate spokesperson for Blade.\n\"My weekly dispatches have little interest to me or my readers unless they create emotion \u2014 laughter or perhaps annoyance, and at times, happiness or even unexpected animus,\" it said.\n\"I appreciate the platform Blade has given me, but I am at the point in my life where I have little interest in Blade, or its partners, bleaching my prose in an effort to avoid any readers potentially being triggered by my views,\" it added. \"Over the past few weeks, Blade's editing process has created the literary equivalent of melba toast. Simply put, my views are not subject to negotiation.\"\nWiesenthal said the drama around McLaren's seemingly rocky departure started as an \"inside joke\" among the company's creative team.\nWhether he exists or not, McLaren was seemingly prescient about one thing: In January, he predicted that stories about well-known public figures pretending to be someone they were not would be big in 2021.\n\"Given the giant void created by our departing president, news outlets will be starving for stories to report on. How inconsequential a story will the media be willing to cover?\" he wrote. \"Well, consider this. How many stories have you read in the past 72 hours about the allegedly fake Spanish accent of Alec Baldwin's wife? Yes, that's a story that will qualify for 'above the fold' status in 2021.\"\nDominic-Madori Davis contributed reporting."

      "text": "The mystery buyer of the former General Motors factory owned by Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio, is apparently SoftBank, according to Bloomberg News. SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle.\nThe report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIt\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customers went bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment.\nSoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars.\nFoxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d\nThe sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business."

      "text": "Foxconn has sold the former GM factory it has owned for three years after failing to stand up any meaningful, large-scale electric vehicle production there.\nThe pivot marks the second major failure of Foxconn to deliver on its promises to help revive U.S. manufacturing. The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin \u2014 a project that Donald Trump called the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d during his first term \u2014 and wound up underdelivering to an extreme degree.\nFoxconn says the buyer is an \u201cexisting business partner\u201d named \u201cCrescent Dune LLC,\u201d an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer.\nFoxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show.\nA Foxconn representative told Automotive News the company will remain \u201cinvolved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility\u201d and claimed it is \u201ccommitted to customers and suppliers\u201d in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.\nFoxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d\nWhile Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn \u2014 which had become an investor in the startup \u2014 of \u201cstarving it of cash,\u201d and said it \u201cmaliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.\u201d\nFoxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in October 2023 with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed to build EVs for Fisker Inc. as well. Fisker filed for bankruptcy in June 2024.\nA fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has not had much of an impact, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors. Monarch\u2019s CEO, Praveen Penmetsa, did not respond to an emailed request for comment about whether its tractors will continue to be built in Ohio."

      "text": "The day after he won an unprecedented $243 million verdict in a wrongful death case against Tesla, attorney Brett Schreiber posted a reel on Instagram celebrating the victory. His song pick: 1992\u2019s \u201cDamn It Feels Good To Be a Gangsta\u201d by the Geto Boys.\nThe lawyer who beat Tesla is ready for \u2018round two\u2019\n\u2018There are two Teslas,\u2019 attorney Brett Schreiber told us. \u2018There\u2019s Tesla in the showroom and then there\u2019s Tesla in the courtroom.\u2019\n\u201cThis is a verdict that will change the world,\u201d Schreiber wrote in the caption, as Bushwick Bill, Willie D, and Scarface rap in the background about how \u201ceverything\u2019s cool in the mind of a gangsta.\u201d\nIf that sounds like hyperbole, mixed with a dose of macho boasting, you\u2019re not wrong. But in some sense, Schreiber earned his right to strut.\nThe day before posting the reel, he stood in a Florida courtroom alongside his clients as a jury handed Tesla a major defeat. The company was partially responsible \u2014 33 percent, to be exact \u2014 for a 2019 crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. (It was determined that the driver of the Tesla Model S invovled, George McGee, was mostly responsible. McGee settled with the families in 2021.) The company was ordered to pay as much as $243 million in punitive and compensatory damages to Angulo and Benavides\u2019 family. It\u2019s a huge sum, though one that could be reduced on appeal.\nThe verdict was highly unusual, insofar as the case even went to trial. Tesla has studiously avoided facing juries in fatality cases involving its driver assist technology, preferring to settle with the injured parties. But when it has gone to trial, it typically wins, such as in two previous cases in California.\nThe winning streak came to an end with Schreiber\u2019s case. We spoke a few days after the decision about his historic win, how he used Elon Musk\u2019s own words to bolster his case, and how Tesla could face even steeper fines in the many lawsuits that are still pending.\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\nI\u2019ve been following Tesla for a very long time and I know that the company has a pretty solid track record of avoiding these types of judgments. Why do you think this was different?\nWell, I mean, they did make an overture to settle the case, and for a very large sum of money. Now, it was a fraction of the verdict, but the condition of the settlement was that it would be secret. And my clients were not interested in a secret settlement. They knew that this was a case and a cause that was bigger than themselves. And it was important to them that we shine a light on what Tesla has done.\nMy theme in my closing argument was about Tesla\u2019s choices and Tesla\u2019s words. And to your point as to why they\u2019ve been successful, I think it\u2019s in part because there are two Teslas. There\u2019s Tesla in the showroom and then there\u2019s Tesla in the courtroom. And Tesla in the showroom tells you that they\u2019ve invented the greatest full self-driving car the world has ever seen. Mr. Musk has been peddling to consumers and investors for more than a decade that the cars are fully self-driving, that the hardware is capable of full autonomy. And those statements were as untrue the day he said them as they remain untrue today. But then they showed up in a courtroom and they say, No, no, no, this is nothing but a driver assistance feature.\n\u201cMy theme in my closing argument was about Tesla\u2019s choices and Tesla\u2019s words.\u201d\nWords matter. Choices matter. \u2026 Sometime later today or tomorrow, whenever the clerk finally approves it, all of the admitted trial exhibits are going to be publicly filed on the federal docket in Miami. Documents that only I and the lawyers involved in this case have seen, which shows Tesla knew about people\u2019s constant misuse of their system. They knew how they were misusing it. They knew why they were misusing it. And they knew when they were misusing it \u2014 going back a decade. And I would encourage you and anybody else who\u2019s been following these to log on to Pacer and to pull those exhibits down because they have never been seen before. And I have been saying for well over a year that the only way that this information was ever going to become public was inside of a courtroom.\nAnd we did that, and the only reason we were able to do that was because the Benavides and Angulo families were courageous enough to stand up to the largest corporation in the world and say, No, you are not going to settle this in secret. This is going to be shared publicly. And the jury saw it with a unanimous verdict. They sent a message to Tesla. Your choices and your words matter. Do better.\nI wanted to ask you about how you presented this case to the jury. And specifically the role that Elon Musk and his words played. You made a very pointed show of bringing in comments from the Tesla CEO. Can you talk a little bit about the role that you think that his past comments about Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and about its self-driving capabilities played in this particular trial?\n[Musk\u2019s words] were central to it. \u2026 The jury is asked about the expectation of an ordinary consumer. What would an ordinary consumer expect this vehicle to do? It didn\u2019t actually matter what the driver himself thought. Now, his feelings about this were very consistent with Musk\u2019s statements, but [Musk] says these things for a reason. He says this to create this idea in the public\u2019s mind that these cars are more than they really are. He makes these comments going back to 2015. Autonomous driving is a solved problem. They are safer than humans. It will stop for anything. It knows if there\u2019s something metal and something dense in front of it, it should stop. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an alien spaceship, he said. And we played all of those because that aligns with the law.\nI said, \u201cLook, you may know that Chick-fil-A has a cow running around telling you to eat more chicken and that LiMu the emu and Doug wants you to buy Liberty Mutual insurance. And that Geico has a gecko that peddles its products.\u201d I said, \u201cNo one knows who Andrew Cathy, Tim Sweeney, and Todd Combs are. They are the CEOs of those companies. And even though no one\u2019s heard of them \u2026 the decisions they make and the words they speak define what an ordinary consumer thinks of their company and the products they sell.\u201d And I said the same is true of Elon Musk and Tesla. They cannot escape the fact that they have represented for a decade that they have invented and made a vehicle to the public that is the greatest, most advanced, Enhanced Autopilot driving vehicle the world has ever seen. And then they show up in court and they go, Well, there\u2019s no vehicle in 2019 that would have ever stopped under this scenario. It\u2019s a T intersection. It\u2019s a broadside hit. Blah, blah, blah. Well, that opened the door to me to say, \u201cYou cannot make these statements publicly and then use as a defense in trial the fact that the car that you\u2019ve claimed for a decade you invented doesn\u2019t actually exist.\u201d The jury saw through it.\nThis is a type of technology that is used throughout the auto industry. Other car companies have a variety of ADAS technologies that are out there. What\u2019s different about Tesla\u2019s approach? And how did that contribute to this crash, in your opinion?\n[GM\u2019s] Super Cruise, [Ford\u2019s] BlueCruise, right, those were similar vintage-era Level 2 systems. They had driver monitoring systems that actually worked. They use infrared cameras. They had systems that were geofenced. You could only use them on certain roadways that they were designed for. A lot of other systems at the time, I think Infiniti, Nissan, Honda, and somebody else I can\u2019t remember right now had a system where if you override the adaptive cruise control, the lane centering shuts off. Because you\u2019re either going to use it or you\u2019re not. Tesla didn\u2019t do any of those things.\nThat was their choice. And that goes back to the whole thing that makes them the outlier. This was not a car company that got into tech. This was a tech company that got into cars. And their production process was unlike what any other responsible automotive manufacturer has ever done. Rather than ensuring that things were ready for prime time, rather than releasing a finished product, they released a beta product. But they tell you, We call it beta, but we don\u2019t really mean it\u2019s beta. Again, they use words to the point where they become meaningless.\n\u201cThis was not a car company that got into tech. This was a tech company that got into cars.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been online and you\u2019ve seen some reactions to this verdict. I\u2019ve seen a few from Tesla\u2019s fan base, which is quite substantive. And they talk about how the technology in [George] McGee\u2019s vehicle, Autopilot, is an outdated system \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been updated since 2019 \u2014 whereas most of the current system, Full Self-Driving or FSD, is supposed to be measurably better. Do they have a point? Or is it beside the point for the outcome of this jury?\nFor the outcome of this jury, it is beside the point. We could not introduce evidence about 2023 and 2024 and later developments. But I got news for the fan base. It\u2019s not better. They\u2019ve actually eliminated radar. They\u2019ve got cameras only. It doesn\u2019t work. Everyone who knows anything and who\u2019s been following and paying attention in autonomous vehicle development for the last decade knows that the holy trinity of safety is lidar, radar, and cameras. You cannot create a camera-based-only system that is going to be better than a human driver. It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s not done. They sure as heck haven\u2019t done it. And their fusion system \u2026 continues to fail. You will see internal documents produced by Tesla where they determine that in 6 percent of the crashes that they received information on in 2019, they themselves determined that Autopilot was at fault.\nIt\u2019s so stupid, but my point is, it\u2019s not better. It\u2019s a three-legged stool. If you take one of the legs out, the other two fall down. Like I said, I\u2019ll tip my hat to Waymo. I\u2019ll tip my hat to those guys. They geofence. They three-dimensionally map, they tie in infrastructure, they use lidar, they use radar, they use cameras. Are they perfect? No. And that\u2019s the other thing I want to be really clear about. We are not anti-autonomous vehicle technology. We are not anti-progress. To the contrary, we think this stuff can and will save lives. It just has to be done the right way. And Tesla\u2019s done it the wrong way. And this unanimous jury who sat for three weeks listening to 40-plus hours a week of testimony and evidence felt the same way.\nCan you talk about what the trial revealed about how Tesla handles its Autopilot data, and also how it interacts with law enforcement when incidents arise and they need access to that data?\nThe docket should be fully unsealed in about three weeks. The court has ordered that and has given Tesla an opportunity to file a brief about anything specifically they want to keep under wraps. I am confident that the motion that we brought for sanctions against them for withholding evidence for four years will become fully unsealed. It would be irresponsible for me to say more than what they\u2019ve said, but suffice it to say, there is more to that story, and it will be set out.\nBut to that end, I can say that Tesla has a system of gathering data. They receive it immediately after crashes. And it is a very fair, I would say almost generous, statement to say that they\u2019re not always forthright with that information. And it\u2019s in part because people just don\u2019t understand it. Law enforcement doesn\u2019t understand it. Government investigators don\u2019t understand it. Through this case, we actually understood it better than even Tesla\u2019s lawyers did. Now, the in-house people knew. And again, I can\u2019t say whose decision it was to delete the data. But somebody at Tesla knew that if this information on the heels, six weeks later after the Jeremy Banner crash occurred in Deerfield Beach, Florida, that having another Autopilot fatality, that they knew that law enforcement wanted to share with federal investigators, they knew that would be bad for business. Why they did it? Only they can answer that question.\n\u201cI am confident that the motion that we brought for sanctions against them for withholding evidence for four years will become fully unsealed.\u201d\nTesla right now is trying to roll out a robotaxi service in a number of cities. What would you say to people who are interested in this, curious about trying out these vehicles, to regulators who are weighing whether to approve Tesla\u2019s requests?\nI would say that this verdict hopefully sends a very clear message to Tesla. That they need to do better. They need to elevate people\u2019s lives and people\u2019s safety over greed and profits. That\u2019s what I told the jury in closing argument, that this was not only just an opportunity. I know that jury instruction talks about punishing Tesla and deterring bad conduct. But I told them really this was an opportunity for them to help Tesla, because when a company gets to a point where they\u2019re elevating profits and greed over people\u2019s lives and safety, then that is a company that has lost its way. That is a company that needs to have its course corrected. What I hope, through their efforts at developing a Level 4 system, is that Tesla will receive this message for what it was. It\u2019s an opportunity and a teachable moment to be better.\nThe problem is \u2026 it\u2019s my understanding that it is a camera-only-based system. That\u2019s a problem. Right, the megapixels on the cameras, on a 2025 Tesla, if they\u2019re anything like what they\u2019re putting on the robotaxi, have a lower megapixel resolution than my iPhone. The human eye is 250 megapixels. Be better. There\u2019s a reason why responsible manufacturers are doing this differently. And again, is it hubris? Is it greed? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what this motivation is to double down and just try to do it the way that, Oh, we can do it this way and no one else can. I struggle with that. I\u2019m just a lawyer. What do I know? But engineers, people who have spent decades, careers, lifetimes studying this stuff, have reached the same conclusions. So my hope is that they pause. They look at what they\u2019re doing and they find ways to do it better. To do it safer.\nThat\u2019s what this verdict was about: sending a message that you cannot use our public roadways as your personal laboratory to test production vehicles. And then when you discover that an incident occurs, that you make an incremental change. That\u2019s what their corporate representative said. And as I said a couple of times publicly and told the jury, an incident to the families impacted is known as a funeral. These are people\u2019s lives that you\u2019re playing with. So my hope is that they really think about their approach. I hope that consumers demand that they rethink their approach. I hope that analysts looking at the impact of this verdict and potential verdicts in the future tell them that they need to do better. Because I think that\u2019s the only way that we\u2019re going to ever see it really change. It seems likely that there will need to be more of these types of verdicts before we do see some change, either from the company or from the way that the market views the company.\n\u201cIs it hubris? Is it greed? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nNow that we have this verdict, I\u2019m curious to know what you think it\u2019s going to mean for future cases pending against Tesla?\nRound two, Maldonado v. Tesla, Alameda State Superior Court, 75 days from today. Tesla\u2019s going to find out. I\u2019m the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in that case. And I am not limited in California to a 3x multiplier on punitives. If I had asked that jury in Florida for a billion dollars, they would have given it to me. But I couldn\u2019t ask them for that. Florida law says punitives can only be three times compensatories. I asked for $104 million in compensatories. They gave me $129 [million].\nI got to tell you something, as a trial lawyer, to get $25 million over your ask is unheard of. They would have given me anything I asked for, not because it was me, but because of the facts. The facts are a stubborn thing. And we get to tell those same facts with a better Autopilot defect theory. And I get to not only juxtapose Musk\u2019s lies in that case, but I juxtapose them with the testimony that I didn\u2019t have in Miami. I\u2019ve only had this case for a year. I worked the Maldonado case from the beginning. And in that case, I have testimony from all of the senior Autopilot leadership: Sterling Anderson, CJ Moore, Andrej Karpathy. And I show them those same quotes that were played to that jury in Miami. I said, \u201cWhen Mr. Musk said those things, was that a true statement about production vehicles at Tesla?\u201d To a person, they answer: Absolutely not.\nHe not only betrayed the public, he betrayed his own engineers. Betrayal is the most powerful human emotion there is, especially when it comes to rendering a verdict and holding a company account. That\u2019s what round two is going to look like in 75 days.

      "text": "Once the design, manufacturing and certification of electric aircraft is complete, urban air mobility companies face a cascade of logistical issues, including building an app that can connect customers to rides and finding dedicated take-off and landing areas.\nA new partnership between autonomous air taxi developer Wisk Aero and air mobility ride platform Blade Urban Air Mobility aims to provide a solution.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Wisk will own and operate up to 30 aircraft on Blade\u2019s network of dedicated air terminals along short-distance routes. Wisk will be compensated based on flight time, along anticipated minimum flight-hour guarantees, the companies said in a news release Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s a smart move for both companies. Blade does not own aircraft itself, but instead brokers private air travel service through a digital platform. However, the craft they offer are conventional rotorcraft, such as helicopters and seaplanes. The partnership will help \u201caccelerate Blade\u2019s transition from conventional rotorcraft to safe, quiet, emission-free Electric Vertical Aircraft,\u201d Rob Wiesenthal, CEO of Blade, said in a statement.\nWisk, born out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, will be able to benefit from Blade\u2019s experience as an air mobility service provider. Once Wisk achieves certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, it will be able to immediately ramp up via Blade\u2019s network.\nThe companies say they are committed to an \u201copen-network\u201d approach to Urban Air Mobility, with Wisk providing aircraft to multiple customer platforms and likewise Blade using many different electric aircraft developers for its ride services. Not all electric vertical take-off and landing companies will likely take the partnership route. Joby Aviation CEO JoeBen Bevirt has stated publicly that the company intends to be vertically integrated between its vehicle development and air taxi operations.\nBlade is one of a suite of air mobility companies, including Joby, that have announced its intention to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. In December 2020 Blade said it would merge with SPAC Experience Investment Corp. at a valuation of $825 million. The deal includes $400 million in gross proceeds and $125 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE).\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "A jury in federal court in Miami has found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company\u2019s Autopilot driver assistance system.\nThe jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla, CNBC reported. The punitive fines coupled with a compensatory damages puts the total payments to around $242.5 million. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney confirmed to TechCrunch that this is the correct amount.\nNeither the driver of the car nor the Autopilot system braked in time to avoid going through an intersection, where the car struck an SUV and killed a pedestrian. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. (The driver was sued separately.)\nThe verdict comes at the end of a three-week trial over the crash, which killed 20-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. The verdict is one of the first major legal decisions about driver assistance technology that has gone against Tesla. The company has previously settled lawsuits involving similar claims about Autopilot.\nBrett Schreiber, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement to TechCrunch that Tesla designed Autopilot \u201conly for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans.\u201d\n\u201cTesla\u2019s lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Schreiber. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict represents justice for Naibel\u2019s tragic death and Dillon\u2019s lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company\u2019s trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives.\u201d\nTesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch, said it plans to appeal the verdict \u201cgiven the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cTo be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2014 from day one \u2014 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d\nTesla and Musk spent years making claims about Autopilot\u2019s capabilities that have led to overconfidence in the driver assistance system, a reality that government officials \u2014 and Musk himself \u2014 have spoken about for years.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) came to this determination in 2020 after investigating a 2018 crash where the driver died after hitting a concrete barrier. That driver, Walter Huang, was playing a mobile game while using Autopilot. The NTSB made a number of recommendations following that investigation, which Tesla largely ignored, the safety board later claimed.\nOn a 2018 conference call, Musk said \u201ccomplacency\u201d with driver assistance systems like Autopilot is a problem.\n\u201cThey just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It\u2019s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It\u2019s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do,\u201d Musk said at the time.\nThe trial took place at a time when Tesla is currently in the middle of rolling out the first versions of its long-promised Robotaxi network, starting in Austin, Texas. Those vehicles are using an enhanced version of Tesla\u2019s more capable driver assistance system, which it calls Full Self-Driving.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include the amount of compensatory damages in the total."

(Joby) Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. This document sets forth the airworthiness criteria the FAA finds to be appropriate and applicable for the powered-lift design.\nDATES:\nThese airworthiness criteria are effective April 8, 2024.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nJames Clary, Emerging Technology Coordination Section, AIR-611, Policy and Standards Division, Aircraft Certification Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 10101 Hillwood Parkway, Fort Worth, TX 76177; telephone 817-222-5138; email\njames.clary@faa.gov.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\nBackground\nThe Joby Model JAS4-1 (Model JAS4-1) powered-lift has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 4,800 lbs. and is capable of carrying a pilot and four passengers. The aircraft uses six tilting electric engines with 5-blade propellers attached to a conventional wing and V-tail.[1]\nThe aircraft structure and propellers are constructed of composite materials. As a powered-lift, the Model JAS4-1 has characteristics of both a rotorcraft and an airplane. The Model JAS4-1 is intended to be used for Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) parts 91 and 135 operations, with a single pilot onboard, under visual flight rules (VFR).\nOn November 2, 2018, Joby applied for a type certificate for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. Under 14 CFR 21.17(c), Joby's application for type certification is effective for three years. Section 21.17(d) provides that, where a type certificate has not been issued within that three-year time limit, the applicant may file for an extension and update the designated applicable regulations in the type certification basis. Because the project was not certificated within three years after the application date above, the FAA approved the applicant's request to extend the application for type certification. As a result, the date of the updated type certification basis is June 14, 2022.\nThe FAA issued a notice of proposed airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift, which published in the\nFederal Register\non November 8, 2022 (87 FR 67399). The FAA issued a notice extending the comment period to December 22, 2022, which published in the\nFederal Register\non December 7, 2022 (87 FR 74994).\nDiscussion\nBecause the FAA has not yet established powered-lift airworthiness standards in 14 CFR, the FAA type certificates powered-lift as special class aircraft. Under the procedures in \u00a7 21.17(b), the airworthiness requirements for special class aircraft, including the engines and propellers installed thereon, are the portions of the requirements in 14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 found by the FAA to be appropriate and applicable to the specific type design and any other airworthiness criteria found by the FAA to provide an equivalent level of safety to the existing standards. These final airworthiness criteria announce the applicable regulations and other airworthiness criteria developed, under \u00a7 21.17(b), for type certification of the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift.\nThe Model JAS4-1 powered-lift has characteristics of both a rotorcraft and an airplane. It is designed to function as a rotorcraft for takeoff and landing, and as an airplane cruising at speeds higher than a rotorcraft during the enroute portion of flight operations. The electric engines on the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift will use electrical power instead of air and fuel combustion to propel the aircraft through six 5-bladed composite variable-pitch propellers. Accordingly, the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift proposed airworthiness criteria contained standards from parts 23, 33, and 35 as well as other proposed airworthiness criteria specific for a powered-lift and the engines and propellers installed thereon.\nFor the existing regulations that were included without modification, the proposed airworthiness criteria included all amendments to the existing parts 23, 33, and 35 airworthiness standards in effect as of the application date of June 14, 2022. These are part 23, amendment 23-64, part 33, amendment 33-34, and part 35, amendment 35-10.\nThe Model JAS4-1 powered-lift proposed airworthiness criteria also included new performance-based airworthiness criteria. The FAA developed these criteria because no existing standard captured the powered-lift's various flight modes and electric engines, and some unique characteristics of their propellers. The new requirements specific to the Model JAS4-1 in the proposed airworthiness criteria used a \u201cJS4.xxxx\u201d section-numbering scheme.\nBecause many of the proposed airworthiness criteria are performance-based, like the regulations found in part 23, the FAA has proposed to adopt \u00a7 23.2010 by reference, which would require that the means of compliance used to comply with the airworthiness criteria be accepted by the Administrator. Because no powered-lift consensus standards are currently accepted by the Administrator, the means of compliance will be accepted through the issue paper process.[2]\nSummary of Changes From the Proposed Airworthiness Criteria\nThese final airworthiness criteria reflect the following changes, in addition to others as explained in more detail under Discussion of Comments: The FAA made changes to the aircraft performance section to incorporate an optional, \u201cincreased performance\u201d approval, which requires greater aircraft performance capabilities beyond that of the baseline \u201cessential performance\u201d approval. The expectations for aircraft performance at both levels are clearly defined at the requirement level. Requirements to address various scenarios involving failures that can lead to loss of thrust were clarified and consolidated into a consistent terminology across all airworthiness criteria. Expectations were added for the aircraft to be capable of a controlled emergency landing following any condition where the aircraft can no longer provide the commanded power or thrust required for continued safe flight and landing (CSFL). The proposed requirement to incorporate a bird strike deterrent system was not adopted in these final airworthiness criteria, nor were other requirements not applicable to the Model JAS4-1, such as requirements for operations on water, approval for aerobatic flight, and others, as discussed in further detail under Discussion of Comments. The FAA\n( printed page 17231)\nmodified and developed revised aeroelasticity criteria to more directly address concerns expressed by commenters related to \u201cwhirl flutter\u201d and aeromechanical stability. The FAA revised requirements in response to numerous comments requesting clarification or recommending changes to address safety gaps in the proposed criteria, particularly in the areas of aircraft handling and control, structural airframe loads and durability, flight controls, protection of occupants, and protection of systems from high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) and lightning. The FAA updated requirements for electric engines in response to requests for improved clarity on applicability and relationship to the airframe requirements. The FAA also updated definitions for \u201ccontrolled emergency landing,\u201d \u201cCSFL,\u201d and \u201csources of lift\u201d and added a definition for \u201clocal events.\u201d\nLastly, the FAA clarified that, should Joby apply to amend the type certificate to include another model powered-lift, these airworthiness criteria would apply to that model also, provided the criteria remain appropriate to the changed aircraft in accordance with part 21, subpart D. This change was necessary so that each future change to the aircraft will not necessarily require an application for a new type certificate.\nDiscussion of Comments\nThe FAA received responses from 46 commenters. The majority of commenters were government agencies, private companies, and organizations as follows: Alaka'i Technologies Corporation (Alaka'i); Aerospace Industries Association (AIA); AIBOT LLC (AIBOT); Airbus; Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA); Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o Civil (ANAC); Archer Aviation Inc. (Archer); Ascot Aviation Associates (Ascot); Aerospace, Security and Defense Industries Association of Europe (ASD-Europe); Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI); BETA Technologies, Inc. (Beta); United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UKCAA); Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC); Diamond Aircraft; EASA; End State Solutions; General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA); Hartzell Propeller (Hartzell); LDR; Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB); Lilium eAircraft GmbH (Lilium); Martin Aerotech; MTLS Aerostructure (MTLS); National Business Aviation Association (NBAA); Odys Aviation (Odys); Overair Inc. (Overair); Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (Rolls-Royce); Rotorcraft Drive Systems; Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA); Vertical Aerospace; and Volocopter GmbH (Volocopter). The FAA received comments from individual commenters as well.\nSupport\nAIA, AUVSI, ASDIA, NBAA, and individual commenters expressed support for type certification of the Model JAS4-1 as a special class of aircraft and establishing airworthiness criteria under \u00a7 21.17(b). ALPA expressed support for the use of 14 CFR part 35 propeller airworthiness standards. An individual commenter expressed support for the CSFL and controlled emergency landing definitions.\nDefinitions\nThe FAA proposed criteria that created new or modified definitions for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. The FAA received and reviewed comments from AIBOT, Airbus, ASDIA, ALPA, Alaka'i, Beta, Diamond Aircraft, EASA, End State Solutions, GAMA, Hartzell, Lilium, MTLS, Odys, Overair, TCCA, UKCAA, Volocopter, and individual commenters that requested the FAA clarify, revise, or adopt as proposed certain definitions. Specifically, these comments were focused on the topic areas of \u201cCSFL,\u201d \u201ccontrolled emergency landing (CEL),\u201d and \u201closs of power/thrust,\u201d along with requests for clarification on other uses of the term \u201cthrust.\u201d GAMA and Overair also proposed modifications to the \u201csource of lift\u201d definition. Additionally, comments from Airbus, ALPA, ASDIA, EASA, Odys, TCCA, UKCAA, and an individual commenter requested the establishment of a higher safety target for powered-lift like the Model JAS4-1. In response, the FAA created an \u201cincreased performance\u201d approval that may be granted based on the aircraft's ability to meet higher performance standards for continued flight under certain failure conditions. The FAA modified JS4.2000(a) to provide for the higher safety target of \u201cincreased performance\u201d as well as to establish the proposed minimum safety target for CSFL as \u201cessential performance.\u201d The Model JAS4-1 must meet either the essential or increased performance requirements in this certification basis. Additionally, the Model JAS4-1 may be approved for both essential and increased performance with appropriate and different operating limitations.\nThe FAA has modified the definition of \u201cCSFL\u201d to establish the different expected outcomes based on the performance approval sought. The definition of \u201cCSFL\u201d was modified slightly for the essential performance approval to include pilot alertness; however the ability to continue to the planned destination or alternate is a requirement to meet the increased performance approval. Increased performance is a higher level of safety that guarantees fly-away capability after any failure not shown to be extremely improbable. Essential performance does not require the aircraft to have the capability to land at the planned or an alternate landing site as is required for increased performance.\nSeveral commenters suggested the FAA adopt EASA's special condition for vertical take-off and landing aircraft (SC-VTOL) requirements for powered-lift. The FAA disagrees and has instead adopted \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cincreased\u201d performance approvals. Although the FAA's \u201cessential\u201d and increased\u201d performance approvals are similar to EASA's \u201cCategory Basic\u201d and \u201cCategory Enhanced\u201d approvals, differences remain. The FAA is establishing these airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 to provide a certification basis for aircraft design approval, while the operational approval is accomplished outside of the aircraft certification process. Additionally, both the FAA's and EASA's performance levels include the aircraft's ability to conduct a controlled emergency landing after a condition when the aircraft can no longer provide the commanded power or thrust required for CSFL as specified in JS4.2105(g). To complete the integration of these defined levels of safety requirements, the FAA modified JS4.2115 \u201cTakeoff performance,\u201d JS4.2120 \u201cClimb requirements,\u201d and JS4.2130 \u201cLanding\u201d to incorporate the essential and increased performance requirements.\nThe FAA received several comments that the proposed definition of a \u201cCEL\u201d was not sufficient to ensure that the relevant instances that may be encountered in operation are addressed beyond a \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d as required under the proposed JS4.2105(g). The FAA agrees with the concerns raised by these commenters. As such, the FAA revised the proposed CEL definition and the requirements in JS4.2105(g) to establish the minimum level of safety required when the aircraft can no longer provide the commanded power or thrust required for CSFL.\nOne commenter requested the FAA remove the part of the CEL definition that requires that the pilot be capable of choosing the direction and area of touchdown and instead require a controlled descent. As indicated by the term itself, \u201ccontrolled emergency landing\u201d is a defined airworthiness attribute in which the design maintains\n( printed page 17232)\nsufficient control to change direction to an area of touchdown, while reasonably protecting occupants from serious injury. However, the FAA has updated the definition of CEL by relocating the pilot reference to focus the requirement on aircraft functionality. Overall pilot controllability requirements are addressed in JS4.2135, which requires that the aircraft be controllable and maneuverable without requiring exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength. The intent of the definition of CEL is to provide equivalency to the part 23 airplane gliding requirements and the part 27 rotorcraft autorotation requirements. Both minimize the aircraft's speed (forward and vertically) while still allowing directional control of the aircraft to an emergency landing.\nOne commenter requested the FAA clarify the statement \u201creasonably protecting occupants\u201d in the definition of \u201cCEL\u201d and further commented that non-participants should also be protected since these aircraft plan to operate in highly-populated urban environments. The FAA agrees with the need to provide additional clarity and has modified the definition of CEL to clarify that the expected safety outcome is protection from serious injury, which inherently provides a level of protection for non-participants on the ground. This approach is similar to the level of safety in \u00a7\u00a7 23.2270, 23.2320, and 23.2510 for normal category airplanes.\nThe FAA also received comments seeking clarification of the term \u201csome damage\u201d in the definition of CEL. The allowance for some damage to the aircraft exists in the 14 CFR 23.2000 definition of CSFL. For the Joby Model JAS4-1, this allowance was moved to the definition for CEL. The intent is that, although there may be aircraft damage, the occupants remain protected to the extent that egress may still be achieved following the landing.\nThe FAA received several comments requesting clarity on the meaning of \u201closs of thrust\u201d and \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d in JS4.2000 and throughout the airworthiness criteria. These terms were inherited from the existing airworthiness standards used to create the proposed airworthiness criteria. The FAA agrees that the \u201closs of thrust\u201d term is inadequate for the Model JS4-1, which incorporates distributed propulsion with an integrated flight and propulsion control system. Historically, this terminology was used to convey an assumed complete engine failure because of the critical nature that engines, propellers, and transmissions provided regarding continued flight or CSFL capability. With the advent of distributed propulsion, the underlying assumptions of design features, mitigations, and substantiation of capability under endurance testing established within the legacy requirements are no longer valid, requiring revision.\nDistributed propulsion with an integrated flight and propulsion control system adjusts the aircraft's flight path using aerodynamic and/or propulsive forces. In addition to addressing the complete loss of thrust at any individual location and its effects, the design must address additional failures from the flight and propulsion control system that may inadvertently generate more or less thrust than commanded by a pilot. For powered-lift with tilting nacelle designs like the Model JAS4-1, the design must also address the possibility of any given nacelle to fail in an orientation that does not match its commanded position, and account for the subsequent thrust vector that results. In part, some of these failures are identified through the system safety process. However, other considerations exist outside of that process that are necessary for identifying other critical failures. As such, the FAA has included a definition of \u201ccritical change of thrust\u201d to address the thrust's magnitude and orientation. Critical change of thrust may consist of more than one condition depending on what flight conditions it adversely affects (performance, handling qualities, or both). A critical change of thrust will require a dedicated assessment encompassing all the above elements.\nFurther, the proposed definition for \u201closs of power/thrust\u201d was not adopted in these final airworthiness criteria. Since this term was only used in the proposed JS4.2105(g), the final JS4.2105(g) requirement was rewritten to directly incorporate the previous \u201closs of power/thrust\u201d definition language and clarify that the condition represents any scenario in which commanded thrust is insufficient to ensure CSFL, regardless of cause.\nThe FAA also received recommendations to modify the proposed \u201csource of lift\u201d definition to use terminology consistent with the powered-lift definition in 14 CFR part 1. The FAA agrees and has revised this definition to align with the powered-lift definition more closely.\nOne commenter requested the FAA clarify the meaning of \u201cpredominately\u201d and what was meant by \u201ccombination\u201d in the definition of \u201csource of lift.\u201d The FAA has changed \u201cpredominantly\u201d to \u201cprincipally\u201d in the JS4.2000(b)(3) of these final criteria, as the term \u201cprincipally\u201d is used in the part 1 definitions of powered-lift and rotorcraft. The FAA intended for the definition of \u201csource of lift\u201d in JS4.2000(b)(3) to be aligned with the existing regulatory definitions of powered-lift and rotorcraft. The FAA intends the term \u201ccombination\u201d to capture instances where the sources of lift involve both engine driven lift devices (\ne.g.,\nrotors) and non-rotating airfoils (\ne.g.,\nfixed wings), generally in a manner in which the balance between the two is varying during transition from wing-borne flight to thrust-borne flight and vice-versa.\nThe FAA received a comment seeking clarification on the use of the term's \u201ctransition\u201d and \u201ctransitional\u201d within the airworthiness criteria. The term \u201ctransition\u201d is used within the airworthiness criteria to describe a change in configuration or mode of operation and is not an indication of a specific source of lift. Within the preamble of the notice of proposed airworthiness criteria, the term \u201ctransitional\u201d is intended to mean the same as \u201csemi-thrust borne.\u201d As the use of the term \u201ctransitional\u201d to mean \u201csemi-thrust borne\u201d was limited to the preamble language, no modification to the airworthiness criteria is needed.\nThe FAA received a comment asking to replace the term \u201chover\u201d with \u201ctaxi\u201d in the listed phases of flight in JS4.2000(b)(2). The FAA disagrees, as the term \u201chover\u201d refers to an airborne flight condition and \u201ctaxi\u201d refers to movement while on the ground. Another commenter requested that the FAA add \u201ctaxi\u201d to the criteria, since the terms is also used in JS4.2225. The FAA disagrees as the term \u201cground operations\u201d in JS4.2000(b)(2) includes taxi operations. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments asking that the terms \u201cshutdown,\u201d \u201cstart,\u201d \u201crestart,\u201d and \u201cidle\u201d be defined for electric engines. The FAA disagrees. The FAA intends that these terms have the same meaning as for existing engine technology, but recognizes that there may be some differences based on the specific design of the Model JAS4-1 and its engine operations.\nThe FAA received a comment questioning the applicability of part 33 requirements that used the term \u201crotorcraft.\u201d Upon further review, the FAA found similar issues with the references to \u201cairplane\u201d within part 33 and part 35. The FAA agrees with the concern and updated JS4.2000(c) to clarify that part 33 and part 35 requirements that use the terms \u201cairplane\u201d and \u201crotorcraft\u201d mean \u201caircraft.\u201d This also prompted the FAA to remove the inappropriate reference to typical airplane installations in\n( printed page 17233)\n\u00a7 35.37(c)(2). The FAA also received a comment questioning the use of the term \u201cof this part\u201d in part 33. The FAA agrees; the revision to JS4.2000(c) also clarifies that \u201cthis part\u201d means \u201cthese airworthiness criteria\u201d when used in part 33 and part 35 requirements.\nLastly, the FAA added a definition for the term \u201clocal events\u201d in response to comments requesting clarification of this term as used in requirements in subparts H and I.\nApplicable Criteria\nThe FAA proposed applicable criteria by determining the appropriate airworthiness requirements that apply to the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. These criteria are tailored to the powered-lift's design, including its engines and propellers, as well as its construction, intended use, and suitability for compliance with operational requirements.\nCAAC, EASA, GAMA, Lilium, Martin Aerotech, Odys, Overair, TCCA, Vertical Aerospace, and Volocopter requested the FAA remove sections and terms from the proposed airworthiness criteria that do not specifically apply to the Model JAS4-1 design. The FAA agrees and did not adopt the following in these final airworthiness criteria as they were not specifically applicable to the Model JAS4-1:\nJS4.2225(c);\nJS4.2240(b) (a new JS4.2240(b) has been added);\n\u00a7 23.2310;\nJS4.2320(d), (e) (the remaining requirements of JS4.2320 have been transitioned to \u00a7 23.2320);\nJS4.2325(h);\n\u00a7 23.2420;\n\u00a7 23.2435;\n\u00a7 23.2530(e);\nJS4.2540; and\n\u00a7 35.43.\nThe following phrases were not adopted in these final airworthiness criteria as they are not specifically applicable to the Model JAS4-1 design:\nJS4.2400(a): \u201cor provides auxiliary power to the aircraft;\u201d\nJS4.2405(a), (b), (c): \u201creverser system;\u201d\nJS4.2430(a)(3): \u201cand auxiliary power unit;\u201d and\nJS4.2430(c), (c)(1), (c)(3): \u201crefilling or.\u201d\nThe FAA received comments that questioned the inclusion of HIRF and lightning requirements for aircraft approved for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations. The requirements are conditional for IFR approved designs. The FAA found it prudent to specify basic design requirements for HIRF and lightning based on the expectation that future design modifications could include an IFR approval. However, additional design and installation requirements beyond those specified in these airworthiness criteria would be needed for the aircraft to be approved to operate under IFR.\nLastly, the FAA received numerous comments noting that the airplane levels prescribed by 23.2005 should no longer be referenced in these criteria, as they apply to conventional airplanes and not to a powered-lift. The FAA agrees and has revised the airworthiness criteria accordingly.\nTechnical Areas in General Order of the Airworthiness Criteria Sections\nAircraft Performance, Handling, and Control\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from Alaka'i, AIBOT, Airbus, ALPA, ANAC, ASDIA, Beta, Diamond Aircraft, EASA, End State Solutions, GAMA, Lilium, MTLS, Odys, Overair, Rolls-Royce, Rotorcraft Drive Systems, TCCA, Vertical Aerospace, Volocopter, and individual commenters requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to aircraft performance, handling, and control for the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received a comment noting the inconsistent use of terms when referring to the applicable atmospheric references in proposed JS4.2105, JS4.2115, and JS4.2130. Under JS4.2105(a), performance requirements at atmospheric conditions must be applied to all requirements in Subpart B unless otherwise prescribed, including JS4.2115 and JS4.2130. The FAA modified JS4.2115 and JS4.2130 to include fixed performance parameters for takeoff and landing, respectively; however, this does not negate the requirement to account for atmospheric conditions as denoted in JS4.2105(a).\nOne commenter suggested adding \u201cat sea level\u201d to JS4.2105(a), consistent with the language for levels 1 and 2 low-speed airplanes in part 23. The FAA disagrees. JS4.2105(a) as proposed achieves the intended safety objectives and aligns the airworthiness criteria with the appropriate level of safety intended by utilizing appropriate standards from both parts 23 and part 27, with revisions specific to the Model JAS4-1. The FAA did not modify JS4.2105(a) as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments that stated a concern that proposed JS4.2105(b)(1) inadvertently limits airport altitudes to 10,000 ft. The FAA agrees and has changed the airworthiness requirement to develop performance data to the maximum altitude for which certification is being sought.\nThe FAA also received a comment requesting clarification whether the 10,000 feet specified in JS4.2105(b)(1) should be expressed in either mean sea level or above ground level. The language in JS4.2105 is consistent with the existing airworthiness standard \u00a7 23.2105 and is referenced to the altitude above sea level. No change was made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter requested revision of JS4.2105(c), stating the rule is too vague and recommending that a minimum crosswind limit be established similar to parts 27 and 29. The FAA received another comment requesting clarification on dealing with wind gusts arising in urban environments. The FAA agrees with the need for a minimum crosswind limit but does not agree that details addressing urban environments belongs in JS4.2105(c). The FAA revised JS4.2135(a)(6) in response to similar comments to specify a minimum of 17 knots all azimuth capability. The FAA did not change JS4.2105(c) as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received comments about JS4.2105(f) expressing confusion about what the phrase \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d means relative to a powered-lift design of the Joby JAS-4 type. As mentioned previously, the FAA replaced the phrase \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d with a new term, \u201ccritical change of thrust,\u201d which is defined in JS4.2000.\nSeveral commenters noted inconsistent utilization of the term \u201cflight envelope\u201d and requested clarification. One such instance was identified in JS4.2135(a), where the criteria referenced an \u201coperating envelope.\u201d The FAA's intent was not to imply this flight envelope was different from others referenced in these airworthiness criteria. To be consistent, the FAA has generally replaced \u201coperating envelope\u201d with \u201capproved flight envelope\u201d where applicable, such as in JS4.2105(f) and JS4.2135(a), except for JS.2425(b) and JS4.2710(d), where the proposed requirements define operating envelopes specific to the engine.\nThe FAA received several comments requesting clarification of the new term \u201closs of power or thrust\u201d defined in proposed JS4.2000(b)(4) and used in proposed JS4.2105(g) to specify the required level of safety after a condition when the aircraft can no longer provide commanded power or thrust required for CSFL. This proposed term generated confusion with similar terminology referring to \u201closs of thrust\u201d in other sections of the criteria. The FAA agrees that clarification is necessary and\n( printed page 17234)\ntherefore has not adopted the \u201closs of power/thrust\u201d definition in final JS4.2000. The FAA has also revised JS4.2105(g) by replacing the term \u201closs of power or thrust\u201d with the definitional language from proposed JS4.2000(b)(4).\nSeveral commenters asked for clarification on JS4.2105(g) and the use of system safety or operational mitigations as the compliance showing. The FAA modified JS4.2105(g) to provide additional clarity. Revised JS4.2105(g) is intended to assure that in the event of cockpit mismanagement, energy exhaustion, improper maintenance, or other failures, a controlled emergency landing can be achieved. JS4.2105(g) establishes safety objectives and the FAA's acceptance of a specific means of compliance is beyond the scope of these airworthiness criteria.\nA commenter asked for clarification on JS4.2105(g) as to whether a conventional forward landing would be an acceptable mitigation for loss of power or thrust. A conventional forward landing may be acceptable if the aircraft is capable of a controlled emergency landing in that configuration. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments requesting that the FAA more explicitly state that the speed for thrust-borne flight in JS4.2110 and JS4.2150 may include hover. The minimum safe speed determined in JS4.2110 must cover all phases of flight (including hover) and all sources of lift, and JS4.2150 uses that minimum safe speed. As such, no change to the criteria is necessary.\nThe FAA also received a request to revise JS4.2110 to require minimum safe speed for \u201ceach flight condition and configuration\u201d instead of only for each flight condition. The FAA disagrees. The phrase \u201cflight condition\u201d includes the aircraft configuration, phases of flight, and the sources of lift. No change to the criteria is necessary.\nSeveral commenters stated that the proposed airworthiness criteria for takeoff performance in JS4.2115, climb performance in JS4.2120, and landing performance in JS4.2130 do not establish sufficient minimum performance requirements to meet the public's expectations and levels of safety. One commenter recommended rewording paragraph (b) of JS4.2115, JS4.2120, and JS4.2130 to require the applicant to account for a range of engine or distributed propulsion system failures instead of accounting for loss of thrust.\nAs explained previously, the FAA recognizes the need to clarify the difference in requirements for \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cincreased\u201d performance levels as defined in JS4.2000(b)(1) for the Model JAS4-1 with respect to the takeoff, climb, and landing performance criteria of JS4.2115, JS4.2120, and JS4.2130, respectively. The FAA has revised these performance requirements to include scenarios for all engines operating and for critical changes of thrust. As revised, JS4.2115, \u201cTakeoff performance\u201d addresses all engines operating, as well as critical change of thrust conditions, for both essential and increased performance levels. Essential performance level requirements ensure all engines operating takeoff capability and the capability to perform either a safe stop or safe landing following a critical change of thrust. Increased performance, while similar for safe stops, defines the requirements for continued takeoff following a critical change of thrust, including the capability to continue the climb and then subsequently achieve the configuration and airspeed specified for increased performance in JS4.2120, \u201cClimb Performance.\u201d\nThe FAA revised JS4.2120 to establish targets for both essential and increased climb performance for all engines operating, as well as after a critical change of thrust, as defined in JS4.2000. The FAA developed essential and increased climb performance requirements with all engines operating using part 23 requirements. Essential performance also requires that the applicant assess critical change of thrust impacts on takeoff and climb performance capabilities. Increased performance after a critical change of thrust defines minimum criteria utilizing part 23 and part 27 Category A climb requirements, dependent on the takeoff flight path and sources of lift defined in JS4.2000 along that path.\nMultiple commenters requested clarity on where glide and autorotation performance are captured. The FAA added JS4.2120(e), which requires the applicant determine the performance for gliding or autorotation.\nThe FAA received a number of comments noting the lack of specificity in proposed JS4.2130. The comments noted that JS4.2130 was overly vague and did not provide enough substantive detail to support the intent of the criteria. The FAA agrees and has revised JS4.2130 to ensure the level of safety and capability for essential and increased performance for takeoff in JS4.2115 is consistent with the level of safety and capability for essential and increased performance for landing in JS4.2130. Landing under JS4.2130 now contains requirements for both essential and increased performance levels, such that the aircraft must be able to make a landing upon a critical change of thrust. For increased performance, the FAA has also included a minimum criterion to safely transition to a balked landing condition following a critical change of thrust.\nThe FAA received a comment that determining the performance for all potential partial loss of power conditions in proposed subpart B may be impractical. The FAA agrees. As mentioned previously, a new term, \u201ccritical change of thrust\u201d has been defined in JS4.2000 to identify the most critical thrust-related failure condition(s) for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. This term requires consideration of the most adverse effect on performance or handling qualities. The FAA modified JS4.2115, JS4.2120, JS4.2125, and JS4.2130 to use this new definition of critical loss of thrust.\nA commenter requested clarification on the phrase \u201capplicable sources of lift\u201d in JS4.2135(a)(2). During a specific phase of flight, an aircraft design may only allow for a singular source of lift during that phase of flight. In other phases of flight, one or more sources of lift may be possible. Therefore, \u201capplicable sources of lift\u201d refers to only those allowable by the aircraft design. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nMultiple commenters requested the FAA establish an additional limit flight envelope which would establish the controllability limits of the aircraft. The FAA does not agree with this request. The FAA intended proposed JS4.2135 to establish the regulatory requirement for controllability that is used to define the approved flight envelope. The FAA recognizes that excursions outside of the aircraft's approved flight envelope can occur and must be considered from a safety perspective. The FAA has replaced the proposed requirement of \u00a7 23.2160(a) with new JS4.2160 to address speed excursions beyond the approved flight envelope.\nThe FAA received multiple comments requesting the FAA utilize the multiple flight envelope concept in EASA's SC-VTOL, in lieu of the proposed minimum safe speed requirement in JS4.2110. The commenters stated that the FAA's proposed requirement may be appropriate for wing-borne flight, but it is not appropriate for other aircraft configurations. The FAA determined that the establishment of a minimum safe speed and an approved flight envelope establishes a level of safety for the Model JAS4-1 that is consistent with the safety levels established in parts 23 and 27.\n( printed page 17235)\nThe FAA also received comments seeking clarification on atmospheric effects, scoping, and sources of lift in regard to JS4.2110. The intent of that requirement is to address flight conditions in normal operation considering the most adverse conditions, which includes adverse atmospheric effects. Accordingly, no change to this requirement is necessary. Establishment of minimum safe speeds in regard to specific sources of lift will be established in the means of compliance.\nRegarding controllability, the FAA received comments asking the FAA to adopt the requirement in \u00a7 23.2135(a)(3), to address \u201clikely reversible flight control or propulsion system failure\u201d instead of proposed JS4.2135(a)(3), which requires addressing \u201clikely flight-control or propulsion-system failure.\u201d Commenters further clarified that they believed flight controls are fully addressed by the proposed requirement that the Model JAS4-1 comply with \u00a7 23.2510. The FAA disagrees and determined that specific airworthiness criteria for controllability are needed to address the integration of the advanced flight-control system and the propulsion-system. In addition, JS4.2135(a)(3) is to ensure that likely failures not included in the system safety process of \u00a7 23.2510 are addressed and that failures that are included have an adequate handling quality assessment, which is outside the scope of \u00a7 23.2510. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment seeking clarity on the difference between JS4.2135(a)(3) and JS4.2135(a)(5), which requires addressing degraded flight control system operating modes not shown to be extremely improbable. The intent of JS4.2135(a)(3) is for the applicant to identify likely failures that can be seen in service that are not addressed by a system safety analysis. These may include mechanical or other single point failures. JS4.2135(a)(5) includes failures that are identified during the formal system safety process. The intent of JS4.2135(a)(5) is to ensure that those failures that result in degraded handling qualities are assessed. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nOne commenter asked the FAA to remove JS4.2135(a)(5) because the requirements of proposed Subpart F would sufficiently mitigate this hazard. The FAA disagrees. JS4.2135(a)(5) requires controllability evaluation using approved flight test methods of compliance. The requirements in Subpart F, which apply to equipment, do not adequately address this concern. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received a comment to modify JS4.2135(a)(5) to remove the phrase \u201cnot shown to be extremely improbable.\u201d The FAA disagrees. Removing this phrase would require the applicant to address all failure conditions regardless of their probability. The FAA included this phrase to limit the cases where handling qualities are evaluated to those conditions not shown to be extremely improbable to limit the applicants burden. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nSeveral commenters requested that a minimum level of safety be established with respect to proposed JS4.2135(a)(6), which requires that the aircraft can land safely in wind conditions. Multiple commenters questioned whether JS4.2135(a)(6) was only applicable to thrust-borne flight. The FAA concurs that a minimum level of safety should be defined and has amended JS4.2135(a)(6) to contain a more prescriptive all-azimuth minimum wind speed requirement of 17 knots. This minimum wind limit is applicable to the thrust-borne operations and is consistent with requirements for parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft.\nThe FAA received a comment that the term \u201cloading\u201d in proposed JS4.2135(a)(1) needed to be revised to include energy level considerations (\ni.e.,\ndegraded or low battery). Energy level considerations are covered under JS4.2135(a)(3), (a)(5), and (b), which address propulsion system failures, flight control system operating modes, and critical control parameters such as limited-control power margins, respectively. Propulsion system failures include the electrical distribution and batteries. The same commenter proposed adopting a new requirement to address a rolling takeoff in maximum crosswind. The situation noted by the commenter is already addressed by JS4.2135(a)(2), which covers all phases of flight (\ne.g.,\ntakeoff for the approved flight envelope including crosswinds). No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nMultiple commenters asked for clarity on the phrases \u201ccritical control parameters\u201d and \u201climited control power margins\u201d in JS4.2135(b). The phrase \u201ccritical control parameters, such as limited control power margins\u201d is intended to capture parameters or limits in which the aircraft is control or performance limited. The applicant must define these parameters as they apply to their unique design. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment recommending that \u201cchange from one flight condition to another\u201d be replaced with \u201ctransition from one flight condition to another\u201d in JS4.2135(c). The FAA agrees and has updated JS4.2135(c) accordingly.\nSeveral commenters stated that the language utilized from part 23, pre-amendment 23-64, in the development of proposed JS4.2145 did not provide appropriate granularity between static and dynamic stability and sources of lift for a powered-lift. The FAA agrees and has revised the requirements in JS4.2145 to account for the difference in stability requirements that arise between wing-borne, semi-thrust-borne, and thrust-borne flight for the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received comments asking the FAA to provide specific likely failure cases to be considered in addition to more detailed control feel requirements in proposed JS4.2145(a). The FAA partially concurs with these comments. The intent of JS4.2145(a) is for the applicant to identify likely failures that may be encountered in service that are not addressed by system safety analysis; those could include mechanical or other single point failures. The FAA has revised the language in JS4.2145(a) to improve clarity but did not concur with the commenters' request to identify specific failure conditions, including detailed control feel requirements.\nThe FAA also received a comment seeking clarity on the term \u201cunstable\u201d in JS4.2145(b). The FAA revised proposed JS4.2145(b) (now JS4.2145(c), due to changes discussed previously) to clarify that the intent is to ensure dynamic stability characteristics. The FAA intends \u201cunstable\u201d to mean the same as is stated in the criteria: that the characteristics do not increase the pilot's workload or otherwise endanger the aircraft and its occupants.\nThe FAA also received comments regarding aerobatics and whether such proposed criteria are applicable to this class of vehicle or if instead the criteria should be better tailored to Joby's design. The FAA agreed and revised JS4.2145 and JS4.2150 accordingly with the recognition that Joby is not seeking approval for aerobatics for the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received a comment that proposed JS4.2150 may be adequate for wing-borne operation but not thrust-borne operation. The FAA agrees and has revised JS4.2150 to address all sources of lift.\n( printed page 17236)\nThe FAA received a comment asking for removal of proposed JS4.2150(b) as it was redundant. The FAA disagrees and finds it necessary to have an airworthiness requirement that the aircraft not inadvertently depart controlled flight.\nThe FAA also received a comment questioning the terminology \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d in proposed JS4.2150(b). The FAA agrees this term was inappropriate for an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing operations because it requires a hazardous test condition that would result in an initial adverse environment, which was not the intent. The FAA has updated JS4.2150(c) (previously proposed JS4.2150(b)) to replace \u201ccritical loss of thrust\u201d with \u201csudden change of thrust\u201d to remove this hazardous condition and to distinguish it from the term \u201ccritical change of thrust\u201d defined in JS4.2000. The FAA intends the term \u201csudden change of thrust\u201d to refer to short-term commanded thrust changes, whether directly by the pilot or from the flight control system in normal operation.\nThe FAA received comments on proposed JS4.2150 that a maximum speed limitation may be necessary to prevent loss of control on a powered-lift. The FAA agrees with the commenters, but because JS4.2150 relates to minimum safe speed requirements, the FAA has revised JS4.2160 to include this safety requirement in JS4.21060(b).\nThe FAA received a comment requesting clarification on the applicability of \u00a7 23.2155. The commenter questioned the necessity for this requirement with the assumption that powered-lift do not taxi under their own power. The FAA disagrees that this requirement should not be adopted as proposed, as the Model JAS4-1 has the ability to taxi. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nThe FAA received a comment on JS4.2140(c) requesting removal of the word \u201clikely\u201d from the term \u201clikely abnormal or emergency operations.\u201d The FAA does not agree as the term is needed to appropriately bound the requirement. This is in alignment with \u00a7 23.2140(c), the existing airworthiness standard used to develop JS4.2140(c). No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nThe FAA also received a comment on proposed JS4.2140(c) suggesting the removal of \u201cmulti-engine.\u201d The commenter stated that because the Model JAS4-1 is a multi-engine aircraft, including this term adds no value and may create confusion. The FAA agrees and did not adopt the reference to \u201cmulti-engine aircraft.\u201d\nFinally, the FAA received several comments about JS4.2140(c)'s use of the language, \u201closs of thrust not shown to be extremely improbable\u201d in the context of trim system requirements. As mentioned previously, a new term, \u201ccritical change of thrust\u201d was defined in JS4.2000 to provide an equivalent term adapted to the model JS4 design. The FAA modified JS4.2140(c) to use \u201ccritical change of thrust\u201d as a result.\nOne commenter noted that proposed JS4.2140(a) should not be limited to just cruise flight. The FAA agrees and has removed the reference limiting the requirement to cruise flight. Additionally, commenters expressed a concern that normal phases of flight utilized in proposed JS4.2140(a) and the flight conditions identified in proposed JS4.2140(b) may create some confusion. The FAA agrees and has revised the language in JS4.2140(a) to specify \u201cnormal operations\u201d instead of \u201cnormal phases of flight.\u201d\nOne commenter requested the FAA change the phrase \u201clevel flight\u201d to \u201ccruise\u201d in JS4.2140(b)(2). JS4.2140(b)(2) references flight conditions and not phases of flight, and therefore \u201clevel flight\u201d is appropriate. The commenter also requested the FAA add \u201chover\u201d to JS4.2140(b). Hover does not have a longitudinal component, and as such trim in that axis is not applicable. Adjustments of trim may not apply any discontinuities as identified in JS4.2140(c). No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received comments concerning the use of the term \u201ctrim\u201d in proposed JS4.2140 and questioning its appropriateness with fly-by-wire control systems that do not use traditional trimming arrangements. The FAA finds the requirements in JS4.2140 applicable because the Model JAS4-1 fly-by-wire flight controls may implement a trimming function rather than conventional trim device tabs or bias springs. Such a function would be equivalent to a trim or auto-trim device. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter requested that the FAA replace the term \u201cprimary flight controls\u201d in proposed JS4.2140(a) and (b) with the term \u201cinceptor.\u201d The FAA disagrees. Although inceptors and effectors may fall under the term \u201cprimary flight controls,\u201d the FAA does not find this change necessary as it prescribes a specific implementation of technology. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nIcing\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from ALPA, EASA, GAMA, Overair, and TCCA requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to flight into known icing (FIKI) conditions as well as inadvertent icing encounters. Specifically, commenters requested the FAA explain why references to icing conditions requirements were excluded, revise the level of prescriptiveness of the criteria, and remove FIKI requirements because the Model JAS4-1 is not seeking FIKI approval at this time. At the same time, the FAA received comments requesting the FAA include more specific requirements for FIKI conditions.\nBased on numerous comments received noting that Joby does not seek approval for FIKI on the Model JAS4-1 at this time, the FAA did not adopt proposed JS4.2165(a). Proposed JS4.2165(b) and (c), which address inadvertent icing encounters, remain applicable to the Model JAS4-1, and have been renumbered to JS4.2165(a) and (b), accordingly. JS4.2415 is similarly intended to capture any aircraft icing during an inadvertent encounter that adversely affects powerplant operation.\nThe FAA received comments requesting the FAA include requirements for recirculating snow and accumulation of ice and snow, because smaller rotors and airfoils, such as those on the Model JAS4-1, are known to be susceptible to the effects of snow and icing. The FAA agrees with concerns regarding the effect of scale on ice accretion, but finds they are addressed by proposed JS4.2165(b) (JS4.2165 (a) in these final criteria) for an inadvertent icing encounter. Recirculating snow and accumulation of snow are foreseeable conditions addressed by \u00a7 23.2415(a) for engine operation and by JS4.2600(a) for flightcrew visibility considering accumulations on the windshield due to recirculating snow.\nThe FAA received requests to remove proposed JS4.2165(b) since the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift is not seeking FIKI approval. The FAA does not agree, as proposed JS4.2165(b) (JS4.2165(a) in these final criteria) addresses inadvertent icing encounters, not FIKI. The relatively low revolution speed and resulting low centrifugal acceleration effect on ice shedding capability, as well as the effect of increased torque on electric engines, need to be addressed in an inadvertent icing encounter.\nLastly, the FAA received several comments on proposed JS4.2165(a), which the FAA did not adopt in the final rule. The commenters requested that the FAA explain why the reference to the icing conditions defined in appendix C of part 25 were excluded\n( printed page 17237)\nfrom these airworthiness criteria. The icing conditions for which certification is sought will be defined in future amended airworthiness criteria should Joby seek icing certification after initial type certification. This will allow Joby to seek a standard that reflects their operating limitations.\nStructural Design Loads\nThe FAA received comments from Airbus, ALPA, Diamond Aircraft, EASA, GAMA, Overair, Rolls-Royce, TCCA, Volocopter, and an individual requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to structural design loads for the Model JAS4-1, including vibration and buffeting, flight modes, and wing borne vs. thrust-borne design loads.\nThe FAA received a comment to modify \u00a7 23.2215(a) to cover the whole operational envelope of the aircraft. The FAA does not agree. The objective of this criteria covers the structural design envelope, which may exceed the operational envelope requirement recommended by the commenter. The design envelope loads requirement will be further clarified in the means of compliance. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter recommended the FAA include the structural requirement for vibration and buffeting and harmonize with EASA's SC-VTOL.2215(b) for powered-lift, by adding \u201cVibration and buffeting must not result in structural damage up to dive speed, within the limit flight envelope\u201d to \u00a7 23.2215.\nThe FAA agrees that vibration and buffeting must not result in structural damage, but the FAA does not agree to use the SC-VTOL.2215(b) language. The FAA finds that EASA's scope for vibration and buffeting in SC-VTOL is not sufficient for powered-lift. The FAA instead moved the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2215 to JS4.2215(a) and added a new paragraph (b), which states, \u201cThere must be no vibration or buffeting severe enough to result in structural damage, at any speed up to dive speed, within the structural design envelope, in any configuration and power-setting.\u201d\nTwo commenters requested the FAA clarify the transitional flight mode for engine-driven lifting-device assembly provisions per JS4.2225(d). The commenters pointed out that the structural loads requirements for this special class of aircraft include loads resulting from the transitional flight phase that are not considered under loading conditions in parts 23 and 27. Specifically, the commenters were concerned that propellers, when repositioned in-flight relative to the aircraft primary axis, may introduce unique load cases relative to conventional propeller loads that would impact the static strength evaluations. The commenters recommended the FAA capture requirements for loads in all phases of flight by revising JS4.2225(d). One commenter requested revising JS4.2225(d) to read \u201cEngine-driven lifting-device assemblies, considering loads resulting from flight (including transitional flight mode) and ground conditions, as well limit input torque at any lifting-device rotational speed.\u201d Another commenter requested revising JS4.2225(d) to read \u201c(d) Engine-driven lifting device assemblies, considering loads resulting from flight and ground conditions, limit input torque at any lifting-device rotational speed as well as propeller holding or clocking (locking) conditions if applicable.\u201d\nThe FAA agrees that all powered-lift flight configurations need clarification for the calculation of structural design loads for transitional flight phases. The FAA also recognizes that changes in propeller \u201cdisk\u201d orientation during flight will affect aircraft loads resulting from the aerodynamic influence of the propellers on the aircraft. Similarly, the FAA considers it likely that aircraft aerodynamics loads will influence the propeller aerodynamic loads. Therefore, the FAA concluded that proposed JS4.2200 Structural Design Envelope should be revised instead of JS4.2225 (as suggested by the commenters) to include, \u201cThrust\u2010borne, wing\u2010borne, and semi\u2010thrust\u2010borne flight configurations, with associated flight load envelopes.\u201d The FAA added JS4.2200(g) accordingly.\nMultiple commenters asked for clarity on the requirements in JS4.2225(d) and whether the intent of that criteria could be shown through means of compliance with JS4.2225(a). The FAA disagrees. JS4.2225(a) is specific to loads for the engine mount, whereas JS4.2225(d) is specific to lifting device assemblies.\nMultiple commenters requested the FAA provide clarification in JS4.2200(b) with respect to appropriate design maneuvering load factors for powered-lift designs. The intent of JS4.2200 is to describe the various design envelopes that must be considered by the applicant in the loads analysis. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter requested that the FAA define the term \u201csufficiently\u201d in JS4.2200(a)(1) and (2). As explained in the notice of proposed criteria, the FAA based proposed JS4.2200 on \u00a7 23.2200, with revisions to address the powered-lift structural design envelope. The terms \u201cbe sufficiently greater\u201d in JS4.2200(a)(1) and \u201cprovide sufficient margin\u201d in JS4.2200(a)(2) have the same meaning, and will be applied to the Model JAS4-1 in the same manner, as in \u00a7 23.2200(a)(1) and (2). No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nA commenter stated that JS4.2200(e), which proposed to require that the applicant account for each critical altitude up to the maximum altitude, does not consider redistribution of loads if deflections under load would significantly change the distribution of external or internal loads. EASA requested the FAA revise JS4.2200(e) similar to EASA SC-VTOL.2200(e). The FAA does not concur, as the critical altitude and redistribution of loads requirement in SC-VTOL.2200(e) is already captured by JS4.2200(e) and \u00a7 23.2210. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received multiple comments questioning the requirement to use service history in the development of the design load maneuvering factors in JS4.2200(b), since the Model JAS4-1 has no service history. One commenter requested the FAA add specific language to the airworthiness criteria that points to using service history from existing normal category aircraft. The FAA agrees that the service history utilized in this showing should come from service experience from both rotorcraft and small airplane service history. However, the FAA disagrees that a change to the airworthiness criteria is necessary.\nOne commenter recommended the FAA revise proposed JS4.2225 to be more generic by specifying source of loads for any relevant structural components, and not only the components specific to the Model JAS4-1. The FAA disagrees, as these airworthiness criteria are specific to the applicant's design.\nStructures\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from ASDIA, Airbus, ANAC, EASA, GAMA, Lilium, Martin Aerotech, MTLS, Overair, Odys, TCCA, and Volocopter requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to aircraft structure for the Model JAS4-1.\nOne commenter requested the FAA incorporate requirements equivalent to EASA SC-VTOL.2240(b) for structural durability. Several commenters suggested adding the level 4 airplane requirements for damage tolerance in \u00a7 23.2240(b) to JS4.2240 to incorporate damage tolerance principles. The FAA partially concurs with the recommendations of the commenters and has clarified to JS4.2240(b)\n( printed page 17238)\nconsistent with the FAA's long-standing policies regarding use of fail-safe methodology in conjunction with damage tolerance inspections. Fail-safe methodologies, also referred to as safety-by-design, incorporate multi-load-path structure (\ni.e.,\nredundant load paths) to act as back-up structure should any one of the original load paths (\ni.e.,\nfail-safe structure) fail. Damage tolerance (\ni.e.,\nsafety-by-inspection) is a property of structure relating to its ability to sustain defects safely until those defects can be detected.\nThe FAA does not agree that adoption of \u00a7 23.2240(b) is necessary or appropriate, as this requirement is specific to airplanes that meet the definition in \u00a7 23.2005 for a Level 4 airplane that can carry 10-19 passengers. The \u00a7 23.2240(b) requirement for Level 4 airplanes was derived from \u00a7 23.574 at amendment 23-48 and excluded the option to use fail-safe methodologies for commuter category airplanes (Level 4). In addition, \u00a7 23.574(a) requires the use of damage tolerance and allows the use of safe-life in \u00a7 23.574(b) only when damage tolerance is found to be impractical.\nDamage tolerance is one available option to use when complying with JS4.2240(a), along with the options to use safe-life and fail-safe methodologies, provided the fail-safe option relies on damage tolerance or safe life as stipulated in numerous FAA policies including AC 27-1B, \u201cCertification of Normal Category Rotorcraft;\u201d AC 23-13A, \u201cFatigue, Fail-Safe, and Damage Tolerance Evaluation of Metallic Structure for Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter Category Airplanes;\u201d and AC 91-82A, \u201cFatigue Management Programs for In-Service Issues.\u201d The FAA notes further that the intent of adding JS4.2240(b) to these final criteria was to incorporate inspection when the fail-safe method is used. Incorporating inspections addresses long-standing and known deficiencies with fail-safe methodologies on all part 23 airplanes, as clarified in the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for amendment 23-64, in which the FAA identified potential shortcomings in the ability to detect all possible failure scenarios and ensure that all structural failures would be immediately obvious and corrected before further flight. The intent of structural durability requirements in both \u00a7\u00a7 23.2240(a) and 27.571 is to use the appropriate application of safe-life or damage tolerance principles to ensure that fail-safe structure maintains the required safety margins without extended periods of operation with reduced safety margins.\nThe FAA agrees with the commenters that further clarification on the stipulations that govern use of fail-safe methodologies should be included in the Model JAS4-1 criteria to reiterate the FAA's requirements in this regard. Consequently, the FAA has added a new JS4.2240(b) that reflects the intent of \u00a7 27.571(d) together with amendment 23-64 and associated policies to incorporate damage tolerance principles into powered-lift aircraft. The requirements in JS4.2240(b) will mitigate deficiencies in the fail-safe option and will apply to the Model JAS4-1 structure beyond those elements specifically identified by \u00a7 27.571. This is consistent with \u00a7 21.17(b), which directs the FAA to use the requirements from existing airworthiness standards, as appropriate, to determine the level of safety for the aircraft.\nMultiple commenters requested that the FAA align JS4.2240(c) with EASA SC-VTOL.2240(d). The FAA notes that JS4.2240(c) is similar to SC-VTOL.2240(d), although SC-VTOL.2240(d) refers to \u201clift/thrust unit\u201d instead of \u201cengine.\u201d The EASA term \u201clift/thrust unit\u201d includes the engine and propeller or rotor assembly. This topic is an ongoing discussion with foreign certification authorities. For the Model JAS4-1, other rotating parts within the system, except for propeller blades or rotors, should be evaluated using typical rotor burst methods, including shielding where practical.\nThe FAA received a comment to move JS4.2240(c) to outside of Subpart C Structures. The FAA disagrees as JS4.2240(c) is a requirement specific to structural durability and is appropriately included in JS4.2240, which is consistent with \u00a7 23.2240. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nSeveral commenters requested the FAA align \u00a7 23.2250(c) with the failure criteria in EASA SC-VTOL.2250(c). SC-VTOL.2250(c) contains a requirement for Category Enhanced that a single failure must not have a catastrophic effect upon the aircraft. The FAA's airworthiness criteria do not contain requirements equivalent to EASA's \u201cCategory Enhanced\u201d requirements. However, the changes to JS4.2240(b) in these final criteria require inspections to reliably detect damage before it could result in a structural failure, therefore mitigating that structural failures do not result in a catastrophic failure. The FAA also changed the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2250(c) to new JS4.2250(c) to require the applicant to prevent single failures from resulting in a catastrophic effect upon the aircraft.\nThe FAA received a comment requesting the airworthiness criteria include a requirement to address corrosion on metallic or semi-metallic structure components resulting from high voltage difference of electric potential. The FAA does not concur. JS4.2240(a) provides an appropriate regulatory framework for addressing corrosion, as it embodies the safety intent of the prescriptive requirements in pre-amendment 64 regulations \u00a7 23.573 and \u00a7 23.574, which directly address corrosion, among other factors, in both composite and metallic structure. This framework will be applied to the Model JAS4-1 in the same manner as \u00a7 23.2240 for normal category airplanes to address corrosion resulting from any source, including high voltage difference of electric potential. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nMultiple commenters requested clarification on the lack of environmental requirements in \u00a7 23.2260(e), which applies to only thermal effects. Environmental effects are addressed in \u00a7 23.2260(a), and as such the FAA made no change as a result of these comments.\nAeroelasticity & Aeromechanical Stability\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments requesting the FAA revise the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2245 to address whirl flutter. The FAA agrees that whirl flutter and all similar dynamic instabilities related to rotating surfaces, non-aeroelastic aeromechanical stability, and power generating components should be addressed for the Model JAS4-1. However, the FAA disagrees with using the specific term \u201cwhirl flutter,\u201d as doing so may incorrectly limit the scope to classical airplane whirl flutter only, and not address all possible instabilities for the Model JAS4-1 configuration.\nBased on the commenter's recommendation, the FAA has replaced the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2245 with new JS4.2245 to require that component and rotating surfaces must be free of any aeroelastic instability under each appropriate speed and power condition. Additionally, the FAA determined that the related issue of aeromechanical stability should similarly be addressed but does not consider it to be covered under the subject of aeroelasticity. Therefore, the FAA created a new section JS4.2241, \u201cAeromechanical stability,\u201d incorporating requirements from rotorcraft airworthiness standards, similar to ground resonance requirements in \u00a7 27.241, to address\n( printed page 17239)\naeromechanical instabilities considered possible for the Model JAS4-1 when operating in thrust-borne and semi-thrust-borne flight.\nFlight Controls\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from Airbus, ASDIA, EASA, GAMA, Lilium, MTLS, Overair, TCCA, and an individual commenter requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify, proposed airworthiness criteria related to flight controls for the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received a comment stating that 14 CFR part 23 amendment 23-64's requirements for flight controls should be sufficient for the Model JAS4-1 and the FAA should use those requirements. The FAA disagrees. Part 23 at amendment 23-64 did not envision the type or complexity of the design of powered-lift flight controls, such as those on the Model JAS4-1. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received several comments that raised concerns with the suitability of proposed JS4.2300(b), which was developed from part 23 requirements for trim systems on normal category airplanes, for fly-by-wire powered-lift with distributed propulsion. The FAA concurs with the comments and modifies proposed JS4.2300(b)(2) by replacing the specific trim indications with a requirement that the trim systems and functions provide information necessary for safe operation. The specific indications listed in proposed JS4.2300(b)(2)(i)\u2014(b)(2)(iv), which summarized the prescriptive indications from 23.677(a) and ASTM F3232 section 4.4, may be used as means of compliance with final JS4.2300(b)(2) if they are applicable, or they may be modified for the novel implementation of trim functions on the Joby Model JAS4-1.\nCommenters raised concerns over the flightcrew control margin awareness for fly-by-wire flight control systems and recommended including a requirement addressing this issue. The FAA concurs with the comments and has added JS4.2300(a)(3) requiring the flightcrew to be made suitably aware whenever the means of primary flight control approaches the limits of control authority. For the context of this airworthiness criteria, \u201csuitably aware\u201d indicates an appropriate balance between nuisance alerting and necessary operation.\nOne commenter asked for clarification of the term \u201cindirect flight-control systems\u201d in JS4.2300(c). The FAA agrees that this term caused confusion. The FAA did not adopt this term and instead revised JS4.2300(c) for clarity.\nSeveral commenters stated that proposed JS4.2300 was overly prescriptive because the requirements could be better addressed in means of compliance and could conflict with automation in fly-by-wire flight controls. In contrast, other commenters stated that proposed JS4.2300 was insufficiently prescriptive and noted that regulations need to explicitly guide applicants, especially for novel aircraft, and specific requirements for awareness of reduced flight envelopes should be provided.\nThe FAA considered these comments and revised proposed JS4.2300 to be less prescriptive in instances where other requirements adequately address the same safety objective. The FAA did not adopt the proposed requirements in JS4.2300(c)(1), (c)(2)(i), and (c)(2)(iii) because they were redundant with other requirements and were unnecessarily prescriptive. The FAA added a more prescriptive requirement specifically for control margin awareness in response to these recommendations.\nOne commenter suggested a revision to the phrase \u201cthe onset characteristics of each protection feature is appropriate for the phase of flight and type of maneuver\u201d in proposed JS4.2300(c)(2)(i). The FAA notes there should be no discontinuous inputs into the flight control system from envelope protection systems, but agrees that abrupt inputs may be necessary in some situations (\ne.g.,\npreventing stall in response to an atmospheric disturbance). The FAA determined that this requirement is adequately addressed by JS4.2300(a)(1) and therefore did not adopt proposed JS4.2300(c)(2)(i).\nThe FAA received a comment on \u00a7 23.2305 requesting that the FAA add a requirement for parking brakes. The FAA disagrees. Section 23.2305(b) requires a reliable means of stopping the aircraft. One means to accomplish this may include a parking brake; however, the applicant may propose other means. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOccupant System Design Protection\nThe FAA received comments from ALPA, ANAC, EASA, GAMA, Lilium, Overair, Rolls-Royce, and TCCA on occupant system design protection requirements.\nThe FAA received comments seeking clarification on the proposed inclusion of the ditching exclusion in \u00a7 23.2315(a)(1) and a comment that this contradicts the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2310 for seaplanes and amphibians. The FAA concurs that the language proposed caused confusion and has revised these proposed requirements. The FAA did not adopt the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2310 as it is not applicable to the Model JAS4-1. The FAA maintained the scope of \u00a7 23.2315 (now JS4.2315) specific to the \u201ccabin configured for takeoff or landing\u201d but did not adopt the exclusion for ditching because the Model JAS4-1 is not seeking ditching approval.\nOne commenter requested that the FAA require shrouding on propellers. The FAA does not concur with the comment. JS4.2315(a)(1), originally proposed as \u00a7 23.2315, requires that passenger doors are not located where they would endanger persons using the door. Operational requirements are also used to ensure safety of passengers, ground crews, and property, as required for existing aircraft. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nThe FAA received comments regarding aerobatics and whether such criteria are applicable to this class of vehicle or if the proposed criteria for aerobatics should be removed. The FAA agrees and has removed the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2315(b) because the Model JAS4-1 does not seek approval for aerobatics.\nThe FAA received comments asking the FAA to include the protection of occupants in proposed JS4.2320(a)(2). Another commenter asked for clarification of proposed JS4.2320(a)(2). Another commenter asked the FAA to modify proposed JS4.2320(a)(2) to protect the pilot, flight controls, and propulsion electrical power and control from propellers. The intent of proposed JS4.2320(a)(2) (now \u00a7 23.2320(a)(2) in these final criteria) is to protect the pilot and systems so the pilot can land the aircraft in the event of a propeller failure. Protection of the occupants embarking and disembarking is required by JS4.2315. Propulsion control is required by \u00a7 23.2320(a)(2) as a part of the flight controls on the Model JAS4-1. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nBird Strike\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from AIBOT, Airbus, Alaka'i, ALPA, ANAC, ASDIA, Beta, EASA, End State Solutions. GAMA, JCAB, Lilium, MTLS, Odys, Overair, Rolls-Royce, TCCA, UKCAA, Vertical Aerospace, Volocopter, and individual commenters requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to bird strike requirements for the Model JAS4-1.\nSome commenters requested that the FAA increase the bird-impact size, while other commenters requested that\n( printed page 17240)\nthe bird mass should not be prescribed, or a lower bird mass should be used with considerations for multiple bird strikes. Some commenters requested complete removal of the requirement, while other commenters only requested removal of the requirement for bird deterrence devices. Several commenters questioned the bird mass differences between the aircraft level requirement in proposed JS4.2320, the propeller requirement in \u00a7 35.36, and the bird ingestion evaluation in JS4.2718.\nThe FAA maintains the rationale presented in the notice of proposed airworthiness criteria for the proposed level of bird strike protection for the Model JAS4-1. The proposed requirements were based on the increased exposure to birds in the environment in which the Model JAS4-1 is expected to operate, the expectation of public safety, and the recommendations presented in the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) Rotorcraft Bird Strike Working Group (RBSWG) report.[3]\nThe safety level obtained with the 2.2-lb bird strike requirement for transport category rotorcraft (as established in \u00a7 29.631) has been demonstrated in service to be sufficient. Similarly, the existing bird strike requirement with a 4.0-lb bird for type certificated propellers (established in \u00a7 35.36) has also been demonstrated in service to be sufficient. The bird ingestion requirements in JS4.2718 are not driven by either of these bird sizes. Therefore, the proposed bird impact protection requirement remains unchanged and will retain the proposed 2.2-lbs at the aircraft level, while maintaining propeller requirements at 4.0-lbs in \u00a7 35.36.\nThe FAA also considered the comments received on the bird deterrent system requirement in proposed JS4.2320(b), and the FAA concurs with not adopting this proposal. Although the FAA is aware of some research supporting the use of such devices, the FAA agrees the data is insufficient to mandate such a system at this time. The FAA encourages applicants such as Joby to consider voluntary implementation of these systems or similar bird deterrence mitigations, as good design practice.\nThe FAA also received comments that questioned whether the bird strike requirement should be listed under proposed JS4.2320, \u201cOccupant Physical Environment,\u201d since as written, it applies to more than just the occupant physical environment. The FAA agrees with these comments. The bird strike requirement placed in proposed JS4.2320 was intended and described in the notice as an aircraft-level requirement. Therefore, the FAA did not adopt proposed JS4.2320(b) and instead placed some of the requirements from proposed JS4.2320(b) into a new JS4.2311, \u201cBird Strike\u201d in Subpart D, \u201cDesign and Construction,\u201d to reinforce its intent as a general, aircraft-level requirement.\nLastly, several commenters expressed concern with flocking bird strikes that could affect multiple engines at the same time and recommended this be addressed by the ingestion requirements in JS4.2718(a). The FAA notes that the airworthiness criteria in Subpart H apply to each single engine used in the aircraft distributed propulsion system. The requirements in JS4.2718(a) address ingestion from likely sources such as foreign objects, birds, ice, and hail, and are intended to capture engine effects from any ingestion source determined to be applicable to the Joby electric engine design. Common cause effects across multiple engines will be addressed under the applicable aircraft-level requirements, including \u00a7 23.2510, so no change to the engine airworthiness criteria is necessary.\nFire and High Energy Protection\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from Diamond Aircraft, EASA, GAMA, JCAB, Lilium, MTLS, Odys, Overair, TCCA, and Volocopter requesting that the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to fire and high energy protection on the Model JAS4-1.\nSeveral commenters recommended the FAA revise \u00a7\u00a7 23.2325 and 23.2270 to protect against fires in baggage and cargo compartments propagating and creating an unsafe condition. The commenters suggested incorporating requirements similar to those in EASA SC-VTOL.2270, and further recommended clarifying proposed \u00a7 23.2325 by removing the references to part 23 airplane certification levels.\nThe FAA agrees with the need to mitigate the risk of fires in baggage and cargo compartments, commensurate with the intended level of safety for the Model JAS4-1. The FAA reviewed the baggage and cargo compartment fire protection requirements in parts 23 and 27, the intended operational uses of the Model JAS4-1, and the EASA SC-VTOL requirements. The proposed airworthiness criteria did not require the design to alert the pilot of a fire in a baggage or cargo compartment, or require these compartments be constructed of or lined with fire resistant materials to protect the aircraft and occupants if the pilot was unaware of a baggage or cargo compartment fire. However, part 27 contains requirements to protect rotorcraft occupants from the risk of fire in a baggage compartment through the use of flame and fire resistant materials in its construction. The FAA revised proposed \u00a7 23.2325 (now JS4.2325) by removing the part 23 airplane certification levels. The FAA also added JS4.2325(e) requiring that the Model JAS4-1 baggage and cargo compartments be constructed of or lined with fire resistant materials, similar to \u00a7 27.855(a)(2), or be equipped with a fire or smoke detection system to allow the pilot to take immediate action to land, or be located where a fire would be visible to the pilots and accessible for the manual extinguishing of a fire, which adopts some elements of SC-VTOL.2270.\nA commenter recommended the FAA revise proposed \u00a7 23.2325 to be more generic by specifying performance-based safety objectives. The FAA does not agree, as the revisions to proposed \u00a7 23.2325 (now JS4.2325) discussed previously are specific to the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received comments recommending retaining the language in \u00a7 23.2330 of \u201cdesignated fire zone\u201d in lieu of the proposed JS4.2330 \u201cfire zone.\u201d The term \u201cfire zone\u201d includes designated fire zones and new fire zones developed to address fire threats from new technologies. Much of existing guidance is defined for designated fire zones, which assume a fire involving kerosene or aviation gasoline. Other terms will be determined by the applicant, including designated fire zones, to distinguish between different types of fire zones and the fire threat that exists in those zones. The difference in language does not impose requirements beyond the intent of part 23, and also allows new fire zones to be established for aircraft using non-conventional propulsion and energy supply. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment to align the language in JS4.2330(a) and JS4.2330(b) (\u201cfire zone\u201d) with the language in SC-VTOL.2330 (\u201cdesignated fire zone\u201d). As discussed above, the FAA has moved away from using the term \u201cdesignated fire zone.\u201d EASA SC-VTOL.2330(a) is broader than JS4.2330(a) and includes additional components by applying to \u201cflight critical systems\u201d instead of only \u201cflight controls.\u201d Although JS4.2330 is not as broad as EASA SC-VTOL.2330(a) as far\n( printed page 17241)\nas the scope of components, it is broader with respect to the types of fire zones that those components must address, by using the term \u201cfire zone\u201d instead of \u201cdesignated fire zone.\u201d Protection of flight critical systems other than flight controls and ensuring CSFL after a fire or release of stored energy are addressed in JS4.2440 and \u00a7 23.2510.\nThe FAA received multiple comments to add survivable emergency landing fire protection requirements to \u00a7 23.2325. The FAA disagrees as this is covered by JS4.2430(a)(6). No changes are necessary as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment to add a requirement to JS4.2335 to minimize the risk of electrical shock to the crew, passengers, service, and maintenance personnel similar to the requirement in \u00a7 27.610(d)(2). This concern is adequately addressed by proposed JS4.2335(b), which requires the appropriate protection against hazardous effects caused by accumulation of electrostatic charge. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA also received a comment to revise JS4.2335(b) to require protection against catastrophic and hazardous effects. The proposed airworthiness criteria state that the aircraft must be protected from hazardous effects, which represent the minimum hazard level that must be addressed; by definition, this requires that catastrophic effects must also be addressed. No changes are necessary as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments questioning proposed JS4.2440 in lieu of requiring compliance with \u00a7 23.2440 for powerplant fire protection. JS4.2440 is more performance-based, allowing for all powerplant related fire protection concerns to be covered by a singular airworthiness criteria. No changes are necessary as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments recommending replacing the term \u201cpowerplant system\u201d in JS4.2440 with \u201cpowerplant\u201d or \u201cpowerplant installation.\u201d The FAA does not concur as the proposed terminology is consistent with \u00a7 23.2410. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nPropulsion Safety and Integration\nThe FAA received comments from Airbus, ASDIA, EASA, GAMA, Hartzell, JCAB, Lilium, Odys, Overair, TCCA, Rolls-Royce, Volocopter, and an individual commenter requesting that the FAA revise, remove, or clarify the proposed airworthiness criteria related to propulsion safety and integration on the Model JAS4-1.\nProposed JS4.2405(d) specifies \u201cextremely remote\u201d as an acceptable probability of failure for power or thrust control systems, assuming manual backup capability. Several commenters stated that reliance on manual backup control of power or thrust on distributed propulsion powered-lift aircraft is unlikely to be acceptably achievable to ensure CSFL, and that failure of the propulsion control system is potentially catastrophic. Commenters also stated that specifying the power or thrust control system failure probability as extremely remote may be inconsistent with the extremely improbable requirement in JS4.2135.\nThe FAA agrees the airworthiness criteria should not specify an acceptable failure probability for power or thrust controls systems on a distributed propulsion powered-lift. Additionally, the FAA agrees that control of distributed propulsion powered-lift, using manual control of individual engines and propellers, should not be assumed. The FAA revised JS4.2405 by not adopting proposed paragraph (d). The appropriate hazard classification and failure probability for power or thrust control systems will be determined using the aircraft-level system safety process in \u00a7 23.2510, as well as JS4.2135, if controllability is affected.\nThe FAA received a comment that JS4.2405(b) and \u00a7 23.2410(a) contradict one another, with the suggestion to remove the phrase \u201cif CSFL cannot be ensured, the hazard has been minimized\u201d from \u00a7 23.2410(a). The FAA disagrees. JS4.2405 establishes the safety objective for power or thrust control systems, whereas \u00a7 23.2410 is applicable to all powerplant systems and permits minimization of the hazard in limited cases. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nMultiple commenters recommended the FAA replace proposed JS4.2405 (power or thrust control systems) and JS4.2425 (powerplant operational characteristics) with a requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2405 (automatic power or thrust control systems) and 23.2420 (reversing systems), or otherwise address those systems under the safety analysis requirements of \u00a7 23.2510. Commenters also recommended the airworthiness criteria be revised to allow the propulsion-control system to be evaluated along with the flight control system within the aircraft-level safety analyses required by \u00a7 23.2510. The FAA does not agree with these recommendations and notes that \u00a7 23.2405 and 23.2420 are not limited to functions defined in former \u00a7 23.904 and 23.933, as discussed in the preamble to part 23 amendment 23-64.[4]\nAs noted previously, the FAA agrees that for the Model JAS4-1, the engines and propellers should be considered part of the flight control system, to include at a minimum all equipment and systems used for control of pitch, roll, yaw, and vertical motion. Furthermore, the subsystem analysis required by JS4.2405 for the engine power or thrust control system does not relieve the applicant from aircraft-level requirements such as JS4.2300, \u00a7 23.2500, or 23.2510 when incorporated into a system such as the flight control system. Conversely, specific subsystem requirements, such as JS4.2405, are not imposed on other subsystems that make up a higher-level system simply because they become part of a higher-level system. The FAA did not change the proposed criteria as a result of these comments; however, as noted previously, references to the \u201creverser system\u201d in proposed JS4.2405 have not been adopted because that system is not applicable to the Model JAS4-1.\nOne commenter requested that the FAA include tilting systems in proposed JS4.2405(a). As stated in the preamble of the notice of proposed airworthiness criteria, JS4.2405 addresses nacelle rotation, which encompasses tilting systems as well as systems in which the nacelle is attached to a movable lifting surface. No changes were made to the criteria.\nMultiple commenters requested the FAA consider modifying JS4.2425(b), \u201cPowerplant Operational Characteristics,\u201d to include wording from SC-VTOL.2425(b) that would only require inflight engine shutdown and restart capability if the safety benefits outweigh the hazards. Another commenter requested clarity on JS4.2425, which requires a means for shutdown and restart of the powerplant within an established operational envelope. It does not prohibit procedures or control logic that would restrict engine restart under certain conditions. The FAA disagrees with modifying the criteria. The FAA will address the requirements of appropriate shutdown and restart procedures through the aircraft flight manual limitations and operating procedures. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter suggested the FAA change JS4.2430(a)(1) to include \u201ccontrol and management systems\u201d along with energy storage and supply systems. The FAA agrees that battery control and management systems are\n( printed page 17242)\ncovered by JS4.2430(a)(1) in addition to \u00a7 23.2525, but do not consider a change necessary as the FAA considers the term \u201cenergy storage and supply systems\u201d to include battery control and management systems. The FAA received another comment requesting to remove \u00a7 23.2525(b) as it was duplicative to JS4.2340(a)(1). The FAA does not agree with this proposal and made no changes from the comment as \u00a7 23.2525 addresses required power for intended operations for all aircraft systems that use the electrical storage system, whereas JS4.2430(a)(1) contains propulsion criteria that ensures the independence between multiple electrical storage systems providing electrical power to the propulsion system.\nCommenters requested the FAA clarify \u201cwhere the exposure to lightning is likely\u201d in JS4.2430(a)(2), which they believe could be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation suggested by commenters is to consider \u201clikely\u201d as it applies to areas of the aircraft where lightning may strike, while another interpretation is in reference to operating environments where lightning is likely. The FAA agrees with this concern and has revised the airworthiness criteria by removing the phrase \u201cwhere the exposure to lightning is likely.\u201d The FAA notes that JS4.2430(a)(2) and \u00a7 35.38 assume the aircraft will be exposed to lightning regardless of any environmental operating limitations and require protection of the energy system from catastrophic events. The applicant will show compliance with JS4.2430(a)(2) for the Model JAS4-1 consistent with other type certificated products by identifying areas of the powered-lift where direct attachment of lightning is \u201clikely,\u201d along with evaluating the resulting effects.\nThe FAA received a comment asking the FAA to consider the failure due to overload of the landing system in JS4.2430(a)(6). The Model JAS4-1 is not required to address specific failures due to overload of the landing system since its landing system is not located near its energy storage systems. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nThe FAA received a comment requesting that airworthiness criteria be added to protect occupants from possible hazards from the energy systems. The FAA notes that proposed JS4.2430(a)(6), as written, covers this and therefore did not make changes as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA also received a comment recommending that JS4.2430(a)(6) be expanded to include minimizing hazards to emergency service responders in addition to occupants. The FAA concurs with this suggestion and adds first responders to the airworthiness criteria.\nCommenters requested the FAA explain the reservation of proposed JS4.2430(a)(7) and JS4.2430(c)(2). A commenter also recommended the FAA adopt EASA SC-VTOL.2430(a)(7) and add it as JS4.2430(a)(7) to ensure appropriate power quality within the energy system. The FAA did not incorporate the requirements from 23.2430(a)(7), which are similar to the requirements from EASA SC-VTOL.2430(a)(7), or (c)(2) into the Model JAS4-1 proposed criteria, and instead listed them as \u201cReserved,\u201d because they cover physical contamination of stored energy. Stored electrical energy is not susceptible to physical contamination in the way that convention fuel is. Damaged or failed electrical storage and distribution systems may prevent delivery of stored electrical energy to an intended load, which is a different condition than contaminated energy. The FAA notes these concerns are covered by uninterrupted energy supply and fluctuation requirements under JS4.2430(a)(4). To avoid confusion, the FAA did not adopt the proposal to \u201creserve\u201d paragraphs JS4.2430(a)(7) and (c)(2) and renumbered (c)(3) accordingly.\nThe FAA received a comment that likely hazards for energy systems are not limited to temperature influences as mentioned in JS4.2430(b)(2). The FAA agrees and did not adopt the qualifier \u201cdue to unintended temperature influences\u201d in these final airworthiness criteria.\nSeveral commenters suggested clarification on the application of system safety requirements, propulsion requirements, and flight control system requirements due to the integration of these functions on the aircraft. The commenters questioned whether power or thrust control system requirements need to be applied to flight control systems or if flight control system requirements need to be applied to power or thrust control systems. The FAA concurs with the commenters' request to consider the engines and propellers part of the flight control system. The flight control system includes, at a minimum, all equipment and systems used for control of pitch, roll, yaw, and vertical motion. The FAA notes that the subsystem analysis required by JS4.2405 for the engine power or thrust control system does not relieve the applicant from higher-level requirements such as those in JS4.2300, \u00a7 23.2500, or \u00a7 23.2510, when engine or thrust control systems are incorporated into a higher-level system such as the flight control system. Conversely, specific subsystem requirements such as JS4.2405 would not be imposed on other subsystems that make up a higher-level system simply because they become part of that higher-level system. The safety requirements in \u00a7 23.2510 apply at the aircraft level to the integrated functions of all systems on the aircraft, in addition to specific system requirements such as JS4.2300 and JS4.2405.\nSeveral commenters expressed concern regarding the appropriateness of the system-level safety objectives in proposed JS4.2405 and \u00a7 23.2425 for such highly integrated systems. The commenters suggested JS4.2405 and JS4.2425 are not necessary, since compliance with \u00a7 23.2510 can require the applicant to define both system and aircraft level safety objectives.\nThe FAA recognizes there may be inconsistencies between safety objectives required at the powerplant installation level and those at the aircraft level, but notes this is the case for type certificated airplanes and rotorcraft. Existing powerplant rules define a minimum level of safety that permits certification of a broad range of products for single and multi-engine aircraft. One common requirement for powerplant installations has been the \u201cno single failure\u201d concept, which is practically applied given the number of engines installed. This concept remains critical even for highly integrated and distributed powerplant systems. Aircraft level safety objectives may not drive the level of safety typically provided in a powerplant installation, such as isolation between all engines on a multi-engine aircraft with more than two engines, so the powerplant requirements establish a minimum safety objective that may not always align with those at the aircraft level. As powered-lift and distributed propulsion systems evolve, there may be less need to capture powerplant installation unique safety requirements. Until then, the FAA will use JS4.2405 to capture those requirements for the Model JAS4-1 and ensure the powerplant installation level of safety is appropriate regardless of the aircraft level safety objectives.\nMultiple commenters requested clarification regarding the definition of \u201cenergy\u201d and the instances in the criteria where liquid fuel is still relevant, despite the consideration of electric propulsion systems. The term \u201cfuel\u201d is used in part 23 and includes any form of energy used by an engine or powerplant installation, such as provided by carbon-based fuels or\n( printed page 17243)\nelectrical potential.[5]\nThe FAA recognizes that using the term \u201cfuel\u201d instead of \u201cenergy\u201d has implied the criteria are limited to non-fossil-fuel-based propulsion systems and is inconsistent with language used by other airworthiness authorities. As such, the FAA has replaced the term \u201cfuel\u201d with \u201cenergy\u201d throughout these Model JAS4-1 airworthiness criteria. The FAA notes that \u201cenergy\u201d includes any form of energy, including carbon-based fuels, electrical potential, and other means of energy storage or power generation for propulsion.\nSeveral commenters requested that the FAA revise proposed JS4.2400(b) to clarify that the Model JAS4-1 engines and propellers will not be individually issued type certificates, but rather approved under the aircraft's type certificate, and as such, any requirements mentioning the \u201ctype certificate\u201d should be excluded. The FAA agrees and has revised JS4.2400(b) to remove the requirement that each engine and propeller installed on the Model JAS4-1 have a type certificate.\nThe FAA received comments to add \u201cpropeller\u201d to JS4.2400(c) and specifically mention \u201cpropeller vibration\u201d in JS4.2400(c)(4). The FAA does not agree. Powerplant installation as defined in JS4.2400(a) includes all components for propulsion, which includes propellers. Thus, propeller vibration and fatigue are covered by the requirement in JS4.2400(c)(4). No changes are necessary as a result of the comments.\nThe FAA received a comment to distinguish between airplane and engine hazards in JS4.2400(e). The requirement in JS4.2400(e) addresses powerplant components at the aircraft level. Engines are one of many powerplant components installed at the aircraft level, each of which must meet any limitations or installation instruction provided with that component or be shown to not to create a hazard. Engine specific hazards for the Model JS4-1 are found in subpart H of the airworthiness criteria. The FAA disagrees that the distinction requested by the commenter is necessary, and no changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received comments requesting the FAA either remove \u00a7 23.2525(c) and modify JS4.2430(a)(3) to explicitly include energy storage systems, or revise \u00a7 23.2525(c) to remove the primary source failure consideration. The FAA disagrees. Section 23.2525 addresses required power considering the failures and malfunctions of the primary source at the aircraft level, whereas the requirements in JS4.2430(a)(3) are specific to energy systems used for propulsion. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nSystem Safety\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from ASDIA, AIBOT, Airbus, ALPA, EASA, End State Solutions, GAMA, Lilium, Odys, Vertical Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, TCCA, UKCAA, Volocopter, and individual commenters requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to system safety and cybersecurity requirements for the Model JAS4-1.\nSeveral commenters cited differences between EASA's SC-VTOL and the proposed FAA airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 with regard to EASA's creation of a \u201cCategory Enhanced\u201d set of requirements. EASA included a structural requirement in SC-VTOL.2250, \u201cDesign and construction principles,\u201d that for Category Enhanced a single failure must not have a catastrophic effect upon the aircraft. The FAA acknowledges that the airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 as a special class aircraft differ from the requirements in EASA's SC-VTOL, which is a set of generalized requirements intended to cover a class of aircraft. The FAA's long-standing technical practice manages risk due to structural failures through the use of critical or life-limited parts, which mitigates any need to address potential catastrophic structural failure modes under the system safety requirements of \u00a7 23.2510. While this practice differs from that of EASA's approach, the FAA finds both approaches comparable and acceptable for risk mitigation. As discussed previously, the FAA revised proposed \u00a7 23.2250(c) (now JS4.2250(c)) to add a requirement that single failures must not result in a catastrophic effect upon the aircraft.\nOne commenter requested the FAA adopt language from \u00a7 29.953(a)(2) to require that the energy system allow power to be supplied to each powerplant through a system independent of those parts of each system supplying energy to other powerplants. The FAA does not concur that this addition is necessary or appropriate. Proposed JS4.2430(a)(1) and (a)(3) were derived from \u00a7 27.953 for multi-engine normal category rotorcraft and \u00a7 23.953(a) for multi-engine normal category airplanes and are appropriate to address the issue of energy loads required for propulsion for the Model JAS4-1. The FAA notes that these sections capture the intent of what the commenter seeks to address by incorporating \u00a7 29.953, which is applicable to transport category rotorcraft. Section 23.2525(c) ensures power remains available for essential loads to supply other critical systems.\nSeveral commenters identified that these criteria do not include specific failure condition probability targets or required development assurance level criteria and requested that they be included with appropriate rationale. The FAA does not agree, as existing aircraft airworthiness standards (parts 23, 25, 27, and 29) also do not prescribe specific failure condition probability targets or development assurance level criteria. This guidance may be found in advisory circulars or industry consensus standards, which provide one means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with the regulatory requirements. These means will likely need to be modified to consider powered-lift designs such as the Model JAS4-1.\nOne commenter recommended the FAA revise the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2510 to include a clarification on the applicability of the standard, as it pertains to systems and equipment installed in the aircraft and how it relates to other requirements contained in other sections of the airworthiness standards. The FAA disagrees. The FAA proposed that the Model JAS4-1 comply with \u00a7 23.2510 without modification because the FAA intentionally developed that rule as a regulation of general requirements that do not supersede any requirements contained in other part 23 sections. The FAA intends the same application for the Model JAS4-1.\nSeveral commenters expressed concern over the absence of a \u201cno single failure\u201d catastrophic failure condition criteria in these airworthiness criteria, citing its inclusion in EASA SC-VTOL.2510(a)(1). The FAA does not agree that a specific requirement prohibiting catastrophic single failures is necessary in the airworthiness criteria. Existing parts 23, 25, 26, and 29 airworthiness standards do not contain a \u201cno single failure\u201d requirement for catastrophic failure conditions, and the FAA consider these longstanding existing airworthiness standards acceptable. Although preventing \u201csingle failures\u201d is addressed in FAA guidance material (\ne.g.,\nAdvisory Circulars 25.1309-1A and Advisory Circular 27-1B), it is one means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with the regulatory requirements. The FAA intends the same application for the Model JAS4-1.\n( printed page 17244)\nSeveral commenters recommended the FAA clarify requirements for addressing cybersecurity. The FAA is addressing cybersecurity through JS4.1529 and \u00a7 23.2500, \u00a7 23.2505 and \u00a7 23.2510. The FAA concurs that these aircraft involve many new technologies which are highly integrated, and any cybersecurity vulnerabilities must be appropriately assessed and addressed through an accepted means of compliance. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nLightning Protection\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from EASA, GAMA, Lilium, Overair, and TCCA requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria intended to address hazards that may result from a lightning attachment on the Model JAS4-1. These requirements include consideration for lightning common cause effects due to the potential for simultaneously affecting multiple systems. The proposed airworthiness criteria considered inadvertent exposure to lightning producing environments, including flight into clouds, as well as cold or icy weather conditions. The FAA determined that the highly integrated systems of the Model JAS4-1 aircraft require lightning protection.\nOne commenter requested the FAA clarify why the lightning indirect effects requirements are not applicable to systems with major failure conditions. The FAA notes that the lightning requirements are intended to be applicable to systems with major failure conditions for aircraft approved for IFR operations. For aircraft approved for IFR operations, proposed JS4.2515(b) is applicable to systems with hazardous or major failure conditions, similar to \u00a7 27.1316(b).\nMultiple commenters recommended the FAA revert proposed JS4.2515 to \u00a7 23.2515 to limit the applicability of lightning requirements to aircraft approved for IFR operations that cannot show exposure to lightning is unlikely. The Model JAS4-1 incorporates systems that are critical in VFR and IFR operations that require protection against indirect effects of a lightning strike. A lightning attachment may occur during flight, when operating through or in the vicinity of lightning producing environments. Aircraft operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) may encounter lightning, and aircraft operating in day or night visual meteorological conditions may inadvertently encounter lightning producing environments such as flight into clouds and freezing or icy weather conditions. Systems that perform functions essential to CSFL must demonstrate immunity to lightning for all operations to achieve the intended safety objectives for catastrophic failure conditions. The FAA finds the requirements in JS4.2515 to be appropriate for the systems on the Model JAS4-1 and made no changes as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment asking for clarification of JS4.2515(a)(2), stating that it could be incorrectly interpreted as the system could be allowed to fail when exposed to lightning without recovery after exposure. The FAA does not agree that JS4.2515(a)(2) may be misinterpreted. Demonstration of lightning immunity is required for systems with catastrophic failure conditions. The exception for recovery conflicts in JS4.2515(a)(2) is based on aircraft operational or functional requirements independent of lightning exposure. The expectation is that a system recovers normal operation of a function without impact to safety of flight by design. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nMultiple commenters recommended the FAA consider whether systems with hazardous and major failure conditions must meet lightning requirements for aircraft not approved for IFR operations. The FAA notes that aircraft not approved for IFR operations are restricted from flight into IMC and must use outside visual references. An aircraft operating in IMC may encounter lightning producing environments, a hazard which requires more stringent requirements than for aircraft certified exclusively for VFR operations. Limiting JS4.2515(b) to IFR operations therefore maintains the level of safety intended for protection against lightning threats. Section JS4.2515(b) is applicable to IFR operations and systems with hazardous (level B) or major (level C) failure conditions. Section JS4.2515(a) is applicable to all operations and systems with catastrophic failure conditions. This approach achieves the intended safety objectives.\nCommenters recommended deleting the word \u201csignificantly\u201d from the text of JS4.2515(b) so that the requirement is clearly identified as applicable to electrical and electronic systems with hazardous and major failure conditions. The FAA concurs since JS4.2515(b) is applicable to IFR operations and systems with hazardous or major failure conditions. The FAA did not adopt the term \u201csignificantly\u201d from proposed JS4.2515(b) to ensure both major and hazardous failure conditions are appropriately assessed.\nHIRF\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from EASA, Overair, and TCCA requesting the FAA revise, remove, and clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to HIRF exposure.\nCommenters requested consideration for HIRF common cause effects due to the potential of affecting multiple systems simultaneously, since radio frequency transmitters are continuously evolving, and future spectrum expansions are anticipated. The FAA agrees that the HIRF environment and sources are unpredictable and that the aircraft and highly integrated systems require robust HIRF protection, but considers the proposed requirements adequate to address this concern.\nOne commenter requested the FAA clarify why operation under IFR is considered to relax the HIRF requirements, but not the lightning criteria. Another commenter requested the FAA clarify why the HIRF requirements are not applicable to systems with major failure conditions. Several commenters also requested the FAA remove the limitation that \u00a7 23.2520(b) be only applicable for aircraft approved for IFR operations, similar to SC-VTOL.2520(b).\nThe FAA notes that proposed JS4.2515 and JS4.2420 provide consistent requirements for the protection of electrical and electronic systems from the effects of lightning and HIRF, respectively. The FAA does not concur that the HIRF requirements are relaxed for IFR. JS4.2520(a) is applicable for all operations and systems with catastrophic failure conditions, aligned with JS4.2515(a). Limiting JS4.2520(b) to IFR operations maintains an acceptable level of safety, as JS4.2520(b) is intended to be applicable to systems with hazardous or major failure conditions. This also aligns with similar requirements in JS4.2515(b) for lightning. The FAA did not adopt the term \u201csignificantly\u201d from proposed JS4.2420(b), similar to JS4.2515(b), to ensure that major and hazardous failure conditions are appropriately assessed for HIRF as well as for lightning. This approach achieves the intended safety objectives and aligns the airworthiness criteria with the appropriate level of safety intended by utilizing appropriate standards from both parts 23 and part 27, revised to be appropriate for the Model JAS4-1.\nEquipment\nAIBOT provided a comment that requirements demarcate lighting patterns subject to flight modes such as\n( printed page 17245)\nvertical takeoff and landing or fixed-wing operation. The FAA disagrees. FAA lighting requirements for the Model JAS4-1 are defined in \u00a7 23.2530, consistent with requirements for normal category airplanes.\nFlightcrew Interface\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from ALPA, EASA, GAMA, Lilium, Odys, Overair, and TCCA requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to flightcrew interface requirements on the Model JAS4-1.\nThe FAA received comments requesting that the FAA replace the language in JS4.2600(a) and (b) with the language in \u00a7 23.2600(a) and (b). The Model JAS4-1 is capable of using one or more sources of lift to perform a particular phase of flight. Therefore, using the unchanged wording from \u00a7 23.2600(a) is not sufficient and does not include hover. JS4.2000 incudes definitions for \u201csources of lift\u201d and \u201cphases of flight,\u201d and those defined terms were used in proposed JS4.2600(a). The FAA included \u201cwithout excessive concentration, skill, alertness, or fatigue\u201d in proposed JS4.2600(b) to address the human factors elements used to control the aircraft. The Model JAS4-1 includes increased levels of automation and technology that may impact pilot concentration, alertness, and fatigue, so the inclusion of \u201cwithout excessive concentration, skill, alertness, or fatigue\u201d language is necessary. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment to restructure the header paragraph of JS4.2620 such that the manufacturer must present pertinent information for the aircraft for all possible configurations of thrust or flight. The FAA disagrees as the requirement is applicable to the overall aircraft and must contain information concerning aircraft configurations as necessary for defining the required information in JS4.2620. No change is necessary as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter requested clarification on procedures for the flightcrew following an abnormal battery anomaly. The FAA notes that JS4.2620(a)(5) addresses this concern by requiring information necessary for safe operation because of design, operating, or handling characteristics to be specified in the Airplane Flight Manual, which provides procedural guidance for flightcrew. Procedures following an abnormal battery anomaly are necessary for safe operation. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter requested that the FAA include JS4.2620(a)(5) as information that must be approved by the FAA. The FAA disagrees, as this requirement is consistent with the existing airworthiness standards for normal category aircraft. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter requested clarification on whether the requirements in JS4.1529 (ICA) and JS4.2615 (flight, navigation, and powerplant instruments) would also address EASA SC-VTOL.2445, Lift/thrust system installation information. Although the Model JAS4-1 airworthiness criteria do not contain a requirement that directly aligns with EASA's SC-VTOL.2445, the commenter is correct that JS4.1529 and JS4.2615 address the lift/thrust installation requirements in EASA SC VTOL.2445. In addition, the lift/thrust installation requirements in EASA SC-VTOL.2445 would be addressed for the Model JAS4-1 by the requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 23.2605 and 23.2610.\nThe FAA received multiple comments to modify \u00a7 23.2605 to add a requirement that information related to safety equipment must be easily identifiable and its method of operation must be clearly marked, as specified in SC-VTOL.2605(d). The language requested by the commenters is already required by \u00a7 23.2535 and therefore no changes are necessary as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter requested the FAA revise JS4.2615(b)(2) to delete criteria for single failure and probability. The FAA does not agree and notes that this requirement is essential for CSFL after probable failures, both singular and in combination.\nElectric Engines\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from Airbus, EASA, GAMA, JCAB, Lilium, MTLS, Odys, Overair, Rolls-Royce, TCCA, Vertical Aerospace, Volocopter and an individual commenter requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to electric engines for the Model JAS4-1.\nOne commenter recommended replacing the phrase \u201cintended aircraft application\u201d throughout subpart H with language specific to the Model JAS4-1 design. Another commenter recommended replacing \u201cdeclared environmental limits\u201d with \u201caircraft environmental and operating limitations\u201d throughout subpart H. The FAA does not agree that more specific language is necessary, as \u201cintended aircraft application\u201d and \u201cdeclared environmental limits\u201d are sufficient to meet the electric engine certification requirements. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received comments recommending the removal of \u00a7 33.5 (a), (b), and (c) and \u00a7 33.29 from the engine requirements in Subpart H. One commenter stated these requirements should not be imposed for an engine that is not being type certificated as an independent product, as is the case for the Model JAS4-1. This commenter also stated the engines for the Model JAS4-1 are being certified under the umbrella of the aircraft type certificate; as a result, the installation and operating instructions will already be part of the type design data package at the aircraft level. Other commenters stated that no additional burden from individual \u201cengine-only\u201d requirements for data sheet content is necessary, from \u00a7 33.5(a), (b), and (c), JS4.2702, JS4.2706, JS4.2710(j)(2), JS4.2718(c) and (d), JS4.2719(b) and (e), and JS4.2733(d)(2). The FAA recognizes the engines will be approved with the Model JAS4-1 aircraft, but instructions for installing and operating the engines are required, as well as other engine airframe interfaces such as instruments, connections, sensors, etc., whether the engines are approved with the aircraft or certificated under their own type certificate. The FAA made no changes in response to these recommendations.\nThe FAA received comments on the applicability of subsystems equipment installed in an electric hybrid propulsion system (EHPS), as referenced in EASA Special Condition E-19 EHPS.330. The FAA acknowledges these comments but notes that they are not applicable to the Model JAS4-1, since the Joby engine architecture does not include the electric hybrid propulsions systems associated with E-19 EHPS.330.\nOne commenter questioned whether the requirements of EASA Special Condition E-19 EHPS.80, which accounts for the complete inability to isolate components that could cause a hazard to aircraft, should be added to airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1. The FAA does not agree, as the requirement to isolate components that could cause a hazard to the aircraft is in EHPS.350(d), EHPS Control System, not in EHPS.80. The requirement in EHPS.350 raised by the commenter is addressed by JS4.2710 Engine Control Systems, JS4.2717 Safety Analysis, and JS4.2733 Engine Electrical Systems. Since the Joby JAS4-1 is a special class aircraft and the engines will be approved with the aircraft, the means by which components prevent a hazard from developing may be implemented\n( printed page 17246)\neither at the engine-level or at the aircraft-level. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nAnother commenter noted the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 33.75(e)(1) includes a reference to \u00a7 33.4 (ICA), although the proposed airworthiness criteria do not include a requirement to comply with \u00a7 33.4. The commenter recommended either removing the reference to \u00a7 33.4 or adding a reference to Appendix 1, \u00a7\u00a7 AJS4.2701, A33.2, A33.3, and A33.4. The FAA agrees with the comment. The FAA proposed JS4.2717 to include those safety analysis standards from \u00a7 33.75 that could not be required directly for the Model JAS4-1 without modification. Proposed JS4.2717(c) contained requirements for how the applicant must comply with \u00a7 33.75(e). The FAA has modified proposed JS4.2717(c) to reference the ICA in JS4.1529 for compliance with \u00a7 33.75(e)(1).\nThe FAA received a comment asking for clarification of the term \u201cduty cycle\u201d in JS4.2702(b). The FAA also received a comment to remove the requirement in JS4.2702(b) to list the duty cycle on the type certificate data sheet. The FAA disagrees. A duty cycle is intrinsic with engine ratings. Engine ratings are declared to support aircraft performance objectives, whereas duty cycles are an electric engine property that limits the usage of the ratings. The duty cycle, combined with the rating at that duty cycle, establishes the capability and the limits for engine usage. A commenter also noted that the takeoff power time limitation is not defined. A duty cycle and rating at each duty cycle must be declared, which covers this concern. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA received a comment to add specific operating limits to JS4.2702. The FAA also received a comment to add \u00a7 33.7(d) to the airworthiness criteria to address the accuracy of the engine control system and necessary instrumentation. Section 33.7(d) applies to engine performance and operating limitations. The FAA did not propose to require that the Model JAS4-1 comply with \u00a7 33.7(d), because \u00a7 33.7(d) focuses on engine control system components (\ne.g.,\nspeed sensors, actuators, feedback mechanisms) that typically operate using low voltage power and hydraulic systems. Electric engines, such as those that are part of the Model JAS4-1 design, are controlled differently. In addition, the Model JAS4-1 engine electrical systems are integrated with aircraft systems instruments that are necessary for control of the engine, which would not be addressed by \u00a7 33.7(d). Instead, for the Model JAS4-1, the engine performance and operating limitations referenced by \u00a7 33.7(d) are addressed by the airworthiness criteria for the engine control system in JS4.2710 and the engine electrical system in JS4.2733. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nThe FAA also received a comment that JS4.2702 provided a redundant definition of the engine ratings with that in \u00a7 33.8. The FAA disagrees. These two engine requirements accomplish different objectives. JS4.2702 establishes the engine's ratings and limits, while \u00a7 33.8 ensures each rating applies to the lowest power that all engines of the same type may be expected to produce under the conditions used to determine that rating. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter suggested the FAA remove the word \u201cturbine\u201d from \u00a7 33.17(a), as it is not applicable to the Joby Model JAS4-1. The FAA notes that proposed JS4.2704, \u201cFire Protection,\u201d was initially drafted to consider potential arc-fault-initiated fires occurring anywhere inside or outside the electric engine. However, the commenter highlighted that the second statement in \u00a7 33.17(a) specifically applies to internal fires in turbine engines and is not relevant to Joby engines. Consequently, the FAA has modified the airworthiness criteria to remove the applicability of \u00a7 33.17(a) to the Model JAS4-1 and add a new statement to JS4.2704 emphasizing the design and construction requirements to minimize the occurrence and spread of fire during normal operation and failure conditions. This modification results in JS4.2704 having two paragraphs, (a) and (b). This modification makes a suggestion by another commenter to change the title of the airworthiness criteria to \u201cHigh Voltage Arc Faults and Fire Protection\u201d inapplicable.\nThe FAA received a comment questioning the applicability of \u00a7 33.17(b) through (g), which address flammable fluids. The FAA notes that flammable fluids and flammable fluid storage components could be used in the Model JAS4-1 design. As such, the FAA finds these criteria applicable, and no changes were made.\nThe FAA received a comment that pass and fail criteria should be defined for the requirement in JS4.2705 to minimize the development of an unsafe condition in the engine and recommended using the criteria in JS4.2717(d)(2). The FAA does not concur. An unsafe condition is determined by a risk assessment and not solely by the hazards identified by the hazardous effects in JS4.2717(d)(2). No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA also received a comment to add \u201cremoval from service\u201d to the maintenance actions in proposed JS4.2705. The FAA disagrees. The statement \u201cremoval from service\u201d is appropriate to address simple engine designs that are life limited. However, this statement is not needed in the Model JAS4-1 airworthiness criteria because any maintenance involving a life limited engine is addressed by JS4.2729(b) and JS4.2713. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received two comments requesting clarification regarding whether proposed JS4.2729 (b) allows the applicant the option of not performing the teardown inspection. The FAA clarifies that the agency intends JS4.2729(b) to require a teardown inspection except for any engine parts or components that cannot be torn down. The FAA has changed proposed JS4.2729(b) to clarify that it only applies to engine components where a teardown cannot be performed in a non-destructive manner.\nA commenter requested clarification on the difference between the durability requirements of JS4.2705 and JS4.2726. JS4.2705 is criteria for durability requirements for design and construction of the engine, whereas JS4.2726 provides requirements for a durability demonstration. The FAA modified JS4.2726 to distinguish it from JS4.2705 by explaining its purpose, which is to establish when the initial maintenance is required.\nA commenter questioned where the requirements in EASA's E-19 EHPS.200 are captured. The FAA notes that \u00a7 33.23 establishes the loads associated with the engine mounting attachments and structure similar to what would be expected under EHPS.200 for an electric engine such as in the Model JAS4-1. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nMultiple commenters requested clarification on JS4.2709 concerning failure conditions leading to rotor overspeed. JS4.2709 was based on \u00a7 33.27 \u201cTurbine, Compressor, Fan, and Turbosupercharger Rotor Overspeed.\u201d The FAA intended the approach used for establishing the highest possible rotor overspeed in proposed JS4.2709 to be consistent with the approach in \u00a7 33.27(b), except for the prescriptive overspeed margins. The margins in \u00a7 33.27(b) are based on the physics of what drives the rotors in turbine engines and turbosupercharger rotors. The mechanisms that can drive electric engines to an overspeed condition are different from those that govern\n( printed page 17247)\ncombustion engines. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter suggested that JS4.2710(a) should refer to engine operations as well as engine tilting devices unless engine control systems are linked to one engine. The FAA notes that JS4.2710 addresses individual engines used in the Joby distributed propulsion system; however, the FAA identified an error in JS4.2710(j)(2), which was originally intended to cover all engine electrical systems, leading to confusion regarding the applicability in paragraph (a). The FAA clarifies that the engine control requirements in JS4.2710 apply to any aspects of the engine control that interface with aircraft control systems that are necessary for safe flight and landing. The FAA has corrected this error in the final criteria by removing the reference to electrical power supplied to the aircraft by energy regeneration from paragraph (j)(2).\nOne commenter recommended that the pertinent characteristics and capabilities of the Model JAS4-1 that the applicant must analyze should be prescriptively included in JS4.2710(g) and JS4.2717(e). The FAA does not agree that all the pertinent aircraft details that must be analyzed under JS4.2710(g) and JS4.2717(e) should be prescribed within the airworthiness criteria as existing aircraft airworthiness standards also do not prescribe these pertinent aircraft details. This guidance may be found in advisory circulars or industry consensus standards, which provide one means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with the existing regulatory requirements. These means will likely need to be modified to consider powered-lift designs such as the Model JAS4-1.\nOne commenter recommended that the FAA clarify that JS4.2710(i)(2) be applicable throughout the flight envelope. The FAA agrees that JS4.2710(i)(2), which requires the engine control system be able to detect and accommodate any single failure related to the aircraft-supplied data as specified in JS4.2710(i), is applicable throughout the flight envelope. However, the FAA did not make any changes as a result of this comment, as JS4.2710(d) already specifies that the engine control system must perform the intended functions, throughout the declared operational envelope. This includes the control system requirements in JS4.2710(i)(2) and will be captured as part of the aircraft's approved flight envelope.\nThe FAA received a comment to update JS4.2710(e) to declare the engine control system and the engine electrical environmental limits, similar to JS4.2823(a)(2). This concern is already addressed by the airworthiness criteria. Since the engines are approved with the aircraft, environmental conditions and limits that were used to substantiate the Model JAS4-1 aircraft and its engines will be used to develop compliance with JS4.2620, \u201cAircraft Flight Manual.\u201d No changes were made to JS4.2710(e) as a result of this comment. However, this comment revealed a need to clarify the requirement in proposed JS4.2727. The purpose of JS4.2727 is to supplement engine testing with additional component-level and systems-level tests that expose engine components and systems to operational conditions that cannot not be achieved in the engine test environment or with the specified test duration. Also, demonstration shortfalls for certain electrical properties might occur with other engine tests, such as the durability demonstration, because the test duration required to show deterioration in electrical hardware may be impracticable.\nOne commenter requested the FAA remove proposed JS4.2711(b)(2), which specifies that the aircraft design is not required to enable the flight crew to monitor the engine cooling system for a cooling system failure that would not result in a hazardous engine effect. The FAA disagrees. Removing proposed JS4.2711(b)(2) would result in a requirement for instrumentation enabling the flightcrew to monitor the engine cooling system regardless of the hazard level resulting from a cooling system failure. Although monitoring the engine cooling system would enable the crew to respond to leading indicators to an overheated engine and prevent the aircraft from the subsequent effects, the severity of the effects from an overheated engine, and the appropriate engine-level protection and mitigation standards are addressed by the engine safety analysis. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nOne commenter suggested changing the word \u201celectromagnetic\u201d to \u201celectrical\u201d in proposed JS4.2712(a). The FAA does not concur with this change, as electrical system hazards are covered in JS4.2733. However, the FAA acknowledges that the requirement in proposed JS4.2712(a) could be clarified and made changes to that effect.\nMultiple commenters recommended adding the demonstration to operate above temperature limits on turbine engines for short-duration ratings in JS4.2724, and to consider updating JS4.2709 and JS4.2730 to add the requirements in E-19 EHPS.250(a), \u201cthe failure of any rotating component or part of an equipment, electric engine or generator must not lead to the release of high energy debris.\u201d The FAA has revised JS4.2724 to remove its applicability to all engine ratings and also revised the introductory text of JS4.2730 to be more aligned with part 33 subpart B. The FAA did not find the recommended language appropriate for JS4.2709 and did not make any changes to JS4.2709.\nThe FAA received a comment asking for clarification on whether JS4.2715(c) only applies to engines having torque operating limitations. JS4.2715(c) applies to an electric engine regardless of whether the engine is torque limited. Joby can propose ratings and limits in accordance with JS4.2702 using relevant engine parameters such as horsepower, torque, rotational speed, and temperature. JS4.2715 and JS4.2725 require tests that range from ground idle and flight idle, to the rated power or thrust prescribed by these rules. Electric engines can create torque much faster than combustion engines, and sudden changes in torque could present a hazard to the aircraft installation. Therefore, the power response characteristics must account the intended aircraft application to ensure the torque characteristics of the engine and intended aircraft are compatible. These requirements correspond to \u00a7 33.73 and \u00a7 33.89 respectively, so the minimum torque or power settings are established in the procedures that assess the operational capabilities of the electric engines. The FAA modified proposed JS4.2715(c) to clarify that this is an engine-level requirement.\nOne commenter requested the FAA consider EASA's Special Condition E-19 EHPS.260. The commenter states that proposed JS4.2716 only addresses hazardous engine effects and applicants should evaluate, as required by EHPS.260, the effects of any continued rotation on the system, such as windmilling propellers. The concerns raised by the commenter are addressed by JS4.2733, \u201cEngine Electrical Systems.\u201d JS4.2733(b) (both proposed and final) ensures that the generation and transmission of electrical power, and electrical load shedding, do not result in any unacceptable engine operating characteristics or cause the engine to exceed its operating limits. New JS4.2733 (e)(2) requires the characteristics of any electrical power supplied from the engine to the aircraft via energy regeneration to be identified and declared in the engine installation manual.\nOne commenter requested clarification on the applicability of JS4.2717(a) and (c). The FAA notes that JS4.2717(a) is necessary because\n( printed page 17248)\n\u00a7 33.75(a)(1) and (a)(2), which are required as part of these airworthiness criteria, refer to hazardous engine effects as defined in \u00a7 33.75(g). Similarly, JS4.2717(c) is necessary because \u00a7 33.75(d) and (e), which are required as part of these airworthiness criteria, also refer to hazardous engine effects. When showing compliance with \u00a7 33.75(a)(1), (a)(2), (d), and (e), Joby must use the definitions in JS4.2717(d) in lieu of the definitions in \u00a7 33.75(g), as stated in JS4.2717(a) and (c). No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received multiple comments to change the proposed definition of a minor engine effect in JS4.2717(d)(1). The commenters recommended using the criteria in \u00a7 33.75(g)(1) to classify the effects of a partial or total loss of engine power in the Model JAS4-1. The Model JAS4-1 engine airworthiness criteria do not classify the engine effect from a complete loss of engine power because the aircraft level assumptions are different than those used in \u00a7 33.75(g)(1). The Model JAS4-1 engine airworthiness criteria allow a complete loss of power in one engine to be classified based on the effects on the aircraft. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nMultiple commenters stated that due to the integrated nature of the Model JAS4-1, the system safety analyses required in support of \u00a7 23.2510 are adequate and sufficient, and that \u00a7 33.75, JS4.2717, and JS4.2733(f) and (g) should be removed from these airworthiness criteria. The FAA does not agree with this recommendation, and notes that \u00a7 23.2510 establishes the safety objective for aircraft systems and equipment \u201cwhose failure or abnormal operation has not been specifically addressed by another requirement.\u201d The proposed subpart H and I requirements include specific engine and propeller design and testing requirements not covered under aircraft-level airworthiness criteria and establish a minimum level of safety equivalent to the existing part 33 and part 35 airworthiness standards as required under \u00a7 21.17(b). Additionally, these airworthiness criteria prescribe the same requirements for installed engines and propellers on the Model JAS4-1 that would apply to these engines and propellers if they received separate type certificates under parts 33 and 35, respectively. The aircraft-level requirements of \u00a7 23.2510 are not sufficient on their own to ensure engines and propellers will meet the intended level of safety required by \u00a7 21.17(b) for parts 33 and 35. Since the engines will be approved with the Joby aircraft, these compliance details may be documented in the appropriate aircraft-level documents with references to the engine-level requirements in Subpart H.\nOne commenter recommended removing the prescriptive airworthiness criteria of subparts H and I and to defer their development to the means of compliance. Another commenter proposed to use performance-based aircraft requirements that consign the engines and propellers to aircraft equipment or systems and relegate engine and propeller certification requirements to a means of compliance to an aircraft requirement. The FAA does not agree with these comments and considers the requirements in subparts H and I to provide an equivalent level of safety for the Model JAS4-1. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nA commenter requested the FAA reword proposed JS4.2717(d)(1) to remove an extraneous phrase \u201cdoes not prohibit the engine from meeting its type-design requirements.\u201d The FAA concurs that the phrase was unclear and updated JS4.2717(d)(1) for clarity.\nA commenter requested clarification regarding why blockage of a cooling system as described in JS4.2717(d)(2)(ii) is considered a hazardous engine effect. The FAA notes that the blockage of a cooling system is not by itself a hazardous engine condition, but it could contribute to the development of one. Accordingly, the FAA modified JS4.2717(d)(2)(ii).\nA commenter requested the FAA align JS4.2713 with the safety expectations in EASA's SC-VTOL. The commenter recommended changing JS4.2713 to specify that no single failure may lead to a catastrophic event and to exclude the criteria for critical parts. The FAA does not find the level of safety outlined in SC-VTOL for \u201cCategory Enhanced\u201d to be applicable to the Model JSA4-1 engine failure classifications, which could be minor, major, or hazardous, but not catastrophic. The FAA will apply failure classifications that are consistent with those established in part 33 to provide the equivalent level of safety required by \u00a7 21.17(b). No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter requested clarification as to whether JS4.2713 would require the same activity for both critical parts and life-limited parts. An engineering plan, manufacturing plan, and service management plan will be needed for critical parts and for life-limited parts as stated in JS4.2713(b).\nCommenters requested the FAA clarify what is meant by the definition of a \u201clife limited part\u201d in proposed JS4.2713(a)(2), as it includes phrases that make it open-ended and indistinguishable from the definition of a critical part in JS4.2713(a)(1). The FAA agrees regarding the need for clarification in the definition of life-limited parts. While retaining the examples in the definition, the FAA has revised the definition of life-limited part in JS4.2713(a)(2) to be distinguished by the failure mode related to low-cycle fatigue mechanisms. The revised definition specifies that life-limited parts may involve rotors or major structural static parts, among other parts with failure potentially leading to hazardous engine effects due to low-cycle fatigue mechanisms.\nA commenter noted that the FAA made a reference to \u00a7 33.70 in proposed JS4.2713(b) when \u00a7 33.70 was not included as a part of the Model JAS4-1 airworthiness criteria and recommended adding \u00a7 33.70. The FAA agrees and \u00a7 33.70(a), (b), and (c) have been added to the airworthiness criteria. The introductory paragraph of \u00a7 33.70, however, is not part of the airworthiness criteria.\nA commenter also requested that the FAA specifically address high-cycle fatigue (HCF) effects in JS4.2713. HCF effects are included in the life limit calculation under \u00a7 33.70. The influence of HCF on life limits is addressed as part of the vibration requirement in JS4.2720, which characterizes and quantifies all vibration stresses in a part. It also requires the vibration stresses to be less than the material endurance limits, when combined with steady stresses. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter noted that the FAA has historically not applied the classification of \u201ccritical part\u201d in FAA airworthiness standards and asked for clarification. The use of critical parts is consistent with the FAA's certification approach for electric engines and is necessary for an acceptable level of safety. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter questioned why the FAA included transient maximum overtemperature and transient maximum overspeed as part of the endurance demonstration in proposed JS4.2721. The FAA notes that electric engines typically establish power or thrust ratings using shaft torque. Therefore, torque is managed directly, or by another governing parameter, such as electrical current. The airworthiness criteria in JS4.2721 are performance-based, but the applicant may use the procedures in \u00a7 33.84(a) as a means of compliance with the overtorque requirement. Transient rotor speed in\n( printed page 17249)\nelectric and combustion engines is controlled by different technologies. Transient overspeed in a combustion engine is typically a design feature that allows an engine to exceed a maximum steady state rotor speed temporarily in order to meet certain performance requirements. Electric engines use electrical current and have fast response times, so transient rotor overspeed is not typically needed to meet performance requirements and would most likely occur from a failure or design flaw, which are occurrences within the scope of JS4.2721. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nThe FAA received a comment requesting clarity on the endurance demonstration requirement in JS4.2723(b). The FAA notes that the endurance demonstration is an accelerated severity test intended to demonstrate the engine has acceptable performance characteristics throughout the operating range, up to and including engine ratings and operating limits without the need for maintenance after being exposed to these extreme conditions. Therefore, the engine cycles that are used for the endurance demonstration do not correlate well with the engine cycles that are used during in-service operation. The FAA concurs with the commenter that additional clarification is needed and modified JS4.2723(b) to require that the endurance demonstration must be for a duration sufficient to verify the limit capabilities of the engine.\nOne commenter identified a need for clarification regarding electromagnetic stresses in proposed JS4.2712, \u201cStress Analysis,\u201d which also corresponds to \u00a7 33.62. The FAA has updated JS4.2712(a) to address the interaction between electrical systems and magnetic components, specifically considering electromagnetic forces, which are not covered in existing airworthiness standards for aircraft engines. The revised paragraph (a) requires a comprehensive stress analysis, including mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic forces, to ensure an adequate design margin that prevents hazardous engine effects and unacceptable operating characteristics.\nAnother commenter requested that the FAA add \u201cat the declared operating limits\u201d to proposed JS4.2712(a). The FAA does not concur. JS4.2712 includes mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stress. These criteria were created to account for design limits specific to electric engines that, if exceeded, could develop into hazardous engine conditions. The airworthiness criteria ensure design margins account for any relevant declared operating limits. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter asked for clarification of the term \u201cminimum material properties\u201d in JS4.2712(b). JS4.2712(b) requires determining maximum stresses in the engine without exceeding minimum material properties. The Model JAS4-1 must comply with \u00a7 33.15, which establishes the requirements for engine materials. Compliance with \u00a7 33.15 will determine \u201cminimum material properties.\u201d No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter proposed that the FAA consider that the single fault tolerance criteria in proposed JS4.2710(f)(2) be understood at the aircraft \u201cpropulsion system level\u201d rather than at the engine level when addressing Loss of Power Control (LOPC). Commenters requested similar clarification regarding the single fault criteria in proposed JS4.2733(f)(2). The FAA disagrees that the requested change would be appropriate. The airworthiness criteria in Subpart H apply to a single engine, not to the entire distributed propulsion system. No changes were made to the airworthiness criteria in response to this comment.\nMultiple commenters requested that the FAA qualitatively and quantitively define LOPC in the airworthiness criteria. The FAA does not agree. The LOPC airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 are contained in portions of \u00a7 33.28 and JS4.2710. Existing engine airworthiness standards in part 33 do not prescribe the level of detail requested by the commenters. LOPC will depend on the performance data and system analysis for the Model JAS4-1 and its intended aircraft application. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nOne commenter noted that \u00a7 33.28(d)(4) effectively requires that the engine control system be resilient to local events, while the proposed airworthiness criteria in JS4.2710(f)(4) does not allow local events to occur. The commenter requested the FAA revise JS4.2710(f)(4) to maintain the safety intent of \u00a7 33.28(d)(4). The FAA agrees with the suggested change. JS4.2710(f)(4) has been changed to require the engine control system to \u201censure failures or malfunctions that lead to local events in the aircraft do not result in hazardous engine effects as defined in JS4.2717(d)(2) due to engine control system failures or malfunctions.\u201d\nOne commenter proposed that the FAA differentiate between the ingestions that must not lead to a hazardous event (such as a large bird impact) and the ones that cannot lead to a loss of power that would become incompatible with the aircraft performances and CSFL capabilities. Another commenter questioned the use of the broad term \u201cforeign objects\u201d in JS4.2718. The FAA modified JS4.2718 to incorporate ingestion sources identified in \u00a7\u00a7 33.68, 33.76, 33.77, and 33.78. Revised JS4.2718 uses general terminology when distinguishing abnormal operation, hazardous engine effects, and unacceptable power loss which accounts for aircraft level effects and clarifies the term \u201cforeign objects\u201d by specifying the ingestion source.\nMultiple commenters requested clarification regarding applicability differences between \u00a7 33.28 and JS4.2710. The FAA notes that the applicability of both requirements is covered by JS4.2710(a). The FAA intends the applicant to employ the elements of \u00a7 33.28 specified as applicable to the Model JAS4-1 in combination with the additional requirements of JS4.2710.\nOne commenter asked if compliance with \u00a7 33.64 is necessary to satisfy the proposed pressurized cooling requirements in \u00a7 33.21 and JS4.2706, as stated in ASTM Standard F3338-21 section 5.7.4. The ASTM Standard applies to liquid engine cooling systems, but the requirements in \u00a7 33.21 and JS4.2706 apply to air and liquid engine cooling systems. The FAA notes that although \u00a7 33.64, which contains requirements for pressurized engine static parts, is not part of the Joby airworthiness criteria, the concern raised in this comment is addressed by other Joby airworthiness criteria. Pressurized engine static parts are addressed by JS4.2719. Paragraph (a) specifies requirements for liquid systems used for lubrication or cooling engine components. Paragraph (c) includes airworthiness criteria for static parts subjected to pressurized liquid systems. The FAA also revised the heading of JS4.2719 from \u201cLiquid Systems\u201d to \u201cLiquid and Gas Systems\u201d to clarify the applicability of the requirement and to differentiate it from ASTM Standard F3338-21.\nAnother commenter requested the FAA clarify that \u00a7 33.29(f), which requires a safety assessment of incorrect fit of instruments, sensors, or connectors, applies to the Model JAS4-1. The FAA disagrees and notes that \u00a7 33.29(f) references a \u00a7 33.75 turbine engine safety analysis that is not relevant to the Joby electric engines. The airworthiness criteria have been revised to exclude paragraph (f) from the requirement to comply with certain paragraphs of \u00a7 33.29.\n( printed page 17250)\nThe same commenter requested the FAA generalize the terminology in JS4.2728 to recognize electro-mechanical implementations in addition to traditional mechanisms and functions. The commenter proposed replacing \u201clocking\u201d with \u201cholding\u201d and \u201cunlocking\u201d with \u201crelease.\u201d JS4.2728 does not prescribe specific implementation of the rotor lock, other than the prevention of the rotor from turning. A rotor locking (or holding) function in an electric engine could have both mechanical and electro-mechanical purposes. The FAA determined the criteria in JS4.2728 will achieve the intended objectives for the Model JAS4-1. No changes are necessary as a result of the comment.\nA commenter questioned the use of service limits in determining acceptability during the teardown evaluation in proposed JS4.2729(a)(1), as the service limits can be lower than those demonstrated as a part of the certification process. The FAA agrees that the intent is that each engine part must conform to the type design and be eligible for incorporation into an engine for continued operation and updated JS4.2729(a)(1) to remove the reference to service limits.\nThe FAA received multiple comments asking to define or qualify what would be an acceptable margin for purposes of JS4.2730(a) and whether a rotor burst analysis is required at the aircraft level. The FAA disagrees. The FAA will determine an acceptable margin similar to the way the agency determines acceptable margins for engines under part 33. No changes were made as a result of these comments.\nIn regard to compliance with the functional demonstrations required by JS4.2731, a commenter asked whether there will be a basic standard test-run program, or whether the demonstration will depend on the individual case. The FAA notes that JS4.2731 uses performance-based language to describe the functional demonstrations if they are not accomplished concurrent with other required engine tests. Currently, there are no industry-wide accepted standards for conducting electric engine tests with variable pitch propellers, so the demonstration will depend on the individual case.\nA commenter requested the FAA merge JS4.2733(c)(1), which addresses the electrical-power distribution system, and JS4.2733(d)(1), which addresses protection systems. Paragraph (c) addresses the safe transfer of power throughout the power plant whereas paragraph (d) addresses a protection system's response to power conditions that exceed design limits. These systems perform different functions, and therefore they are treated by separate airworthiness criteria. No changes were made as a result of the comment.\nThe same commenter noted that the type of electrical fault isolation required in JS4.2733(c)(3) should be linked to the possible effects of the fault on the safety of flight and the aircraft. JS4.2733(c) protects engine electrical systems from faulted electrical energy generation or storage devices. The means of compliance should be tied to the safety assessment, which includes aircraft-level effects from faulted electrical-energy generation or storage device. The FAA updated JS4.2733(c)(3) to recognize this link.\nA commenter questioned the numbering scheme of the airworthiness criteria in proposed JS4.2733(d). The FAA agrees that the numbering scheme needed better clarity. JS4.2733(d)(1) was merged with the introductory text of JS4.2733(d). Proposed JS4.2733(d)(2) does not fit under Protection Systems and was moved to JS4.2733(e). Proposed JS4.2733(e) through (g) have been renumbered as JS4.2733(f) through (h).\nThe same commenter noted that proposed JS4.2733(d) was too prescriptive in specifically requiring transmission interruption. The FAA agrees and changed the language to reflect that the Model JAS4-1 must be designed such that certain conditions would not result in a hazardous engine effect.\nLastly, the commenter requested that the FAA revise proposed JS4.2733(e), which addresses environmental limits, to make it less prescriptive. The commenter suggested that proposed JS4.2733(e) contain similar language as that in the equivalent requirement for the propeller control system in JS4.2823(a)(2). The FAA disagrees. JS4.2733(e) and JS4.2823(a)(2) are not equivalent requirements as stated by the commenter. Proposed JS4.2733(e) (JS4.2733(f) in these final criteria) requires demonstrating environmental limits through system and component tests when substantiation methods are insufficient, while JS4.2823(a)(2) requires ensuring propeller control system functionality remains unaffected by declared environmental conditions and documenting validated environmental limits in propeller manuals. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nPropellers\nThe FAA received and reviewed comments from ALPA, Airbus, ASDIA, EASA, GAMA, Hartzell, Overair, TCCA, and Volocopter requesting the FAA revise, remove, or clarify proposed airworthiness criteria related to propellers for the Model JAS4-1.\nMultiple commenters requested changes to proposed JS4.2823 regarding the causal direction of hazardous propeller effects and local events. One commenter suggested that \u201clocal event\u201d needs to be defined. The FAA concurs and has revised JS4.2823(b)(2) to require that local events not cause hazardous propeller effects. The FAA also concurs that the definition of \u201clocal events,\u201d in the context of JS4.2823, should be as defined as it is in AC 33.28-3, \u201cGuidance Material for 14 CFR \u00a7 33.28, Engine Control Systems,\u201d with minor wording changes that are appropriate for the Model JAS4-1. The FAA has added this definition to JS4.2000(b)(6).\nAnother commenter noted that two requirements from \u00a7 35.23 were missing in the proposed airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 and suggested that they be added. The FAA concurs and added \u00a7 35.23(b)(3) and 35.23(b)(4) to the airworthiness criteria as paragraphs JS4.2823(b)(3) and JS4.2823(b)(4).\nAdditionally, commenters suggested that the number of propeller pitch cycles be increased from thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred in proposed JS4.2840(a) to align it with \u00a7 35.40(b). The FAA agrees and has revised JS4.2840(a) accordingly.\nOne commenter asked why the functional test in proposed JS4.2840 is limited to forward pitch and not to the entire pitch range. The FAA notes that the test is limited because the Model JAS4-1 does not have reversible pitch capability.\nSeveral commenters requested the FAA elaborate on how the FAA differentiated between requirements for rotors compared to propellers, and whether icing ingestion requirements are needed for propellers. The FAA does not concur with suggestions to add additional requirements for lift generating rotors or ice ingestion requirements for the JS4.2800 series criteria. The design and the expected failure modes of Joby's propellers are expected to be similar to conventional propellers type certificated under part 35 despite being used in the vertical thrust mode. Ice ingestion requirements for the engines already exist in other parts of the Model JAS4-1 airworthiness criteria.\nCommenters suggested that proposed JS4.2815, which requires a safety analysis of the propeller system, is inadequate because the rate of hazardous propeller effects was not conservative enough and propeller release and unbalance should be treated as catastrophic events and not as hazardous propeller effects. Further,\n( printed page 17251)\ncommenters suggested that determining the rate of hazardous propeller effects should be less ambiguous. The FAA does not concur with the suggestion that the acceptable hazardous propeller failure rate is too high. The criteria are derived from part 35 requirements, which provide an acceptable level of safety for both part 23 and 25 airplanes. The FAA does not concur with the suggestion that propeller release and unbalance should be treated as catastrophic and not hazardous effects. Catastrophic effects are treated at the aircraft level and the criteria for single propellers provide an acceptable level of safety. The FAA does not concur with the request to make the quantitative prediction of a hazardous propeller effect less ambiguous due to inherent limitations on the availability of reliable data.\nOne commenter questioned the need for a propeller critical part designation. The FAA does not concur with the suggestion to not make the propellers critical parts. The critical part requirements are integral for creating a propeller with an equivalent level of safety and are retained for the Model JAS4-1.\nCommenters suggested that the current \u00a7 35.35 centrifugal load requirements are inappropriately prescriptive and that overspeed requirements derived from parts 27 or 29 rotorcraft rules are more appropriate. The FAA does not concur with the suggestion to substitute rotorcraft overspeed requirements for the propeller centrifugal load tests in \u00a7 35.35(a) and (b) because the design and failure modes of Joby's propellers are expected to be similar to conventional propellers type certificated under part 35. The consequential propeller loads are expected to primarily be centrifugal loads, and therefore the prescriptive centrifugal test requirement of \u00a7 35.35, with its requirement for a large margin of safety, is needed to ensure an equivalent level of safety.\nA commenter requested clarification on the requirements in \u00a7 35.36 and whether it includes secondary impact hazards on other aircraft systems or personnel. The \u00a7 35.36 airworthiness standard requires that the propeller must withstand a 4-lb bird impact without major or hazardous effects. This prohibits the release of the propeller or any major portion of the propeller, which could result in secondary impact hazards on other aircraft systems or personnel, or result in an excessive imbalance. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nA commenter stated that the propeller-specific lightning strike requirements of \u00a7 35.38, which prevent major or hazardous effects, are inconsistent with aircraft-level lightning requirement in JS4.2335, which prevents catastrophic effects. The commenter proposed modifying the airworthiness criteria to remove the inconsistency. The FAA disagrees. The propeller requirements prescribe a particular safety level for an uninstalled propeller only; an uninstalled propeller does not need the same safety requirement as the aircraft. The aircraft safety analysis uses the propeller failure rate data to show that the aircraft will not experience any catastrophic effects. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nOne commenter requested a definition for maximum propeller overspeed and overtorque as used in \u00a7 35.41. The FAA does not concur with the request to define propeller overspeed or overtorque because the applicant defines these ratings, if applicable, to show compliance with JS4.2805 and \u00a7 35.41. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nAnother commenter requested a definition of acceptable \u201cpropellers of similar design\u201d for purposes of compliance with JS4.2840(c). By a propeller of \u201csimilar design\u201d in JS4.2840(c), the FAA means that expected failure modes, materials, construction, normal operating characteristics, and features of the propeller are unchanged or have only insignificant differences compared to another propeller. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nRequests To Include Additional Criteria\nThe FAA received comments from Airbus, ALPA, ANAC, ASDIA, CAAC, EASA, GAMA, JCAB, Lilium, Martin Aerotech, MTLS, TCCA, and individual commenters that additional criteria should be added for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift.\nOne commenter requested the FAA provide reasoning on the omission of \u00a7 23.2005, which defines certification levels for normal category airplanes based on maximum seating configuration and speed, or an equivalent airworthiness criterion. The commenter requested the FAA discuss how the agency is establishing the minimum safety requirements for various special class powered-lift products to provide an equivalent level of safety. The FAA did not include \u00a7 23.2005 in these airworthiness criteria as that regulation was developed specifically for part 23 airplanes. The Model JAS4-1 is a powered-lift with novel flight phases that are not representative of airplanes; instead, the FAA is establishing a level of safety for the Model JAS4-1 that is equivalent with the level of safety in both part 23 and part 27 for airplanes and rotorcraft performing similar operations. Additionally, the criteria in this notice are specific for the Model JAS4-1 and are not generally applicable to powered-lift of various sizes.\nAn individual requested more criteria for HIRF environment applied to urban air mobility operations and vertiports. The FAA notes JS4.2520(a), HIRF protection, requires compliance for systems associated with catastrophic failure conditions. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nSeveral commenters requested the FAA require provisions for in-service monitoring such as a Health and Usage Monitoring System to validate assumptions pertaining to airframe structure designs. The FAA is charged under \u00a7 21.17(b) to provide an equivalent level of safety to the existing airworthiness standards. The FAA does not currently require in-service monitoring for critical parts on other aircraft types, and the FAA does not plan to require any provisions for in-service monitoring of critical parts for powered-lift. No changes were made as a result of this comment.\nSeveral commenters noted that no specific requirement is mentioned for aircraft batteries and recommended the FAA create new, specific criteria to address topics such as fire protection, fire propagation, crashworthiness, high-voltage current disconnection, protection from lightning transients, punctures and leakage of toxic gas or liquid, and effects of temperature and battery health on battery performance. The FAA acknowledges the risk posed by these hazards but does not agree that additional specific requirements are necessary. All risks identified are adequately addressed by the requirements of Subparts E and F, JS4.1529, and the Appendix A ICA requirements for airframe, engines, and propellers, with specific safety objectives and means of compliance to address these risks that will be developed and tailored to the specific aspects of the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift.\nOut of Scope Comments\nThe FAA received and reviewed numerous comments that were general, stated the commenter's viewpoint or opposition without a suggestion specific to the proposed criteria, did not make a request the FAA can act on, requested clarification on existing airworthiness\n( printed page 17252)\nstandards, requested changes or clarification to means of compliance, requested changes to type certification procedures defined in 14 CFR part 21, requested requirements for features not included on the Model JAS4-1, improperly assumed the Model JAS4-1 was an Unmanned Aircraft System, addressed issues covered by operational requirements including IFR under which the Model JAS4-1 will not be operating or other 14 CFR parts not related to airworthiness, or asked generalized questions about the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. These comments are beyond the scope of this document. The FAA also reviewed several comments relating to the pursuit of future rulemaking for powered-lift, which is beyond the scope of these airworthiness criteria.\nAdditional Changes Made to the Proposed Criteria\nFrom October 31, 2023, through November 2, 2023, the FAA met with representatives from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regarding the proposed airworthiness criteria. This discussion did not pertain specifically to the Model JAS4-1, but instead concerned harmonization activities between EASA and FAA on the requirements and means of compliance for type certification of powered-lift/VTOL aircraft generally. As a result of this meeting, and for consistency with the harmonized general criteria, the FAA changed the proposed requirement to comply with \u00a7 23.2250(c). The FAA added the sentence \u201cThe applicant must prevent single failures from resulting in a catastrophic effect upon the aircraft\u201d to \u00a7 23.2250(c) (now JS4.2250(c)) to clarify that while single point failures are allowed in the design, they must be prevented from resulting in a catastrophic effect on the aircraft.\nApplicability\nThese airworthiness criteria, established under the provisions of \u00a7 21.17(b), are applicable to the Joby Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. Should Joby apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model, these airworthiness criteria would apply to that model as well, provided the FAA finds them appropriate in accordance with the requirements of subpart D to part 21.\nConclusion\nThis action affects only certain airworthiness criteria for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. It is not a standard of general applicability.\nPursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following airworthiness criteria are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. The FAA finds these criteria to be appropriate for the aircraft and applicable to the specific type design and provide an equivalent level of safety to existing airworthiness standards.\nAircraft-Level Requirements\n\u00a7 23.1457 Cockpit Voice Recorders\n(a) through (g) [Applicable to Model JAS4-1]\n\u00a7 23.1459 Flight Data Recorders\n(a) through (e) [Applicable to Model JAS4-1]\nJS4.1529 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness\nThe applicant must prepare Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA), in accordance with Appendices A, A1, and A2, that are acceptable to the Administrator. ICA for the aircraft, engines, and propellers may be shown in a single aircraft ICA manual if the engine and propeller approvals are sought through the aircraft certification program. Alternatively, the applicant may provide individual ICA for the aircraft, engines, and propellers. The instructions may be incomplete at the time of type certification if a program exists to ensure their completion prior to delivery of the first aircraft, or issuance of a standard certificate of airworthiness, whichever occurs later.\nSubpart A\u2014General\nJS4.2000 Applicability and Definitions\n(a) These airworthiness criteria prescribe airworthiness standards for the issuance of a type certificate, and changes to that type certificate, for the Joby Aero, Inc. Model JAS4-1 powered-lift. This aircraft must be certificated in accordance with either the \u201cessential performance\u201d or \u201cincreased performance\u201d requirements of these airworthiness criteria. This aircraft may also be type certificated as both \u201cessential performance\u201d and \u201cincreased performance\u201d with appropriate and different operating limitations for each approval.\n(b) For purposes of these airworthiness criteria, the following definitions apply:\n(1)\nContinued safe flight and landing\n\u2014\n(i) for powered-lift approved for \u201cessential performance\u201d means the aircraft is capable of continued controlled flight and landing, possibly using emergency procedures, without requiring exceptional pilot skill, strength, or alertness.\n(ii) for powered-lift approved for \u201cincreased performance\u201d means the aircraft is capable of climbing to a safe altitude, on a flightpath clear of obstacles, and maintaining level flight to a planned destination or alternate landing, possibly using emergency procedures, without requiring exceptional pilot skill, strength, or alertness.\n(2)\nPhases of flight\nmeans ground operations, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, hover, and landing.\n(3)\nSource of lift\nmeans one of three sources of lift: thrust-borne, wing-borne, and semi-thrust-borne. Thrust-borne is defined as when the weight of the aircraft is principally supported by lift generated by engine-driven lift devices. Wing-borne is defined as when the weight of the aircraft is principally supported by aerodynamic lift from fixed airfoil surfaces. Semi-thrust-borne is the combination of thrust-borne and wing-borne, where both forms of lift are used to support the weight of the aircraft.\n(4)\nControlled emergency landing\nmeans the aircraft design retains the capability to allow the pilot to choose the direction and area of touchdown while reasonably protecting occupants from serious injury. Upon landing, some damage to the aircraft may be acceptable.\n(5)\nCritical change of thrust\nmeans the most adverse effect on performance or handling qualities resulting from failures of the flight control or propulsive system, either singular or in combination, not shown to be extremely improbable.\n(6)\nLocal events\nare failures of aircraft systems and components, other than the engine and propeller control system, that may affect the installed environment of the engine and propeller control system.\n(c) Terms used in the part 23, part 33, and part 35 provisions that are adopted in these airworthiness criteria will have the following meaning:\n\u201cAirplane\u201d means \u201caircraft.\u201d\n\u201cThis part\u201d means \u201cthese airworthiness criteria.\u201d\n\u201cRotorcraft\u201d means \u201caircraft.\u201d\n( printed page 17253)\n\u00a7 23.2010 Accepted Means of Compliance\n(a) through (b) [Applicable to Model JAS4-1]\nSubpart B\u2014Flight\nPerformance\n\u00a7 23.2100 Weight and Center of Gravity\n(a) through (c) [Applicable to Model JAS4-1]\nJS4.2105 Performance Data\n(a) Unless otherwise prescribed, the aircraft must meet the performance requirements of this subpart in still air and standard atmospheric conditions.\n(b) Unless otherwise prescribed, the applicant must develop the performance data required by this subpart for the following conditions:\n(1) Altitudes from sea level to the maximum altitude for which certification is being sought; and\n(2) Temperatures above and below standard day temperature that are within the range of operating limitations, if those temperatures could have a negative effect on performance.\n(c) The procedures used for determining takeoff and landing performance must be executable consistently by pilots of average skill in atmospheric conditions expected to be encountered in service.\n(d) Performance data determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must account for losses due to atmospheric conditions, cooling needs, installation losses, downwash considerations, and other demands on power sources.\n(e) The hovering ceiling, in and out of ground effect, must be determined over the ranges of weight, altitude, and temperature, if applicable.\n(f) Continued safe flight and landing must be possible from any point within the approved flight envelope following a critical change of thrust.\n(g) The aircraft must be capable of a controlled emergency landing, following a condition when the aircraft can no longer provide the commanded power or thrust required for continued safe flight and landing, by gliding or autorotation, or an equivalent means to mitigate the risk of loss of power or thrust.\nJS4.2110 Minimum Safe Speed\nThe applicant must determine the aircraft minimum safe speed for each flight condition encountered in normal operations, including applicable sources of lift and phases of flight, to maintain controlled safe flight. The minimum safe speed determination must account for the most adverse conditions for each flight configuration.\nJS4.2115 Takeoff Performance\n(a) The applicant must determine takeoff performance accounting for:\n(1) All sources of lift for each takeoff flight path for which certification is sought,\n(2) Minimum safe speed safety margins,\n(3) Minimum control speeds, and\n(4) Climb requirements.\n(b) For aircraft approved for essential performance, the applicant must determine the takeoff performance to 50 feet above the takeoff surface such that a rejected takeoff resulting in safe stop or landing can be made at any point along the takeoff flight path following a critical change of thrust.\n(c) For aircraft approved for increased performance, the applicant must determine the takeoff performance so that-\n(1) Following a critical change of thrust prior to reaching the takeoff decision point, a rejected takeoff resulting in a safe stop or landing can be made.

      "text": "Rivian has filed a lawsuit in Ohio to be able to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in the state \u2014 the latest swing in a perpetual fight between up-and-coming American automakers and the entrenched and powerful dealership lobby.\nThe company sued the registrar of Ohio\u2019s Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) on Monday in federal court, claiming the state is harming consumers by blocking direct sales. Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C.\nOhio\u2019s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cOhio\u2019s prohibition of Rivian\u2019s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience \u2014 all of which harm consumers \u2014 with literally no countervailing benefit,\u201d lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.\nRivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.\nAllowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.\nWhat\u2019s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state\u2019s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ohio\u2019s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,\u201d Mike Callahan, Rivian\u2019s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.\nRivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state\u2019s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly but ultimately failed.\nLucid Motors, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022 in a challenge to that state\u2019s direct-sales ban. The court ruled against Lucid earlier this year, but the company has appealed, federal court records show."

      "text": "At a time when the world feels increasingly divided between East and West, Uzbekistan has emerged as a rare middle ground, as the Central Asian nation\u2019s homegrown unicorn, Uzum, has raised $65.5 million in a new funding round co-led by China\u2019s Tencent and the New York- and London-based VR Capital, with participation from U.S.-based FinSight Ventures.\nThe all-equity round brings the Tashkent-headquartered startup\u2019s post-money valuation to approximately $1.5 billion \u2014 a nearly 30% jump from the $1.16 billion valuation it announced when it first hit unicorn status in March last year.\nFounded in 2022, Uzum started its journey in Uzbekistan with an e-commerce marketplace called Uzum Market, and shortly after its success, the startup added fintech with a debit card and later expanded into its express food delivery service, Uzum Tezkor.\nUzum currently boasts over 17 million monthly active users \u2014 nearly half of Uzbekistan\u2019s adult population, or about two-thirds of all smartphone users in the country \u2014 and 16,000 merchants. In the first half of 2025 alone, the startup recorded $250 million in gross merchandise value (GMV), up nearly 1.5x year-over-year.\nIts digital banking arm, Uzum Bank, launched a co-branded Visa debit card with pre-approved credit limits in August last year. That product has already issued 2 million cards and is on track to surpass 5 million by year-end. Meanwhile, Uzum\u2019s unsecured lending business hit $200 million in financed volume in Q1, growing 3.4x from the same period last year. The startup also posted $150 million in net income in 2024 \u2014 a 50% year-over-year jump.\nWith a portfolio spanning e-commerce, fintech, and digital banking, how has a startup just over three years old managed to scale this quickly \u2014 and draw the attention of global investors like Tencent?\nUzum founder and CEO Djasur Djumaev attributes the success to a combination of deep local knowledge and disciplined execution. He believes that understanding the country\u2019s culture, consumer behavior, and business environment \u2014 and pairing that with the technical and operational expertise that global companies have developed \u2014 has been critical to building a business that can scale quickly and sustainably.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe startup built its digital and physical infrastructure from scratch to kick off its business in Uzbekistan. This includes setting a logistics capacity that has grown to 112,000 square meters, with a storage capacity of 1.1 million square feet, allowing it to process more than 200,000 orders per day.\nThe startup has also set up more than 1,500 pickup points across 450 cities, towns, settlements, and villages in the country to enable next-day deliveries. These pickup points also allow the issuance and distribution of Uzum Bank cards.\n\u201cBetting on local expertise and infrastructure in frontier markets gives you an advantage to then perform and scale your business very fast,\u201d Djumaev told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview.\nInitially, Uzum operated on a fulfilled-by-operator model to enable e-commerce deliveries. It has since expanded to include fulfillment-by-seller and delivery-by-seller options, with a goal of routing 20% to 30% of deliveries through these new models. These new delivery models will also help Uzum expand its stock-keeping units, which are currently over 1.5 million available for its next-day delivery service, up from over 600,000 SKUs at the time of its last funding announcement in March 2024.\nWhen asked what brought Tencent onto its cap table this time, Uzum\u2019s chief strategy and business development officer, Nikolay Seleznev, told TechCrunch the startup\u2019s strong growth metrics convinced the Chinese investor to come on board after several quarters of ongoing discussions.\nUzum plans to grow its fintech business by introducing a deposit product in September and a long-term (more than 12 months in maturity) credit facility for its B2C customers. The startup also plans to expand its merchant base and help its existing and new merchants with its QR code payment processing system, expand its Visa debit card program, and build new products to support small and medium enterprises in the country.\nSimilarly, the startup plans to introduce new products adding value-added services to its e-commerce business, including those helping to generate advertisement revenues. It is also working toward scaling its financial infrastructure further with AI increasingly embedded across credit scoring, fraud protection, and personalized user experiences.\nFurthermore, Uzum plans to open up its e-commerce marketplace for international merchants, beginning with those in China and Turkey in September.\n\u201cWe are expecting 10 to 15% of cross-border activity coming from these countries,\u201d Seleznev said.\nThe startup has over 12,000 people in its workforce, including blue-collar workers at its pickup points, as well as tech, engineering, and product teams across all its business verticals.\nSimilar to other businesses of its sort, which are profitable and have multiple avenues to generate continuous income over time, Uzum has plans to become public in the medium term. But before that, it aims to raise a Series B round of $250\u2013$300 million in the first half of 2026.\nThat said, the startup has so far raised $137 million in equity, including the latest round."

      "text": "The semiconductor industry\u2019s rollercoaster year continues with another major development.\nPresident Donald Trump said on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Tuesday that his administration is planning to announce tariffs on semiconductors and chips as soon as next week. However, the specifics of these tariffs remain unclear.\nSuch tariffs could cause quite a disruption for U.S. hardware and AI companies. When the U.S. CHIPs and Science Act was signed in 2022 \u2014 providing $52 billion in subsidies to boost domestic chip manufacturing \u2014 the U.S. produced only about 10% of global chips. Despite this small manufacturing footprint, more than half of global semiconductor companies are headquartered in the U.S.\nSince then, some progress has been made toward boosting domestic chip manufacturing. Both Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have received funding from the CHIPs Act. TSMC has also committed to spending \u201cat least\u201d $100 billion over the next four years on chip manufacturing plants in the U.S.\nBut setting up chip manufacturing plants takes time. Intel recently announced it was delaying construction on its Ohio chip manufacturing facility, again, highlighting the challenges of rapidly scaling up production.\nThe tariff announcement comes as the industry awaits the administration\u2019s decision on AI chip export restrictions \u2014 rules that control which countries can purchase advanced semiconductors used in AI systems.\nThe Trump administration formally rescinded the Biden administration\u2019s chip AI export rules in May. Those rules had established a country-specific, multi-tier approach to restricting chip exports based on national security concerns. The Trump administration then released its AI Action Plan in July, which emphasized the need for the U.S. to implement chip export restrictions but was light on the details of what that could look like.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "Lyft\u2019s European expansion will include Chinese-made robotaxis.\nThe U.S. ride-hailing company announced Monday it has made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant\u2019s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026, pending regulatory approval.\nIf approved, Baidu\u2019s RT6 vehicles, which are equipped with its Apollo Go self-driving system, will be integrated into Lyft\u2019s ride-hailing app. Lyft CEO David Risher said the robotaxi service is an example of its \u201chybrid network approach, where AVs and human drivers work together to provide customer-obsessed options for riders.\u201d\nLyft has historically centered its ride-hailing business on the United States, while rival Uber has expanded globally and into other areas, like food delivery. But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for about $197 million in cash.\nThe acquisition opened the European market to Lyft, which has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012.\nLyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology.\nUber has partnered with more than 18 companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world, including ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, WeRide, and Baidu. Last month, Uber invested hundreds of millions of dollars into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.\nLyft hasn\u2019t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan to add autonomous shuttles made by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to put AVs from May Mobility on its network in Atlanta later this year."

      "text": "Tesla\u2019s board of directors has announced a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth around $29 billion in shares, with the company citing the \u201cever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla\u2019s position at a critical inflection point\u201d as reasons for the payout.\nThe massive pay package is being allocated through a 2019 Equity Incentive Plan that is already approved by shareholders, so it won\u2019t go to a vote, according to a regulatory filing and Ann Lipton, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Tesla says it will put \u201ca longer-term CEO compensation strategy\u201d to a vote at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for November.\nMusk\u2019s new compensation plan will be entirely voided if the Delaware Supreme Court decides to overturn a judge\u2019s January 2024 decision to strike down Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package because of how it was negotiated behind the scenes. That pay package was worth around $56 billion.\nMusk has threatened to stop working on AI and robotics at Tesla unless he gains more control over the company. Those threats preceded what is now a multimillion-dollar talent war among the biggest companies in the artificial intelligence space, along with a rush of mergers and acquisitions.\nAt the same time, Musk has built up his own AI company outside Tesla called xAI, which now owns X, his social media platform. This has happened while Tesla\u2019s sales growth has vanished and its brand has been damaged by Musk\u2019s involvement in the Trump administration.\nTesla said Monday that its board of directors formed a special committee earlier this year consisting of chairwoman Robyn Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in order to sort out a new package.\nThe award they ultimately decided on involves giving Musk 96 million shares that will vest in two years, provided that he \u201cserve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla\u201d during that term and holds the stock for five years. Unlike Tesla\u2019s previous award to Musk, this new package does not appear to be tied to goals like increasing the company\u2019s stock price.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nAt Tesla\u2019s Monday premarket trading price, that would be worth around $29 billion. Musk will have to pay a $23.34-per-share purchase price, bringing the total current value of the award to him to roughly $26.7 billion. Depending on how the Delaware Supreme Court rules on Tesla\u2019s appeal, the package may be forfeited so \u201cthere cannot be any \u2018double dip,\u2019 according to Tesla.\n\u201cElon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor,\u201d the company wrote.\nTesla said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is also a board member, recused themselves from the process of constructing this new compensation package. Musk\u2019s involvement in the 2018 compensation package was one of the reasons Delaware Chancery Court Judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick decided to strike it down following a trial sparked by a shareholder lawsuit.\nMcCormick said the process of creating that 2018 plan was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d because of Musk\u2019s input and his deep connections to the people on Tesla\u2019s board. She also criticized that plan for not including any terms that would bind Musk to Tesla for \u201cany set amount of time\u201d \u2014 a likely reason for the two-year pledge included in the new plan.\nMcCormick\u2019s decision caused an uproar among Tesla\u2019s largest fans and many of its shareholders. It\u2019s also what inspired the company to re-incorporate from Delaware to Texas, a state with fewer established shareholder protections written into its laws. Tesla went as far as holding a shareholder vote to \u201cre-affirm\u201d the pay package. But McCormick confirmed her decision in December 2024, saying the vote and Tesla\u2019s legal arguments were \u201cunprecedented theories [that] go against multiple strains of settled law.\u201d\nUpdate: This story and the headline have been updated to reflect that the award has been approved by Tesla\u2019s board and does not need a shareholder vote."

      "text": "Indian startup Jeh Aerospace founders Vishal Sanghavi and Venkatesh Mudragalla have had a front-row seat to the commercial aircraft sector and its growing production bottleneck.\nThe two former Tata Group executives spent close to two decades in different positions at the company and worked on projects that included participation from global aerospace companies, including Boeing, Sikorsky, and Lockheed Martin.\nNow, armed with $11 million in Series A funding, the pair are working to ease global supply chain bottlenecks by scaling the production of metallic components for aero engines and aerostructures, which it then sells to U.S.-based Tier 1 suppliers that work with commercial aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing.\nAnd they plan to help India become a destination for aerospace component manufacturing in the process.\n\u201cAt Tatas, we unlocked India\u2019s potential for these large OEMs, Boeing, Airbus, Sikorsky, and GE [General Electric], but we wanted Jeh Aerospace to unlock India\u2019s potential for the large Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturers in the supply chain,\u201d said Sanghavi, who is also CEO at Jeh.\nJeh Aerospace, which is headquartered in Atlanta to better access its U.S. customer base, has a 60,000-square-foot software-based, precision manufacturing facility in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. The 3-year-old startup has combined precision machinery, robotics, and IoT devices to slash product introduction lead times from the industry\u2019s traditional 15-week timeline to 15 days.\nJeh Aerospace\u2019s software-defined manufacturing approach helps bring predictability and dynamic scheduling to allow offering a consistent supply to customers with no compromises on quality, Sanghavi said.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nAnd it seems VCs and strategic investors are interested in Jeh Aerospace\u2019s pitch.\nThe Series A round was led by Elevation Capital, with participation from General Catalyst. With the infusion of the new capital, Jeh Aerospace has raised about $15 million in total from institutional venture capital firms. The VC fresh funding comes less than a month after the startup received an undisclosed strategic investment from IndiGo Ventures, a corporate venture capital arm of Indian carrier IndiGo.\nAshray Iyengar, principal at Elevation Capital, said the company \u201cbuilt a truly differentiated approach to aerospace manufacturing.\u201d\nAircraft production bottleneck\nGlobal air traffic demand rose 10.4% year-over-year in 2024, surpassing 2019 levels by 3.8%, per the International Air Transport Association data released earlier this year.\nThe rebound has spurred airlines to expand fleets, pushing up orders even as the industry grapples with talent and production bottlenecks, as Deloitte notes in a recent report. Tier 1 suppliers are facing extended lead times as the commercial aircraft backlog reaches a record of nearly 15,700 units, according to McKinsey.\nJeh Aerospace\u2019s founders believe using technology to scale production of metallic components for aero engines and aerostructures will unplug that bottleneck. That premise has shaped how Sanghavi, the former chief operating officer at Tata Boeing Aerospace, and Mudragalla have built its 100-person workforce, team of advisers, and business model.\nInstead of working directly with OEMs like Airbus and Boeing, which make 30% of commercial aircraft, Jeh Aerospace deliberately decided to tap Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturers, Sanghavi told TechCrunch, adding this group makes 60% to 70% of aircraft.\nThe startup currently has half a dozen paying customers, including Vermont-based GS Precision and Ohio-headquartered RH Aero. Sanghavi said each of these customers is a \u201chigh dollar, high ARR customer,\u201d and they have the potential to become large accounts in the next one to two years.\n\u201cWhat we believe is that to work with lesser, but better customers, not to have a transactional relationship, but a far deeper and meaningful relationship. So, we are also very, very focused on not having too many customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business doesn\u2019t need too many customers because you can really scale with few customers very fast and very quickly.\u201d\nThe company has also assembled an advisory team with deep ties to commercial aircraft OEMS. The startup counts former Boeing India president Pratyush (Prat) Kumar and former Airbus India CEO and managing director Dwaraka Srinivasan among its early advisers and backers.\nJeh Aerospace has made notable manufacturing and financial progress in its short life.\nSince its $2.75 million seed round in January last year, Jeh Aerospace says it has delivered more than 100,000 flight-critical components and tools on time. The startup has also established a machine capacity exceeding 250,000 hours annually.\nIn the last financial year, the startup reached $6 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and achieved profitability after taxes. Sanghavi told TechCrunch that it projects a 3x to 4x increase in its ARR this year and also boasts an order book worth $100 million.\nThe company plans to use the new $11 million in capital to scale its manufacturing and inspection capabilities by investing in next-generation digital production technologies, Sanghavi said.\nThe Jeh Aerospace co-founders see an opportunity to bring more local manufacturing to India and strengthen the country\u2019s position on the global aerospace map, much like its recent emergence as a hub for iPhone production.\nIndia already plays a growing role in aerospace manufacturing, with Airbus sourcing $1.4 billion worth of components annually from the country and targeting $2 billion by 2030. Boeing, for its part, is aiming for a $1.3 billion annual spend and announced its plans to invest $200 million in a new engineering and technology center in Bengaluru in 2023. Still, the South Asian nation has yet to achieve large-scale success in aerospace component manufacturing \u2014 a gap companies like Jeh Aerospace are hoping to fill.\nAlthough few Indian startups operate in aerospace component manufacturing, the sector includes players like JJG Aero, which appears to be a peer to Jeh Aerospace based on industry positioning. Sanghavi declined to comment specifically on JJG and noted that his startup sees its primary competition among U.S.-based tier-2 suppliers."
