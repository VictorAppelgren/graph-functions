  "description": "Oxfordshire County Council's plan to reduce the the number of beds for those leaving care are approved.",
  "content": "A council is cutting the number of beds available for homeless young people leaving the care system. Oxfordshire County Council has approved plans to reduce the number of beds by 20% and reduce the age limit for accessing the service from 25 to 21. The changes were made to the contract for the Young People's Supported Accommodation Services programme, which is due to expire next month. Councillor Sean Gaul said: \"To say we've gone about this as carefully as possible... is an understatement.\"\n\nThe aim of the programme is to support leavers of the care system with supported accommodation, to allow them to gain life skills and either pursue further education or employment. The total number of beds would be reduced from 203 to about 154. In their report, officers said there were important reasons for not extending all the contracts, including \"low occupancy numbers\" and \"low waiting lists\" in certain areas. Those aged between 21 and 25 who are currently using the service will not be made homeless, but the service will stop accepting referrals from anyone over 21. Councillor Gaul added: \"We have done, I think, as much as can be done to get this decision as correct as possible.\"",

Have they noticed that there is a lot of problem with young people's mobile phones, a lot of young people don't like going to school?\n\"They have taken away a service young people used to trust.\"\nMs Nerton's comments come as Chard Youth Club prepares to close after 70 years because of a lack of funds.\nSerena Wootton, a trustee of the Chard Area Youth Committee, said she is \"devastated\" by the decision, but ultimately the building and insurance had become too expensive.\nThe centre, which was attended by about 270 young people across the week, will close its doors on Friday.\n\"We could see year on year it was getting more and more challenging to stay open and this (closure) felt like the only option for us,\" she said.\nA recent report, external by the YMCA found that nationally there has been a 73% drop in funding for youth services across England \u2013 a cut of \u00a31.2bn.\nIt has left some estates and villages across the county without a place for young people to go.\nMum-of-seven Tasha Reid said she is concerned that a lack of things for young people to do in Priorswood, Taunton, is fuelling anti-social behaviour (ASB).\n\"There are a lot of children, some as young as 10, running around with knives, sometimes terrorising the local neighbourhood,\" she said.\nAvon and Somerset Police said while it has seen an increase in anti-social behaviour in young groups within Somerset generally, possession of weapons offences remain average, with no increase for Priorswood specifically.\nInsp Joe Piscina, of the Somerset West neighbourhood policing team, added: \"We continue to target youths causing ASB within the area and as a force we target knife crime both through enforcement and through early intervention and engagement.\"\nHe said the force is actively using social media, beat surgeries and school talks to engage with the community.\nBut Ms Reid said more needs to be done. She is now trying to set up her own youth club, but said it is much harder than she thought.\n\"There is a lot of funding that needs to be gained, lots of training that you need,\" she said.\n\"It has not been easy at all and knowing where to go to get that help has been quite hard.\"\nOne of those also trying to help is Craig Lloyd, who has spent 30 years working in youth services in Somerset.\nHe was made redundant when council youth cuts were made 10 years ago and has since set up his own community interest company called Youth Unlimited.\nIt runs six youth clubs, including one at the Recreation Centre in Bridgwater, which is funded by the town council.\nBut he said the sector is \"fragmented\" and provision is dependent on whether town and parish councils or private individuals have stepped in with funding or practical help.\n\"We've got a lot of people in small communities really trying to do their best and the difficulty they have is they are working in isolation,\" he added.\nIn a statement the government said that over the next year it is investing \u00a3145m into youth programmes across the country adding: \"As part of our Plan for Change we have carried out the biggest listening exercise with young people in a generation.\"\nIt added that local authorities have a \"statutory duty to secure sufficient leisure-time activities and facilities in line with local needs\".\nBut Somerset Council said it receives \"no national funding\" for youth clubs.\n\"Due to national challenges, all Somerset services are under pressure and the council continues to work with partners and local organisations to seek innovative solutions,\" it said.\n\"We are very encouraged by the energy and ambition within communities to work with us in this area to improve access and provision.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Somerset\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook, external and X, external.

We want to improve outcomes for vulnerable young people, children we care for and care leavers.\nThe service\nVulnerable young people - or young people at risk of homelessness - are provided with high quality accommodation while being supported to develop their independent living skills, find employment, education or training.\nThe service is a short-term intervention which includes a plan to help young people meet their long-term needs.\nThe service has been developed with professionals, organisations and young people who have experience of supported housing services.\nThe YPSA service is co-commissioned in partnership with city and district councils.\nWho is eligible for the service?\nServices are targeted at young people aged 16-24 facing the following issues:\n- Separation from or loss of family\n- Past family experiences such as trauma, abuse, neglect, family breakdown, parent drug and alcohol addiction, parent mental health or disability issues\n- Challenging behaviours which have resulted from their experiences\n- Needs resulting from drug and alcohol issues, anger management, low self-esteem, self-harm, mental health, learning disability and domestic abuse.\nYPSA eligibility criteria and referral process (pdf format, 165Kb)\nIt is recognised that there may be young people that may display/have a set of specialist needs that cannot be catered for within the YPSA and alternative accommodation options and support will need to be considered.

The district councils make a contribution towards these costs.\nYoung people are required to cover the cost of their accommodation and pay these costs to the service provider. These costs can be covered by housing benefits or job salary and then each young person also needs to pay an additional \u00a310 a week to cover other costs which cannot be covered by housing benefit which include things like wi-fi and tv licence.\nIf a young person is under 18 and is in local authority care, all of their costs are covered by social care.\nIf a young person is over the age of 18 years and is an unaccompanied young person who is not able to access any benefit support, then social care will cover their accommodation costs. However, they will still need to pay the \u00a310 a week charge from their allowance from social care.\nCo-production and engagement\nIt is important to involve a variety of stakeholders, including young people and professionals, when delivering and developing services to ensure that they meet the needs of the people using the services.\nGathering feedback from young people to design the service (pdf format)\nResources to support co-production and engagement work with stakeholders.\nStaff wellbeing\nTraining for YPSA staff\neLearning for YPSA staff\nCheck the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children Board (OSCB) website for other training opportunities\nPresentations from virtual training/briefing sessions\n- Understanding the Move on Homes and work of REoC Pdf format, 185Kb)\n- Understanding the House project (pdf format, 577Kb)\nAccreditation opportunities available for young people in YPSA services.\n- Flow chart (pdf format, 30Kb)\n- Guide to accreditation AQA and OAA (pdf format, 223Kb)\n- Accreditation training for Young People's supported accommodation service (pdf format, 733Kb)\nUnderstanding the work of Riverside\n- Working agreement framework Riverside and YPSA services (pdf format, 133Kb)\n- Riverside referral form (docx format, 87Kb)\nFamily Group Conference service, making referrals and mediation\n- 7 Min guide (pdf format,506 Kb)\n- FGC consent form (docx format, 82Kb)\n- Housing FGC referral form (docx format, 91Kb)\nSubstance misuse: harm reduction, identifying patterns around misuse and current issues around particular drugs locally.

  "argos_summary": "Oxfordshire County Council has approved a 20% reduction in beds for young people leaving care, cutting the number from 203 to about 154 and lowering the age limit for new referrals from 25 to 21. The decision is justified by low occupancy and waiting lists in some areas, but other local councils warn it could increase homelessness among vulnerable young people. Meanwhile, broader youth services across the county face funding cuts, with closures of youth clubs and calls for more investment to prevent anti\u2011social behaviour. The council plans to redesign the service to make it more effective and cost\u2011efficient, though the impact on support for care leavers remains a concern.",
