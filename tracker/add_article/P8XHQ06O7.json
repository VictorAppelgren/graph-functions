      "summary": "Asian shares rose on Friday, led by gains in the Nikkei, Hang Seng, and other regional indices, following a record‑setting rally in U.S. stocks. The rally was fueled by expectations that weaker U.S. job data could prompt the Fed to cut rates, easing bond‑market pressure and lifting equity prices. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields fell, oil prices slipped, the dollar weakened against the yen, and the euro edged higher.",
