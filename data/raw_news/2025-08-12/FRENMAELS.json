  "content": "Max Verstappen and his stylish girlfriend Kelly Piquet stepped out in the Sardinian sunshine with their kids on a family trip this weekend.\n\nThe F1 star, 27, and model Kelly, 36, were enjoying some quality time together in the upmarket Porto Cervo area of the Italian island.\n\nMax welcomed his first child - a girl called Lily - with girlfriend Kelly in May this year.\n\nWhile Lily is Max's first child, Kelly already has a daughter, Penelope, born in 2019, from her previous relationship with Formula One driver Daniil Kvyat, 30.\n\nBoth children joined them on the trip as they all stepped out together for a stroll in the picturesque port town.\n\nKelly looked summer chic in a white and beige striped dress which she teamed with brown sliders as she pushed Lily's pram.\n\nMeanwhile Max cut a casual figure in a navy T-shirt and white shorts as he carried some shopping bags.\n\nTheir family holiday in Sardinia comes after the pair purchased a plot of land at the luxury development Pinheirinho Comporta in Portugal.\n\nDaily Mail understands that the couple are planning to build a property there, after spending plenty of time in the sunny holiday destination.\n\nMax's jet was recently spotted at the airport nearby, and he spent time playing golf with his friends and relaxing on the beach at the exclusive UltraLuxe Pinheirinho Comporta resort.\n\nThis is the second year in a row the couple have spent part of their summer in the area, with Kelly often sharing holiday snaps with her social media followers.\n\nPinheirinho is a large coastal estate near Comporta, Portugal, known for its natural beauty and high-end development.\n\nIt features a blend of luxury residences, a championship golf course, and a resort and spa.\n\nBeyond golf, the area offers opportunities for surfing, horseback riding, tennis, and other outdoor activities.\n\nOther celebrity residents include Christian Louboutin, Princess Eugenie and visitors include Claudia Schiffer, Madonna and Harrison Ford.\n\nDaily Mail has contacted Max and Kelly's representatives for comment.\n\nMax welcomed his first child with girlfriend Kelly in May this year.\n\nHe announced the news on Instagram, sharing a slew of black and white snaps of their baby girl, whom he called the 'greatest gift' and revealed they had named her Lily.\n\nAlongside the adorable pictures, he wrote: 'Welcome to the world, sweet Lily. Our hearts are fuller than ever - you are our greatest gift. We love you so much.'\n\nWhen talking about having his first child, Max previously explained he is already somewhat prepared thanks to Penelope.\n\nThe Dutchman said in the Talking Bull podcast : 'Luckily I did get a little bit of training with Penelope, seeing her grow up already for like four years. Which has been also really, really nice.\n\n'But yes, for sure, when it's like, also going be fully your own [kid]... Yes, it's going to be a different challenge. But I'm looking forward to it'.\n\nThe couple began dating in October 2020, and announced that they were expecting their first child together last December.\n\nDespite having a nine-year age gap, Kelly previously said that her relationship with Max is thriving because of the mutual understanding they have for each other.\n\nKelly, said: 'I think we have a very healthy relationship, easygoing, we have a lot of understanding and support for each other.\n\n'You would think the age difference could be a challenge, but so far things are going really well.\n\n'I also really appreciate how he treats Penelope. It's so sweet to see.'\n\nThe subject of marriage has been publicly addressed by Max, who said that only 'time will tell' if he and Kelly decide to tie the knot.\n\nKelly is the daughter of F1 legend Nelson Piquet, who won three Drivers' Championships himself in the 1980s, though he was also embroiled in a racism scandal with Lewis Hamilton.",

Let's make 2021 a year to remember in many ways. Wishing you all success, love and happiness just as I found mine.'\nMeanwhile Kelly wrote: 'Love is what makes the world go round. Happy new year and much love #2021.'\nKelly is a familiar face in the pitlane, having worked in motorsport PR and social media for Formula-E since 2015.\nIn 2016, she told the website e-racing.net she was 'working full time for Formula E as social media strategist and content creator.'\nShe explained: 'I focus on Instagram and Twitter, and do all Snapchat content.'\nMeanwhile she added she loved travelling the world because she gets to see so many different cultures, meet different people.'\nShe continued: 'Although the most exciting thing to me is being part of such an innovative concept, and introducing this new sport to different cities and cultures.\n\u201cMy favourite race locations so far have been Berlin, Monaco, Buenos Aires and Paris.'\nAs a model she's posed for PatBO and Lucas Boccal\u00e3o, and walked the catwalk in a number of fashion shows.\nHer ultra glamorous Instagram is filled with modelling shots as well as snaps of her lavish holidays jetsetting across the world.\nMeanwhile her daughter Penelope can often be seen by her side as the duo snuggle up in various luxurious destinations.\nAnd the mother-of-one regularly shares snaps of her bikini body on Instagram, delighting her 500,000 social media followers.\nCheering Max on is his glamorous Brazilian model girlfriend Kelly (pictured together), who previously dated Daniil Kvyat for three years\nMax went public with their relationship on New Year's Day this year, sharing a romantic snap of them together on a beach in Brazil, though it's thought they've been an item since October 2020 (pictured left and right)\nWithin the last few months, she has shared snaps from Brazil, Monte Carlo, Russia, Milan and Amsterdam.\nOther snaps show her gushing over Max, with her birthday tribute to her boyfriend reading: 'Happy Birthday to the love of my life.\n'I love everything about you, about us and I am beyond proud of you. I can\u2019t wait for all that is to come.'\nIt is believed Max only met his father-in-law Nelson a month ago, when the model shared a snap on her Instagram stories of the pair, writing: 'Finally they meet.'\nKelly with her father, three-time F1 world champion Nelson Piquet (right) and fellow F1 legend Niki Lauda\nAnd earlier this year she spoke of her fears for her boyfriend when he takes part in races.\nShe explained: 'It\u2019s of course mixed emotions. I\u2019m always super excited to support him but I always am nervous that everything goes well and that he doesn\u2019t get hurt in an accident.\n'The danger is normally not the first thing that comes to my mind but after his two big accidents this year, I\u2019m much more nervous.'\nShe also revealed how she dreams of 'building a beautiful, strong and united happy family.'\nKelly is a familiar face in the pitlane, having worked in motorsport PR and social media for Formula-E since 2015 (pictured with Max in Monaco)\nDays ago, Martin Bundle warned Max risks tarnishing his legacy and could be labelled an 'unfair driver' should his tactics in his tumultuous F1 world title battle with Lewis continue.\nThe two drivers head into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi this Sunday level on points after a Saudi Arabian Grand Prix which saw Hamilton win and Verstappen given two time penalties following clashes between the two of them.\nYet Sky Sports F1 expert Brundle - while praising the Dutchman's 'driving skills and racing nous' - explained his concern that a continuation of these controversial tactics could damage his legacy as he hunts his first world championship.\nKelly is a familiar face in the pitlane, having worked in motorsport PR and social media for Formula-E since 2015\n'Such is Max's car control and cunning, he's sometimes able to pull off the audacious moves and leave a margin of doubt as to whether it's hard racing or simply a professional foul outside of the regulations,' Brundle said in his Sky Sports column.\nBy virtue of having more race wins than seven-time world champion Hamilton - nine to eight - Verstappen would win the title if neither driver finished the race in Abu Dhabi this Sunday.\nThis has led to speculation that Verstappen could resort to ramming his rival off the track, while his dad Jos admitted that his son would do 'everything' to win the world title.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Nat Barr's tough message to Albo after recognising Palestine state\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"
