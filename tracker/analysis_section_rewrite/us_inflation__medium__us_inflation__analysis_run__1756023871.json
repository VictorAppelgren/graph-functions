      "feedback": "The draft does a credible, multi‑asset weave around AI productivity and private‑market themes, but it needs a disciplined 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and quantified links; tighten source discipline (only IDs from the material) and reconcile conflicts (AUVSI’s defunct figures vs the Grand Forks/UAS data). Actionable edits: 1) Build a formal 3–6 month scenario with a base case, and 1–2 alternate paths (e.g., “AI productivity drives 1–1.5% real‑GDP uplift and disinflation with gradual policy easing” per Range (UPV3X2MQ6); alternate where AI uptake stalls or inflation overshoots, reducing rate bets). 2) For each pillar add a catalyst, timing window, and invalidation signal: Range’s productivity data and its macro transmission (UPV3X2MQ6); Pacaso expansion and walled‑in liquidity dynamics (Pacaso metrics like 21% annual co‑ownership growth and the 10‑destination expansion; ticker PCSO) (UPV3X2MQ6); HeartSciences’ AI‑ECG regulatory/reimbursement trajectory and potential FDA clearance (ILYC1M41F, A8 not present; cite ILYC1M41F); UAS labor data from Grand Forks (FOM34PUWA); BoJ wage/market tightness implications (A7VLN74BK). 3) Quantify where possible and avoid hedging: anchor base‑case impact in 3–6 months to ranges from Range (1–1.5% productivity uplift) and Pacaso’s growth/expansion figures; quote HeartSciences’ market size ($32B ECG market by 2034) and Medicare reimbursement start (ILYC1M41F); note the Grand Forks salary level (~$106k) and 97% growth, with data gaps (FOM34PUWA). 4) Strengthen causal chain and flows: explain how AI productivity raises corporate capex, shifts capital toward tech/private assets, and supports private‑market valuations, then map to 3–6 month valuation read‑throughs (Range/Pacaso/HeartSciences) and potential disinflationary policy paths. 5) Explicitly flag conflicts and data caveats: drop reliance on defunct AUVSI numbers; emphasize measurement heterogeneity in UAS data and reporting lags (FOM34PUWA). 6) Expand watch‑list signals and risk flags: inflation prints, wage data (BoJ‑driven global spillovers via A7VLN74BK), regulatory milestones (HeartSciences FDA/Medicare), private‑market liquidity signals (Pacaso/PCSO, Mogul‑style platforms if referenced), and consumer sensitivity (V8TEZOR8R). 7) Improve structure so the base case ends with a concise base‑case valuation path and then 1–2 alternate outcomes with clearly stated triggers and invalidations; finish with a crisp confidence band and a one‑line synopsis of watch signals. 8) Tighten prose for SECTION FOCUS: explicitly call out the 3–6 month horizon, cluster all catalysts by date window, and end with base case, alts, risks, watch‑list signals, and confidence; ensure every assertion maps to one of the five IDs (V8TEZOR8R, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK).",
