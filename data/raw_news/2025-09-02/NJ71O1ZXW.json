However, the company isn\u2019t sure that shoppers, weary over long-term inflation, will accept, or what rivals aim to charge.\n\n\u201cEveryone is struggling to figure out what to do, what\u2019s the right decision, where do we set prices,\u201d Clifford Thompson, the company\u2019s president, told WSJ.\n\nAs the report noted, the impact of tariffs is a big question mark facing the economy. Thus far, the new levies haven\u2019t led to a jump in prices, largely because businesses have absorbed prices. But with pre-tariff inventories running out, companies are now facing tough decisions.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said recently that tariffs\u2019 impact on consumer prices \u201care now clearly visible\u201d in some product categories, and are expected to accumulate in coming months, the report added.\n\nWSJ also cited a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond which found that 38% of businesses were only slightly certain or not at all certain about the prices they will charge for the remainder of the year. Close to 60% were either slightly certain or not at all certain about the costs of materials for the rest of 2025.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence has also found businesses struggling in the face of the tariffs. For example, the report \u201cBrewing Storm\u201d shows that small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) with access to financing and readily available cash were 23% more likely to be very confident in their ability to navigate potential tariffs.\n\nBy contrast, SMBs with no access to financing were 75% more likely to have no plan to offset any additional costs stemming from tariffs. In all, 13% of SMBs had no access to any form of financing and believe their survival is at risk in the next two years.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play\u201d found a major shift in sentiment among U.S. middle-market firms, with more than 50% of payment heads at goods companies now believing tariffs will hurt their companies. This marks a sharp uptick from previous months, when positive and negative outlooks were evenly split at 35%.",

      "text": "That\u2019s according to a report Monday (Aug. 11) from Bloomberg News, citing research from Goldman Sachs.\nWhile U.S. companies have so far absorbed the brunt of the impact of the White House\u2019s tariffs, consumers will soon feel more pressure as companies raise prices, the bank\u2019s economists said.\nWhile consumers have \u2014 as of the end of June \u2014 absorbed roughly 22% of tariff costs, that figure will jump to 67% should the newest levies follow in the path of earlier tariffs, the economists said.\nThe Bloomberg report notes this will lead to faster inflation. The core personal consumer expenditure index, a key Federal Reserve inflation metric, is projected to reach 3.2% year-on-year in December, according to the Goldman report. The analysts said underlying inflation net of tariffs would be 2.4%, down from 2.8% in June.\nThe findings follow last week\u2019s release of the July 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations, from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Center for Microeconomic Data.\nThat report showed that while American consumers feel more optimistic about their finances, they are wary of several other economic factors, with their short- and long-term inflation expectations increasing.\nMeanwhile, research by PYMNTS Intelligence has been tracking the effect of tariffs on consumers. It found, among other things, that nearly a third of consumers had delayed or canceled discretionary buys such as electronics, home d\u00e9cor, or even back-to-school supplies.\nAnd 42% of the surveyed consumers said they now compare prices at three or more retailers before making a purchase, up from 27% in January.\nPYMNTS analysts caution that prolonged periods of out-of-stock items can \u201ctrain\u201d shoppers to regard once-routine purchases as risky, making thrift a long-term habit and eroding lifetime customer value for brands.\n\u201cTariffs are no longer an abstract policy lever,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last week. \u201cThey are a daily pain point at the checkout aisle. Retailers must brace for a consumer who is both price-sensitive and chronically unsure whether the product will even be on the shelf.\u201d\nAnd as covered here last week, the impact of tariffs could stretch beyond higher prices for product goods.\n\u201cFor bankers, payments networks and FinTech platforms, the era of tariffs affects trade\u2011finance credit, supply\u2011chain hedging and working\u2011capital automation,\u201d that report said. \u201cProduct heads must now address new calculations for budgeting capital, currency exposure and re-routing suppliers, functions that tap into fee\u2011generating services, from letters of credit to cross\u2011border virtual accounts to receivables\u2011backed deals.\u201d"

      "text": "August 22, 2025\nMonetary Policy and the Fed\u2019s Framework Review\nChair Jerome H. Powell\nAt \u201cLabor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,\u201d an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context of sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, the labor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time, the balance of risks appears to be shifting.\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the near-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term Outlook\nWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.1 Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year (figure 1).\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024 (figure 2).2 This slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.3 But it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market\u2014an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \"breakeven\" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024 (figure 3). The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation (figure 4).4\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived\u2014a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \"one-time\" does not mean \"all at once.\" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage\u2013price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside\u2014a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\nEvolution of Monetary Policy Framework\nTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals. This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.5\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.6\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u2014meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.7 To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period\u2014and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.8 The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting\u2014a \"makeup\" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.9 In particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance (figure 5).10 When it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\nElements of the Revised Consensus Statement\nThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive\u2014modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment (figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \"monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \"makeup\" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing down inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations promote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and limit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12 Further, they allow monetary policy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising price stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that \"price stability is essential for a sound and stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.\" This theme came through loud and clear at our Fed Listens events.13 The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate \"shortfalls,\" rather than \"deviations,\" from maximum employment. The use of \"shortfalls\" reflected the insight that our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment\u2014and hence of \"maximum employment\"\u2014are highly uncertain.14 The later years of the post-GFC recovery featured employment running for an extended period above mainstream estimates of its sustainable level, along with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target. In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to tighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.15\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term \"shortfalls\" was not always interpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of \"shortfalls\" was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed \"shortfalls\" from our statement. Instead, the revised document now states more precisely that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\" Of course, preemptive action would likely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability.\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\" This focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that \"durably achieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and benefits for all Americans.\" The feedback we received at Fed Listens events reinforced the value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and communities.\nFourth, consistent with the removal of \"shortfalls,\" we made changes to clarify our approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not complementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in promoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012 language. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the potentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level consistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as they did over the 2022\u201324 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience has shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern in household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some policy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a public review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. That frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so diligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual appearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak from this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve leaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we face. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than 40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n1. For example, after the July 2024 employment report, the 3-month average of the unemployment rate had increased more than 0.5 percentage point above its lowest value over the previous 12 months.

In early September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish a preliminary estimate of benchmark revisions to the level of nonfarm payrolls as of March 2025, based on data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Data available to date suggest that the level of nonfarm payrolls will be revised down materially. The final benchmark revision will be incorporated into the monthly employment data in February 2026.

Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing contributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above its average during the 2002\u201307 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In contrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage point, compared with the 2002\u201307 average of \u22120.25 percentage point.

      "text": "The current tariff landscape can be boiled down to one theme: uncertainty.\nAs several news outlets have reported, a new tranche of duties hit at 12:01 a.m. Thursday (Aug. 7), but many carve-outs and enforcement details remain cloudy, forcing governments to scramble for side deals while the White House sketches sector-specific levies that could soar to 250%.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Treasury has already booked $82 billion in tariff revenue in just three months, a 241% jump from a year ago. However, the path forward is anything but clear.\nThis comes as no surprise to PYMNTS readers. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s year-long \u201cUncertainty Project\u201d has turned its attention to the tariff issue since President Donald Trump took office. As the tariff picture continues to develop (or not), we thought it a good opportunity to summarize some of the PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s findings across four groups: consumers, SMBs, mid-market companies and CFOs. Below are the latest sector-specific insights.\nConsumers:\n- Sticker shock spreads beyond imports. June\u2019s \u201cStock Out\u201d survey found 47% of U.S. shoppers could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs disrupted supply chains or inflated price tags.\n- Regressive impact intensifies. Millennials and Generation Z consumers, who rely heavily on lower-priced imports, face a tariff-related cost burden 1.6 times higher than that of baby boomers, according to the same report.\n- Trading down becomes the default. Nearly one-third of respondents delayed or canceled discretionary buys \u2014 electronics, home d\u00e9cor, even back-to-school supplies \u2014 while 42% said they now compare prices at three or more retailers before purchasing, up from 27% in January. Psychological scarring looms, the report says. PYMNTS analysts warn that prolonged out-of-stocks can \u201ctrain\u201d shoppers to regard once-routine purchases as risky, embedding thrift into long-term habits and eroding lifetime customer value for brands.\n- Takeaway: Tariffs are no longer an abstract policy lever. They are a daily pain point at the checkout aisle. Retailers must brace for a consumer who is both price-sensitive and chronically unsure whether the product will even be on the shelf.\nSmall- to Medium-Size Businesses:\nSurvival anxiety deepens. In \u201cBrewing Storm,\u201d we found 13% of SMBs lack access to any form of financing and believe their survival is at risk in the next two years, an 86% increase compared to the 6.9% of all SMBs surveyed who express this concern.\n- Precarious reliance: Half of SMBs currently depend solely on their daily sales or owners\u2019 personal savings for survival, indicating a limited financial safety net in a volatile operating environment.\n- Tariff preparedness gap: SMBs with access to financing and readily available cash are 23% more likely to be very confident in their ability to navigate potential tariffs. In contrast, SMBs without access to financing are 75% more likely to have no plan in place to help offset any additional costs arising from tariffs.\n- Counterintuitive disconnect: Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 SMBs that lack any access to financing paradoxically claim they do not need it. This finding is highlighted as counterintuitive given that survival in an uncertain business environment often depends on timely access to funding.\nMid-Market Businesses:\n\u201cTariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play\u201d reveals a significant shift in sentiment among U.S. middle-market firms, with more than half of heads of payments at goods firms now believing tariffs will negatively impact their companies. This represents a sharp increase from previous months, when positive and negative outlooks were equally split at 35%. In contrast, services firms remain largely ambivalent regarding the tariffs\u2019 effects.\n- Supply chain concerns: The study highlights widespread concerns over supply chain disruptions, with nearly 9 in 10 goods firms anticipating product delivery delays or shortages and higher raw material costs due to tariffs. These expectations have climbed 9 percentage points since February, indicating increasing strain on supply chains for physical goods.\n- No confidence vote: Confidence in managing these potential disruptions remains low across sectors. Only 35% of heads of payments at both goods and services companies expressed strong confidence in their firms\u2019 ability to adapt to supply chain challenges. Furthermore, 1 in 4 heads of payments surveyed reported being not or only slightly confident in their firm\u2019s adaptability.\n- Pressure: In response to tariff pressures, middle-market firms are actively adapting their strategies. For goods firms, 63% plan to renegotiate pricing with existing suppliers, and 53% intend to replace overseas providers with domestic ones. Despite these proactive steps, a notable portion of firms have taken no action, including 16% of goods firms and 24% of services firms, with this figure rising to 27% for high-uncertainty firms.\n- Takeaway: Mid-market CEOs call 2025 \u201cthe reset year.\u201d Growth bets are shelved in favor of liquidity hoarding, defensive tech and supply-chain relays \u2014 moves that help them survive today but risk dulling competitive edge tomorrow.\nChief Product Officers:\nOur report, \u201cThe CAIO Report: Tariff Turbulence: Product Leaders Shift Strategy to Blunt Fallout,\u201d reveals crucial insights into how companies of varying sizes are perceiving and responding to current trade policies. It found that pessimism surges among the largest firms: Eighty percent of product leaders at the largest U.S. enterprises, defined as those with annual revenues exceeding $10 billion, now anticipate mostly or completely negative impacts from tariffs. This represents a significant 24 percentage point increase in pessimism since May, when 56% expected similar outcomes.\n- Universal expectation of disruptions for largest companies: One hundred percent of the largest enterprises are bracing for specific negative consequences, including costs associated with reconfiguring supply chains, shortages or delays in acquiring necessary products, and difficulties with exports. Furthermore, all of these large firms also anticipate potential layoffs or reduced hiring.\n- Proactive measures: In response to tariff pressures, most of the largest enterprises are actively implementing strategies. Specifically, 57% are reducing operational costs, while 50% are negotiating better prices with their suppliers and 50% are adopting just-in-time inventory strategies to manage their stock more tightly.\n- Emerging opportunities: Despite widespread concerns, the report indicates some positive outlooks. Ninety-two percent of all surveyed enterprises anticipate positive impacts from new opportunities to support local economies. Additionally, 82% expect enhanced supply chain resilience as a result of adapting to the current trade environment.\n- Takeaway: The finance suite is the new nerve center for tariff strategy, toggling between cash-flow triage and real-time scenario modeling. Yet PYMNTS warns of a bifurcation: proactive CFOs sprint ahead with contingency playbooks, while a sizable minority remain frozen just when foresight is most valuable.\nAcross every layer of the economy, PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s Uncertainty Project paints the same picture: tariffs have shifted from macro headline to micro reality. From checkout aisles to boardrooms, the new mantra is conserve, delay, hedge \u2014 and hope clarity arrives before cash runs out."

      "text": "American businesses are reportedly absorbing most of the cost of new U.S. tariffs.\nIn recent earnings reports, General Motors said it paid $1 billion in tariffs in the second quarter, Stellantis said it paid $350 million and Hasbro said it expects to pay $60 million during the full fiscal year, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Thursday (July 24).\nLast month, Nike said it expects tariffs to cost it $1 billion during the current fiscal year, according to the report.\nCompanies have been cautious about raising their prices to make up for the costs of tariffs because they could lose market share to competitors who don\u2019t raise prices, because the tariffs may be temporary and, in some cases, because they don\u2019t want to draw the ire of President Donald Trump, the report said.\nWhen Walmart said in May that it would raise some prices, Trump posted online that the company and China should instead \u201ceat the tariffs,\u201d per the report.\nIn addition, some companies increased their inventory ahead of the tariffs to avoid that cost, according to the report.\nWhile most of the cost of tariffs has been borne by American companies, the report said some foreign suppliers have trimmed their prices and some companies have increased the price paid by consumers, as evidenced by the June inflation reading rising from 2.4% in May to 2.7% in June, the report said.\nCompanies are also working to offset the cost of tariffs by cutting other costs, shifting their purchasing to new suppliers and introducing new products, per the report.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence and Visa Acceptance Solutions collaboration \u201cConsumer Tariff Sentiment: Informed Americans Are Skeptical of the Benefits\u201d found that while large retailers have the ability to navigate the challenges posed by tariffs, smaller businesses may struggle.\nThe report also found that retailers are experimenting with \u201cgood, better, best\u201d product tiers that include both premium domestic products and lower-priced imports; providing origin transparency that reassures buyers about the cost-value proposition of local manufacturing; and using artificial intelligence to segment customers not just by purchase history but values alignment, delivering personalized offers based on a shopper\u2019s inferred beliefs about sustainability, nationalism or price sensitivity.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter."

      "text": "Cash flow is always top of mind for any business. That\u2019s even more true when economic, policy and regulatory conditions shift. As the Trump administration applies sweeping global tariffs, consumers are pulling back on spending. Along with uncertainty about the levies\u2019 longer-term status, the rapid changes are creating a newly volatile operating environment that is severely pressuring some enterprises. Fewer than 1 in 2 U.S. small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) currently have access to any form of financing, new PYMTS Intelligence data shows. Thirteen percent with no access to financing consider their survival at risk in the next two years. Overall, 6.9% think they might not survive.\nWhile such pessimism pervades nearly 20% of smaller businesses, the situation is potentially precarious for half. Some 50% currently rely solely on their daily sales or owners\u2019 personal savings to survive. By contrast, those with business credit cards report high levels of satisfaction. Meanwhile, others that can\u2019t secure financing through mainstream credit sources\u2014perhaps because they\u2019re seen as high risk or don\u2019t have sufficient collateral\u2014often turn to riskier options, such as unsecured loans or personal credit cards. It should thus come as no surprise that businesses with access to traditional sources of financing are more confident in their ability to navigate current economic headwinds and their chances of survival in the long term.\nAt the same time, many SMBs that lack access to any form of financing, whether traditional or alternative, also claim not to need it. That is a counterintuitive finding amid an uncertain business environment where survival depends on the ability to tap timely funding.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cBrewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report. This edition examines SMBs\u2019 access to and use of varied financing sources. The report draws on insights from a survey of 560 SMBs conducted from Feb. 5, 2025, to Feb. 12, 2025.\nSurvival at Risk\nOne in five SMBs are worried about staying open.\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that businesses without access to traditional financing are much less confident in their ability to adapt to a changing economic environment and remain in operation. During the survey in early to mid-February, some 6.9% of all SMBs said they were unlikely to survive the next two years. This figure spikes to 13% among SMBs without access to financing, an 86% increase.\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that 44% of SMBs had access to any form of financing. Just 36% had access to readily available cash, including another 8% that also had cash in the bank.\nFewer than 3 in 10, or 28%, of all SMBs have business credit cards. But those cardholders are satisfied with that form of financing. Sixty-four percent of businesses with access to any form of financing use their corporate cards to withdraw money for business operations. The cards offer SMBs many advantages, allowing them to access cash on a moment\u2019s notice for generally low fees, as long as repayments are made on time. Four in 10 businesses with access to financing use personal credit cards held by their owners. This is a riskier financing method as it intertwines the owner\u2019s personal and business finances. Instability in either area could potentially wreck the owner\u2019s or their company\u2019s financial well-being.\nTwenty-eight percent of SMBs used other financing sources, such as bank loans or investment assets. These credit options carry risks, such as higher fees or penalties if repayments aren\u2019t made promptly.\nSignificantly, most SMBs did not have access to any financing. Such businesses instead relied solely on money from day-to-day sales or cash in the bank for survival. These SMBs have little to no safety net in the event of economic changes or declining revenue. A single slow business day could potentially jeopardize vendor payments or payroll, putting their financial future in peril. PYMNTS Intelligence found that 16% of SMBs did not have access to cash. Four in 10 had only cash in the bank. Specific industries are more vulnerable than others. For example, 64% of hotel, restaurant and entertainment companies\u2019 sole financing option was cash they had in the bank.\nThe more precarious a business\u2019s financial health, the more likely it correlates with financing access. More than 1 in 3, or 35%, of SMBs with decreasing revenue had no access to cash in the bank or readily available cash, compared to just 8% of firms with increasing revenue. Banks and credit card providers are more willing to extend credit to successful businesses, as there is a greater chance of them making repayments on time.\nSMBs Weigh Risky Financing Options\nBusiness credit cards are a favorite source of financing, but many SMBs turn to riskier options when they are desperate.\nBusiness credit cards are clearly the favorite option for SMBs with access to financing. This is because these cards offer instant access to cash up to a credit limit at any time. Our research finds that 44% of SMBs with access to financing used these cards in the last 12 months, with no other source of financing used by more than 15% of these firms\u2014a testament to the cards\u2019 reputation for convenience and reliability among SMB owners. SMBs see business credit cards as a safety net. These cards are popular with businesses regardless of their optimism about survival. Forty-four percent of SMBs who said it was very likely they would survive the next two years used such cards. That\u2019s similar to the 45% of those who said their survival was somewhat likely and 40% who said the chances of survival were slim or not at all likely.\nDespite business credit cards being the top financing choice, SMBs that were more pessimistic about their long-term survival were much more likely to use riskier sources of financing as they maxed out their card limits. Twenty-seven percent of businesses that said it was unlikely they would survive the next two years used personal credit cards. Some 19% used unsecured bank loans, which typically have higher interest rates.\nIn general, companies with lower revenues were more likely to use personal credit sources for financing. Owners of firms with $150,000 or less in annual revenue used personal loans, personal investment assets, loans from employees, loans from family and friends and home mortgages much more often compared to firms with higher revenues. Each of these options carries personal and reputational risk, but businesses this cash-poor often do not qualify for better options.\nFinancing for Navigating Economic Troubles\nSMBs with access to financing are more confident in their ability to weather economic turbulence.\nHaving access to cash and financing means that a business can continue to pay its vendors, make payroll and cover other day-to-day functionalities, even if revenues slow down. One example of this can be seen in SMBs\u2019 plans to navigate potential tariffs. Businesses with access to financing and cash are 23% more likely to be very confident in their ability to navigate tariffs compared to those who do not have access to financing or cash. Meanwhile, SMBs that do not have access to financing are 75% more likely to have no plan to help offset any additional costs from tariffs.\nBusinesses in different industries also said they would deploy different tactics to combat the adverse effects of tariffs. The retail industry is the most likely to replace foreign suppliers with domestic ones, with 36% of retailers saying they would leverage this strategy. Hotels and restaurants said they would negotiate with suppliers and use alternative materials. Professional services firms were the least likely to have a plan to respond to tariffs. However, those businesses rely the least on imported goods and are the least likely to be directly affected by the levies.\nSMBs Cope With Lack of Financing\nMany SMBs claim not to need financing. But they also don\u2019t have access to it.\nBusinesses have many reasons for not using credit financing, ranging from high fees and interest rates (cited by 27% of survey respondents) to high repayments (17%) to concerns about data security (8%). The most oft-cited reason was lack of need. We found that 43% of SMBs that did not use any financing in the past 12 months said they did not require it. Surprisingly, 3 in 4 SMBs without any access to financing claimed they did not need it.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving SMB growth.

Uncertainty clouds short-term outlooks for trade, consumer spending and the economy, and companies must decide how to respond.\nPYMNTS Intelligence surveyed the heads of payments at U.S. middle-market firms generating annual revenues between $100 million and $1 billion in late March. At the time, the April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement was approaching, but no one knew exactly what that meant. Companies still largely don\u2019t, amid a bourgeoning U.S.-China trade war, constant adjustments for some levies on major trading partners and mixed signals about \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on nearly all countries. \u201cPervasive\u201d uncertainty, as the Federal Reserve called it, leaves the picture as muddy now as when we collected the data.\nMeanwhile, warning signs are building. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first quarterly contraction since 2022, and things could quickly worsen. The levies would broadly increase prices on everything from toys and electronics to luxury watches and cars, and crimp consumer spending. This hit would have knock-on effects for businesses, jobs and investments. PYMNTS Intelligence recently estimated that even a mild decline in consumer spending could vaporize $92 billion per year from the economy.\nMore than half of the heads of payments we surveyed in goods verticals believe tariffs will be bad for their companies, a sharp increase from the previous month. These firms are bracing for supply chain disruptions, with about 9 in 10 expecting product delivery delays or shortages and higher raw material costs. Respondents at services firms, which rely less on imports, are generally more ambivalent, but still flag many concerns of their own.\nThese are just some of the key findings in \u201cTariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence study conducted from March 1, 2025, through March 27, 2025. Data was collected from a survey of 60 heads of payments, each representing a U.S. company with annual revenue between $100 million and $1 billion.\nMore than half of heads of payments at goods firms say that tariffs will have a negative impact.\nMiddle-market firms are increasingly bracing for negative impacts from the tariffs. Among heads of payments at companies in the goods space, just over 1 in 2 believe the levies will be negative for them. Meanwhile, roughly 1 in 5 expect positive outcomes. The scales have tipped heavily since February, when the positive and negative camps were equally split, at 35%.\nServices firms, meanwhile, remain more ambivalent and show little change from the prior month. Only slightly more of the heads of payments foresee negative impacts, at 27%, than positive ones, at just under 1 in 4. The growing divide between the outlooks of firms in goods verticals and those in services reflects the direct threat that tariffs pose to physical goods and products imported from abroad, with ripple effects across supply chains for many retail and manufacturing businesses.\nFor goods, the survey covered companies in construction or building materials, food and beverage distribution, manufacturing and retail and wholesale trade. For services, it covered companies in advertising and media services, business services (law, accounting, consulting and employment), education, finance and insurance, healthcare, real estate, travel and transportation, warehousing and waste management. The survey\u2019s sample size (60 respondents) did not meet the threshold for a confident analysis of the technology sector.\nSupply Chain Strain\nMost heads of payments at middle-market firms expect supply chain disruptions, with those at goods firms especially concerned about shortages, shipping delays and higher prices for raw materials due to tariffs.\nMid-sized companies widely expect supply chain disruptions and rising costs, and those fears increasingly appear justified. Major U.S. ports are sounding alarms about precipitous drops in import volumes, and Walmart, Target and Home Depot CEOs reportedly warned Trump of product shortages and higher prices.\nFirst-quarter financial results from some of the world\u2019s largest companies also indicate rising prices and an impending downturn. For example, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton saw global sales dip 3% in the first three months. The luxury goods and alcoholic beverage giant warned it might raise prices and will reportedly cut 1,200 jobs. Meanwhile, McDonald\u2019s posted its largest quarterly sales decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 3.6% drop in U.S. sales. Chris Kempczinski, its CEO, stated that customers are \u201cgrappling with uncertainty.\u201d\nHeads of payments at middle-market goods firms show especially strong concern, with nearly 9 in 10 expecting shortages or delays in getting products delivered to them and the same predicting higher raw material costs. In both cases, these shares have climbed 9 percentage points since February. At 68%, most goods firms expect difficulty exporting due to retaliatory measures by other countries.\nFor services firms, higher material costs are the most widely expected negative impact, at 64%. Most also cite product delays or shortages, at 55%. The fact that most services firms worry about these issues, which on the surface would seem to impact only the goods space, underscores the complex and interconnected nature of today\u2019s middle-market businesses.\nWhile tariffs\u2019 negative impacts loom largest, most heads of payments expect benefits as well. Nearly two-thirds of firms, 63% for goods firms and 64% for services companies, say the levies will create opportunities to support local economies. Enhanced supply chain reliance stands out as another expected benefit, cited by 53% of goods firms and 42% of services firms.\nLack of Confidence\nOne in four heads of payments surveyed lack confidence about their firms\u2019 ability to handle supply chain disruptions from tariffs.\nJust like the fluidity of policy signals on tariffs, companies have shifting assessments of their ability to deal with the related supply chain challenges. Overall, only 35% of the heads of payment at both goods and services companies expressed strong confidence that their firms can adapt to these disruptions, a dip from 38% in the prior month. But the picture is nuanced, reflecting the shape of uncertainty at companies lacking strong confidence. Four in 10 feel somewhat confident, up slightly from 35% a month earlier, and 1 in 4 say they are not or only slightly confident, down from 27% a month earlier.\nRespondents at goods companies are somewhat less likely than those at services firms to express high levels of confidence in their firm\u2019s ability to adapt to supply chain disruptions. Meanwhile, high-uncertainty firms are now much more likely to have little or no confidence in this area, at 40%, compared to around 20% for low- and medium-uncertainty firms.\nPushing Back on Suppliers\nIn response to tariff pressures, middle-market firms widely plan to push back on their suppliers by renegotiating, diversifying and shifting to domestic providers.\nWith some new levies already implemented and others pending, most heads of payments say their firms will take steps to mitigate disruption. For goods firms, the most common response is to renegotiate pricing with existing suppliers, at 63%. Most also plan to replace overseas providers with domestic ones, at 53%, while 26% say they will diversify their international suppliers. Meanwhile, 37% of goods firms plan to stockpile inventory before certain levies kick in, up substantially from 30% in February.\nTurning to services providers, reducing operational costs stands as the most common response for nearly 3 in 4 firms. This likely means cutting jobs in many cases, as workers are typically the largest cost for services firms. Most services companies also plan to diversify their international providers, at 53%, with another 18% switching to domestic ones. Meanwhile, nearly half will renegotiate with their existing suppliers.\nNotably, many firms \u2014 16% for goods and 24% for services \u2014 have still taken no action. For high-uncertainty firms, this climbs to 27%. (These questions were posed for the first time in the March survey covered in this report.) These findings underscore that many firms lack confidence about how to respond to the fast-moving and unpredictable tariff situation. Meanwhile, consumers are growing increasingly pessimistic, with confidence now at a five-year low, The Conference Board, a nonprofit think tank for leading companies, said last week.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on how the tariff situation impacts businesses.
