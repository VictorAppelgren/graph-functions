      "summary": "Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, used a bilateral meeting with UK’s Keir Starmer to underscore his stance on migration, climate action, and EU foreign policy. He framed migration as an economic driver, criticized the EU’s muted response to Gaza, and warned that the US under Trump is eroding the post‑WWII global order. Sánchez also highlighted Spain’s refusal to meet Trump’s 5% defence‑spending target and the potential for tariffs, while calling for greater solidarity and consistency in tackling climate change. His remarks signal a push for a more assertive EU stance and a re‑evaluation of Spain’s role in global affairs.",
