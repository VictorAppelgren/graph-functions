      "feedback": "Strong cross‑topic framing, but the piece needs a tighter, causal, numbers‑driven map from policy/regime to asset prices and a sharper, implementable watch-list. Actionable edits: (1) construct a clear, three‑pillar causal chain anchored to Regime A: Fed easing (50bp cut in Sep; ~150–175bp by year‑end) → front end/term structure easing → softer USD and range‑bound equities/gold; then tariffs/deregulation/CHIPS/equity framework → hit to margins, capex, and valuation multiples; oil/energy dynamics feed inflation/real rates and risk premia; (2) translate every driver into explicit, sourced numbers (cite Regime A numbers for the base‑case; 4.2–4.3% for the 10Y; 1.8–2.2% dividend yields; 12–18% justness premium; 2.5 mbpd 2025 supply rise; 90‑day tariff truce extension; 50bp/150–175bp as above); (3) separate near‑term (Q4) vs. longer‑term (2025+) scenarios, with a formal base case, a tariff/energy shock path, and an AI/productivity upside path, plus explicit invalidation/trigger points; (4) replace or tightly contextualize the “IBM hiring pause” signal with a more robust productivity/capex trigger (e.g., margin‑driven capex discipline, software/automation uptake) and quantify its potential offset to capex costs; (5) tighten the oil/energy logic: state the IEA/J99EM2TPZ forecast plainly, link to inflation/real rates and risk premia, and show how energy re‑pricing would re‑price equities; (6) sharpen the watch‑list into five decisive signals with thresholds (e.g., tariff extension outcomes, IEA inventory/data releases, move in 10Y yield range, dividend‑yield/justness premium moves, and a tangible AI‑driven margin/NPv shift); (7) ensure every quantitative claim has a source ID and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., energy oversupply vs demand softness) with a single narrative thread; (8) prune or properly contextualize the U.S. urban crime dynamics paragraph unless a direct, material market channel is shown; (9) avoid multi‑parenthetical clutter by integrating citations into the sentence flow; (10) ensure the output remains within the intended length/format by collapsing redundant phrasing and aligning with SECTION FOCUS—synthesize macro/policy/flows/valuation into a single coherent framework and present a crisp horizon‑centric watch list.",
