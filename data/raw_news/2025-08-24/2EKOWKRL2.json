  "title": "The Liverpool-Newcastle rivalry has entered a bitter new era",
  "description": "From the 1990\u2019s 4-3 thrillers to the Isak transfer saga this summer, clubs are now direct competitors and tension will be high on Monday",
  "content": "It is a fixture synonymous with the drama and entertainment of the Premier League, a match that once encapsulated everything that helped establish football\u2019s most popular domestic competition. Newcastle United versus Liverpool was not a rivalry as such \u2013 the two clubs had last been on a level footing way back into the 1970s \u2013 but it caught the zeitgeist of early era Premier League. Liverpool, for so long the pre-eminent force in English and European club football, were in decline; a fading force, who had been overtaken by Manchester United and were in the formative years of a three decade-long wait to be champions of England once more. Newcastle, by contrast, were on the rise. After so long an irrelevance in the national football conversation, as they bounced between top and second tier, their promotion to the newly-formed Premier League in 1993 captured the imagination of football\u2019s new and expanding audiences. Under former Liverpool player Kevin Keegan they were \u201cThe Entertainers\u201d, a big-spending, ambitious and extremely confident football club, with a team that played the most exciting, attacking and brave football in the division. It was football without brakes; the ultimate \u201cwe will score one more goal than you\u201d philosophy. They were all in. They did not win anything, but they won hearts and minds.\n\nThis was what Newcastle\u2019s current manager Eddie Howe thought of when he applied for the job back in 2021. Now aged 47, it was Keegan\u2019s Newcastle that tugged at his heart strings; the Newcastle he had watched as a teenager. For that generation, Newcastle\u2019s games against Liverpool epitomised the new swagger of English football: high-scoring and highly entertaining. The aristocrats of the English game against the nouveaux riches. We lapped it up, the two successive 4-3 games \u2013 both won by Liverpool \u2013 going a long way to costing Newcastle the title. One was named the greatest Premier League game of the 1990s, with the image of Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings, as Liverpool scored a late winner, etched into history.\n\nNewcastle should have shut up shop and held on for a point at Anfield. Instead, they kept on attacking, looking for a winner. Romanticism over pragmatism, that was the Keegan way. Newcastle burned hot, but quickly faded. Liverpool, even when unable to win the league, continued to win trophies under G\u00e9rard Houllier and Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Newcastle faded into the background and, under Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership between 2009 and 2021, back into irrelevance. Liverpool barely noticed them, unless they were buying their players. For Peter Beardsley in 1987, read Andy Carroll in 2011 or Georginio Wijnaldum in 2016. There was no rivalry to speak of. Liverpool, as they had been in the 1970s and 80s, were competing and operating on a different level. That changed in October 2021 when Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) took a controlling stake in Newcastle. A month later, Howe was appointed manager. What has followed in the four years since, has been a rapid ascension from relegation battlers to Champions League contenders and trophy winners. Newcastle\u2019s victory over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final in March was the culmination of a plan, devised by Howe and the ownership when he took the job.\n\nFor the second time in three years, Newcastle will be playing in the Champions League this season and are, as they were under Keegan and briefly under Sir Bobby Robson, a clear and present danger to the \u201cBig Six\u201d. We must be careful not to create fake rivalries in football and avoid conflating healthy competition with conflict, but there is no doubt Liverpool have been rattled by Newcastle\u2019s surge. It started under former Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who perceived the arrival of another club owned by an oil state, following the dramatic transformations of Manchester City and Paris St-Germain, as a danger. He took pot shots at them in press conferences, scolding Newcastle\u2019s former sporting director, Dan Ashworth, for opining there was \u201cno ceiling\u201d on the club\u2019s ambition under PIF. Klopp, preaching to his disciples, argued Liverpool did have a ceiling and could not spend as much money under their owners Fenway Sports Group. Given the Premier League\u2019s profitability and sustainability rules (PSR), combined with the new ones brought in to curb associated party sponsorship deals immediately after the Newcastle takeover, were in put in place specifically to prevent Newcastle spending their owner\u2019s money in the same way City and Chelsea had done before them, the jibe struck a nerve on Tyneside. There was tension too on the touchline. Relations between Klopp, Howe and his assistant Jason Tindall, were fractious. There was a lot of bickering when the teams played each other. It was Klopp, sources have told Telegraph Sport, who prompted Howe\u2019s infamous statement that his Newcastle team were there to compete, not be liked. Liverpool remained the superior side \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s Carabao Cup win was the first time Howe had beaten them as Newcastle manager \u2013 but there is no doubt a new era had begun. Which brings us to the here and now. When Newcastle entertain Liverpool at St James\u2019 Park, they will do so fuelled by a mixture of anger and defiance. It will be a molten cauldron under the lights and the rest of the country, as they once did in the 90s, will be transfixed. There is bitterness and acrimony. Although Klopp\u2019s successor, Arne Slot, has been nothing but respectful in the way he has spoken about Newcastle, and particularly Howe, tension over transfers has cranked things up. What better way to deal with a new, emerging threat than weaken them by signing their best players. Of all of the 19 transfers between Newcastle and Liverpool, none have created the sort of animosity that the latter\u2019s attempt to sign Alexander Isak has done this summer. Last year, Liverpool were interested in signing Anthony Gordon, a boyhood Liverpool fan. With Newcastle in danger of a PSR breach in June, the board was desperate. Talks over the sale of Gordon were instigated by Newcastle, but a bid was never made. Newcastle solved their issues and when Liverpool returned later that summer, their approach was firmly rebuffed. Gordon, though, had been affected. He wanted to sign for the club he had supported as a boy. His head had been turned. Gordon was not the same player last season as the hangover from that disappointment lingered.\n\nFast forward 12 months and it has been all about Isak. A transfer saga that began on social media, with the new breed of transfer experts whipping things up, gradually filtered into the mainstream media in mid July, when a rather strange story appeared saying Liverpool had let Newcastle know they would be willing to pay \u00a3120m for Isak if they were willing to let him leave. Newcastle had maintained all year that Isak\u2019s asking price would be in excess of \u00a3150m and were adamant the Sweden international was not for sale. The asking price was specifically designed to send that message \u2013 which came directly from PIF. In the background, though, Liverpool knew Isak wanted to go and wanted to play for them. Newcastle remained defiant, they had, as they always planned, dug in and resisted. What has transpired since is a complete breakdown in the player\u2019s relationship with his employer as Isak continues to demand that he is allowed to leave.\n\nAfter a bid of \u00a3110m was rejected almost a month ago, Liverpool backed off given the ferocity of Newcastle\u2019s rejection, but Isak and his agent have done everything in their power to force his way out since. The forward is currently on strike, refusing to play and even released a statement last week in which he claimed promises had been broken and it was in the best interests of everyone to let him go. Newcastle responded quickly, denying any promises were made and, to all extents and purposes, ruled out a transfer in this window. The statement was led by PIF. From a Liverpool perspective, they have done nothing wrong, other than bid for a player they admire, who they know wants to play for them. They are, sources have stressed, perfectly entitled to make a bid reflecting their own interpretation of his worth and fair market value. Newcastle are, in turn, entitled to reject it. It is not conflict, it is merely the business of football.\n\nNewcastle, at least privately, perceive things rather differently. They feel Liverpool have deliberately unsettled their player and the agent has, with their tacit support, encouraged Isak to behave appallingly in order to force them to sell well below their valuation. Liverpool deny they have done any such thing. Newcastle still believe it is an attempt to bully them into doing something they have never intended to do this summer \u2013 sell Isak on the cheap, severely weakening themselves and directly strengthening a club they now see as a rival. After all, if Liverpool had really backed off, would Isak still be clinging on to the idea the move can happen before deadline day? This is the backdrop to Newcastle playing Liverpool on Monday night. Isak will not be involved, Newcastle will be considerably weaker on the pitch as a result. He has burned so many bridges, the path to redemption on Tyneside is a hugely difficult one. He has insulted the club he still plays for and the manager who helped turn him into one of Europe\u2019s best strikers. Howe\u2019s side will also have to face the player, Hugo Ekitike, they tried to sign to play alongside Isak this season. It is one of the strange quirks of this drama that, had Ekitike signed for Newcastle in July, they may well have been more open to letting Isak leave for Liverpool, especially if they had offered something close to \u00a3150m.",

  "summary": "The Liverpool-Newcastle rivalry has entered a new era, with the two teams having previously been on a level footing since the 1970s. Liverpool, once dominant in English and European club football, was losing ground to Manchester United. Newcastle, however, was on the rise, becoming known as \"The Entertainers\" under former Liverpool player Kevin Keegan. The team's high-scoring and aggressive play against Liverpool won hearts and minds, but Newcastle faded into the background under Mike Ashley's ownership between 2009 and 2021. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) took a controlling stake in Newcastle and Howe was appointed manager a month later. Since then, Newcastle has risen from relegation battlers to Champions League contenders and trophy winners. Despite this, Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp has criticised Newcastle's spending, arguing there is no ceiling on the club\u2019s ambition under their Fenway Sports Group owners.",

  "argos_summary": "The article traces the evolution of the Newcastle\u2011Liverpool rivalry from the 1990s, when Newcastle\u2019s attacking style under Kevin Keegan captivated fans, to the present day when the club\u2019s takeover by Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF and the appointment of Eddie Howe have turned them into a serious Premier League contender. It highlights how Liverpool\u2019s decline in the early 2000s contrasted with Newcastle\u2019s resurgence, and how the two teams now clash not only on the pitch but also in transfer negotiations, most notably the high\u2011profile dispute over Alexander Isak. The piece argues that the Isak saga has intensified tensions, with Liverpool accused of pressuring the player and Newcastle viewing it as an attempt to weaken them. The upcoming match at St James\u2019 Park is framed as a battleground where emotions run high, with Newcastle eager to prove their newfound strength and Liverpool wary of the emerging threat.",
