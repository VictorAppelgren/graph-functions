  "content": "According to Mr Robinson, the windmill trust started four years ago and aimed to manage the windmill and outbuildings as a \"thriving tourist attraction\".\n\nELDC had promised money for a new caf\u00e9, visitor centre and shop after the authority successfully received \u00a31.2m of levelling up funding.\n\nThe money had been allocated from an \u00a38m government grant for the Lincolnshire Wolds Culture and Heritage Programme.\n\nIn December 2024 funding was withdrawn by ELDC.\n\nDistrict Councillor Graham Marsh said funding was reallocated to Alford Manor House as the grant had to be spent by September 2026.\n\nMarsh said it became \"quite clear\" restoration work for the outbuildings at the site could not be completed in time.\n\nAccording to Marsh, \u00a3800,000 was still available to fund work on the outbuildings but the district council needed \"level of guarantee\" of funding from Lincolnshire County Council to repair the windmill.\n\n\"Without a working windmill there, there is no prospect of that being a viable site,\" he said.\n\nIn a joint statement, Councillor Natalie Oliver, LCC's portfolio holder for culture, and Councillor Liam Kelly, the authority's portfolio holder for property, said: \"As a new leadership team, we've come into the council with a fresh pair of eyes and have asked officers to present the different options and costs associated with the various windmills owned by the county council.\n\n\"Protecting our heritage assets is important, as is making sure we are using taxpayers' money to the best effect. We'll be considering the options for windmills at a meeting later in the year.\"",

      "text": "Volunteers 'devastated' as windmill funding pulled\n- Published\nVolunteers say they are \"absolutely devastated\" by a decision to withdraw \u00a31.2m of funding from a windmill restoration project.\nEast Lindsey District Council (ELDC) had promised the money for a new cafe, visitor centre and shop at Alford Windmill.\nBut the councillor in charge of the project said ELDC had \"little choice but to pause the scheme\" because the owners of the windmill, Lincolnshire County Council (LCC), had no \"commitment to restore\" the mill itself.\nLCC said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision, but its \"hands are tied slightly on timescales\".\nThe money had been allocated from an \u00a38m government grant for the Lincolnshire Wolds Culture and Heritage Programme.\nELDC previously said the plans would help to secure the future of the windmill. But the council has now \"agreed to reallocate the money\".\nDoug Porter-Robinson, of the Alford Windmill Trust, which has been hoping to manage the windmill and outbuildings as a visitor attraction, said the \"devastating\" news followed \"delay after delay\".\n\"We're so disappointed,\" he added. \"We just look at each other wondering what we're going to do now.\n\"It's just a catastrophic mistake. The people who will lose out are the people of Alford.\"\nELDC said the government funding had to be used by March 2026. It had \"been left with little choice but to look again\" at how to use the money.\nCouncillor Graham Marsh, the deputy leader of ELDC, said the mill was \"the anchor for this whole project\".\n\"Without a working mill \u2013 and a commitment to restore it from the owners \u2013 the whole site has no main attraction,\" he added.\nRemaining funds will now go towards the Alford Manor project, where a new function room and other improvements are planned, amid hopes that more funding for the windmill will be found.\nMarsh claimed the deterioration of the mill meant \"the projected cost of the repair is \u00a31.2m\".\nCouncillor Richard Butroid, executive member for corporate property at LCC, said: \"We have recognised additional inflationary costs, but this does not diminish our disappointment that East Lindsey have withdrawn their funding for Alford Windmill.\"\n\"Nevertheless, the \u00a3460,000 we have allocated to the project remains committed, as well as our intention to repair the building.\"\nMr Porter-Robinson said: \"It baffles me that Lincolnshire County Council and East Lindsey District Council haven't worked in harmony on this project.\n\"We've been spectators all the way through this until the funding has now been pulled.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external."
