  "title": "ICE raids are keeping workers from their jobs\u2014and businesses are suffering",
  "description": "Trump\u2019s aggressive enforcement against immigrants is affecting their ability to work\u2014and hurting the businesses that rely on them.",
  "content": "California\u2014and other states across the country\u2014rely heavily on the labor of immigrants. Many of those workers are living in fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, making it harder to do their jobs. Experts say this fear is restricting the rights of all workers and hurting the state\u2019s broader economy. Capital & Main spoke to workers and an employer in California about how President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against immigrants is affecting their ability to work. All of them requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the federal government. The restaurant owner said traffic to his business dropped immediately after ICE officials targeted another restaurant, Buona Forchetta, in a highly visible operation that drew community protest and a violent response from ICE.\n\nSince then, the owner said, his sales have dropped by 30% to 40% because immigrant customers aren\u2019t leaving their homes except for essential tasks like work. The owner, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, said one of his workers self-deported at the beginning of the Trump administration and another is out on maternity leave. He hasn\u2019t replaced either of them. The restaurant owner\u2019s experiences line up with findings in a recent research brief from the University of California, Merced, Community and Labor Center, which found that fewer Californians, both citizens and noncitizens, went to work the week that intense immigration raids began in Los Angeles in June.\n\nThat decline continued the following month, the researchers later said in an update. Flores listed several possible reasons for the drop, including that workers were afraid to go to work, a supply chain slowdown from missing immigrant labor could be creating less available work or\u2014as in the restaurant owner\u2019s case\u2014frightened customers might be shopping less. Flores said the fact that U.S. citizens showed a significant drop in employment goes against the Trump administration\u2019s claims that deporting noncitizens will free up jobs for people born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cMost people that understand economics pretty well will tell you that\u2019s not how the economy works. It\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the actual consequences of people very aggressively being taken\u2014without any due process in some cases\u2014and, confronted with those realities, if the administration continues to advance their very aggressive efforts to have the largest deportation campaign in history, we have to wonder what is the actual intent of it.\u201d The intent is clear to many undocumented workers, including a woman who cleans buildings and houses. \u201cThings are getting more difficult for the simple fact of the color of our skin,\u201d the woman said in Spanish. \u201cWe are the most looked for [by ICE].\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s been in the U.S. for more than two decades and has two U.S. citizen children with her husband, who is also undocumented. The pair met in San Diego soon after she arrived from Guerrero, Mexico, she said. The woman said there aren\u2019t enough workers in her industry. She said she\u2019s afraid to go to work, but she has no choice because she has bills to pay. She added that construction work has slowed down since Trump came into office, leaving her partner without a way to make a living. She works for a cleaning company full time and cleans homes as a side job. She works seven days a week.\n\nShe said she tries not to carry as many tools and supplies when she goes to work at the private homes so that she doesn\u2019t attract attention to herself. \u201cI never felt so afraid since the time I got here as in this time period since January 20, 2025,\u201d she said. She admitted that she often avoids going out for anything besides work, preferring to skip birthday celebrations and other events to stay safe at home.\n\nSatomi Rash-Zeigler, executive director of the University of California, San Diego, Labor Center, said that Trump\u2019s policies have a chilling effect not only on immigrant labor but also on workers\u2019 ability to advocate for their rights, regardless of their immigration status or country of origin. \u201cBy targeting the folks that are the most vulnerable, we are undermining all workers, basically creating a system where you have bad employers that will be able to thrive with little to no accountability,\u201d Rash-Zeigler said. She said employee fear of reporting hazards in the workplace can lead to public safety issues, such as farm workers not feeling safe to report an employer using a toxic pesticide on crops.\n\n\u201cFear is a policy tool of fascism,\u201d Rash-Zeigler said. \u201cThey want the boss to have all the power. They want to keep workers silent and compliant under any and all circumstances and that\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s not good for workers. It\u2019s not good for our country.\u201d A woman from Sonora, Mexico, said she hasn\u2019t been looking for work even though her family is struggling because she is afraid of ICE. She said she knows firsthand about the struggles with workplace exploitation as an undocumented worker. She worked for more than a decade at a bakery in San Diego.\n\nWhen it was her shift, she said, she was the only one on duty in the kitchen. Eventually, the work wore her down physically, causing debilitating arthritis in her hands and knees, she said. She asked for help from her employer so that she wouldn\u2019t have to do the work alone. Instead, the bakery cut her hours, she said. When they hired other workers to replace her, she said, the bakery staffed more people in the kitchen. A doctor told her she could no longer do the work, but the bakery has refused to compensate her.\n\n\u201cThe truth is I feel sad because what one wants is to work, and one puts in a lot of effort, and that\u2019s not the way they should behave with one,\u201d she said in Spanish. Her oldest daughter, who was born in the U.S. and is still in high school, now works to help support the family. But the family struggles to make ends meet, often receiving support from friends and neighbors. As immigration raids have grown increasingly common, the mother has stopped leaving the house, she said. Her daughter does the grocery shopping and other errands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clean. We thought everything was fine,\u201d the man said in Spanish standing in the hallway of the immigration court. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d Now they\u2019re nervous, and losing time at work to show up for court hearings. Their employer paid for Mautino to represent them. \u201cWork is the same, but all of a sudden you\u2019re thinking, \u2018They\u2019re going to send me to Mexico again,\u2019\u201d one of the men said.",

      "text": "This story was produced by Puente News Collaborative, a bilingual nonprofit newsroom, convener and funder dedicated to high-quality, fact-based news and information from the U.S.-Mexico border.\nAt Hector\u2019s Mariscos restaurant in the heavily Latino and immigrant city of Santa Ana, sales of Mexican seafood have slid. Seven tables would normally be full, but diners sit at only two this Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it like this since COVID,\u201d manager Lorena Marin said in Spanish as cumbia music played on loudspeakers. A U.S. citizen, Marin even texted customers she was friendly with, encouraging them to come in.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m staying home,\u201d a customer texted back. \u201cIt\u2019s really screwed up out there with all of those immigration agents.\u201d\nIncreasing arrests in California by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have begun to gut-punch the economy and wallets of immigrant families and beyond. In some cases, immigrants with legal status and even U.S. citizens have been swept into President Donald Trump\u2019s dragnet.\nThe 2004 fantasy film A Day Without a Mexican \u2014 chronicling what would happen to California if Mexican immigrants disappeared \u2014 is fast becoming real life. The implications are stark for many, both economically and personally.\n\u201cWe are now seeing a very significant shift toward enforcement at labor sites where people are working,\u2019 said Andrew Selee, president of the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. \u201cNot a focus on people with criminal records, but a focus on people who are deeply integrated in the American economy.\u201d\nIn California, immigrant workers comprise larger shares of certain industries than they do for the nation overall. Here, the foreign-born make up 62% of agriculture labor and 42% of construction workers, according to the American Immigration Council. Some 85% of sewing machine operators in garment factories are foreign-born. And 40% of entrepreneurs are foreign-born.\nNationally, about a fourth of workers in agriculture and construction are foreign-born, according to the American Immigration Council. More than half of drywall hangers, plasterers and stucco masons are foreign-born. And in science-technology-engineering-and-math, so-called STEM fields, nearly a quarter of workers are foreign-born, said the American Immigration Council.\nThe current enforcement trend, Selee said, will \u201clead to a strategy that will have big economic implications if they continue to go after people who are active in the labor force rather than those who have criminal records.\u201d\nIn both California and across an aging nation, about half of the foreign-born are naturalized U.S. citizens \u2014 a crucial defense in immigration raids and arrests.\nSelee said the current strategy was launched when \u201cthe Trump administration realized they weren\u2019t getting large numbers by following traditional approaches to pursuing people who are priority targets for deportation.\u201d\nNow, the threat and chilling effect from immigration raids can be felt in disparate communities from Dallas to El Paso to rural Wisconsin \u2014 among migrants and in some cases, the employers who hire them.\nIn the tiny town of Waumandee in Wisconsin, dairy farmer John Rosenow said he can\u2019t find U.S. citizens who can withstand the rigors of dairy work.\n\u201cFact of the matter is if you want to eat or drink milk you are going to need immigrant workers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, we want to get rid of the people who are bad actors,\u201d Rosenow said. \u201cBut the people I know, people who are working in the dairy farms, are just hard-working people, getting things done, doing jobs Americans don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\nIn California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, rancher and melon-grower Joe Del Bosque has heard reports of U.S. agents chasing workers in the strawberry fields of south of his operation.\nThe San Joaquin Valley, known as the food basket of the world, is heavily dependent upon foreign born workers, especially at harvest time, Del Bosque said. He currently has 100 people who work for him and those numbers will double as the harvest picks up in the coming weeks.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to disrupt the harvest and food chain. This will hurt the American consumer,\u201d Del Bosque said. \u201cThese people are hard workers. They come to work, especially if they have families here or in Mexico.\u201d\nIn a surprise on Thursday, Trump said an executive order is \u201cpotentially coming, allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the country so farmers don\u2019t run out of workers.\u201d\nRaids or the threat of them, are also taking an emotional toll on families and generating protests in Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Spokane, New York, San Antonio, Dallas and elsewhere.\nIn El Paso, protesters flipped the White House script that undocumented immigrants were \u201ccriminals.\u201d They waved mostly U.S. flags and shouted \u201cNo justice, no peace. Shame on ICE.\u201d\nAmong the protesters was Alejandra, a U.S. citizen and a junior at the University of Texas at El Paso. She asked for partial anonymity for fear of reprisal against her mixed-status family.\nShe said she took to this border city\u2019s streets to honor the sacrifice of grandparents who migrated from Ciudad Juarez. \u201cAll it takes is for you to look at who took that first step to bring you the life you have currently,\u201d Alejandra said.\nIn the Dallas area, a Guatemalan said he\u2019d been absent from construction sites for days.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much fear, too much to risk,\u201d said Gustavo, 34, requesting his surname be withheld because he is undocumented. \u201cI fear tomorrow, tonight. I may be deported and who loses? My family back in Guatemala.\u201d\nTough immigration enforcement has been the top-polling issue for Trump. But favor may be slipping. A poll released last week by Quinnipiac University showed Trump had a 43% approval rating on immigration and a 54% disapproval rating. That poll was conducted between June 5-9 \u2014 after several days of protests.\nMeantime, back in Santa Ana, a city of about 316,000 in Southern California, shop owner Alexa Vargas said foot traffic has slowed around her store, Vibes Boutique, with sales plummeting about 30% in recent days.\nOn a recent day, the shop\u2019s jeans and glitzy tee-shirts remain un-browsed. Metered parking spots on the usually busy street sat empty. A fruit and snow cone vendor whom Vargas usually frequents had been missing for days.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this dead right now,\u201d Vargas, 26, said on a Tuesday afternoon. \u201cPeople are too scared to go out. Even if you\u2019re a citizen but you look a certain way. Some people don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d\nReyna, a restaurant cook, told her boss she didn\u2019t feel safe going to work after she heard about the immigration detentions at Home Depot stores in the city.\nThe 40-year-old, who is in the U.S. without legal status, said she fears becoming an ICE target. Current immigration laws and policies don\u2019t provide a way to obtain legal status even though she\u2019s been living in the U.S. for more than 20 years.\n\u201cI need to work but, honestly, I\u2019m scared to death to leave my house,\u201d\nFor now her life is on hold, Reyna said.\nShe canceled a party for her son\u2019s high school graduation. She no longer drives her younger children to summer school. She even stopped attending behavioral therapy sessions for her 7-year-old autistic son.\nReyna said she can\u2019t sleep. She suffers headaches every day.\nEarly Tuesday, she said, immigration agents in an unmarked vehicle swept up her husband\u2019s 20-year-old nephew, who is a Mexican national without legal status. The scene unreeled across from her home.\nHer autistic son, a U.S.-born citizen, has begged her to allow him to play on the front yard swing set.\n\u201cNo, honey. We can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Reyna told him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe police are taking people away,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey are taking away people who were not born here.\u201d"

      "text": "Relentless immigration raids are changing California's way of life\nWhen immigration agents came to the farm where he worked, Jaime Alanis tried to hide.\nClimbing to the roof of a greenhouse, while agents rounded up and arrested dozens of his coworkers below, Mr Alanis hoped to stay out of sight.\nThen he fell.\nHis neck was broken and skull fractured. He died later in hospital.\nMeanwhile, immigration agents fired teargas at a crowd of some 500 protestors, who had gathered to stop the raids outside two legal cannabis farms. Some threw rocks, and the FBI says one fired a gun at federal agents.\nMr Alanis's death, and the violent clashes that ensued at those cannabis farms, are the latest examples of the kind of chaos that has swept across southern California since the beginning of June, when immigration raids began to intensify in the region.\nThose crackdowns sparked protests, which led to US President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard and US Marines, to protect federal officers from the demonstrators and to ensure that his mass deportations, which he had long promised, were carried out.\nWhile many Americans support Trump's tough immigration policies, the relentlessness of the raids in the region has also triggered a fierce backlash from neighbours and activists. Southern California is home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants, many of whom have been forced into hiding - too afraid to go to work, school or even the grocery store.\nIn so doing, the raids have altered the landscape of one of the country's most populous regions. Businesses are shuttered, cities have cancelled community events - including Fourth of July fireworks celebrations.\n\"Everyone's looking over their shoulders,\" says a \"raspado\" vendor in Los Angeles on a recent Sunday, where normally crowded soccer fields and picnic tables were mostly deserted. As she prepared the shaved ice with sweet strawberry syrup, she seemed wary of questions but grateful for a customer.\n\"It's never like this,\" she said.\nThe raids at the two cannabis farms are now being touted as the largest immigration operation since Trump took office.\nOf the 361 migrants detained during those raids, four had \"extensive\" criminal records, including rape, kidnapping, and attempted child molestation, media reported. Immigration officers also found 14 migrant children, who the administration claims have been \"rescued from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking\".\nWhile the administration frequently highlights the convicted rapists, murderers and drug dealers they have arrested in operations, scores of immigrants - many with no criminal convictions who have spent decades building businesses, families and homes - have been caught in the crosshairs.\n\"They just kidnap you,\" says Carlos, who didn't want his full last name used out of fear that he could be deported to his native Guatemala. He has been too afraid to go to work since his sister, Emma, was detained while selling tacos outside a Home Depot last month. \"If I'm brown, if I'm Hispanic, they just come and catch you and take you.\"\nThe Trump administration says claims that people are being targeted because of their skin colour are \"disgusting\" and false.\nCarlos says he feels a bit safer since a federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration to stop \"indiscriminately\" detaining people with \"roving patrols\" of federal agents. But he doesn't trust that they will stop, and he needs to go back to work.\n\"How am I going to pay my rent,\" he says. \"I'm stuck inside.\"\nChurches and immigrant rights groups have been organising food delivery for people in hiding. They have also been training people to protect immigrants out on the streets using apps, text chains and social media to alert people when federal agents are nearby.\nWhen dozens of armed agents in camouflage descended on MacArthur Park on horseback and in armoured vehicles earlier this month, few were surprised.\nWord had spread quickly of the operation \u2013 and rumours had swirled that \"la migra\" was coming hours before the troops arrived. Dozens of protesters swarmed to greet the troops \u2013 including LA Mayor Karen Bass, who demanded they leave the park.\nWitnesses say no arrests were made and no one was seen running to escape. By the time troops arrived \u2013 with professional-looking camera crews recording the overt show of force \u2013 the only people in the park were protesters, some kids at a summer camp, and some homeless people asleep in the grass.\n\"It's been gut wrenching,\" says Betsy Bolte, who lives near the park and had showed up to protest and yell obscenities at the agents.\n\"It's war against the people \u2013 the heart and soul of the economy. And it's all intentional. It's part of the plan,\" she said, crying while showing reporters her footage.\nActivists accuse the government of terrorising its own people.\n\"This is part of a programme of terror. From Los Angeles to the Central Coast, the Trump administration is weaponising the federal government and military against Californians,\" says the advocacy group CAUSE.\nBut not all Californians agree.\nTrump won 38% of the ballots in November. Recently, the BBC featured the story of one woman who is still devoted to the president and his mass deportation plans, even while she's locked up as an illegal immigrant.\nAnd a lone Trump supporter showed up at the protest at the cannabis farm last week, only to be beaten and jeered at and spat on by protesters.\nPerhaps ironically, the architect of many of Trump's deportation policies, is an Angeleno himself. Senior White House aide Stephen Miller was raised in liberal Santa Monica where even as a teenager he was known on conservative radio for condemning the use of Spanish in his school.\nHe told Fox News this week that California's \"violent\" Democratic politicians who show up to protest were inciting violence against federal immigration agents.\n\"No city can aid and abet an invasion of this country over the will of the American people and the law enforcement officers empowered to enact the American people's wills,\" he said.\nTrump's \"border tsar\" Tom Homan says Los Angeles has itself to blame because LA's sanctuary laws prevent local law enforcement from co-operating with immigration agents inside jails, where they could detain immigrant offenders outside of the public eye.\n\"We're going to double down, triple down on sanctuary cities,\" Homan told reporters, adding that they do not have such overt public raids in Florida because all the sheriffs there let immigration agents into the jails to detain immigrants.\n\"If they don't let us arrest the bad guy in the county jail, they're going to arrest them in the community. We're going to arrest them at a work site.\"\nIn Los Angeles, the impact of the month of raids is noticeable. In parks and neighbourhoods once bustling with shoppers, foot traffic, music and street vendors, the absence of familiar sounds is eerie.\nThere are 88 cities in LA County and many of them have cancelled public summer events due to the ongoing immigration enforcement activity.\n\"Many residents have expressed fear and uncertainty, leading them to remain indoors, refrain from work, and withdraw from daily public life,\" the city of Huntington Park said in a statement about cancelled events. \"Our priority is and will continue to be the safety and peace of mind of our community.\nNow some immigrants are afraid to turn up for their scheduled hearings, because they are being detained outside court.\nPastor Ara Torosian of Cornerstone Church in West LA said the bulk of his Persian-language congregants were asylum seekers. One couple with a three-year-old daughter were detained outside court when they showed up for what they thought was a \"routine\" hearing. Now they are in Texas at a family detention centre.\nFive members of his congregation were detained in June \u2013 two of them on the street as Pastor Torosian filmed and begged the agents to stop.\n\"The are not criminals,\" he said. \"They were obeying everything, not hiding anything.\""

      "text": "A group of San Diego-area Democrats Monday denounced Friday's federal raid on two restaurants in the South Park neighborhood, which saw armed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detain four people in an operation the officials said left the community shaken and traumatized.\nThe late afternoon operation at Buona Forchetta and Enoteca Buona Forchetta involved at least 20 agents in military-style gear taking a group of workers into custody, while also confronting and handcuffing others and at one point detonating flash-bang grenades in the vicinity.\nThe detained individuals included three Mexican nationals and another from Colombia, according to Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Chula Vista, but he and other officials said it hasn't been shown that the detained people had violent criminal histories warranting the tactics employed.\nVargas said Monday morning's news conference was being held outside San Diego's federal courthouses specifically because a local federal judge \u2014 U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Crawford \u2014 signed off on a warrant that he said authorized agents to detain everyone working inside the restaurants, whether or not they were undocumented.\nVargas said part of the lawmakers' demands were to meet with the chief judge for the Southern District of California to inquire how and why warrants of this sort were being approved.\nAlong with Vargas, Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, Rep. Sara Jacobs, D- San Diego, Rep. Mike Levin, D-Carlsbad, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria spoke out against the impetus behind operations like Friday's and the manner in which it was carried out.\nJacobs said recent immigration enforcement tactics \"have crossed a new line.\"\nThe congresswoman was not only referring to Friday's incident, but also recent arrests conducted at San Diego courthouses of people attending immigration hearings and a workplace immigration raid in March near El Cajon.\n\"This isn't about going after criminals. They're going after people who are trying to do the right thing and people who are contributing to our economy,\" Jacobs said.\nPeters described the incident as \"our government terrorizing our own communities.\" He said the operation shows White House officials are not prioritizing violent criminals in President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign.\n\"We were told that this whole move on immigration and deportation was about violent criminals,\" Peters said. \"Well, we know that's not true.\"\nVargas said the ICE agents were \"armed to the teeth as if they were entering a war zone,\" \"terrorized the patrons and workers,\" and he charged that the intent of the operation \"was to intimidate and to bring terror and fear into everybody's hearts, especially immigrants.\"\nGloria said, \"This kind of operation does not promote public safety, it undermines it. Our community's trust in law enforcement is diminished when scenes like that unfold in their communities.\"\nLevin cited reports stating that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller is calling for 3,000 people to be arrested daily by immigration law enforcement officials.\n\"Setting an arbitrary quota is what created a mess like what we saw on Friday and it will continue unless we all speak out against it,\" he said.\nLevin noted that approximately 20% of San Diego\u2019s service sector workforce is made up of immigrants without immigration status.\n\u201cWhat happened on Friday was fundamentally wrong, fundamentally un-American and can happen presumably to 1 in 5 San Diegans working in the service sector,\u201d he said.\nICE has not commented beyond confirming the operations occurred at the restaurants. Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe, an ICE spokeswoman, told City News Service: \"As this is an ongoing investigation, we have no further releasable information at this time.\"\nAt Monday's San Diego City Council meeting, Councilman Sean Elo-Rivera stood by statements he made over the weekend. Describing the Friday incident as \"terroristic\" and \"fascist,\" Elo-Rivera urged San Diegans to stand up and push back against ICE raids in the community.\nCouncilman Stephen Whitburn denounced the raid and said it was intended to make people afraid. Council President Joe LaCava demanded an apology from the agency.\nSan Diego police were called in to assist the operation with crowds that gathered.\n\"The nature of their involvement at the time of the request was unknown to us,\" the department said in a statement. \"SDPD was not involved in the operation beforehand, nor were we involved in any immigration enforcement. Federal agents had left the area prior to our arrival, and our officers did not ultimately provide any assistance or take enforcement action.\"\nThe company behind Buona Forchetta said in a statement that all its restaurants in San Diego and Orange counties will remain closed through Tuesday in response to \"the traumatic incident involving a federal enforcement operation at our original and beloved South Park location.\"\nThe statement continued, \"We will be back soon. But for now, we are holding our people close and leaning into the love you have so generously given.\"\nIn a separate social media post on Saturday, Buona Forchetta said it was working with attorneys \"to locate and support our detained employees and their families.\"\nAdministration officials have conducted stepped-up enforcement of illegal immigration since President Donald Trump took office in January, and data show that illegal border crossings have reached historically low levels."

      "text": "A San Diego restaurant owner who serves many immigrant customers has seen business plummet. A cleaning woman avoids bringing tools to work to avoid drawing attention to herself. Her husband, a construction worker, has been unemployed for over a month. A California farm had to hire an attorney to protect workers with approved visas from deportation.\nCalifornia \u2014 and other states across the country \u2014 rely heavily on the labor of immigrants. Many of those workers are living in fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, making it harder to do their jobs. Experts say this fear is restricting the rights of all workers and hurting the state\u2019s broader economy.\nCapital & Main spoke to workers and an employer in California about how President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against immigrants is affecting their ability to work. All of them requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the federal government.\nThe restaurant owner said traffic to his business dropped immediately after ICE officials targeted another restaurant, Buona Forchetta, in a highly visible operation that drew community protest and a violent response from ICE.\nSince then, the owner said, his sales have dropped by 30%-40% because immigrant customers aren\u2019t leaving their homes except for essential tasks like work.\nThe owner, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, said one of his workers self-deported at the beginning of the Trump administration and another is out on maternity leave. He hasn\u2019t replaced either of them.\nThe restaurant owner\u2019s experiences line up with findings in a recent research brief from the University of California, Merced, Community and Labor Center, which found that fewer Californians, both citizens and noncitizens, went to work the week that intense immigration raids began in Los Angeles in June.\nPrivate sector employment in the state declined just over 3% from the previous month, researchers found.\nEdward Flores, faculty director of the UC Merced Community and Labor Center, said that shift is significant.\n\u201cThe only time we see a decline in private sector employment like that at that time of year is really comparable to the Great Recession or to COVID,\u201d Flores said.\nThat decline continued the following month, the researchers later said in an update.\nFlores listed several possible reasons for the drop, including that workers were afraid to go to work, a supply chain slowdown from missing immigrant labor could be creating less available work or \u2014 as in the restaurant owner\u2019s case \u2014 frightened customers might be shopping less.\nFlores said the fact that U.S. citizens showed a significant drop in employment goes against the Trump administration\u2019s claims that deporting noncitizens will free up jobs for people born in the U.S.\n\u201cMost people that understand economics pretty well will tell you that\u2019s not how the economy works. It\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the actual consequences of people very aggressively being taken \u2014 without any due process in some cases \u2014 and, confronted with those realities, if the administration continues to advance their very aggressive efforts to have the largest deportation campaign in history, we have to wonder what is the actual intent of it.\u201d\nThe intent is clear to many undocumented workers, including a woman who cleans buildings and houses.\n\u201cThings are getting more difficult for the simple fact of the color of our skin,\u201d the woman said in Spanish. \u201cWe are the most looked for [by ICE].\u201d\nShe said she\u2019s been in the U.S. for more than two decades and has two U.S. citizen children with her husband, who is also undocumented. The pair met in San Diego soon after she arrived from Guerrero, Mexico, she said.\nThe woman said there aren\u2019t enough workers in her industry. She said she\u2019s afraid to go to work, but she has no choice because she has bills to pay. She added that construction work has slowed down since Trump came into office, leaving her partner without a way to make a living.\nShe works for a cleaning company full time and cleans homes as a side job. She works seven days a week.\nShe said she tries not to carry as many tools and supplies when she goes to work at the private homes so that she doesn\u2019t attract attention to herself.\n\u201cI never felt so afraid since the time I got here as in this time period since Jan. 20, 2025,\u201d she said.\nShe admitted that she often avoids going out for anything besides work, preferring to skip birthday celebrations and other events to stay safe at home.\nSometimes people don\u2019t want to pay her after she finishes cleaning, she said, and they threaten that they will call immigration officials if she objects.\nThose situations have always caused some fear, she said, but it\u2019s even more so now.\nShe and her partner are seriously considering returning to Mexico after their youngest finishes high school, she said.\nShe is afraid to go back to Guerrero, where her family has experienced the violence that has caused many to flee the state and seek asylum elsewhere.\nBut, she said, in the current situation, she feels more afraid to be here.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the American dream anymore, as they say,\u201d she said.\nSatomi Rash-Zeigler, executive director of the University of California, San Diego, Labor Center, said that Trump\u2019s policies have a chilling effect not only on immigrant labor but also on workers\u2019 ability to advocate for their rights, regardless of their immigration status or country of origin.\n\u201cBy targeting the folks that are the most vulnerable, we are undermining all workers, basically creating a system where you have bad employers that will be able to thrive with little to no accountability,\u201d Rash-Zeigler said.\nShe said employee fear of reporting hazards in the workplace can lead to public safety issues, such as farm workers not feeling safe to report an employer using a toxic pesticide on crops.\nRash-Zeigler said documented and undocumented workers alike are afraid of ICE raids because of the violent tactics that the agency has used.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to interact with that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey try to keep their heads down and not be caught in the fray of these sweeps. It\u2019s impacting everyone.\u201d\nShe said even U.S. citizen workers could be afraid to report workplace abuse because it could attract the attention of immigration officials.\n\u201cFear is a policy tool of fascism,\u201d Rash-Zeigler said. \u201cThey want the boss to have all the power. They want to keep workers silent and compliant under any and all circumstances and that\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s not good for workers. It\u2019s not good for our country.\u201d\nA woman from Sonora, Mexico, said she hasn\u2019t been looking for work even though her family is struggling because she is afraid of ICE.\nShe said she knows firsthand about the struggles with workplace exploitation as an undocumented worker. She worked for more than a decade at a bakery in San Diego.\nWhen it was her shift, she said, she was the only one on duty in the kitchen. Eventually, the work wore her down physically, causing debilitating arthritis in her hands and knees, she said. She asked for help from her employer so that she wouldn\u2019t have to do the work alone. Instead, the bakery cut her hours, she said.\nWhen they hired other workers to replace her, she said, the bakery staffed more people in the kitchen.\nA doctor told her she could no longer do the work, but the bakery has refused to compensate her.\n\u201cThe truth is I feel sad because what one wants is to work, and one puts in a lot of effort, and that\u2019s not the way they should behave with one,\u201d she said in Spanish.\nHer oldest daughter, who was born in the U.S. and is still in high school, now works to help support the family. But the family struggles to make ends meet, often receiving support from friends and neighbors.\nAs immigration raids have grown increasingly common, the mother has stopped leaving the house, she said. Her daughter does the grocery shopping and other errands.\nThe mother feels proud of what she has been able to provide for her children during her time in the U.S., she said, but she also worries that her life is now at a low point.\nShe has thought about trying to find another job that she can do in her condition, but she said she hasn\u2019t because of fear of the raids.\nThat fear has even reached agricultural workers here on visas. On a recent day at the immigration court in downtown San Diego, a group of men faced potential deportation even though they said they were here on current H2A visas \u2014 the visas given to temporary or seasonal agricultural workers.\nThe men had previously been in the U.S. working for the same employer, according to Kathrin Mautino, an attorney. The employer, a farm in Fallbrook, California, had tried to extend the men\u2019s visas last year, but the men ended up leaving for the winter holidays to go home, many to Jalisco, Mexico, before the date on their original visas, according to the attorney and several of the men.\nThe men came back again in June and July.\nThey weren\u2019t afraid when they entered the country, one of the men said, because they thought all of their paperwork was in order. But then documents indicating they had pending immigration court cases arrived at their workplace.\n\u201cWe\u2019re clean. We thought everything was fine,\u201d the man said in Spanish standing in the hallway of the immigration court. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d\nNow they\u2019re nervous, and losing time at work to show up for court hearings. Their employer paid for Mautino to represent them.\n\u201cWork is the same, but all of a sudden you\u2019re thinking, \u2018They\u2019re going to send me to Mexico again,\u2019\u201d one of the men said.\nOne man said he had just entered the country the week prior, and a customs officer informed him that he had a pending deportation case.\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming legally and leaving legally,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bad what they\u2019re doing. We have papers.\u201d\nCopyright 2025 Capital & Main"

      "text": "Updated May 31, 2025 at 19:29 PM ET\nA chaotic scene from a federal immigration raid on a popular San Diego restaurant is drawing new attention to government tactics in the push to fulfill President Trump's promise to deport millions in a historic crackdown.\nVideo shared on social media and local news shows armed and masked agents in full tactical gear swarming the area near a popular Italian restaurant called Buona Forchetta late Friday afternoon.\nA crowd of people gathers, filming and yelling in protest, surrounding cars and detention vans. Then, a momentary explosion of what appears to be a flash-bang grenade sends smoke floating through the street.\nA special agent with the Department of Homeland Security told NPR member station KPBS that officials were \"executing a criminal search warrant\" during a workplace raid.\nSome witnesses in news reports say agents at first handcuffed the entire restaurant crew as they asked for identification. Several workers were ultimately detained, though witness accounts differ on how many.\nDHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, did not immediately respond to NPR's email inquiry Saturday. Neither did the restaurant.\nOne employee cried while speaking with KPBS on Friday as she described how federal agents handcuffed her coworkers in the restaurant, just before it was scheduled to open.\nThe crowd of locals at one point blocked an unmarked DHS vehicle from leaving a nearby intersection; they shouted profanities and called agents fascists. Agents sounded sirens, then deployed what KPBS described as a smoke device to disperse the crowd.\nThe San Diego Police Department told NPR in a statement that it was asked to assist at the scene of Friday's workplace raid, but that federal agents had left the area prior to their arrival, and that SDPD officers \"did not ultimately provide any assistance or take enforcement action.\"\nCopyright 2025 NPR"
