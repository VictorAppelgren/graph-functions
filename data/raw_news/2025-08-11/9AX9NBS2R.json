  "content": "Scientists say hot, humid weather is to blame for the glaciers melting in Kashmir, India, according to Rising Kashmir.\n\nIndia's Kashmir Valley is experiencing a surge in humidity levels that is unusual for the summertime, which is usually dry and temperate. The humidity is causing locals a lot of discomfort, making the unusually high temperatures feel oppressive.\n\nScientists are attributing the humidity to a combination of factors, including rapid glacial melt, altered wind patterns, and changing monsoon behaviors, all of which indicate that the region is experiencing climate stress.\n\nThe glacier melt is having a particularly large impact because rising river levels are creating increased moisture in the atmosphere.\n\nDeforestation and development have worsened the problem.\n\nDr. Yasir Yousuf, an environmentalist based in Kashmir, cautions that if these warning signs are ignored, it could lead to irreversible crises for the ecology and local humanity.\n\nWhy is glacier melt in Kashmir important?\n\nScientists are urging people to prioritize glacier conservation, stop construction in eco-sensitive areas, and restore the forest floor.\n\nThe heat has become unbearable for residents and has had a direct impact on their health. Local hospitals have seen an influx of patients being treated with skin infections, dehydration, and respiratory problems. Dr. Ruqaya Qureshi, a physician at SMHS hospital in Srinagar, explained that the high humidity levels in the atmosphere disrupt the body's cooling mechanism, which is dangerous to human health. She is especially concerned for children and the elderly, the most vulnerable segments of the population.\n\nIce melt impacts our planet, causing communities to suffer due to higher tides during extreme weather events, disruptions to food systems, and an increased spread of disease. Although isolated weather events have always existed, the scientific consensus is that human actions and inactions have induced the general warming of the planet. This change has supercharged the weather events, making them more powerful and dangerous.\n\nWhat's being done about glacier melt?\n\nWorldwide, cities are taking steps to reduce the pollution that is contributing to the planet's overheating. Tokyo is requiring new homes to have solar panels, and Los Angeles outlawed gas power in all new buildings.\n\nAs individuals, we can help by supporting pro-climate candidates and making sustainable choices. Recycling, composting, and conserving resources such as electricity and water are simple actions we can take.\n\nDr. Mir Asif, a climatologist from North Kashmir, is sounding the alarm. \"If glaciers disappear, so does our water, our agriculture, and our very identity,\" he warned.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "Srinagar, July 19: The Kashmir Valley is grappling with an unusual surge in humidity levels this summer, causing discomfort among residents and raising alarm among climate experts.\nTypically known for its dry and temperate summers, the Valley has experienced soaring humidity, exacerbating the heat and making conditions oppressive. Experts link this persistent humidity to a combination of factors including rapid glacial melt, altered wind patterns, and changing monsoon behaviour, clear indicators of escalating climate stress in the region.\n\u201cSuch humid conditions are not typical for a Kashmiri summer,\u201d said Dr.YasirYousuf, an environmentalist based in Kashmir. He pointed to glacier melting as a primary cause, which increases local moisture content. \u201cWhen combined with heatwaves and stagnant air, it creates a perfect storm of climatic discomfort,\u201d he explained. Dr.Yousuf warned that ignoring these signs could lead to irreversible ecological and humanitarian crises.\nDr. Mir Asif, a climatologist from North Kashmir, highlighted another anomaly: \u201cNormally, high humidity triggers rainfall, but we\u2019re witnessing suppressed convection, likely due to temperature inversions or shifting jet streams, reflecting changing monsoon dynamics.\u201d He also noted the accelerated melting of glaciers in the Kashmir Himalayas, which contributes to rising river levels and heightened atmospheric moisture.\n\u201cThe problem is worsened by deforestation and unplanned development in sensitive zones,\u201d Dr.Asif added. Citing recent studies, he said the region\u2019s glaciers have lost over 15% of their mass in the last 30 years, with smaller glaciers retreating faster. This retreat is linked to increased flash floods, humidity, and disruption of local weather patterns.\n\u201cThis contributes to flash floods, increased humidity, and disruption of local weather systems,\u201d he said.\nDr Asif further said people must prioritize glacier conservation, stop rampant construction in eco-sensitive zones, and restore degraded forest cover.\n\u201cIf glaciers disappear, so does our water, our agriculture, and our very identity,\u201d he said.\nLocals, meanwhile, are bearing the brunt. \u201cIt\u2019s suffocating,\u201d said Sajjad Ahmad, a resident of Baramulla.\n\u201cWe used to sleep comfortably in summer without fans. Now, it feels like Delhi or Mumbai is sticky and warm all night. The health impact is becoming apparent too, he said.\nDr.RuqayaQureshi, a physician at SMHS Hospital in Srinagar, said that they are seeing more patients with skin infections, dehydration, and respiratory problems.\n\u201cThe high humidity hampers the body\u2019s cooling mechanism, which can be dangerous, especially for children and the elderly,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, as per Meteorological Department (IMD) data on Saturday there was humidity at 8:30 AM was recorded at exceptionally high levels across many stations with 100% at Amarnath Holy Cave, Baltal, and Sheshnag; 92% in Gulmarg; 93% at Panjtarni; and 84% in Pahalgam. Even Srinagar City registered a morning humidity of 82%, unusually high for mid-July.\nDirector MeT Srinagar, Dr Mukhtar Ahmad, said that during the next 24 hours, hot and humid with brief spells of light to moderate rain along with thundershower at scattered to fairly widespread places.\n\u201cAgain, 21-23rd July, generally cloudy with Intermittent spells of light to moderate Rain/thundershower at many places, with intense showers at a few places, with heavy rain at isolated places of J&K,\u201d he said.\nAs per the MeT advisory, there is a possibility of intense showers with gusty winds at a few places with heavy rain at isolated to scattered places of J&K during 21-23rd July.\n\u201cFlash floods at a few vulnerable places with landslides and mudslides & and shooting stones. Rise in water level in river streams, local nallas& water logging in a few low-lying areas, and advise farmers to spray during this period,\u201d he said."
