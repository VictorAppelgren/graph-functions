      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target but can be tightened to meet the 4–6‑sentence, executive‑style brief and to satisfy the “explicit causal link” rule. 1) Add the canonical handle mapping (us_mortgage_rates → ust10y) in the first sentence and keep the 6.55% figure. 2) In the second sentence, explicitly state that the 10‑yr Treasury yield is the handle that drives mortgage rates and that the current 6.8–7.2% band is a function of the projected ust10y trajectory. 3) In the third sentence, list the primary catalyst window: the Fed meeting on 16‑17 Sep 2025 (LF0UUL917) and any subsequent ust10y shift. 4) In the fourth sentence, keep the risk list but add the specific risk of a Fed hike (LF0UUL917) and a stronger‑than‑expected ust10y decline. 5) In the final sentence, condense the watch signals to: Fed meeting 16‑17 Sep 2025, ust10y evolution, CPI/Inflation releases, and loan‑demand indicators (credit‑card utilization, housing‑market activity). 6) Remove any redundant phrasing (“limited impact of recent cuts”) and ensure every claim is backed by the single source ID (LF0UUL917). This yields a crisp, 5‑sentence brief that fully maps to the canonical handle, cites the catalyst window, and lists risks and watch items with clear magnitude ranges.",
