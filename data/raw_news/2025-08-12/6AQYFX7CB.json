  "description": "Thank you for reading, watching and listening with The Athletic - this is what you can expect each week from us this season",
  "content": "And now you know: Liverpool will win the 2025-26 Premier League. Arsenal will finish second (again), Manchester City third, Chelsea fourth and Newcastle United, with or without Alexander Isak, fifth.\n\nBurnley and Sunderland will go straight back down but Leeds United are going to survive, bucking the trend of the past couple of seasons for the top flight\u2019s promoted teams. In fact, you can see the full finishing positions here, as predicted by our writers, who are never wrong. Ever.\n\nWell, except last year, when we had City winning it and Liverpool coming third. But then, who could have foreseen City\u2019s mid-season unravelling and Arne Slot\u2019s incredible start to life as Jurgen Klopp\u2019s successor? Apart from you lot, of course.\n\nIn our annual hope-o-meter from this time last year, 93 per cent of Liverpool followers were positive about their team\u2019s chances (only Arsenal and Nottingham Forest were higher) but just 73 per cent of City supporters felt the same. This season, it\u2019s Chelsea, Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion and Sunderland fans who top our poll, with Newcastle\u2019s the most despondent.\n\nAt The Athletic, we pride ourselves on being the world\u2019s most trusted source of football information. We promise you in-depth club coverage, unrivalled tactical, analytical and now financial analysis. We are the home of David Ornstein\u2019s exclusive news stories and the DealSheet, the best-sourced transfer reporting on the internet. We run investigations, revelatory interviews and seek to hold power to account. Our dedicated teams bring our work to you on audio, video and social. We deliver serious reporting on serious issues and sensitive writing on sensitive stories.\n\nOur aim is to deliver true, balanced, deeply informed journalism that helps you better understand the game you love.\n\nBut we also like to have a little fun.\n\nSo this season, in recognition of your foresight, we are offering readers the chance to play a weekly Premier League predictions game every Friday against one of our leading writers, Oliver Kay (as well as a supercomputer and a small child, obviously).\n\nEach Thursday, Anantaajith Raghuraman will keep you ahead of the game by explaining the season\u2019s underlying trends in his new interactive Alternative Premier League Table.\n\nThe key Premier League talking points will be dissected each Monday in The Briefing, on the Athletic FC podcast with Ayo Akinwolere and Adam Crafton, and in the Did You Notice? short-form video review show with Jon Mackenzie. Our video team will go long-form on a Saturday, unpacking the biggest stories on The Athletic\u2019s Week in Football.\n\nWe\u2019ll have live coverage of the weekend\u2019s biggest games and quick, informed written analysis in our signature match briefings before James Richardson and friends turn on The Totally Football Show livestream each Sunday evening after the day\u2019s final game.\n\nYou\u2019ll also see more videos from the writers you follow in your feeds this season as they speak directly to you about what you need to know next.\n\nThen there are the news stories, long reads, tactical and data analysis, mailbags, live Q&As and everything else you expect from The Athletic.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just for the Premier League. We\u2019ll continue to cover the best of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game in Europe, the United States and beyond in the build-up to a huge World Cup summer.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot to keep track of, then you can get the best of every day boiled down into one brilliant newsletter by signing up here.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen this season? Nobody truly knows. But however it turns out, we\u2019ll be with you every step of the way.\n\nThank you for reading, watching and listening. You\u2019re the best.",

      "text": "It has often been said \u2014 usually by me \u2014 that the best thing and worst thing Rafa Benitez did at Newcastle United was restore hope.\nWhy best? Because here was a Champions League-winning manager who peeled away the toxic mediocrity of Newcastle\u2019s present (this was 2016 when they were flailing towards the Championship), and saw what lay beneath; stature, history, power. Fans lifted their heads and remembered themselves. They roared.\nAdvertisement\nWhy worst? Because when Benitez left St James\u2019 Park three years later, he was worn down. He finally understood that his vision of what Newcastle could be, if only they would \u201cdo things right\u201d, was not shared by Mike Ashley, the club\u2019s owner. Ambition was strangled. The following season, 10,000 season-ticket holders walked away.\nReturning to the norm could never be business as usual on Tyneside, because having stretched for the sky and found it just out of reach, their fall back to earth landed harder.\nWe shall come back to Newcastle \u2014 my word, yes \u2014 but the point is this: hope hurts.\nThere is a pantheon of fluffy quotes about hope. \u201cHope is a waking dream\u201d, \u201chope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul\u201d, \u201dif it were not for hopes, the heart would break\u201d.\nRubbish, bunkum, romanticised bullcrap, fraud, nonsense, baloney. Hope is a liar, a cheat and a stone-cold killer. Hope is an absolute, all-time b******. Hope sucks. Up yours, hope. F*** you, hope.\nAnd, on that note, welcome to The Athletic\u2019s great Premier League hope-o-meter for season 2025-26!\nOK, so here\u2019s the deal. Every year we pose a very basic question of our subscribers: how are you feeling about your club\u2019s prospects this season? There are two possible responses: optimistic and pessimistic, although there is also scope for readers to leave comments afterwards.\nA small deviation. The most-liked comment in the Newcastle version of that article comes from Mark D: \u201cBloody terrible, thanks for asking.\u201d\nSecond most-liked is from Morgan M: \u201cAre we sure the 2025-26 season can\u2019t turn us down, too?\u201d\nNo, shut up, I am not crying.\nGranted, none of this is hugely scientific. Rarely for these pages, it is not xG or heat maps, pizza charts or hotdog vectors or whatever, but it is pure. We crunch the numbers, we build a table, we present the results, I make \u201cjokes\u201d, you call me unfunny and bosh! We all get some of our aggression out.\nThis year, we are doing things differently, because change can be cleansing and good. Change can be as simple as asking colleagues to provide you with 50 words on the club they cover, thereby leaving you with much less work to do yourself. We should all embrace change.\nHere we go, in descending order.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea\nThere's nothing better to stoke optimism than becoming champions of the world \u2014 well, at least until Gianni Infantino unveils his shiny new Club Galactic Cup in two years' time.\nWhat is this strange magic? Not long ago Chelsea supporters were protesting against the ownership outside Stamford Bridge, shouting some very rude things at Enzo Maresca and sounding off on social media. That last one is a constant, but it's amazing what winning 14 of 16 games to close a season \u2014 and winning two trophies in the process \u2014 can do.\nA cynic might point out that any fanbase which is 98 per cent optimistic can only end up disappointed, but let's not puncture the vibe. This is the happiest Chelsea supporters have felt going into a season since 2020, when Covid ensured none of them could show it in stadiums.\nLiam Twomey\nLiterally minutes after I file this, Chelsea confirm Levi Colwill's done his ACL.\nLiam Twomey\nI have kept this interaction with Liam complete and unabridged not to embarrass him, but rather as a perfect encapsulation of what a t*** hope is.\nIf I did want to embarrass Liam, I would point out \u2014 gently, with love \u2014 that I asked him for 50 words and he provided me with 150. Having garnered a hard-fought reputation for pithiness, nobody at The Athletic wishes to be associated with over-writing <side eye to camera>.\nLiverpool\nAfter a chaotic summer packed with unthinkable twists and turns, Liverpool still go into the season with unrivalled confidence.\nYes, they\u2019re still a striker away from owning the most potent and potentially prolific frontline out there, and who knew such fuss could be made over recruiting a fourth centre-back? But with togetherness and unity, fuelled by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota, this is a season where Liverpool can dominate again and the supporters know it.\nAdvertisement\nGregg Evans\nI hate to be that guy, Gregg, but Liverpool are second in this table. Not first. So their confidence is, in fact, rivalled. It is rivalled by Chelsea, who are above them, or at least were until Liam stuck his oar in.\nBrighton & Hove Albion\nSell top scorer Joao Pedro to Chelsea Hove Albion and reach the Champions League? I like it!\nOnly eight extra points to find from Fabian Hurzeler's injury-ravaged first season, with a leaky defence bolstered and Kaoru Mitoma still causing havoc. Faith in the smartest succession planners is clearly undiminished.\nAndy Naylor\nDoes anybody remember Weebles? They were a children\u2019s toy in the 1970s, egg-shaped and made of plastic. They had a weight in the bottom which meant that however far you tilted them, they would pop back up, hence the advertising tag-line: \u201cWeebles wobble but they don\u2019t fall down.\u201d\nBrighton are Weebles, basically. You can take all their players, you can take their manager and you can take their sporting director, but you\u2019ll never take their freedom to somehow find a way to survive and thrive.\nAndy would remember Weebles because he is one of the few people employed by The Athletic who is older than me. I love Andy.\nSunderland\nThis feels more a question of excitement than optimism and if you strip it all back, it might be the alcohol still talking from that dreamy day at Wembley. Do all those giddy supporters foresee survival in nine months? Unlikely. But recruitment, most notably Granit Xhaka, has given reason to believe Sunderland are not just here to make up the numbers.\nPhilip Buckingham\nTwo things. One, alcohol is great. Two, this is classic hope-o-meter territory. Sunderland are a newly-promoted club who have not been in the Premier League for a while, therefore it is a beautiful novelty and naturally 91 per cent of their fans are optimistic.\nAdvertisement\nJust as this time 12 months ago, 89 per cent of Ipswich Town fans were optimistic. Ipswich won four games last season and finished second-bottom.\nMoral of the story: first you drink to celebrate, then you drink to forget.\nManchester United\nThe signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have helped wash away the foulness of last season. The club still have pull, even after a 15th-place finish. Ruben Amorim's charismatic way of speaking also helps. When he says \u201cgood times are coming\u201d, you find yourself getting swept along.\nCarl Anka\nUntil Sir Jim Ratcliffe sacks another 1,000 staff including players, leaving Amorim unable to fill his substitutes\u2019 bench. He is gone by Christmas.\nManchester City\nDoes this mean jeopardy is a thing again? Pep Guardiola\u2019s team have been so superior for so long that they have pretty much had a monopoly on optimism. But after a season that threatened to become completely derailed, a mammoth 15 per cent have some doubts. If it were any other team the optics would be a lot more gloomy, particularly with the Premier League charges pending, but this is a juggernaut that has added shiny new parts this summer. City fans appear to trust that the genius of Guardiola can find one final reinvention to deem last season nothing more than a temporary glitch in the matrix.\nJordan Campbell\nJordan obviously doesn\u2019t read anything I write, because City have not had a monopoly on optimism at all. In last season\u2019s hope-o-meter they were 13th, with 21 per cent of respondents expressing pessimism. I\u2019m not angry Jordan, I\u2019m just really disappointed and angry.\nArsenal\nIt\u2019s understandable that 10 per cent of Arsenal fans are more pessimistic heading into this season than last. Three successive second-place finishes can be draining, but overriding optimism comes from their consistency. The arrivals of Viktor Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi will also help that feel-good factor as potential game-changers.\nAdvertisement\nArt de Roche\nThis is exactly 50 words, Art. Thank you. Nothing else to see here: Arsenal will finish second.\nEverton\nIt\u2019s nice to see Everton fans a tad more optimistic ahead of the new season. The past few years have been bleak \u2014 we\u2019ve had relegation battles, points deductions and a fight to avoid financial implosion.\nUnder new owners The Friedkin Group, and with David Moyes back as manager, though, things are looking up. They just need to sign some more players to make sure they\u2019re ready to capitalise.\nPatrick Boyland\nSince Paddy wrote this, the club have moved for Jack Grealish, which means we are now well inside Everton\u2019s boom period \u2014 don\u2019t blink! \u2014 and therefore hurtling towards bust.\nNottingham Forest\nThis time last year Forest fans were derided for their lofty, seemingly unfounded levels of optimism, following two years of fighting relegation. Was there something in the water in Nottingham? As it turns out, they apparently knew something that everyone else didn\u2019t, as Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s men forged a surprise challenge for Champions League football, before ultimately finishing seventh. This year, Reds supporters are more mid-table in their expectations and hopes for the new campaign. Let us hope that is not reflected in what unfolds over the next 10 months.\nPaul Taylor\nIn this very same space a year ago, I asked the following question of Forest\u2019s optimism: \u201cWhat is all that about?\u201d I called it \u201cstrange\u201d and a \u201cmystery\u201d and wondered aloud whether we might have fallen victim to election interference.\nTurns out, I called it wrong, but I do not take kindly to Paul\u2019s tone here. It was not derision on my behalf. Far from it. It was actually a combination of ignorance and total indifference. Honestly, imagine using a platform like this to make fun of a colleague. Unbelievable.\nAdvertisement\nAston Villa\nVilla's reason for happiness is Unai Emery. Without him, there would be far less optimism and more focus on the darker underbelly (hello ticket prices). But he is a deity in the Midlands and while Villa's squad appears weaker on paper, with a Marcus Rashford-led group of loanees returning home, as the banner in the Holte End reads, 'Do you want to bet against us?\u2019\nJacob Tanswell\nNo, and I wouldn\u2019t want to be playing them on the first day of the season eith\u2026 oh, right, yes. That\u2019s Newcastle.\nTottenham Hotspur\nRemember that feeling when Spurs won the Europa League in May? It was Tottenham's greatest moment since 1991, the breaking of an emotional dam, transforming how it felt to support Spurs. The key to optimism this season is to bottle that feeling and harness it. Even though the manager and captain from last year have gone, the hope is that Tottenham can maintain that positivity, while making necessary changes on and off the pitch.\nJack Pitt-Brooke\nThree clubs that don\u2019t often \u2014 or ever \u2014 win trophies, won a trophy last season. Spurs are 12th in our optimism table, Crystal Palace are 13th and Newcastle bottom. What does this tell us? That having burst through this emotional dam, as Jack puts it so beautifully, everything else is an anti-climax? Or is it that being good is actually quite hard?\nCrystal Palace\nPalace fans are usually the ultimate pessimists so this is a welcome change to see so many feeling good about the season. Inevitably, therefore, ask this question later in the year and they will have flipped to fear and alarm. But maybe this time is different and belief will remain throughout the season.\nMatt Woosnam\nBut if we waited until later in the year, Matt, it wouldn\u2019t be the hope-o-meter any more, it would just be the league table. What a weird thing to say.\nAdvertisement\nLeeds United & Burnley\nA Championship title, 100 points, sensible owners, Elland Road redevelopment plans and seven new signings worth around \u00a375million ($101m) before the end of July. You can see why the majority of Leeds fans are optimistic for what\u2019s to come. However, everyone knows how big the jump is, especially with three starting attackers still to arrive.\nBeren Cross\nUnderstandably scarred from their last Premier League adventure two years ago, it is not a huge surprise that Burnley fans are the least optimistic of the three promoted sides. Their approach will be different under Scott Parker, with a sturdier defence key to the hopes that lessons have been learned.\nThey have lost important pieces from last year's team \u2014 goalkeeper James Trafford, centre-back CJ Egan-Riley and captain Josh Brownhill \u2014 but this survey was also conducted before they spent big on Chelsea pair Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja. A midfielder and striker who were desperately needed.\nAndrew Jones\nI\u2019m lumping Leeds and Burnley fans together because they represent the other side of the promotion coin. Unlike Sunderland, they have recent experience of the Premier League and they fully understand that nothing good can possibly come of it.\nBrentford\nBrentford finished in the top half of the table last season and had three players reach double digits for goals, so why are fans feeling so nervous? They are hovering above the relegation zone because this has been a huge summer of change. They have lost their head coach Thomas Frank, captain Christian Norgaard and top goalscorer Bryan Mbeumo. Yoane Wissa is desperate to leave, too. New head coach Keith Andrews has a huge task on his hand and there is some scepticism around his lack of experience but Brentford\u2019s squad still possesses quality players.\nAdvertisement\nJay Harris\nBrentford are very Weeble-y, too, but surely even Weebles can\u2019t subvert gravity forever. I don\u2019t know enough about how Weebles work \u2014 or how gravity works \u2014 to answer this question, sorry.\nBournemouth\nLast season was a record points haul (56) for Bournemouth as they almost grabbed a European spot. This season, things are going to be different and Bournemouth fans know it. One of the key reasons for that is their outstanding backline has been completely broken up with goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga no longer on loan, centre-back Dean Huijsen having joined Real Madrid, left-back Milos Kerkez now at Liverpool and central defender Illia Zabarnyi on the verge of a move to Paris Saint-Germain.\nCaoimhe O\u2019Neill\nI have to be honest, I\u2019m running out of things to say/sneer about. That always seems to happen when I get to Bournemouth.\nFulham\nHello ambivalence, our old friend. No senior signings (unless you count 34-year-old backup goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte), a head coach constantly linked with other clubs and some of the most expensive regular-season tickets in world sport \u2014 no wonder Fulham fans are getting twitchy. Still, at least the away kit is nice.\nJustin Guthrie\nAmbivalence is underrated IMO. Ambivalence means no hope and therefore no despair. Ambivalence means a look of cool, ironic detachment which would doubtless work very well in that away strip; lime green with a hint of no f***s given.\nWest Ham United\nSome sensible signings, I think, in Mads Hermansen and Kyle Walker-Peters, but otherwise it\u2019s as you were, which was not particularly inspiring. Even though people were pretty happy when Graham Potter replaced Julen Lopetegui, it was a difficult time to come in and things didn\u2019t really improve. There\u2019s nothing shiny and new to get excited about and so the apathy and dirge hasn\u2019t been replaced.\nAdvertisement\nBenji Lanyardo\nBenji is a regular, brilliant contributor to The Totally Football Show and has done me a massive favour with this response, so I\u2019m not going to offer any criticism or mockery. Purely by coincidence, The Apathy and Dirge is the name of my local pub.\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nRemind us, what is hope? It\u2019s not a phenomenon that we often see in the Black Country, although there were a few rare sightings in the Wolverhampton area during six successive wins towards the end of last season. Now, after the loss of Wolves\u2019 two best players and an underwhelming set of signings so far, Wolves fans (and possibly head coach Vitor Pereira) are staring nervously into their Banks\u2019s Bitter.\nSteve Madeley\nWhy do I need to remind you, Steve? Haven\u2019t you been paying attention? It\u2019s the whole point of this whole bloody piece. Hope is genuinely awful, much like this whole bloody piece.\nNewcastle United\nYou can only admire those 19 per cent of Newcastle fans whose optimism remains intact following the most destabilising of summers (for the second successive year). Player rejection after player rejection in the transfer market? We can deal with that. No sporting director and an outgoing CEO? No sweat. And their star striker doing everything possible to force his way out of the club? Things will be fine once the season kicks off. Promise. We're not worried at all\u2026\nChris Waugh\nTrue story: I worked for The Times for 21 years before being hired by The Athletic. After I left, I discovered that my editors there had a nickname for me: the Pope of Mope. This was because I reported on north-east football \u2014 Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough \u2014 and for large chunks of my spell there, north-east football was a wasteland.\nThe very strong intimation is that I was nourished by this wasteland. I grew and blossomed in it.\nAdvertisement\nLast season, Newcastle won their first trophy in my lifetime. Wembley was a tear-streaked masterpiece. It all felt so very hopeful. It was also way beyond my skill set. Give me hardship and bad decisions and I can churn out gore-flecked words in 30 minutes, crammed with pain and fury and gorgeous disappointment.\nGive me glory and\u2026 well, I\u2019m bereft.\nSo hand me my misery cloak. Pass me my pen of doom. Gather ye, oh clouds of despondency, rain blood down onto Gallowgate and soak the ground red. Let it shake. My time cometh again and hope withers in my presence.\n(Header illustration: Kelsea Petersen / The Athletic; Darren Walsh; photos: Getty, Serena Taylor / Getty)"

      "text": "Raphael Varane remembers clearly the moment, 23 minutes into his debut for Serie A side Como.\nHe made a simple movement and as soon as he felt his left knee go, he knew: time to stop.\n\u201cThey told me not to react impulsively,\u201d says Varane, sitting in Como\u2019s trophy room six months later, \u201cbut, deep down, I knew.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNearly 12 years ago, playing for Real Madrid, Varane tore the meniscus in his right knee and required surgery. The former France international subsequently altered his posture, assembled a support team to help him improve his balance, pushed himself to physical extremes and slightly tweaked his way of playing, tackling less and anticipating more.\nAfter that, he won the 2018 World Cup, as well as three consecutive Champions League titles (to give him four in total) with Madrid from 2016 to 2018.\nSo when he injured his left knee that Sunday night last August, in a Coppa Italia first-round tie against Sampdoria, the one which had been compensating for his right all those years, he saw it as a sign. \u201cI thought, \u2018It\u2019s fed up and tired\u2019.\u201d\nAfter making 360 appearances in 10 years for Madrid, where he won 18 trophies, and then 95 appearances for Manchester United where he won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup (as well as playing 93 times for France, winning the 2020-21 Nations League and reaching the 2022 World Cup final), before joining the Italian side as a free agent in July, the 31-year-old decided to hang up his boots.\nDespite feeling disappointed and some guilt at not helping Como more on the pitch, he has accepted his situation and is ready for his new role as a member of their board. Alongside Osian Roberts, Como\u2019s head of development, and Juliette Bolon, head of the education programme, he is supporting the club\u2019s youth development and aims to help young athletes prepare for life beyond football.\nThis summer he will welcome youngsters to residential camps in Como which pair football with education and culture. \u201cI like to build projects that have a vision, a strategy to build innovative things. It\u2019s this innovative side that I like. We want to create something where they (young people) can really understand how to progress and give them a unique experience that will leave a mark on them as players, but also as people. Passing on certain values that will serve them well whatever happens.\u201d\nWhen The Athletic visits, thick cloud and light drizzle, reminiscent of Manchester\u2019s climate, hide the mountains that form a backdrop to Como\u2019s stadium in northern Italy, an hour from Milan. But this is Varane\u2019s ideal weather for training. The former centre-back, who still lives in Madrid, continues to keep fit in retirement \u2014 going to the gym, running and playing padel. Nothing, however, can replace the rush of football\u2019s biggest stage, facing forwards such as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that adrenaline, that tension, that stress,\u201d Varane says. \u201cBut that\u2019s when I played my best matches. You\u2019re more focused because you know you can\u2019t afford to make any mistakes. That forces you to raise your game.\u201d\nHe clearly misses it, but takes pleasure in other football-related pursuits, such as this youth project with Como. \u201cIt\u2019s just different; it\u2019s not better or worse, it\u2019s another life.\u201d\nIn our interview, he talks candidly about:\n- Why Madrid\u2019s players barely spoke to each other on the pitch\n- How he developed his style of defending\n- How the coaching styles at Madrid and United differed\n- His relationship with United manager Erik ten Hag and their \u201crobust discussion\u201d\n- His gratitude at playing a part in United winning last season\u2019s FA Cup\n- Why he was \u201csurprised\u201d United retained Ten Hag after that game\n- \u201cToo many people involved in the decision-making\u201d at United.\nIn his former life with Real Madrid, Varane stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Luka Modric, Marcelo, Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re a gladiator, or a soldier on a mission,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you step onto the field, you\u2019re ready to give everything you\u2019ve got to win.\u201d\nThat Madrid side\u2019s winning formula, he believes, was their talent as a generation, all in their prime, but also the stability among a squad full of leaders, and their shared mentality.\n\u201cPsychologically, we never thought we were favourites,\u201d Varane says. \u201cWe had to be on another level, like when smaller sides take on big teams. It\u2019s a mixture of playing with humility \u2014 we had to achieve something every time \u2014 and a bit of arrogance. We knew our strengths but we were not overconfident. If we slackened off just a little bit, it was all over.\u201d\nWhat was remarkable to Varane was that the Madrid players barely spoke to each other on the pitch. \u201cEveryone knew exactly what they had to do. Sometimes we pressed, sometimes we didn\u2019t, and in fact nobody gave a signal. There were matches that for the first 30 minutes you sensed things weren\u2019t going well, we were blocked and the space was elsewhere. We changed without even talking.\u201d\nMadrid were flexible in their setup, unpredictable in terms of approach.\n\u201cWhen you started the match, you didn\u2019t know exactly how you were going to play. We didn\u2019t just play or press one way. Sometimes we attacked even when we didn\u2019t expect to, but we saw an opening and went for it.\n\u201cWe were a very instinctive team. That\u2019s why I consider it an art. It\u2019s not robotic. There are always surprises. An action that worked one time may not work again. You always have to reinvent, rediscover, adapt.\u201d\nVarane\u2019s style of play was all about instinct. At the start of his career in France with Lens, defenders were seen, in his words, as an \u201caggressive player who was dirty, rough, and stepped on the attacker\u2019s toes\u201d. But that changed, and what had been perceived by some as his weakness as a youngster became his strength. Don Limpio \u2014 Mr Clean, after a brand of household detergent \u2014 was the nickname Spanish media gave the Frenchman. \u201cI made very few mistakes and didn\u2019t pick up many cards (24 in his 10 seasons). I didn\u2019t force situations. My movements were about sensing where the danger lies.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHis favourite defensive action was all about anticipation. There was nothing more satisfying for Varane than reading an attacker\u2019s run, getting ahead of them and nicking the ball. \u201cAnticipate to defend, so you don\u2019t even have a duel,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way, because the attacker feels disarmed and helpless. He couldn\u2019t even fight. Sometimes they\u2019d say, \u2018I didn\u2019t even play the ball\u2019.\u201d On one occasion, when he caught out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the former Arsenal and Barcelona striker said, \u201cYou\u2019re fast.\u201d\nVarane used his speed to cover for his fellow defenders. \u201cYou try to get forward but you know the danger is behind. You can\u2019t get caught out. I liked to anticipate the balls in behind. Sometimes there were players who would disguise the pass.\u201d Varane says he looked for telltale details such as the opponent\u2019s body position upon receiving the ball. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to play the pass, but he could play it and I\u2019m already anticipating.\u201d\nWhen Varane watches football now, he focuses on players\u2019 attitude when the ball is on the other side of the pitch. Are they ready? For him, that is what distinguishes the best players. \u201cThere were games where, for 10 or 15 minutes, I didn\u2019t touch the ball and yet I was concentrating non-stop,\u201d he says. \u201cI did a lot of moving that you didn\u2019t necessarily see, and that\u2019s why most of my work was invisible.\u201d\nIt was under Carlo Ancelotti that Varane won the first of his four Champions League trophies with Madrid, in the 2013-14 season to complete La Decima (the club\u2019s 10th European title), in a setup that allowed each player to express their creativity. \u201cHe\u2019s very close to the players, understands them and knows how to make them feel comfortable and confident on the pitch,\u201d he says of Ancelotti, now back at the Bernabeu for a second spell that has seen him win two more Champions League finals.\nVarane found Zinedine Zidane, the legendary French player who steered Madrid to nine trophies as head coach from 2016 to 2018, to be similar. \u201cVery calm, positive, always ready to defend his players. When a coach gives his players confidence like that, the players want to reciprocate.\u201d\nAfter a decade at the Spanish giants though, Varane moved on. \u201cI felt I couldn\u2019t do any more than I had already, I couldn\u2019t develop in the way I wanted. Madrid was exceptional, but I\u2019d already done it.\u201d\nHe wanted a new challenge and was attracted by the Premier League. In the summer of 2021, he swapped Real Madrid for Manchester United, two teams in very different situations. \u201cIt was a club that always made me dream. The stadium, the fans, what it represents.\u201d Varane was enticed by the idea of building something, and wanted to use his experience to help United try to win trophies.\nAdvertisement\nIn his first season, he played under three managers: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick (a short spell in caretaker charge) and Ralf Rangnick (an interim appointment from the November). Erik ten Hag was then named as the next permanent manager in April 2022 to take over for that summer. His coaching style was a stark contrast to Varane\u2019s Madrid experience.\n\u201cIt was the opposite,\u201d he says, \u201cwith fairly rigid patterns of play defined in advance. There was very little flexibility in terms of adapting on the pitch. The game plans were very, very precise, with lots and lots of information. It was different.\u201d\nAs an instinctive player, Varane preferred more autonomy, which he had at his previous club and with France. \u201cWe could say to each other, \u2018You have to do it more like this\u2019, instead of a system that was, let\u2019s say, a bit blocked by the coach\u2019s instructions.\u201d\nVarane describes his relationship with Ten Hag as \u201ca bit idiosyncratic\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find the right words. It was very tense at times. Sometimes he made an effort to listen to the players\u2019 feedback. Sometimes he made decisions without listening to the players\u2019 feelings. So there were ups and downs. It was complicated at times.\u201d\nVarane was Ten Hag\u2019s first-choice centre-back in that 2022-23 season but from the October to mid-December of the following campaign he did not start a game, despite being available. He played only 18 minutes in nine league games during that period and did not feature in a Manchester derby which United lost 3-0 to City at Old Trafford. At the time, Ten Hag told the media it was for \u201ctactical reasons\u201d. It was perceived by some at the club that Varane could not cope physically with the manager\u2019s desire to play a high line. United were left with a high press but a low-block defence, which left big gaps in between.\nAccording to Varane, Ten Hag did not offer him an explanation for leaving him out, other than it was for the best of the team. \u201cWe had a robust discussion. We told each other some truths, but then I didn\u2019t play for almost two months. I said I didn\u2019t agree with certain ways of doing things regarding the relationship between him and the team. It wasn\u2019t something that I thought was good for the team because some of the players weren\u2019t at all satisfied. It was not good in terms of the relationship with the coach.\n\u201cHe said \u2018OK, I hear what you said\u2019 and after that I didn\u2019t play.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nVarane did not feel Ten Hag was making an example of him but he did with other players and cited Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho as examples. He believes Ten Hag \u201cwanted to gain respect through fear, perhaps\u201d. \u201cHe always needed an example of a player who was alone the entire time he was at Manchester. He did that with at least one important player on the team. He was always in conflict with certain leaders of the group. That is his way of managing.\u201d\nWhile that is Varane\u2019s perspective, other players, such as Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo blossomed under Ten Hag, while Casemiro, another who won trophies galore with Real Madrid before a move to Old Trafford, has told Spanish outlet AS that his first season at United (2022-23) was his best as a professional.\nWhen Varane was brought back into the team just before Christmas, he felt it was because United were struggling with injuries, rather than any reconciliation. He played 90 minutes in 10 of the next 12 league games, missing one because of illness. But in the April he suffered a muscle injury and was sidelined for seven more matches.\nAsked about why United struggled with injuries, Varane, an advocate for player welfare who has spoken out about the dangers of an increasingly demanding playing schedule and the consequences of concussion, says \u201cit\u2019s not just Manchester United\u2019s problem, it\u2019s a global problem. Things are getting worse and worse. It\u2019s a system that has put the players in the red zone\u201d.\nVarane managed to return to fitness in time for the FA Cup final at the end of May.\n\u201cI also have to recognise what was good (about Ten Hag\u2019s management). He gave me the peace of mind to come back from my injury to play in the FA Cup final. He was counting on me. That was very positive, because it allowed me to play my role in the team,\u201d says Varane. \u201cWe had ups and downs. I can\u2019t say everything was bad. There were complicated moments.\u201d\nWinning the FA Cup at Wembley by beating Manchester City in his final game for United was a special moment for Varane and the team, especially after a difficult season overall. \u201cThe players really came together for the same goal with a clear idea of how to play,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not only an individual achievement but a collective one, to make the players believe that it was possible. The players accepted the challenge and managed to forget everything negative that had happened to really be 100 per cent in this match.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI wanted the best for the team. Sometimes I said things to the coach, not for me, but for the team, or because players felt things. The FA Cup (final) was not about proving something to him at all. My motivation was to achieve with the team, to make the fans happy and above all to experience this feeling of entering the pitch as a gladiator who returns victorious. It\u2019s the best feeling.\u201d\nThe build-up to United\u2019s 2-1 victory, however, was dominated by uncertainty over Ten Hag\u2019s future. The manager admitted after the game that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d whether it had been his last match in charge, but following an end-of-season review, led by United\u2019s new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS business empire\u2019s sporting director Sir Dave Brailsford, Ten Hag was kept on. \u201cI was surprised he stayed,\u201d says Varane. \u201cThe connection with the group no longer existed.\u201d\nVarane\u2019s contract ran until 2024, with an option for a further season. He wanted to stay for another year but during conversations, which involved United\u2019s then football director John Murtough and Brailsford, it was clear that club and player were not aligned. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who the coach would be. I didn\u2019t know if they wanted to change the squad a lot or not. I had no visibility, so it\u2019s difficult to commit when you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re committing to.\u201d\nThe two parties mutually agreed to end his contract and Varane left as a free agent. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t problematic,\u201d he says.\nVarane\u2019s three years at United spanned a turbulent period at the club and his time ended just after the arrival of INEOS. He noted, however, key differences in the running of the organisation compared with how it was done at Madrid.\n\u201cEven from the inside as a player, there wasn\u2019t a clear structure on how things were going to work. There hasn\u2019t been a fixed methodology for years. At Madrid, they have a defined way of doing things at every level of the club. At Manchester (United), it was not clear or defined enough to know how to recruit, how to play, how to communicate. There weren\u2019t the same procedures, processes, structure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one person\u2019s responsibility. That\u2019s the problem \u2014 we don\u2019t even know whose fault it is. It has to be in the overall structure of the organisation. There were too many people involved in the decision-making process, so we didn\u2019t know who was really making the decisions. I can\u2019t say who was responsible, I don\u2019t know. It was a bit of everyone and a bit of no one.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nVarane uses structuring a squad as an example of the clubs\u2019 differing approaches.\n\u201cAt Madrid, you can see that for years there has been a framework. A player is added, some leave, but there is always a solid foundation. When you recruit young, talented players, they have to learn before they can play. It gives them time to develop. When I arrived, at the age of 18, I had no responsibilities in the dressing room. I was just there to learn.\n\u201cAt United, they can recruit a very expensive young player and immediately play him, with all the responsibilities in an extremely difficult league. He\u2019s got a huge weight on his shoulders straight away.\u201d\nVarane feels United have \u201csuccumbed to the pressure of expectation\u201d. \u201cYou have to be able to build a long-term strategy while resisting the daily pressure and matches every three days. That\u2019s what\u2019s difficult. For years, the fans have been expecting to win immediately. Those who take the decisions to achieve these goals want to achieve them straight away.\n\u201cYou have to be calm in a storm in the knowledge you are building something. Sometimes, when the storm came, we needed to make quick decisions, change something. At Real Madrid, people accept the pressure and know how to live with it.\n\u201cWhen I say that the players are in the best conditions at Madrid, it\u2019s because we\u2019re trying to protect them from that pressure. There\u2019s enough pressure already playing on the pitch, with the fans, media and social media. That\u2019s why there was a bit of a protective atmosphere around the players at Madrid. It\u2019s the club where there\u2019s undoubtedly the most pressure. But whether it\u2019s the coach, or the way the club handles difficult situations, it\u2019s really a protection against that pressure. At Manchester, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nDuring those years at United, Varane shared the dressing room with his best friend in football, Bruno Fernandes, who along with David de Gea and Marcus Rashford, were the players at the club who impressed him the most. \u201cEven in difficult moments, they are capable of doing extraordinary things. It\u2019s difficult to perform well individually when the team is struggling. You have to be very very strong,\u201d he says.\nVarane has mixed views regarding United academy graduate Rashford\u2019s recent loan move to fellow Premier League side Aston Villa, only a couple of hours by car from Old Trafford, for the rest of the season.\n\u201cStaying for so many years with this level of intensity and demand, years when the overall atmosphere is often negative because performances are below expectations, it\u2019s very, very difficult. For him to change his environment is positive. He is someone who loves the club and who gives everything for the shirt. But I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s going (to a club) so close to Manchester. I imagined him going further than a few kilometres away.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nManchester United have sunk to a new Premier League low, so at what point does patience snap?\nDespite some of his frustrations, Varane has fond memories of his time in Manchester and says he had an overall positive experience. He learnt a lot and loved the fans\u2019 pride and the respect they had for the United players. \u201cIt was a huge source of motivation and we wanted to repay the love they gave us on the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were ready to fight and even in difficult situations, we never gave up.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nVarane describes United as an \u201cexceptional, magical and unique\u201d club. \u201cI have so much respect and love for the club that I can only be positive. Even when I say things that aren\u2019t going well, it\u2019s well intentioned and constructive. It\u2019s not to point the finger at someone. I only wish the club well and hope they succeed.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Varane is adjusting to a new life balance as he moves from footballer to board member. \u201cComo is a special project,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a different vision. It\u2019s about ambition but also about values. It\u2019s also a very special setting, a place where I can make a contribution and help develop the club.\u201d\n(Top photos: Como 1907; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

      "text": "It was approaching midday and the first-team players at FC Pacos de Ferreira were being put through their paces. They ran and ran under a scalding sun. At the top of the hour, their work done, they walked off, in ones and twos, to seek refreshment and shade.\nIt looked a lot like a normal day of pre-season training. Just around the corner, though, on Rua do Estadio, the club\u2019s flag flew at half-mast. Visible above the west stand of Pacos\u2019 stadium was an electronic billboard bearing a message and a photo.\n\u201cForever,\u201d it read. The photo was of Diogo Jota.\nInside the main stand is the old first-team changing room. The floor is green and white checkerboard, the wooden lockers starting to show their age. It was here, in October 2014, that Jota pulled on the yellow Pacos jersey ahead of his first match in senior football. When he left to join Atletico Madrid two years later, the windfall allowed the club to build a new eastern stand with more modern facilities.\n\u201cWe call that the Diogo Jota stand,\u201d explained Paulo Goncalves, the club\u2019s long-serving technical secretary.\nOutside, Goncalves pointed to the far end of the pitch. \u201cThat was where he scored his first goal,\u201d he said. He pointed towards the tribune. \u201cHe ran and hugged his mum over there.\u201d\nJota only played 45 times for Pacos. When his career clicked into gear, taking him from this modest club to stardom, he might easily have moved on, cut ties. But his gratitude to Pacos \u2014 for launching his career, for taking a chance on him when the country\u2019s big hitters would not \u2014 forged a strong connection.\nAdvertisement\nHe acted as a \u2018godfather\u2019 to youth players during a summer tournament last year, lending advice and support from afar. He would drop in when he was in the area. \u201cHe was always in touch, always sending us messages,\u201d said Goncalves, the emotion audible in his voice. \u201cEspecially in difficult moments.\u201d\nOne thing that has become apparent since the death of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, is that everyone has a story about him \u2014 little examples of his decency, his humanity, his heart. The tales come from Liverpool, from Wolverhampton, from a hundred other places.\nTravelling through the north of Portugal, though, what really struck home was the regionality of this tragedy.\nJota was born in Porto. He spent his childhood in Gondomar, a sleepy satellite city, and played for the local team. His grandfather still lives there, down a bumpy path off Rua da Minhoteira. Jota\u2019s parents were in the house next door; the kids learned to play football in the connecting yard. When Jota left SC Gondomar, it was only for Pacos, 30 minutes away. He later returned to the region with FC Porto. His brother played for Penafiel, another local team. Their father, Joaquim, spent his youth in Foz de Sousa, just to the south. Jota\u2019s widow, Rute Cardoso, grew up in Jovim.\nThe entire region is in mourning for the loss of two of its sons. For huge numbers of locals, the loss is all the more acute for being personal.\nTake Vitor Borges, a taxi driver who worked for years with Jota\u2019s mother, Isabel, at the Ficosa car factory in Porto. \u201cHer and her husband overcame a lot to raise those boys,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cAnd all of it gone, just like that. No one deserves this, but least of all her.\u201d\nOr Miguel Pereira, a former neighbour of Jota and Silva, slightly older but young enough to remember kick-arounds at the red asphalt court at the top of their road. He brought up a photo on his phone: his son Vasco with Jota, taken in May 2024. \u201cIt was a year ago but it feels like yesterday,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\nPereira had come to the headquarters of Gondomar SC to pay his respects. Vasco and his cousin Goncalo play for the club\u2019s under-eight team. They recently won their local league title and had brought a replica of the trophy with them to lay down in tribute. They wound a Gondomar scarf around it before setting it down.\nGondomar\u2019s academy is named after Jota. His face adorns the side of the main stand. On the clubhouse, there are images of him as a boy, in Gondomar\u2019s shirt, and as an adult, playing for the Portugal national team. On Friday afternoon, the site had been transformed into a temporary shrine. There were flowers, candles and scarves, photos and drawings. There were football jerseys bearing messages written in marker pen. \u201cYou will always be our hero,\u201d read one. \u201cDiogo and Andre, forever sons of this land,\u201d read another.\nAt the back of the main stand is a training pitch, the astroturf degraded, and an old club minibus. Jota played here between 2005 and 2013; there\u2019s a good chance that minibus took him and his brother to games in nearby towns, their paths criss-crossing the foothills.\nOn the main pitch, the sprinklers were on. Six starlings perched behind the goal. Through the main gate, more people came: two teenage girls in Liverpool shirts, three young men on their lunch breaks.\nPedro Figueiredo, a Porto fan, had felt an urge to pay his respects. \u201cHe played for my club and I admired him a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came from nothing and worked immensely hard.\u201d\nEugenia Dias had brought her granddaughter, Bernadita. They laid a hortencia down together. \u201cDiogo was an idol to the people of Gondomar,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son played with him when they were small, maybe five or six. We\u2019re all in mourning. We felt he was ours, in a way.\u201d\nA sign just off the main route into Gondomar informs you that this is Portugal\u2019s goldsmith capital. There are around 450 businesses producing jewellery in the city. Their products are sold around the globe.\nThere is an obvious resonance here. Not just because Jota was a gem but because he needed working; we are not talking here about a sure thing, one of those kids who was only ever going to be a superstar. He was still playing for Gondomar at 17. Porto did not want him, hence the move to Pacos. His was a grinding, blue-collar path to the top. It made it all the more meaningful to those who followed it.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was a humble man, someone who fought for everything he had in his life,\u201d said Gondomar resident Maria Nogueira. \u201cHe was a symbol of the region.\u201d\nShe was stood outside the Matriz de Gondomar church. It was Friday afternoon, just before 4pm. The public wake for Jota and Silva was yet to start but already a large crowd had gathered. Some people strained for a view of the chapel, for a sight of the family. Others took shelter under trees.\nWhen the doors opened, people formed a line. They waited in the afternoon heat: men in polo shirts, men with walking sticks, women with flowers, families. They kissed their neighbours and friends, shared pallid smiles. They came to leave wreaths, to say prayers, to say nothing at all, to be silenced by the senselessness of it all.\n\u201cI just thought it was important to pay tribute,\u201d said Fernando Eusebio, who wore a Porto shirt and admitted he did not know how he would react to seeing the coffins inside. Another man clutched a large bouquet to his chest. He said he was a childhood friend of Cardoso, Jota\u2019s widow. The sentence got caught in his throat; he struggled to get the last words of it out at all.\nAs the public entered, friends and relatives of the family began to depart. There was a girl, wrapped in a Portugal flag, crying. The Porto president Andre Villas-Boas was ashen-faced, as was Diogo Dalot, Jota\u2019s Portugal team-mate. At the chapel\u2019s exit, an elderly woman wiped away tears. Her husband stared into space.\nTheir devastation was comprehensible. The scene inside \u2014 Jota\u2019s parents sobbing, Cardoso stricken by grief \u2014 was one of almost unbearable sadness.\nWhen the church bells rang at 5pm, the queue was still growing, people arriving at the end of their work days, wearing suits and supermarket uniforms, exhausted but present. They kept coming, too, the line eventually winding around the side of the cemetery, the flow only slowing when the sun had finally begun to tire of its own vigil.\nThe following day, the funeral would bring further emotion. New faces, too: the Liverpool delegation, more of Jota\u2019s Portugal team-mates, flown in from the four corners of the globe. Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo played in Florida on Friday night at the Club World Cup and were here at 10am on Saturday morning. It would be a world event \u2014 testament, in its way, to football\u2019s reach, as well as to the breadth of lives touched by Jota.\nAdvertisement\nBeing here, though, among the queueing locals, it was impossible not to think about roots: those that ground us, that keep us connected to where we come from, if we allow them to. It is obvious that Jota nourished his. Cherished them, too. That, far more than his ability as a footballer, made these people love him.\nFor the family, there is only pain, as raw as it is unjust, a wound they cannot even yet fully comprehend, let alone cauterise. But later, you hope, that will soften into gratitude \u2014 for the 28 years they had with him, for the memories, for the beauty he gave not just to their lives but those of so many others.\nWaiting to enter the chapel and say a prayer for Jota, Maria Nogueira held a bunch of flowers with a note attached.\n\u201cThank you, Diogo,\u201d it read, \u201cfor making so many people happy.\u201d\n(All photos: Jack Lang/The Athletic; Illustration: Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; Top Photos: Rene Nijhuis/MB Media, Octavio Passos/Getty Images, Jack Lang/The Athletic)"

      "text": "First things first, can somebody \u2014 anybody \u2014 please locate Rob Tanner, The Athletic\u2019s Leicester City correspondent, and give him a big hug?\nThat's 3 defeats on the spin without scoring a goal. In 16 seasons covering #LCFC I can't remember a more troubled and concerning pre-season. It may be only pre-season, but it doesn't provide much confidence.\n\u2014 Rob Tanner (@RobTannerLCFC) August 10, 2024\nJesus, Rob. It\u2019s August! The sun\u2019s out! Cheer up! We\u2019re not supposed to be this depressed yet!\nA story of hope; that\u2019s what this is supposed to be. The Premier League is back, shinier and lovelier than ever and, my gracious, we all feel happy about it, don\u2019t we*? This is what we live for, that spike of adrenaline, this surge of optimism. We surf towards the start of the season on a wave of possibility because this year \u2014 FINALLY \u2014 might just be our year. Down with the naysayers, up with a sense of renewal and away we go.\n*At least until the points deductions kick in, the asterisks start appearing on the league table and we remember that football is more about PSR, VAR, WTF, accountancy and legal cases than actual, y\u2019know, sport and stuff\u2026\nNo, no, no, NO! This is Rob\u2019s malign influence rubbing off on me.\nObviously, in Rob\u2019s case, this is a story of bleakness, despair, the utter futility of existence and taking a cheese-grater to the soul, but the rest of us don\u2019t have to be like that.\nNot until next week, anyway! Ha-ha-ha.\nYes, you guessed it, The Athletic\u2019s great hope-o-meter is back, swaying into the room like a drunken idiot.\nAdvertisement\nWe\u2019ve been doing this for a while now, asking you, our loyal readers, to gauge how hopeful you feel about your respective clubs\u2019 chances. The question we pose is very basic: Do you feel optimistic or pessimistic about the season ahead? Then, once we\u2019ve run your answers through our sophisticated data software, we basically just p**s ourselves laughing at how deluded you all are.\nCase in point, Nottingham Forest. Like, what is all that about? As you can see, Forest supporters are chart-toppers for hope this season which, on the face of it, feels\u2026 strange? In 2022-23, they were full of vim on their return to the Premier League, and quite rightly so because promotion erases the sour memory of losing. In 2023-24, they dropped from 94 per cent optimistic to 49 per cent optimistic because, oh yes, that\u2019s right, losing is s**t and vim became vomit.\nAnd that pessimism was not misplaced; Forest finished fourth-bottom that season. So what exactly has happened in the interim? Caveat: here we must acknowledge that we are living in a world of election interference. It is entirely plausible that bad actors working on behalf of other media companies may be attempting to destroy our hard-won credibility \u2014 ha-ha-ha-ha, no but seriously \u2014 by influencing these results\u2026\nSorry, just to interrupt myself quickly\u2026 Has anyone checked in on Rob recently?\nRob Tanner: \u201cThe promotion party is well and truly over \u2014 Leicester City\u2019s preparations for their Premier League return has ensured that.\u201d\nOK, so it\u2019s no change with Rob.\nBack to Forest and their Panglossian buoyancy. To get to the bottom of which I drafted in our very own Paul Taylor. A great fella, great writer and the man in the know when it comes to all things on the banks of the River Trent. My request was straightforward; please explain, in one pithy paragraph, the reason for all this hope. Here is Paul\u2019s response.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cForest fans have had a love-hate relationship with hope. They hoped desperately for 23 long years that they would one day secure a return to the Premier League. Time and again, those hopes were dashed. Play-offs heartache. Managerial meltdowns. Even relegation to League One. For Forest, hope always went painfully unfulfilled. It didn\u2019t lead you to Anfield or Old Trafford, but to Yeovil and Hartlepool.\n\u201cHope was something to be scared of. Hope always lets you down. But then it finally happened. Their dreams became a reality under Steve Cooper. Forest were back in the Premier League. Then they dared to hope that they would stay at the top table. And it\u2019s happened, not just once, but twice.\n\u201cThis summer, Forest\u2019s biggest hope has been achieved again in that they have so far managed to navigate their way through without having to cash in on either of their two most valuable assets \u2014 Morgan Gibbs-White and Murillo. For two decades, bitter experience taught Forest fans that hope was a pointless endeavour; a cruel mistress. Now, as they prepare for a third season back in the top flight, hope might be their most valuable asset.\u201d\nTo which I can only say: Tayls, mate, I said one f*****g paragraph! And, with respect, I quite clearly said pithy!\nI know we\u2019re The Athletic and we can\u2019t record a scoreline without first walking from Jurgen Klopp\u2019s cousin\u2019s house to Wembley while visiting every shop anyone who has ever played for Forest Green Rovers has bought kale in, but I\u2019ve read shorter novels than that! I\u2019m just not reading all those words, Paul! Which means that Forest\u2019s great hope will forever be a mystery to me.\nAnnoying.\nHow\u2019s Rob doing? Any better?\nRob Tanner: \u201cAn unexpected managerial change and an unconvincing transfer window so far has left many Leicester fans wondering whether their heroes going into the new season are actually weaker than they were in the Championship last season.\u201d\nNo, obviously not.\nIn its own way, isn\u2019t this kind of reassuring, though? As someone who has followed (or rather, traipsed behind) Newcastle United for his entire life, I can\u2019t help but crave a bit of misery. You knew where you stood with misery \u2014 which was in dog s**t, basically, but familiar dog s**t. To be honest, being good isn\u2019t much fun. Being good is stressful, because when you win it\u2019s more about relief than enjoyment and when you lose it\u2019s apocalyptic.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle\u2019s rolling position on the hope-o-meter is illustrative of this: 2022-23; third and 96 per cent optimistic, 2023-24; fifth at 91 per cent, 2024-25; joint-seventh with 89 per cent.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, hope has been a nice change, sure, but at the current rate of descent, Mike Ashley will be back and we\u2019ll be moaning like Rob within a couple of seasons. Can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m old. Way too old to learn and deploy all these new words and phrases like \u2018competing\u2019, \u2018goals\u2019 and \u2018not wholly awful at football\u2019. Sorry, but it\u2019s just not for me.\nAmazingly, Rob\u2019s mob aren\u2019t even bottom of the hope table. That discordant distinction goes to Chelsea, with only 29 per cent of their fans feeling optimistic about what\u2019s ahead. This is a big contrast to 12 months ago, when they were fourth on our list with 92 per cent. And so this is a club who, in the language of the barroom, are bouncing off the walls, p****d out of their skulls but somehow still clutching their packet of pork scratchings.\nA year ago, they had just appointed Mauricio Pochettino and bought lots of good young players and things were looking rosy. Admittedly, they had put most of those signings on 25-year contracts, which was slightly peculiar. Even so \u2014 rosy. Now? They\u2019re up to double figures when it comes to new signings, which means Chelsea Football Club officially have a bigger population than the nation of Liechtenstein, and they\u2019ve got Leicester\u2019s old manager and, as we have already established, Leicester are totally f****d.\nOn which note, back to Rob.\nRob Tanner: \u201cEven the most optimistic fans \u2014 and they may be difficult to find \u2014 would admit that, with the prospect of a profit and sustainability points deduction, the odds are stacked against Leicester staying up.\u201d\nHonestly, it\u2019s like pulling on an old jumper, isn\u2019t it? So warm and comforting and sad.\nGO DEEPER\nPremier League clubs' young player to watch out for this season\nBut, yeah, Chelsea. Here\u2019s more, from one of our Chelsea writers.\nLiam Twomey: \u201cIt might be easier to list the reasons why Chelsea supporters should feel optimistic about the 2024-25 season. There\u2019s Cole Palmer, now committed to Stamford Bridge until 2033 (!) and\u2026 well. The truth is, almost everything beyond Palmer is a question mark, from the bulk of what remains one of the youngest squads in the Premier League to the inexperienced new head coach whose Pep Guardiola-influenced tactical system yielded one win in six pre-season games.\n\u201cAdd to that a seemingly endless recruitment drive that has a scattergun feel and the fact that general-admission season-ticket prices have risen for the first time in more than a decade, and you have a textbook recipe for pessimism.\u201d\nPaging Paul Taylor. See, Tayls? It can be done. Not quite one paragraph, admittedly, but still. Compared to your opus, this was pithy. Thank you for your service, Liam.\nAdvertisement\nOther Premier League depressives? Manchester United who, like Chelsea, have become synonymous with chaos, are third-bottom with 49 per cent. Southampton are joint fourth-last, which is slightly surprising because they\u2019ve just come back up and have the benefit of not being Leicester City.\nThen it\u2019s Brentford, Everton, Tottenham Hotspur\u2026 hmmm\u2026 and oh, hello Manchester City! Thirteenth in the table with 79 per cent when you\u2019re such a truly spectacular football team and basically win everything? I wonder why? Wink, wink, wink, nudge, eh? Wink, nudge.\nCOUGHitsbecauseyouthinkyouregettingrelegatedpossiblyCOUGH.\nWhat about those clubs nearer the top of our table? Arsenal are second, which is absolutely perfect because they will forever be second. Bournemouth are joint-third, which suggests this survey actually needs a bit of election interference, because it was presumably conducted before Dominic Solanke signed for Spurs last weekend. Crystal Palace are level with them, which would be interesting if Crystal Palace were themselves interesting. Then it\u2019s Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers (both also at 93 per cent) and Ipswich Town (level with Newcastle).\nAston Villa have plummeted from the summit last year to 12th, which feels noteworthy. Is this a realistic appraisal of their high player turnover this summer and how being in the Champions League might affect their domestic form? I guess we\u2019ll find out soon enough, which absolutely yes is code for me not being prepared to do any more research or involve any more of my colleagues.\nYet for the sake of completion, for the squaring of hope\u2019s circle, we must return to Rob.\nDoes he have anything positive to say? Amid all these dark clouds, can he spot even the merest sliver of silver?\nRob Tanner: \u201cLeicester have defied the odds before\u2026\u201d\nAdvertisement\nYES, ROB!! YESSSSSSS! Here he is! Back on the front foot, back in the game, summoning up that incredible, indomitable spirit of 2015-16, when Leicester railed against the natural order and won the Premi\u2026\nRob Tanner: \u201c\u2026 but fans must strap in for a rough ride.\u201d\nOh. Oh, right.\nThe Premier League is back, its icy tendrils envelop us, darkness falls and we shall never smile again.\nGO DEEPER\nPremier League preview: Our writers predict what will happen in 2024-25\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "For more than three years, Thomas Partey played for Arsenal after being accused of very serious sexual offences.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get away from Arsenal,\u201d says one of the women who made allegations against him, referencing the huge impact of the Premier League club with fans all around the world.\nShe watched him play knowing that this was a choice the club had consciously made; to let him play on despite the huge legal and moral questions about how appropriate it was for Partey to continue to represent the club.\nAdvertisement\nPartey, 32, left Arsenal on the expiration of his contract on June 30, having made 167 appearances for the club he joined in October 2020 from Atletico Madrid for a fee of \u00a345million (now $61m).\nFour days later, he was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The alleged offences are reported to have taken place between 2021 and 2022 and relate to three women. Partey denies all the charges and his lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, said in a statement her client welcomed \u201cthe opportunity to finally clear his name.\u201d\nArsenal are a club that takes pride in its adherence to the rules, for example the financial laws which govern the game. It is one of the core principles of the club.\nThey are not the first football club at which a player has been accused of sexual offences and they will not be the last. The court process will decide whether he is guilty or not but questions are now being asked about how Partey\u2019s former club handled the accusations against the midfielder, and the impact of their decisions: on fans of the club and the women who complained.\nPartey could not be named publicly under UK law until he was charged, while those who report alleged sexual offences are entitled to anonymity for life. That is also why comments are turned off on this article. But the world of social media does not play by the same rules.\nEvery time Partey played for Arsenal, one alleged victim says she received online abuse. Sometimes it was directed at her; other times, it was people talking in general and derogatory terms about Partey\u2019s accusers.\n\u201cI would frequently get messages from fans,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d send me pictures of him playing or scoring\u2026 I would get death threats, rape threats, people saying they\u2019d set me on fire. If he scored, for example, the abuse would be worse.\u201d\nIn this report, The Athletic can detail:\n- In August 2021, Partey was reported to police for the first time.\n- In September 2021, Arsenal were contacted by one woman to make them aware of the traumatic experiences she said she had with Partey.\n- Arsenal were also subsequently contacted by the police to inform them that Partey was being investigated for serious sexual offences.\n- Arsenal were aware that the Crown Prosecution Service \u2014 which decides whether cases should be prosecuted \u2014 was in the process of making its charging decision when they entered into talks with Partey about a new contract earlier this year.\nArsenal said in a statement: \u201cThe player\u2019s contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings, the club is unable to comment on the case.\u201d\nHere, The Athletic examines what Arsenal knew when, and whether, realistically, based on legal guidance, they could have done anything differently.\nShould they have continued to play Partey? Were there other options? Why did they enter in discussions about extending his contract earlier this year? And how did that make people feel?\nPartey was first reported to police in 2021. The complainant\u2019s next step was to inform his club of the allegations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Arsenal,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cThey won\u2019t just ignore it.\u201d\nShe initially wrote to the club\u2019s safeguarding team, who passed her on to the legal department.\nArsenal\u2019s response was that they were following all the requisite safeguarding legislation, given she was not under 18.\nAdvertisement\nShe also alerted the English Football Association, which gave a similar response and said her claims fell outside of the FA\u2019s safeguarding remit. When contacted by The Athletic, the FA said that on account of the ongoing and live criminal investigation, it is not in a position to comment.\nIn her dialogue with Arsenal, which took place over phone and email, she occasionally felt that those she engaged with \u2014 including some of the club\u2019s senior figures \u2014 did not show an appropriate degree of sympathy.\nArsenal were later informed by the Metropolitan Police that Partey was being investigated for serious sexual offences. Throughout the remainder of Partey\u2019s time with Arsenal \u2014 and their contract negotiations earlier this summer \u2014 the club were aware that there was a possibility charges would be issued.\nDespite the club telling the alleged victim they were taking the matter \u201cextremely seriously\u201d, Partey continued to play for Arsenal \u2014 and was promoted via their media channels. In the days following her initial complaint to the club, he appeared prominently on a number of social media posts.\n\ud83d\udd19 in the squad \ud83d\ude0a\n\ud83d\udc4b @Thomaspartey22 #ARSNOR pic.twitter.com/TPXNlmytU7\n\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal) September 11, 2021\nThis continued intermittently over the seasons that followed. While Partey\u2019s involvement in promotional and marketing materials did appear to reduce, his continued presence in the team meant he never disappeared entirely from view. At international level, he also represented Ghana at the 2022 World Cup.\nArsenal\u2019s stance never shifted. Partey continued to play a prominent role at Arsenal; when he was first arrested in July 2022, and when the case was passed to the CPS in December 2024.\n\u201cIt felt so disheartening\u2026 even when the police specified that they had made the allegations clear to the club, and how serious they (the alleged offences) are,\u201d says one woman.\nArsenal\u2019s decision to offer Partey a new contract is arguably what has raised most questions.\nIn October 2020, Partey signed a five-year deal that made him one of the club\u2019s highest earners. That deal was set to expire this summer, and the expectation had been that he would leave the club on a free transfer, especially given the added complication of the allegations and the risk he could soon be charged. As the end of his contract approached, however, his role in the first team remained prominent.\nAdvertisement\nLast season, Partey made 52 appearances across all competitions. In May 2025, manager Mikel Arteta confirmed his desire for Partey to remain at the club.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said the Arsenal manager when asked if he wanted to retain Partey. \u201cIn regards to Thomas, consistency-wise, it\u2019s been his best season. I think the way he\u2019s played, performed, his availability has been exceptional, and he\u2019s a really important player for us.\u201d\nIt was not the first time Arteta had been publicly supportive of Partey. In October 2022, after Partey scored against Tottenham Hotspur, Arteta told TNT Sports: \u201cFor what he\u2019s been through, and the injuries, and for the effort he\u2019s put in this week to be available for the team, I\u2019m so happy for him, he deserves it.\u201d\nThese remarks appear emblematic of the attitude of the football side of the business. As one senior member of staff remarked in 2022, \u201cWe have to believe him, he is our player.\u201d\nFor some fans, however, the issue is not so black and white. When a player faces such serious allegations, irrespective of the strength of the claims or denials, it causes a moral dilemma. Should that player continue to wear the shirt until the matter is resolved?\nThen, in April, The Athletic broke news of Arsenal\u2019s discussions with Partey over a new contract. On June 4, Arsenal confirmed on their website that \u201cdiscussions are ongoing\u201d.\nNews of a potential extension provoked anger and disappointment from some supporters. The fan group Arsenal Supporters Against Sexual Violence wrote an open letter to the club in November 2024, \u201cregarding the widespread issue of tolerating footballers facing sexual offence allegations within the game we love.\u201d It attracted 9,000 signatories. The group also protested outside the Emirates Stadium ahead of games.\nThroughout this process, a number of Arsenal staff have been torn or disappointed about the club\u2019s response. When Arsenal stated they were in contract talks with Partey, employees reached out to The Athletic to express disbelief and disappointment, adding that they felt they were not alone in their concerns.\nAdvertisement\nFor one of the alleged victims, the decision to try to extend Partey\u2019s deal came as no surprise. For her, it was a reflection of Arsenal\u2019s attitude over the previous three years.\nBut, ultimately, Arsenal could not come to an agreement with Partey. He left the club on the expiration of his contract on June 30.\nWithin four days of his departure, he was charged with serious sexual offences. But at the time the charges became public, he was still listed on the club\u2019s official website as an Arsenal player.\nArsenal have faced considerable scrutiny for continuing to play Partey during this period. As part of the writing of this story, The Athletic sent the club a number of questions. These included:\n- When were Arsenal made aware of the allegations?\n- What did Arsenal\u2019s internal process entail?\n- Were the women\u2019s team consulted at all?\n- Was any decision made regarding reducing Partey\u2019s media obligations?\n- Who made the decisions to continue playing Partey and enter into negotiations over a contract extension?\nArsenal declined to answer, citing the ongoing legal proceedings.\nAlex Clarke, a senior employment lawyer at Onside Law, explains that opting to take action against a player accused of serious sexual offences would not be straightforward under current UK legislation.\n\u201cEven in cases involving the most serious allegations and understandable calls for players to be suspended, the way the standard Premier League playing contract is worded makes this difficult for clubs,\u201d says Clarke.\n\u201cThe standard Premier League contract has been collectively agreed with the PFA (Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, the players\u2019 union) over time and, as a result, contains some fairly player-friendly clauses. In terms of suspension, clubs can only suspend a player for a maximum of two weeks on full pay. There is no automatic right to withhold pay for any period of suspension or to extend the suspension beyond two weeks.\u201d\nExtending the suspension beyond the initial fortnight would need to be mutually agreed with the player \u2014 rather unlikely if said player maintains his innocence.\nThis situation differs from a standard employment contract. \u201cThe world of football generally doesn\u2019t mesh well with employment law, and this is a very stark example,\u201d adds Clarke.\nAs things stand, Premier League clubs do not have the power to suspend players without pay in cases of alleged severe misconduct, and changing that would require a renegotiation with the PFA.\nArsenal would also have given consideration to the fundamental legal principle that Partey is innocent until proven guilty.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cArsenal also owed a duty of care to Partey as his employer and may have felt that any action they took against him would have undermined that duty, particularly as any suspension could be seen as Arsenal publicly implying that they consider him to be guilty,\u201d explains Clarke. The club also needed to balance this against the duty of care it owed to its other employees, who may have felt uncomfortable around someone suspected of such serious offences, as well as safeguarding concerns that come with such serious allegations.\nAlthough Arsenal may not have had the contractual right to suspend Partey without pay, the club confirmed to police that they had looked into the allegations, according to documents seen by The Athletic.\nThere is also a lack of clear guidance for clubs in these circumstances. Lisa Nandy, the UK\u2019s Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, expressed concern this week on the Sports Agents podcast that clubs do not have a \u201cstandard approach\u201d when \u201cvery, very highly paid\u201d players face claims of sexual assault.\nAfter former Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy was charged with rape and sexual assault in August 2021, he was suspended without pay from September 2021 until June 2023. Mendy was later cleared of all charges. In 2024, a judge determined that Mendy was entitled to the majority of his unpaid salary from City \u2014 everything except the amount owed during the five months he spent in custody \u2014 which came to around \u00a38.5m.\nHad Arsenal taken action against Partey \u2014 and if he were later cleared \u2014 they could be financially liable. There would also be the reputational cost of punishing a player for a crime of which they were ultimately not guilty.\nInstead, Arsenal opted to continue to play and promote a player facing such serious allegations.\nThere is another important question worth asking, however: did they have to play him? Football is a squad game \u2014 many players are regularly left out and their omission does not result in legal action. The likes of Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have previously spent protracted spells excluded from the team, seemingly without any significant consequence.\nAdvertisement\nWas Partey\u2019s ability as a footballer \u2014 and his value as an asset \u2014 given greater consideration than the moral and ethical implications of continuing to play him?\n\u201cThere is no obligation on a club to pick a player for any match,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cFor highly skilled employees like footballers, clubs are likely to be subject to an implied employment law duty to provide them with work to allow them to maintain their skills. However, as long as Arsenal allowed Partey to train and continued to pay him a wage, they would probably be satisfying that obligation.\n\u201cThere are some FIFA regulations which may have given Partey a technical right to terminate his contract for what\u2019s called \u2018sporting just cause\u2019 if Arsenal refused to play him at all during a full season, but this sort of claim would probably not have been in Partey\u2019s interests given the nature of the allegations against him and the risk of making these more public.\n\u201cThey may (also) have had in mind the perception this could have created that they believe Partey to be guilty in circumstances where he has maintained his innocence.\u201d\nIn this instance, Arsenal may feel they have observed the letter of the law. Their compliance remains intact.\nBut Arsenal have other key tenets: culture, community, diversity and forward-thinking. This is a club that celebrates its women\u2019s team, the current Champions League holders. It welcomes a diverse fanbase into its stands. Have those facets of the club\u2019s identity been served in this case? On the club\u2019s career page, it states that they \u201cdo the right thing (even when no one is looking)\u201d.\nWhen it comes to the handling of the Thomas Partey allegations, everyone is now looking.\nLegally, Arsenal may feel they have done the right thing. Morally and ethically, there are still questions to be answered.\n(Top photos: James Gill \u2013 Danehouse/Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

      "text": "Welcome to the 10th edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included.\nAdvertisement\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market.\nLast week, we looked at Liverpool\u2019s financial position, a possible new contract for a Chelsea target, and Manchester United\u2019s striker options. This week, we look at the striker high among the options left on the market, a possible deal for an Arsenal midfielder, and the latest on Benjamin Sesko.\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\nDavid Ornstein\u2019s One To Watch\nAs the striker jigsaw continues to form, the football world is watching closely to discover how the various pieces will eventually fall into place.\nThe likes of Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres have made their moves, but the futures of players such as Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko are yet to be resolved.\nOn Monday night, The Athletic revealed that Newcastle United have increased their offer for Sesko as they battle Manchester United to secure the 22-year-old.\nWhoever misses out will need to find an alternative recruit \u2014 unless they stick with existing personnel \u2014 and there is not a huge array of candidates on the market.\nWhether it is for those two clubs or others also looking to strengthen up front, that will naturally increase the consideration given to the market\u2019s remaining options.\nHigh among them is Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, owing to his suitability and availability.\nThe Stamford Bridge side are not desperate to trade the 24-year-old, especially given they require depth ahead of contesting Champions League football next season.\nBut the arrival of Delap and Joao Pedro provides competition and puts Jackson at risk of not being the primary forward, and after scoring 30 goals across 81 games in west London, he will want to be the main man somewhere.\nAdvertisement\nThat explains why Chelsea are open to sanctioning the Senegal international\u2019s departure if an acceptable proposal arrives.\nInterest stems from suitors in both the Premier League and Europe. Some of them want Jackson only if their key target cannot be obtained, or someone leaves; others in addition to what they already have.\nEither way, there is a growing expectation that he will exit, and developments on that case are anticipated in the coming days.\nIt would continue a remarkable sequence of sales completed or agreed by Chelsea, which means they will have accumulated more than \u00a3200million ($265m) in the current transfer window. They are forecasting another \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m before the deadline.\nWhy top clubs would benefit from signing Jackson\nIn an increasingly transitional league, Nicolas Jackson\u2019s devastating ability on the break is a highly sought-after resource. Last season saw a seven-year high of 112 Premier League goals scored from counter-attacks, and few players were as central to those moves as Jackson.\nHis ability to collect the ball in deep areas and surge up the pitch sets him apart. According to advanced data provider Footovision, he led the division for counter-attacking involvements via ball carries.\nJackson is electric in transition, but his finishing and final-third choices remain raw. Yet few strikers possess the relentless desire and movement to reach those advanced areas in the first place: Jackson made 60 sprints in behind the defence \u2014 defined by SkillCorner as off-ball runs of at least 25km/h \u2014 nine more than any other Premier League player.\nJackson specialises in specific traits that make him an appealing profile for a host of Premier League clubs. And for all the noise around his performances, it\u2019s easy to forget that Jackson has hit double figures for league goals in both of his two seasons at Stamford Bridge.\nConor O\u2019Neill\nWhat else we\u2019re hearing\n- RB Leipzig have received an improved offer from Newcastle United to sign Benjamin Sesko. An opening bid worth \u20ac75million (\u00a365m; $87m) plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m. Sesko is also wanted by Manchester United, but a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are lower than those of Newcastle at present. That leaves the St James\u2019 Park side in a strong position as things stand, after a day of positive talks held by their co-owner Jamie Reuben with Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker. Nothing is agreed yet and there is currently no guarantee of the outcome, which could still be Sesko staying if Leipzig do not accept a deal. David Ornstein\n- Burnley are set to strengthen in midfield ahead of their return to the Premier League after reaching an agreement with Chelsea to sign Lesley Ugochukwu. The France youth international, 21, has been granted permission to travel for medical tests and complete a permanent move to Turf Moor. If all goes to plan, Ugochukwu will put pen to paper on a five-year contract \u2014 significantly boosting head coach Scott Parker\u2019s options in the No 6 and No 8 roles. David Ornstein\n- Manchester City have reached an agreement in principle with Ruben Dias to sign a new contract. The 28-year-old\u2019s existing deal expires in 2027. Dias has been a major part of City\u2019s success since he joined from Benfica for an initial \u00a362m in 2020. David Ornstein\n- Stuttgart are working on a deal to sign attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira from Arsenal. The German club have approached their Premier League counterparts about Vieira. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing, with Arsenal likely to seek a respectable price for a player they recruited for up to \u20ac40m in the summer of 2022. David Ornstein\n- Borussia Dortmund remain interested in securing the permanent transfer of Chelsea\u2019s Carney Chukwuemeka, who spent last season on loan at the Westfalenstadion. Chelsea have no interest in loaning Chukwuemeka out again and would only consider a permanent deal for the 21-year-old. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor and Simon Johnson\n- Botafogo have reached an agreement with Bournemouth to sign Neto. The 36-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper was scheduled to fly to Rio de Janeiro on Monday night and undergo a medical before completing the proposed move. It will not involve a transfer fee, but as one of Bournemouth\u2019s highest earners, the Premier League club will make significant salary savings. Neto\u2019s contract was due to end next June, and he is set to join Botafogo on a deal until the summer of 2027, with an option to extend by six months. Bournemouth have already signed Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea as their new No 1, while Neto spent last season on loan with Arsenal. David Ornstein\n- Everton are in talks with Chelsea over the permanent transfer of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m. As reported by The Athletic last week, Chelsea will only consider a permanent sale and placed a valuation of \u00a330m \u2014 the fee they paid Leicester City last year \u2014 on the midfielder, while other Premier League clubs have also made enquiries. Patrick Boyland and Simon Johnson\nWho has spent the most in the Premier League so far this window?\nA look at Premier League spending by club so far this summer throws up few surprises at the top end. Using figures sourced from Transfermarkt, Liverpool\u2019s big summer puts them top of the tree with over \u00a3250m spent on new players; add in \u00a325m on Giorgi Mamardashvili (deal agreed last summer, but only joined Liverpool officially this season) and expectations of agent fees and the four per cent transfer levy payable by clubs on incoming transfers and you land beyond \u00a3300m.\nAdvertisement\nBehind Liverpool sit Chelsea, again offering little surprise. Indeed, of the seven clubs to have spent over \u00a3100m to date, all but one form part of England\u2019s \u2018Big Six\u2019. The exception, Sunderland, have spent heavily as a result of past prudence and out of necessity as a newly promoted club. They are expected to spend even more before the season commences.\nOf greater note are those clubs that haven\u2019t spent much yet. Between Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Fulham, less than \u00a310m has been laid out on new players, which looks pretty stark when set against the backdrop of the rest of the division\u2019s spending.\nPremier League clubs have spent over \u00a31.8billion on players so far this summer, though plenty of that has been among themselves, with the division\u2019s net spend standing at around \u00a3865m.\nEven so, Premier League spending continues to dominate the world transfer market. That net spend figure is far and away the most in football this summer, with only the Saudi Pro League also reaching nine figures (\u00a3185m). The Saudi league\u2019s gross spend is just \u00a3280m so far, though there are expectations that will soon rise.\nChris Weatherspoon\nArsenal\nWhat happened this week?\nAfter a flurry of activity, it has been a quieter week at Arsenal.\nArsenal\u2019s recruitment drive continues at academy level, although the club missed out on 17-year-old Salford City striker Will Wright. Despite agreeing on a fee of \u00a3200,000 plus add-ons with Salford, Arsenal never reached an agreement on personal terms with the player. Wright preferred to remain in the north west, and that allowed Liverpool to steal in and secure a deal.\nThe club are still looking for a striker to complement Andre Harriman-Annous, who toured with the first team in Asia, at under-21 level. Arsenal have had a second bid rejected for 17-year-old Blackburn Rovers striker Igor Tyjon.\nThey have managed to secure the signing of 16-year-old goalkeeper Remi Lupinski from MK Dons. Lupinski, who will be part of Arsenal\u2019s under-17s next season, has signed a two-year scholarship deal.\nWhich youngsters impressing in pre-season could fill gaps in the squad?\nLast summer, the performances of Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri in pre-season forced them into first-team contention. Arsenal adapted their transfer plans accordingly, loaning out Vieira to provide Nwaneri with opportunities to develop.\nThis year, it\u2019s 15-year-old Max Dowman who has captured the imagination with a series of impressive cameos. It is unclear how regularly he will be involved with the first team once the competitive season starts.\nAdvertisement\nThus far, left-footed Dowman has featured on the right wing. That\u2019s a position where Arsenal have more experienced alternatives. Bukayo Saka is one of the first names on the team sheet and Arsenal have also welcomed Noni Madueke to Colney in recent days. Madueke cut short his holiday to start training with Arsenal ahead of schedule.\nThe 2025-26 season is the first campaign in which Dowman will be eligible for either the Arsenal first-team or their under-21s. It is expected he will feature for both teams across the course of the campaign.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nIf Arsenal are to make a significant addition to the first-team squad, it is most likely to be on the left wing. Any acquisition may be connected to the futures of Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\nArsenal hold a long-term interest in 19-year-old Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The France Under-21 international was discussed as a potential signing before Arsenal moved ahead with a deal for Cristhian Mosquera.\nDepartures of defenders such as Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior could lead Arsenal to revisit their interest, but Jacquet signed a new deal with Rennes as recently as May, tying him to the Ligue 1 club until 2029.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nKiwior has been the subject of interest from Porto.\nThe Polish international defender enjoys life at Arsenal, but at 25, he is interested in exploring opportunities to join clubs where he would be regarded as a first-choice player.\nArsenal are not in a hurry to move Kiwior on, but as with most players, there is a number at which a deal would make sense for all parties.\nA number of other players on the fringes of the first-team squad could be allowed to leave before the transfer deadline. There is interest from Fulham in Reiss Nelson.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal also hope to find buyers for Zinchenko, Albert Sambi Lokonga, and Karl Hein. Vieira is being targeted by Stuttgart. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing.\nA number of academy players may also be permitted to leave permanently if a suitable opportunity arises.\nJames McNicholas\nChelsea\nWhat happened this week?\nIt has been a busy one. As far as incomings go, Chelsea completed the purchase of Netherlands international defender Jorrel Hato for a fee in excess of \u20ac40m. They also won the race to sign highly rated England Under-19 midfielder Jesse Derry, who chose to run his contract down at Crystal Palace.\nMore work has been done on the departures front. Joao Felix joined Al Nassr as expected for an initial \u20ac30m, with add-ons potentially taking it to \u20ac50m.\nBurnley have beaten off competition from teams across Europe to buy midfielder Ugochukwu. They also agreed a fee with Chelsea for striker Armando Broja. As reported in the transfer DealSheet last week, Chelsea\u2019s asking price was \u00a325m. The final sum is unlikely to be made public.\nEverton are in talks over the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m, and discussions are ongoing. There is also interest from other Premier League clubs. The transfer DealSheet revealed last week that several Premier League teams had made an enquiry and that Chelsea\u2019s asking price is around \u00a330m.\nSunderland are close to finalising a season-long loan for striker Marc Guiu. The negotiation has included inserting a clause akin to Broja\u2019s loan to Fulham last year, where a penalty fee will have to be paid if the forward does not play a certain number of games. Sunderland sources are comfortable with the situation and do not see such a clause being problematic.\nAdvertisement\nThere has been a lot of activity with sister club Strasbourg, too. Midfielder Kendry Paez and goalkeeper Mike Penders joined them on a season-long loan, while under-21 defender Ishe Samuels-Smith moved permanently for an undisclosed fee.\nMeanwhile, under-21 midfielder Leo Castledine left on loan for Huddersfield Town and another talented member of the development squad, Alex Matos, is nearing a permanent departure.\nDo Chelsea have what they need to compete on four fronts?\nChelsea believe they have improved the squad from the one that finished fourth in the Premier League and won the Conference League.\nThe two wingers that have left \u2014 Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke \u2014 have already been replaced by Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian. The attack has been strengthened, too, with the arrivals of Liam Delap (Ipswich Town) and Joao Pedro (Brighton & Hove Albion), plus extra midfield cover has been provided with the additions of Dario Essugo (Sporting CP) and Andrey Santos, who has returned from Strasbourg on loan.\nHato\u2019s purchase has also filled in a major gap in the group, as Marc Cucurella finally has cover from someone who actually naturally plays in the position rather than switching right-backs Malo Gusto or Reece James across.\nMore departures are expected, particularly higher up the pitch, and that will leave space for more arrivals to come.\nThe only area they will not add to, which will come under scrutiny from the fan base, is in goal. They have no intention to buy another goalkeeper now, despite pursuing Mike Maignan earlier in the window. Chelsea are happy with Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen as their two main choices. Indeed, they turned down an offer from a Champions League club for the latter.\nIn terms of the overall picture, head coach Enzo Maresca will have the opportunity to rotate due to the amount of options at his disposal.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe primary areas are another winger and a creative player, which is why the names Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons will not go away. Both players depend on exits. Chelsea are in informal discussions with Manchester United over Garnacho, but that is as far as it has gone.\nThe same can be said for Simons. No formal bid has been made to RB Leipzig yet. Chelsea do have other players on their wishlist for these roles, including Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAs my colleague David Ornstein reports, Chelsea are not desperate to sell Nicolas Jackson but would be open to sanctioning his departure if the right proposal arrives.\nThe transfer DealSheet revealed last month that Chelsea are open to loaning out winger Tyrique George, but the situation has developed since then.\nChelsea are talking with George\u2019s representatives to figure out the best option going forward. A straight loan is still a possibility, but Chelsea will not consider any proposals including an option to buy. Like Guiu, the club want some kind of conditions in place regarding playing time if there is a loan.\nA permanent sale is being discussed, too, but Chelsea would like to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on fee. A number of teams in England and Europe have registered their interest in both scenarios.\nChristopher Nkunku, who is valued at \u20ac50m, has been given permission to miss the start of pre-season training. He is the subject of enquiries from a number of clubs in England, Italy and Germany. Two teams that looked like possible candidates to sign him earlier in the window \u2014 Manchester United and RB Leipzig \u2014 are now deemed unlikely.\nJackson is the subject of approaches from multiple clubs in England and Europe, too. Chelsea do not see him as untouchable, but will demand a high fee similar to what other starting centre-forwards have cost when transferred to other clubs this summer.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea are still working on the sales of Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga, Carney Chukwuemeka, who is of interest to Borussia Dortmund, and Axel Disasi. They want to get their situations resolved before entering the final week.\nAlfie Gilchrist is still hopeful of joining a Championship side, but he may have to wait until the end of the month. Defender Aaron Anselmino is highly rated at Chelsea after integrating into the camp during the second half of last season and will be sent on loan. Teams in Europe have made an enquiry.\nSimon Johnson\nLiverpool\nWhat happened this week?\nLiverpool\u2019s pursuit of Alexander Isak continued, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.\nA \u00a3110m bid for the Sweden striker was rejected by Newcastle United, who value their prized asset close to \u00a3150m and will not consider selling unless an offer is too good to turn down and they source a suitable replacement.\nMeanwhile, after Luis Diaz completed his move to Bayern Munich, another Liverpool forward edged closer towards an exit as Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal identified Darwin Nunez as their priority target. Milan have also shown an interest in the Uruguayan, although it\u2019s unlikely they will be able to afford him as the cost of the total package is deemed too expensive.\nOn the pitch, Arne Slot\u2019s side wrapped up their pre-season friendly schedule with a double-header against Athletic Club on Monday night at Anfield.\nIs it Isak or bust up front?\nSlot has consistently reiterated that he is only looking for players who can immediately improve the squad, and clearly Isak fits the bill.\nLanding the 25-year-old striker would supercharge an attack that won the title last season and also boost the options ahead of further expected outgoings.\nYet there\u2019s no intention to stockpile players for the sake of it should a move for Isak not progress. Liverpool have new signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz alongside Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah already in the attacking department, while Jeremie Frimpong is an attack-minded right-sided player. There\u2019s no intention to block Rio Ngumoha\u2019s pathway, either, so it would take a standout market opportunity for Liverpool to consider a different attacking option.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nCentre-back is an area that remains a little light following Jarell Quansah\u2019s exit to Bayer Leverkusen.\nIdeally, Slot would like another defender so he has strong competition for places, and a number of young players have been considered.\nThe alternative is turning to either Ryan Gravenberch or Wataru Endo to fill in if Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, or Joe Gomez are not available.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nTyler Morton is on the verge of moving to Lyon for a fee of \u00a315m, inclusive of add-ons.\nFederico Chiesa is still weighing up his options ahead of a likely exit this month, while Kostas Tsimikas debates his future with two years remaining on his contract.\nA number of clubs have shown interest in Ben Doak, but Liverpool are waiting for any offers to sign the winger on a permanent deal before deciding what happens next. James McConnell and Luca Stephenson are expected to go out on loan, but there is growing interest in both players from clubs who are considering a permanent move.\nGregg Evans\nManchester City\nWhat happened this week?\nGoalkeeper James Trafford officially rejoined from Burnley, two years after leaving. City sold him for \u00a314m and bought him back for \u00a327m, which means the value of the deal in book value is \u00a313m.\nLeaving the club on loan was 19-year-old winger Joel Ndala, who joined Hull City. He spent a year at PSV Jong (their second-tier side) and the last four months of last season at Nottingham Forest, which he mainly spent with their Premier League 2 side. They did not take up the option to sign him permanently.\nAre we getting to the stage where City might cut any of their unwanted players loose?\nNumbers certainly have to come down now, with less than a month remaining of the window. They have yet to make headway on that, though, with Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and James McAtee all still City players.\nOther possible departures are being narrowed down as players commit to staying. John Stones is not leaving in the final year of his deal, while the plan is for Abdukodir Khusanov to stay.\nAdvertisement\nThe Uzbek defender\u2019s first six months have been seen as a period to adjust to a new culture, league and language. The fact he can operate at right-back as well as centre-back is also useful.\nThere could be several players heading out on loan, though.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nTrafford represented the final bit of proactive business in terms of incomings.\nThe priority is now sorting the futures of the players who are surplus to requirements, unless an opportunity arises in a position that improves the team and adds value.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nClaudio Echeverri\u2019s future is still to be decided as he is highly thought of internally, but a spot in Argentina\u2019s World Cup squad next summer is on his mind.\nHe has yet to be capped by the senior team, but sources close to the player believe that a loan move is needed to ensure he plays enough. A move to fellow City Football Group club Girona is not on the cards, with the preference being a loan to a Premier League side, if he does leave.\nBrazilian defender Vitor Reis is also in discussions about leaving on loan for the season, potentially to Girona, with his international ambitions also playing a part.\nElsewhere, many European clubs have registered interest in acquiring Sverre Nypan on loan. Bundesliga clubs are in the race, but conversations are ongoing to identify the best destination for his development.\nAt the top end of the academy, Watford and Swansea City are battling for the signature of defender Max Alleyne, who is in talks to extend his contract before heading out on his first loan. Several European clubs have also shown interest.\nJordan Campbell\nManchester United\nWhat happened this week?\nUnited\u2019s summer-long striker search narrowed to a single, priority target: RB Leipzig\u2019s Benjamin Sesko.\nInformal club-to-club talks have taken place with Leipzig, as have discussions with Sesko\u2019s representatives over prospective personal terms. Competition from Newcastle United is fierce \u2014 they made an improved offer for the striker on Monday night. An opening bid worth \u20ac75m plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m.\nAdvertisement\nChristopher Vivell, United\u2019s director of recruitment, served in the same role at Red Bull Salzburg when Sesko joined from Slovenian club Domzale in 2019 and has been a driving force behind United\u2019s pursuit. But a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and as The Athletic\u2019s David Ornstein reports, the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are presently lower than those of Newcastle.\nOmar Berrada, United\u2019s chief executive, told MUTV before Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States that a recruitment team, including Vivell, is \u201cworking around the clock\u201d back in Manchester to further strengthen the squad.\n\u201cWe have to do a lot of multitasking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure we stay on top of it.\u201d\nElsewhere, academy players Ethan Wheatley and Jack Moorhouse both secured loans to League One clubs, joining Northampton Town and Leyton Orient respectively until the end of the season.\nUnited have narrowed their search to a single priority striker: Sesko (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\nWhy did Man Utd decide on Sesko as their first choice?\nUnited had previously whittled their striker shortlist down to Sesko and Aston Villa\u2019s Ollie Watkins, who would offer valuable Premier League experience, such as new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.\nSesko is a rawer and riskier alternative to Watkins, but also far from an unknown quantity in the corridors of Carrington and Old Trafford. United previously explored a move for him when he was just 16 years old, before he had left his native Slovenia.\nUnited revived their interest during Erik ten Hag\u2019s first summer in charge, but Sesko committed to swapping Red Bull Salzburg for their stablemates in Leipzig. He was a target early last summer, too, before attention turned to Joshua Zirkzee.\nAdvertisement\nSesko\u2019s record in the Bundesliga of 27 goals in 64 appearances over the past two seasons is solid without being spectacular and raises questions over whether he is capable of making an immediate impact.\nBut at 22, he is significantly younger than the 29-year-old Watkins, and his rare blend of speed and stature with a powerful strike has made him one of the most highly rated young centre-forwards in Europe.\nSpending north of \u20ac80m on Sesko\u2019s potential would represent a gamble, but should he realise that potential, United would have a striker capable of leading the line for years to come.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nOther than up front, United have been assessing their options in midfield. Amorim is keen to add more dynamism in the middle of the park.\nA goalkeeper signing has also been considered, although with Andre Onana expected to stay, any further addition will likely depend on whether understudy Altay Bayindir departs in search of regular minutes.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nThe Sesko pursuit brings Rasmus Hojlund\u2019s future into question, despite him making no secret of his desire to stay and fight for his place.\nWhile there is interest in the 22-year-old, United will almost certainly need to swallow a loss on his book value of around \u00a340m to let him go. Offers of \u00a330m will be considered.\nGarnacho is the subject of interest from Chelsea, and Real Betis hope to sign Antony on a permanent basis after his successful loan spell in La Liga last season, but neither move is advanced.\nUnited are also eager to offload Sancho, are open to offers for Tyrell Malacia, and could allow Toby Collyer to leave on loan.\nMark Critchley\nNewcastle United\nWhat happened this week?\nBlimey, where to begin?\nThey finally received \u2014 and rebuffed \u2014 an offer for Isak, with Liverpool\u2019s formal bid of \u00a3110m some \u00a310m less than their unofficial expression of interest last month and a great deal less than Newcastle\u2019s \u00a3150m valuation. Isak, who has not been on the club\u2019s pre-season tour to East Asia, instead trained alone at Real Sociedad, his former club, before returning to Newcastle\u2019s training ground on Monday.\nAfter suffering a series of high-profile rejections this summer, Newcastle identified Sesko as their leading target to replace Isak or, \u201cin an ideal world\u201d, play alongside him.\nThey followed that up with a bid worth \u20ac80m to RB Leipzig, but that fell short of the German club\u2019s demands. Newcastle are working flat-out on Sesko, with Jamie Reuben, one of the club\u2019s co-owners, taking a personal interest and being heavily involved, but they are aware they are competing for Sesko with Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, Newcastle made an improved offer. This leaves them in a strong position as things stand, following a day of positive talks held by Reuben with Leipzig and the striker.\nTheir pursuit of Brentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa is ongoing.\nThey completed their second senior signing of the window with goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale joining from Southampton on a season-long loan with an option to buy at the end of the season.\nThe 18-year-old winger, Antonio Cordero, newly arrived from Malaga, left for Westerlo in Belgium on a season-long loan, while midfielder Isaac Hayden was released from his contract.\nIs the slow-moving nature of Newcastle\u2019s business becoming a problem?\nThe slow-moving nature of everything Newcastle do (or don\u2019t do) is a concern. Almost 11 months after Darren Eales announced he would be stepping down as chief executive after a diagnosis of blood cancer, the club have still not confirmed his replacement, with Eales now on medical leave. Nor do they have a sporting director after Paul Mitchell saw out his notice and left at the end of June.\nBoth of these things, to put it mildly, are sub-optimal. It means, for the second summer in succession, there is a huge flux at the top of the club.\nIn terms of the bigger picture, there has been no tangible movement on a new stadium or training ground; while these are huge, complex projects, it has become difficult for Howe to point to progress in other areas of the club.\nRewind to the end of last season, when Newcastle sealed qualification for the Champions League and Howe said: \u201cWe have to be ready to conclude things very quickly because good players don\u2019t hang around for long.\u201d\nThat, clearly, did not happen. Was this a failure of preparation, which should have taken place on Mitchell\u2019s watch? Was it because Howe wanted, where possible, oven-ready Premier League players? Was it a combination of both, plus less-than-perfect circumstances?\nAdvertisement\nWhatever the case, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, James Trafford, and Hugo Ekitike have all ended up moving to traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 clubs.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nFor obvious reasons, centre-forward towers above everything else. With Callum Wilson leaving Newcastle at the end of last season and subsequently joining West Ham United, some form of backup for Isak was already required.\nThere has been a glimpse of what life without Isak would look like during pre-season fixtures. William Osula, the only established centre-forward available to Howe, started three matches in succession; the Denmark Under-21 International is yet to start once in the Premier League. Against Tottenham Hotspur, Anthony Gordon began up front. Neither is a long-term solution.\nRight-sided centre-half is another longstanding requirement. Mitchell spent weeks attempting to sign Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Guehi a year ago, and he remains of interest, but is Newcastle still of interest to the England defender? Atalanta\u2019s Giorgio Scalvini and Marseille\u2019s Leonardo Balerdi have featured during transfer discussions, but other European-based players are under active consideration.\nHaving sold Sean Longstaff to Leeds United, Howe\u2019s options in midfield are thinner, particularly with Joe Willock now out for between four and six weeks with a calf injury. Ideally, there would be reinforcements here, too, although little has been ideal about this summer.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAll roads lead back to Isak.\nNewcastle have been careful to leave escape routes open for their most important player. There has been no criticism of him in public, although there were some pointed general remarks from Howe on Sunday when he told reporters: \u201cNo player can expect to act poorly and train with the group as normal.\u201d They still believe he can be reintegrated, but this will, in part, be determined by the player\u2019s attitude, as well as Liverpool, whose interest remains.\nAdvertisement\nAs Isak\u2019s situation shows, Newcastle cannot take anything for granted, but they are determined to hold on to their other prize assets, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes, Gordon and Tino Livramento.\nBeyond that, Burnley are talking to the club about signing Martin Dubravka, the goalkeeper, while Odysseas Vlachodimos, another goalkeeper, is also available, most likely for a loan.\nNewcastle would not stand in the way of full-backs Matt Targett or Harrison Ashby leaving.\nWhich Premier League clubs could do with selling players this window?\nThere are four weeks remaining in this summer\u2019s transfer window and, though eyes will inevitably be drawn to incomings, it\u2019s a natural byproduct of modern football \u2014 profit and sustainability rules (PSR), cash flow, and squad sizes \u2014 that some clubs will be in greater need of selling than others.\nChelsea provide perhaps the most obvious example, their settlement agreement with UEFA last month dictating that to register new players to their Champions League squad list, they need to ensure a \u2018positive transfer balance\u2019. In other words, outgoings need to outweigh the cost of those newly registered players.\nIn truth, Chelsea\u2019s business model has long relied on player trading and they\u2019ve been effective sellers for years. Their need to sell is not a sign of desperation, more a fact of Stamford Bridge life.\nAs reported by David Ornstein, Jackson\u2019s exit could represent another big sale for Chelsea.\nManchester United might not be desperate, but their desire to sell players this summer is heightened, not least because they\u2019ve been such poor sellers in the past. Already this window, they have benefited from significant sell-on fees via moves involving Alvaro Carreras, Anthony Elanga and Maxi Oyedele.\nUnited haven\u2019t sold anyone themselves yet, though the savings on Marcus Rashford\u2019s wages for a year are sizeable. United\u2019s financial concerns are more cash-focused than based on any ongoing PSR worries, as they owed significant transfer instalments even before the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. Outgoings, with Garnacho and Antony the prime candidates, might not be financial necessities, but United need to get better at selling, and there\u2019s no time better than the present.\nAdvertisement\nElsewhere, several clubs have already been active sellers of talent. Bournemouth, Brighton and Nottingham Forest have each banked over \u00a3100m in sales this summer. Wolves and Brentford aren\u2019t far behind. West Ham\u2019s sale of Mohammed Kudus pretty much offsets their spending on new faces.\nArsenal are the Premier League\u2019s highest spenders on a net basis currently, committing around \u00a3200m in fees while only recouping small sums on Nuno Tavares and Marquinhos. They had a lean year in terms of transfer spending last season, giving them scope to splurge this time around, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if they sought some sales this month.\nLikewise Liverpool. The Athletic has detailed how they can afford their big spending, but the desire to land Isak looks a stretch without a departure, if only because of Fenway Sports Group\u2019s continued desire to run the club sustainably. Nunez leaving would have the benefit of freeing up a striker spot and, most likely, generating a decent fee.\nChris Weatherspoon\nTottenham Hotspur\nWhat happened this week?\nThe biggest story was Son Heung-min playing his last game for Tottenham Hotspur after 10 glorious years. Negotiations are currently ongoing for a move to LAFC, and Son played 66 minutes of the friendly against Newcastle before he was taken off to huge applause.\nIt remains to be seen when Son\u2019s move to LA will be confirmed, and whether Spurs will be straight into the market for a replacement. But the other major development from Sunday was James Maddison being taken off on a stretcher with a worrying-looking knee injury. If it was as serious as it looked, then Spurs may have an issue with creativity in the middle of the pitch.\nThey did make another midfield addition on Sunday, though, with Portugal international Joao Palhinha joining from Bayern Munich on loan. Meanwhile, Mikey Moore joined Rangers on a season\u2019s loan.\nDoes Palhinha solve an issue in the middle?\nMost definitely. Tottenham have lacked a solid defensive midfielder for years. Last season they had to make do with Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in that position, with a few occasional contributions from Archie Gray. And they never looked secure.\nThe decision to allow Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to go to Marseille last summer, while understandable, left Tottenham short in that role. Too many times last year, opponents just counter-attacked through the middle of the pitch, or easily got a shot off from the edge of the box.\nIt is no surprise that Thomas Frank wanted to change that. The former Brentford head coach wanted to bring Christian Norgaard in from his former club, but he chose Arsenal. Frank will hope Palhinha will do the job. He had two good years at Fulham where he comfortably led the Premier League in tackles, proving that he was one of the best players around at stealing the ball and breaking up opposition attacks. And even though he struggled to make much of an impact at Bayern, he should be perfectly equipped to deliver some much-needed defensive stability at the base of Spurs\u2019 midfield.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe big question for Spurs is whether Maddison\u2019s knee injury forces them back into the market to add some creative quality before the end of the window. They pushed hard to sign Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest earlier in the window for \u00a360m. But with Gibbs-White staying at Forest, and Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski both down with knee injuries, Spurs have a serious lack of midfield to start the season.\nFans will be expecting the club to be bold in the market and try to sign some established quality, and would love Tottenham to re-enter the race to sign Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.\nBeyond that, there are some areas that could do with strengthening, such as another left-sided defender, or possibly another centre forward.\nSpurs have five senior centre-backs. Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero are first-choice. Kevin Danso appears to have become the best backup option while Radu Dragusin recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury he suffered in January. Kota Takai joined Spurs from J League side Kawasaki Frontale earlier this summer but has not featured in any pre-season games because he is suffering from a foot injury. Luka Vuskovic looks promising, but is more likely to head out on loan for regular game time to help his development.\nThey are interested in signing another centre-back before the window closes. Van de Ven and Romero both missed large chunks of last season through injury. Dragusin will not be available any time soon, and Takai will need time to acclimatise to a new country and environment. Spurs need more depth and quality to enable them to compete in the Premier League and the Champions League, and to avoid the injury crisis they suffered under Postecoglou last season.\nBut midfield remains the big story for the rest of August.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSon\u2019s move to MLS is likely to be tied up soon, with Spurs hoping to get a fee of close to \u00a320m, which would mean they had almost made back the whole \u00a322m they paid Bayer Leverkusen for him 10 years ago.\nAdvertisement\nEven after Son\u2019s departure, there will be questions about a few other senior players, just in case offers come in that are worth Tottenham thinking about, such as Richarlison or Bissouma. But Cristian Romero, about whom there was so much speculation earlier in the window, looks set to stay.\nAtletico Madrid have given up on signing him and have already signed Slovakian international centre-back David Hancko from Feyenoord.\nBen Davies admitted there is uncertainty over his long-term future in an interview with The Athletic. However, Frank has been impressed by the Wales international, who has featured regularly in pre-season at left-back. He values the 32-year-old\u2019s experience and mentality. Frank believes he is a positive influence within the dressing room and is considering him for a role in the leadership group.\nBentancur has entered the final year of his contract, and Frank has been full of praise for him, too. He thinks the Uruguay international can be a key player long-term. If so, Spurs need to start discussions over a new deal if they haven\u2019t already.\nElsewhere, there is the possibility of younger players leaving Spurs, with Alfie Devine and Dane Scarlett still waiting for loan deals.\nJack Pitt-Brooke and Jay Harris\nBarcelona\nWhat happened this week?\nBarcelona came to the end of their pre-season tour on Monday with a convincing 5-0 win against Daegu FC, with Marcus Rashford scoring his first goal in a Barcelona shirt.\nLast week, they beat Seoul FC 7-3 with Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scoring two goals each. The Catalans ended their trip to Japan and South Korea with 15 goals scored across three games.\nNow they return to Barcelona to finalise their work before the start of La Liga. They will face Como at home next Sunday in the traditional Joan Gamper pre-season trophy.\nMeanwhile, Marc-Andre ter Stegen underwent surgery on his back injury successfully last week. Now it will be up to La Liga to determine if the goalkeeper\u2019s injury can be considered long-term, and therefore free up salary space to register a new Barca player.\nWho are Barcelona at risk of not being able to register?\nThe list is not short. All new signings from this summer need to be included: Joan Garcia, Marcus Rashford and Roony Bardghji. There\u2019s Wojciech Szczesny, too. Finally, Barcelona have to register Gerard Martin. The left-back played last season while being registered as an academy player, but after a significant number of appearances under Hansi Flick, La Liga will now force Barcelona to include him in their first team.\nAdvertisement\nThe number one priority in that department is Garcia. Barcelona want to get his registration resolved as soon as possible, and club president Joan Laporta said during the pre-season tour last week that they are working on it.\n\u201cAll the registrations are progressing adequately. It is better to work in silence and not speak too much about it in public,\u201d said Laporta on Saturday.\nAn element that could have an impact on registrations is Ter Stegen\u2019s injury. The German goalkeeper underwent surgery on his back last week in France. Now, Barcelona are expected to submit medical reports to La Liga, who will assess them. La Liga\u2019s independent medical panel will evaluate the injury and decide whether it can be deemed as a long-term injury. This would mean an expected recovery time of at least four months. If they do, Barcelona would be in a position to use 80 per cent of Ter Stegen\u2019s salary to register a new player.\n\u201cJoan Garcia\u2019s registration does not depend on Ter Stegen,\u201d Laporta said on the weekend. \u201cBut his absence, given it is an important injury, could provide a more straightforward way to register him\u201d.\nWith Rashford and Szczesny, the club maintain they will eventually be registered without any major sale completed. In the case of Bardghji, Barcelona are aware they could potentially register the Swedish winger as a Barcelona Atletic player if there\u2019s no room for him as a first-team one.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAccording to well-placed sources within the club, Barcelona are done with signings in this transfer window.\nAfter the arrivals of Garcia, Szczesny, Rashford and Bardghji, Laporta and Deco do not expect any other major arrivals this summer, and they are now focused on registrations.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nHector Fort is the only first-team player with a big chance of leaving. The 19-year-old right-back has lost his place in Flick\u2019s priority list in his position to Eric Garcia, who was fantastic last season when he was required in the role.\nThere is practically no game time in sight for Fort, which pushed Barca and Flick to tell the player it would be best for him to find a new club. Although Fort did not intend to leave initially, Barcelona\u2019s clarity over his role has made him reconsider. The club are searching for a permanent sale, while aiming to keep close tabs on the defender with a buy-back clause.\nAdvertisement\nOn other names, there have been plenty of rumours in local media. The likes of Fermin Lopez and Marc Casado have been named as players who could raise interest abroad, and ones that Barcelona would be very willing to listen to offers for.\nHowever, the reality is that none of those players intend to leave \u2014 even knowing they are not close to having a starting role \u2014 and Flick is very happy to keep them. Barca won\u2019t actively push for a sale, and at this point club sources acknowledge that there is no major sale contemplated.\nFlick is going to have a deep squad to handle, which is certainly a luxury to have, but at the same time, can be a man-management challenge for the German.\nPol Ballus\nReal Madrid\nWhat happened this week?\nThere was no major movement in terms of signings, and this is not expected to change unless space is freed up in the squad. For now, no further departures are expected after the exits of academy players Chema Andres (Stuttgart), Jacobo Ramon (Como) and Mario Martin (Getafe) were confirmed.\nArgentina midfielder Franco Mastantuono arrived in Madrid on Sunday, although the 17-year-old is not expected to be officially presented until he turns 18 on August 14.\nDoes Xabi Alonso have the right squad for his style of play?\nAlthough in his last press conference in the United States \u2014 after the 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final defeat to Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 Alonso left the door open to further improving the squad, the signings that have been made are in line with his project.\nUpon his arrival at Madrid, the Basque coach played an active role in the signings of Alvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen and Mastantuono, all of whom he called to convince them to join. My colleague Mario Cortegana understands from sources close to the coaching setup that Alonso feels there is still room for improvement. One source suggests Alonso and his staff would like two signings, possibly one to replace Rodrygo in case the Brazilian leaves. The club\u2019s view is that the team has been built with Alonso in mind.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAlthough Madrid are always keeping an eye on the market and evaluating players, it is not clear if they have anyone specific in mind for the rest of the transfer window.\nSources who have recently been in contact with the club tell The Athletic they have been looking at options for midfield, but none of them have been fully convincing. In contrast, club sources insist the squad is closed to any more arrivals and that Alonso will have to adapt to what is available.\nAdvertisement\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAlthough both the club and Alonso are open to Rodrygo leaving, there have been no developments in his case and, according to sources close to the player, the Brazilian has indicated he wants to stay. My colleague Mario Cortegana has been told by sources close to the coaching staff that Alonso and his team are not entirely happy with Rodrygo. The player is working with intermediary Pini Zahavi this summer, which could indicate he is not so clear about his position at the club.\nBoth Endrick and Gonzalo Garcia are keen to stay. According to a source close to Gonzalo, the striker\u2019s agent, Oscar Ribot, is working on an extension and an improvement to his contract after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup.\nThe club has not yet announced who will wear the No 9 shirt, which is telling. Club sources say the decision is yet to be made.\nFrench left-back Ferland Mendy intends to stay at Madrid and compete with Carreras and Fran Garcia, but his camp is surprised the club has not yet announced his contract renewal (which, as The Athletic reported at the time, was finalised last year).\nMadrid retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause for the 20-year-old midfielder Nico Paz after his sale to Como last year. This year, Madrid have decided to waive their buy-back clause \u2014 they can re-sign him for \u20ac9m next year or \u20ac10m in 2027. Como have intended to buy out Madrid\u2019s sell-on rights for months after seeing a lot of potential in Paz last season.\nAccording to various sources involved in negotiations, there is no clause in the current agreement as to how Como could do that. When the idea was first raised a few months ago, sources at Madrid rejected the idea of losing control over a player they see as a potential star.\nReinier Jesus is set to join Atletico Mineiro in his native Brazil. The Athletic reported last week that they were the best-placed suitors for the 23-year-old. Reinier, who joined for \u20ac30m from Flamengo in 2020 and has never played for Madrid\u2019s first team, is expected to sign until December 2029 for the Brazilian side. Madrid will not receive any money but will retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause.\nGuillermo Rai\n(Top photos: Maryam Majd/Getty Images, David Klein/AP Photo; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "A well-known figure in English football arranged \u201ccash for sex\u201d sessions with a teenage girl he is accused of raping at his house and leaving with post-traumatic stress disorder, according to court documents.\nThe girl alleges that when she was 15 the man, who works in the Premier League, invited her to his house on a summer\u2019s day in the 1990s to discuss a potential career opportunity.\nAdvertisement\nHe denies rape, or having any inappropriate relations with an under-age girl, but admits asking the teenager when she was 16 or 17 \u201cif she wanted to earn some cash for sex\u201d and that it became a regular pattern over the following years.\nThe man\u2019s age cannot be disclosed, or any other details that could identify him, after a High Court judge granted an anonymity order last year to protect him from bad publicity and potential damage to his reputation and financial interests.\nThe woman, who must also remain anonymous for legal reasons, is suing for aggravated damages for sexual assault and intentional infliction of injury after alleging that he showed her round his house, then instructed her to sit on his knee, told her she was a \u201cgood girl\u201d and asked if she was still a virgin. She claims she had been dropped off by her parents, who were waiting in their car outside, and recalled the tennis from Wimbledon being shown on television.\nHe is then alleged to have subjected her to a \u201cdisgusting and traumatising\u201d ordeal before directing her to the bathroom to clean herself, telling her she was a \u201cgood girl\u201d again and handing her \u00a3150 in three \u00a350 notes on her return.\nHer case is that she has been left with depression as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and other issues. She says she was too scared at the time to report him because of the potential repercussions and \u201cfeelings of fear\u201d that she or her family may come to harm.\nShe goes on to accept his claims that in the following years they had sex on a number of occasions but states, via her legal team, that she was under the belief that he would provide her with career opportunities \u201cif she complied with his sexual demands.\u201d She says her dealings with the defendant left her with \u201cstigmatising feelings of shame, guilt and failure\u201d and it took many years before she was able to report him. The Premier League figure was not arrested and the case was left on file.\nAdvertisement\nThe alleged rapist, anonymised in court papers as JZX, strongly denies the allegations and says they are \u201cdishonest and malicious.\u201d\nIn his 17-page defence, seen by The Athletic, he also states \u201cthe implied contention that (he) might harm her or her family is wholly unfounded.\u201d\nHe argues that he helped the woman on numerous occasions, including offering financial advice and support \u201cin moments of crisis\u201d, and that they were able to \u201cenjoy a friendship\u201d for more than 20 years after the alleged rape.\nAlthough he accepts that he had initiated the \u201ccash for sex\u201d arrangement while she was 16 or 17, he goes on to allege that she had contacted him on numerous occasions over the following years to offer sexual favours in return for money.\n\u201cOn the vast majority of occasions (he) has declined offers of sex, although he has engaged in sexual activity with the claimant on up to about 15 occasions in total over the years, for which he rewarded her with cash payments in line with her expectations,\u201d the legal defence, signed by JZX, states.\n\u201cOn one occasion, the defendant engaged in sexual activity with both the claimant and her sister, both of whom were looking to earn some cash.\u201d\nMany other details cannot be reported because of the decision to impose an anonymity order to \u201cprotect the interests of the defendant\u201d and \u201csecure the administration of justice.\u201d The judge in the case decided there was \u201cno sufficient countervailing public interest in disclosure.\u201d\nThe alleged rapist continues to work as normal while awaiting a date for a High Court trial.\n(Michael Regan/Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic FC \u26bd is The Athletic\u2019s daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.\nHello! Today marks exactly a year until the start of the 2026 World Cup. We\u2019re here to explain the numbers, the politics, the finance, the geography and the key players behind the globe\u2019s biggest sporting event \u2014 and the biggest tournament FIFA has ever staged.\nOn the way:\n- FIFA\u2019s $13bn gold mine\n- USMNT in turmoil\n- Ronaldo & Messi\u2019s final fling\n- \u201994 and Escobar revisited\nBigger, better? Three host countries, 48 teams, $13bn projected earnings for FIFA\nIn the spirit of a certain fast-food outlet, FIFA\u2019s approach to the 2026 World Cup was to supersize it.\nThe 48-nation event is the largest in the tournament\u2019s history. It\u2019s the first to be spread across an entire continent, with 4,800 kilometres between Mexico City, the southern-most host, and Vancouver, furthest north. FIFA\u2019s projected earnings are leaping from $7.6bn in the four-year cycle to the last World Cup in 2022 to $13bn this time around. Extra large was the cry.\nAdvertisement\nA year today, the competition gets going in Mexico City, with the first of 104 matches. FIFA already owns the biggest sporting event on the planet \u2014 a television audience of 1.5bn for the final in Qatar three years ago was 11 times the U.S. audience for the 2025 Super Bowl, and five billion people are expected to watch worldwide in 2026 \u2014 but by expanding from 32 teams and naming Mexico, Canada and the United States as joint hosts, soccer\u2019s world governing body is consolidating that status.\nA game of growth\nThe U.S. in isolation is an example of the sport\u2019s capacity to grow at an exponential rate. When the country staged the World Cup in 1994, Major League Soccer did not even exist. Today, the division contains billion-dollar clubs, some of whom rank among the game\u2019s most valuable. It boasts Lionel Messi, the finest player of his era (and arguably any other). Mauricio Pochettino is the USMNT\u2019s head coach, as high-profile a name as they have ever been able to recruit.\nSoccer has taken time to crack the States, but it\u2019s getting there, and FIFA sending both this year\u2019s Club World Cup and next year\u2019s World Cup to North America is a concerted commercial push on that front. There\u2019s no getting away from the political manoeuvring involved in allocating these tournaments, but the fact remains: when the World Cup kicks off, it\u2019s the only show in town.\nWill it be ready?\nFIFA\u2019s selection of countries to host its showpiece is increasingly becoming a bone of contention. That was true of Russia in 2018 and true of Qatar four years later. It\u2019s most certainly true of Saudi Arabia, which won the bidding unopposed for the 2034 World Cup. Many argue football\u2019s administrators are brushing over serious matters such as human rights concerns.\nHanding the 2026 edition to the U.S. alongside Mexico and Canada involved much interaction between FIFA and the White House. Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of American President Donald Trump, was a key point of contact in the run up to the \u2018United\u2019 bid winning the race. Latterly, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has grown very close with Trump \u2014 to a degree that is concerning some of Infantino\u2019s colleagues.\nAdvertisement\nNorth America, however, is well equipped for a World Cup. Much of the necessary infrastructure is in place and while stadium alterations will be required, none are having to be built from scratch. The 11 U.S. cities where matches will be played are wrestling with the federal government for $625m in security funding, and they\u2019re not exactly hyped yet. Trump\u2019s recent travel ban could have implications for the travelling parties from specific countries such as Iran. But unlike previous tournaments, it\u2019s taken as read that the U.S., Mexico and Canada will be logistically ready.\nArgentina and Messi (assuming his pencil has enough lead left in it) go into 2026 as defending champions. The bookmakers narrowly favour France, and public confidence must be swinging towards Lamine Yamal and Spain. A 41-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo should be in town, too, keeping the old flame alive. But him and Messi aside, 2026 is a new frontier.\nUSMNT humbled by Switzerland in fourth straight defeat\nOur American subscribers would hope to hear us say that 2026 will be the USMNT\u2019s moment. We\u2019d love to\u2026 but Pochettino has hit the ground crawling, his team were smashed 4-0 by Switzerland in a friendly yesterday (their fourth defeat back-to-back), and errors like Johnny Cardoso\u2019s against Turkey last weekend, above, are doing them in.\nI thought I\u2019d defer to The Athletic\u2019s USMNT expert, Paul Tenorio, to give his take on where Poch is at with 12 months until showtime:\n\u201cThe honeymoon is over and a marriage counsellor is on retainer. The losses in the Nations League riled both an already-concerned fanbase and a coach who expected more effort out of his players. Now, Pochettino is trying to shake things up with an MLS-heavy squad. He\u2019s under deadline to create a connection with his core players and foster some positivity \u2014 and results \u2014 around this group.\u201d\nThat reads like trouble in paradise to me. We\u2019ll be back with more of the fall-out in tomorrow\u2019s TAFC.\nNews Round-Up\n- Tickets for this month\u2019s Club World Cup are selling so badly that students are being given the chance to watch Saturday\u2019s curtain-raiser between Messi\u2019s Inter Miami and Egypt\u2019s Al Ahly for the equivalent of $4 a pop. (Giving them away, in other words.)\n- Al Hilal are trying to sign midfielder N\u2019Golo Kante on a short-term loan from fellow Saudi Arabian team Al Ittihad to allow them to field him at the Club World Cup. You\u2019d think FIFA might query the spirit of a deal like that, but no.\n- Let\u2019s wrap up other transfers quickly. Manchester City got Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders done, paying a combined \u00a377m. Jobe Bellingham has joined Borussia Dortmund for \u00a332m ($43.3m). And despite Arsenal interest, Leroy Sane is close to leaving Bayern Munich for Galatasaray.\n- The first official European league game to go abroad looks like being a Serie A fixture between Milan and Como. The Australian city of Perth is in talks to host the clash in February 2026.\nOn the plane\nBack in 2001, FIFA altered its qualification rules to deny the World Cup holders an automatic place at the next tournament. Fortunately, Argentina stormed the South American (CONMEBOL) group, so they\u2019ll be in the U.S. to have a go at becoming the first back-to-back winners since Brazil in \u201962.\nWith 12 months to go, Lionel Scaloni\u2019s squad are one of 13 countries booked in for the 2026 finals. Mexico and the USMNT, both of whom are habitual participants, received a place as hosts, as did Canada. Familiar faces Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Ecuador have made the cut again.\nAdvertisement\nUzbekistan and Jordan are first-time qualifiers and bona fide unknown quantities. As for New Zealand, the Oceania Football Confederation campaign was so mismatched that they averaged just under six goals a game; a case of beating whatever\u2019s put in front of you.\nAs the slots fill up and we count down to December\u2019s draw (most likely in Vegas, baby), keep an eye on the following nations: 2024 Copa America finalists Colombia have work to do. New Caledonia \u2014 population 290,000 \u2014 are hanging in there. And is Norway\u2019s first World Cup trip in almost 30 years in the bag? A perfect record in a group where Italy are imploding means a berth is theirs for the taking; and doesn\u2019t Erling Haaland just love the smell of blood.\nStars align: Don\u2019t miss these players\nEvery World Cup produces a breakout star, but in 2026, Lamine Yamal can\u2019t really be it. He might be 17 years old and he might not have played in a World Cup before, but by the time he does, the Barcelona winger will have won just about everything else there is to win \u2014 including, potentially, the Ballon d\u2019Or.\nBe psyched for his involvement, though, because Yamal is the real deal. It\u2019s why Barcelona are committing to paying him up to $880,000 a week, and why trading cards with his face on are soaring in value. He\u2019s patenting those step-off-the-right, finish-with-the-left-foot goals \u2014 and the variety in the way he carries the ball (see our graphic, above) is purgatory for a full-back.\nThe Athletic\u2019s data writers have picked a list of 10 players, Yamal included, who they think could steal the show in the States. Two names they didn\u2019t mention but who I\u2019m keen to see out there (aside from Real Madrid\u2019s Dean Huijsen, who is sky high in the breakout stakes) are Premier League-bound Cherki and his France colleague Michael Olise. The Bayern Munich factor is real, but 12 goals and 15 assists from Olise equates to a hell of a first season in the Bundesliga.\nUSA \u201994 revisited:\nFor those of us who remember the \u201894 World Cup clearly, two memories are abiding: Diana Ross\u2019 shambolic penalty during the opening ceremony, and Roberto Baggio outdoing her on the comedy scale with that decisive spot-kick in the final between Italy and Brazil. It\u2019s still on its way to Mars.\nThe competition dared to be different, though, and it was. The States got its first taste of the World Cup. Detroit\u2019s Pontiac Silverdome staged indoor matches for the first time (minus air-conditioning, so the humidity was hideous). The USMNT broke from the traditions of international shirts with their famous denim Adidas number \u2014 which, if we\u2019re honest, has aged pretty well.\nAdvertisement\nBut the event which resonates most all these years later concerns the Group A game between the U.S. and Colombia, played in California on June 22. The USMNT secured passage to the knockouts by winning 2-1, aided by an own goal from Andres Escobar. Ten days after Colombia\u2019s defeat, Escobar was shot dead in his homeland.\nWere the own goal and his murder linked? No motive has ever been established, and some of his old team-mates doubt it. But as ex-USMNT defender Alexi Lalas said in this gripping oral history of the match: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who was on that field that day who wouldn\u2019t gladly lose that game if it meant that Andres Escobar was still with us.\u201d\n(Photo: Mike Stobe \u2013 FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Will the return of Rodri propel Manchester City back to the top of the table? Is this the year Manchester United finally regain their status as a genuine Premier League power? How will a tragic summer affect Liverpool on the pitch? Can the promoted teams break the pattern of recent seasons and stay up?\nAdvertisement\nThe 2025-26 season kicks off on Friday and what better way to start the week than by looking ahead to what might be in store over the coming months.\nWe asked all of our writers to submit their predicted Premier League table \u2014 you can see that a little further down this article. (We won\u2019t name the person who had Manchester United finishing in the relegation places \u2014 for now, at least.)\nWe also asked Oliver Kay, Adam Crafton, Tim Spiers, Nick Miller, Simon Hughes, Stuart James, The Athletic FC podcast host Ayo Akinwolere and Cerys Jones to gaze into their crystal balls and go a little deeper on some of the key topics.\nLet us know if you agree in the comments and we definitely won\u2019t be holding the writers to their predictions come May. Honest.\nWho will be much better than last season?\nKay: Manchester United simply have to be, but I\u2019ll look across the city and say Phil Foden, who had such a difficult time last season. I\u2019m always wary of that \u201cclass is permanent\u201d maxim because there are so many cases that suggest the opposite, but I hope and believe Foden will be energised by a summer\u2019s break, even if it was shorter than would have been ideal.\nCrafton: Strange to say about a team who finished second, but I found Arsenal frustratingly sloppy at times last season. They look a much more complete squad this time around, with additions in key positions, and perhaps Eberechi Eze still to come. There really doesn\u2019t look to be a gap in their armour, so Mikel Arteta must have his team firing from the very start to secure the silverware his reign merits.\nSpiers: Manchester City\u2019s biggest problems last season were rooted in their creaky, Rodri-less midfield. With Rodri back and the dynamic Tijjani Reijnders on board, plus some fine additions in the two Rayans \u2014 Cherki and Ait-Nouri \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be much improved.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Tottenham. Which admittedly isn\u2019t saying much, considering they lost more than half their games and finished 17th last season. But if any team needs a manager who will fashion some square holes for their square pegs, rather than trying to ram them into round ones, it\u2019s Spurs: hello, Thomas Frank.\nHughes: Spurs. Otherwise, they might be relegated.\nJames: The bar\u2019s not set very high for Manchester United and Spurs to be \u201cmuch better\u201d than last season. The temptation is to say that Spurs, under Frank, will be the biggest climber. But I\u2019m going to roll the dice and suggest United, with no European football, will be around the top six.\nAkinwolere: Crystal Palace, assuming they\u2019re able to keep Eze. I really like Oliver Glasner as a coach. I\u2019ve watched some of their pre-season games and they have been impressive.\nJones: Manchester United, surely, if only because the bar is so low. I have been saying this since I was studying for my GCSEs and should probably know better by now. Joking aside, this Europe-less season and the new-look front line feel like fertile ground for a rebuild.\nWho will be worse than last season?\nKay: Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Brentford could all be excused a slight drop-off after exceeding expectations last season, particularly as the first two will have European commitments to contend with. Brentford are the ones at risk of a steep drop-off. Frank is such a hard act to follow for Keith Andrews.\nCrafton: I am a little worried about Bournemouth, who have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga, Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen, and seem to be losing Illia Zabarnyi and Dango Ouattara. Andoni Iraola is a super coach, but that\u2019s a hefty rebuild and replacements may not be through the door until the season starts. I\u2019d also expect a substantial drop-off at Nottingham Forest towards mid-table.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Recent history tells us Manchester United take very good/promising players and turn them into disasters (Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana, Mason Mount etc). All the best, then, to xG overachievers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Team-wise, it has to be PSR botherers Aston Villa, who look chaotic.\nMiller: Newcastle. At the time of writing, they don\u2019t have a striker who actually wants to play for them, have strengthened in a couple of positions they were already fine in, and their transfer targets are all picking other teams. Not ideal when you have the Champions League to deal with, too.\nHughes: Brentford. Yes, they\u2019re a well-run club, but they\u2019ve replaced the manager who got them into the Premier League for the first time and kept them there for years with someone who, not so long ago, was a talking head on Sky\u2019s EFL coverage. He has made a huge jump.\nJames: Nottingham Forest (seventh) and Chris Wood (20 Premier League goals) have got their work cut out to maintain the same level. But it\u2019s hard to look beyond Brentford, who have lost their manager, their top goalscorer, and their captain. Fair play to Andrews if he proves us all wrong.\nAkinwolere: You have to worry for Brentford, with many key components missing in the team. Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Norgaard and possibly Yoane Wissa. It feels like an uphill struggle if they\u2019re not able to replace the quality they\u2019ve lost.\nJones: Brentford, for all the reasons mentioned above. If Wissa leaves, too, their attack will look very thin and a top-half finish could be tough.\nWho will win the title?\nKay: The least controversial answer is Liverpool, but there are various unknowns: how the new signings will adapt, whether they\u2019re light in certain areas, and, of course, how the loss of Diogo Jota in such tragic circumstances might affect them.\nI\u2019ll say Liverpool, cautiously, but I wouldn\u2019t discount Arsenal, Manchester City, or \u2014 if they can somehow harden up a bit \u2014 Chelsea, all of whom should be stronger.\nCrafton: Arsenal. It\u2019s about time. He\u2019s almost been forgotten in the blur of the summer, but Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s departure to Real Madrid will be big for Liverpool.\nSpiers: Manchester City had a disastrous 2024-25 season and still only finished 13 points behind Liverpool. They undoubtedly have the best manager, striker and possibly squad in the league, and I think they\u2019ll probably overhaul Liverpool again.\nMiller: Oh god, I\u2019m falling for it again: Arsenal. Broadly because they seem to have actually addressed their problems this summer, rather than Arteta looking at their squad and saying \u201cNo, we just need one more beefy centre-half to play at full-back\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nHughes: Liverpool. I\u2019m not convinced their eye-catching summer in the transfer market results in eye-catching performances straight away because it will probably take time for the team to gel, but they have recruited proven quality and upgrades in most positions.\nJames: It\u2019s been such a traumatic summer for Liverpool that nobody can be quite sure how they will respond. But my instinct tells me that Arne Slot and his players will develop an even closer bond in the wake of the Jota tragedy and, with the help of some outstanding signings, retain the title.\nAkinwolere: I really want to say Arsenal! Oh, go on then\u2026 Arsenal. As you can tell, I\u2019m not fully convinced, but I have to believe all the pain of consecutive second-place finishes has shown Arteta what he needs to add to this team.\nJones: Liverpool. Arsenal and City\u2019s problems helped them last season, but they have not stood still at the top. Slot\u2019s squad has got even stronger and I don\u2019t feel anyone else has added enough to keep up.\nResults in full: Where our writers think teams will finish\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n45% | 38% | 14% | 3% | |||||||||||||||||\n31% | 31% | 31% | 7% | |||||||||||||||||\n21% | 21% | 45% | 13% | |||||||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 74% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n3% | 45% | 17% | 24% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n28% | 41% | 14% | 7% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n24% | 21% | 41% | 10% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n18% | 14% | 18% | 17% | 10% | 3% | 10% | 3% | 3% | 3% | |||||||||||\n3% | 28% | 31% | 10% | 10% | 7% | 3% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 14% | 17% | 21% | 7% | 17% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 21% | 3% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 3% | 21% | 21% | 10% | 7% | 28% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 14% | 7% | 10% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 3% | 7% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 17% | 7% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 7% | 17% | 21% | 24% | 10% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 7% | 24% | 14% | 28% | 17% | 3% | |||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 34% | |||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 10% | 17% | 7% | 34% | 21% | ||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 14% | 21% | 28% | 24% | 3% | ||||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 10% | 76% |\nWho is the best signing so far?\nKay: I\u2019ve been less than enthusiastic about Chelsea\u2019s approach in the transfer market in recent years, but looking at Jorrel Hato for \u00a335m and an initial \u00a329.1m for Estevao \u2014 and possibly a \u00a340m deal for Alejandro Garnacho \u2014 the potential upside of those deals is enormous (I stress potential because there are still aspects of Chelsea\u2019s approach that leave me sceptical).\nCrafton: There have been some great signings by big Premier League clubs plucking from the middle class of the top flight. Joao Pedro to Chelsea and Kerkez to Liverpool seem surefire bets.\nSpiers: You can have your flair players, your tricky flickers and your goalscorers all you like, but the best hairy-arsed tackler in the Premier League in recent seasons was Fulham\u2019s Joao Palhinha \u2014 and Tottenham have brought him back to England for peanuts. He could transform their team at both ends of the pitch. Shoutout for Sunderland signing Granit Xhaka, too.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Fair play to whoever is persuading players to join Sunderland, because Xhaka is a hell of a get. Viktor Gyokeres is very \u2018final piece in the jigsaw puzzle\u2019 at Arsenal. Florian Wirtz could turn out to be a sort of super deluxe utility man for Liverpool, and wherever he plays, I think he\u2019ll be magic.\nHughes: Joao Pedro. Chelsea needed a top-class striker and now they have one.\nJames: Wirtz would be an obvious answer. But I\u2019ll throw a left-field name into the mix, purely because I said at the Copa America last summer that Colombia\u2019s Jhon Arias \u201cmust surely be on the radar of top European teams\u201d. It disappoints me that Wolves, 12 months later, haven\u2019t even offered a word of thanks.\nAkinwolere: Gyokeres \u2014 is he really the elite striker Arsenal have been looking for? How will he fit their system? His hunger for goals and his tireless work rate should bode well for a team that struggled to bury key chances last season. I\u2019m not expecting 40 goals, but I am expecting some top-bins bangers.\nJones: Gyokeres. 54 goals in one season speaks for itself. He might need a bit of time to slot into Arsenal and the Premier League, but once he does, he can be the focal point they sorely need. Considering what strikers seem to cost these days, an initial \u00a355m isn\u2019t bad either.\nWhich player are you most looking forward to watching?\nKay: In addition to Wirtz, who is mesmerising, there\u2019s Arias, who enthralled me during the Club World Cup, Cherki at Manchester City, Estevao at Chelsea, and, if the opportunity arises and they\u2019ve done their homework on time, the precocious Max Dowman at Arsenal and Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool.\nCrafton: Cunha at Manchester United. Some players grow a few inches in that jersey, and many more are weighed down by the history and scrutiny. He strikes me as someone who will relish the expectation.\nSpiers: It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if Gyokeres solves Arsenal\u2019s striker conundrum. His uncontrollable, lusty desire for scoring goals is tangible and his numbers are ridiculous, but most of the Portuguese league would be the equivalent of Championship standard and below. Also, Arias at Wolves promises to be high on the fun scale.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Wirtz. I don\u2019t especially care how many goals he scores or assists he gets or chances he makes. He just moves in such a slinky, elegant way that I\u2019ll be paying attention to him and only him when Liverpool play. I also like the cut of El Hadji Malick Diouf\u2019s gib, although West Ham will probably ruin him somehow.\nHughes: Wirtz. No Liverpool signing has excited me more since the arrival of Fernando Torres.\nJames: Players (plural), if you don\u2019t mind. Wirtz \u2014 what a signing. The incredibly gifted Cherki \u2014 intrigued as to how Pep Guardiola uses him (and, in particular, how much the City manager trusts him off the ball). Last but not least, 15-year-old Dowman. A sensational talent.\nAkinwolere: Joao Pedro in this Chelsea setup looks tasty. If the Club World Cup appearances are anything to go by, \u00a350m could be money well spent.\nJones: I\u2019m always wary of overhyping teenage \u2018prodigies\u2019, but Chelsea\u2019s Estevao is very exciting. He is an unapologetic entertainer and his dribbling, especially for someone so young, is ludicrous. Romantic or naive as it sounds, it\u2019s always intriguing to hear an incoming player describe football as a \u201cspectacle\u201d.\nWhich manager is under the most pressure?\nKay: Not to say his job is under immediate threat, but the pressure on Ruben Amorim to show he can turn Manchester United around is huge nonetheless. They won just seven of his 27 Premier League games last season. The pressure will lift very quickly if his new-look team can hit the ground running. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it is far from a gentle start fixture-wise \u2014 it\u2019s going to intensify.\nCrafton: The answer to this is always the Manchester United manager, but Daniel Farke has plenty to prove at the highest level at Leeds, while Eddie Howe is coming through a turbulent summer, and I\u2019m curious to see how and if the dynamics at St James\u2019 Park resolve themselves. Oh, and England head coach Thomas Tuchel. There\u2019s a pretty big tournament coming up.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Not necessarily to save his job, but there will be pressure on Frank in what is, after 12 years in management, a huge step up for his first big job. Patience may be in short supply on the back of the enormous high of Spurs ending their trophy drought.\nMiller: No need to overthink this: it\u2019s Amorim. That said, Brentford promoting Andrews from set-piece coach to top man in a summer when they\u2019ve lost two of their best players and a third might go is enough to cause a \u2018mechanic regarding a leaky engine\u2019 sharp intake of breath.\nHughes: Amorim. If United are occupying roughly the same position they finished in last season come November, he\u2019ll be gone.\nJames: Farke could be gone very early in the season \u2014 I don\u2019t see Leeds hanging around if they start poorly. There\u2019s potential for Brentford to make a quick change, too. But, realistically, Amorim goes straight in at No 1. It can\u2019t go on like this, Ruben.\nAkinwolere: Amorim. The buffer of arriving mid-season can only last so long. They have spent a lot of money in attacking areas, but there is still a fair amount of work to do. The fans are impatient and rightly so.\nJones: Amorim. Last season, he had the caveat of arriving earlier than he wanted, and Manchester United\u2019s top brass and supporters have shown him a lot of goodwill. In a campaign with no European football, after being backed so heavily, he has to deliver European qualification at least.\nWho will be top and bottom at Christmas?\nKay: I\u2019m struggling with this one. I know Crystal Palace will finish somewhere between 10th and 15th, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where they or anyone else will be at Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t have predicted this time last year that Liverpool would be four points clear at Christmas with a game in hand. It\u2019s a less predictable league right now and it\u2019s more appealing for that.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Arsenal top, Burnley bottom. Burnley\u2019s opening seven games are brutal and threaten to immediately undermine whatever Scott Parker is seeking to build.\nSpiers: Liverpool have the best XI but it may take some time for their signings to gel, so Manchester City will be top. Burnley\u2019s promotion was built on an insanely good defensive record but they\u2019ve lost a couple of key players and \u2014 call me crazy \u2014 but Armando Broja (two goals in 43 Premier League appearances) might not fire them to safety.\nMiller: Arsenal top, Brentford bottom. Gyokeres has quite a \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 vibe to him, so I think Arsenal will be strong in the first half at least. Brentford will have sacked Andrews in around November, but the revival under Sean Dyche won\u2019t have quite started by Christmas.\nHughes: Arsenal (I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll win it) and Leeds, who will have a new manager by that point if this is the case.\nJames: I\u2019ll answer this in reverse order because I feel slightly more confident of that part of the prediction: Burnley. Top? Realistically, it\u2019s one of four: Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Donald Trump\u2019s Chelsea. Liverpool it is.\nAkinwolere: Liverpool have done a lot of their business early and I think Arsenal and Manchester City will take time to find their flow this time around. It\u2019s hard to look past the newly promoted teams at the bottom. But I\u2019ll go for Brentford.\nJones: Liverpool have given themselves plenty of time to bed in new signings, so they should start strongly; I agree with Ayo that Arsenal and Manchester City will need longer to settle. Sunderland have spent a lot, but not on their defence, which could see them fall behind the pack quickly.\nWill any of the three promoted teams survive?\nKay: Yes. It\u2019s been alarming to see the three promoted clubs go straight back down again in the past two seasons, but I\u2019ll be the cheery voice for once and say I can see two or perhaps even all three of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland surviving this time. How \u2014 and at whose expense \u2014 I\u2019m less confident about. Unlike some, I think it\u2019s a dauntingly strong league.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: I do think the Premier League is better with Leeds and Sunderland in it \u2014 and more clubs from the north in general \u2014 so I would love to see it. But it\u2019s such a big gap. The promoted clubs should remember that teams like Brentford, Brighton and Bournemouth began their Premier League journeys playing very pragmatic football to earn their right to stay in the division.\nSpiers: Sunderland have done the best summer business, although they also had the most ground to make up. Leeds probably have the best chance and there are obvious vulnerable prey to catch, including Brentford post-Frank and also Wolves, who have been circling the drain for three years and not done much about it.\nMiller: I would have said Burnley, on the basis of their extraordinary defence last season, but selling James Trafford will kick a hole in that. Sunderland have spent a fair bit, but they need essentially all of those moves to go right for them. Leeds are interesting, but at the time of writing, probably don\u2019t have quite enough. That said, Brentford and Wolves will probably be bad, and I think Fulham could regress, so one of the new lot will probably stay up\u2026 I\u2019m just not going to commit to one! Sorry!\nHughes: No, but Burnley have the best chance if they are able to defend as they did last season and perform generally as uncompromisingly as they did when Dyche was there.\nJames: Leeds and Sunderland have the potential to be more competitive than Ipswich Town, Leicester City and Southampton last season. Leeds on the basis of\u2026 well, just being Leeds and making Elland Road a bit of a fortress. Sunderland, on the face of it, have done some very good transfer business. If I had to pick one\u2026 see my final answer, mate.\nAkinwolere: Sunderland have spent a lot of money, but that often doesn\u2019t equal survival. I\u2019m excited by the signings of Simon Adingra and Xhaka, though. Parker struggled at the helm with both Fulham and Bournemouth last time he managed in the Premier League, as did Farke with Norwich City. With Manchester United and Tottenham having such bad seasons and still surviving last time out, you worry about the financial and quality gap already created by the established teams.\nJones: Leeds and Burnley haven\u2019t added enough quality, and while I would love to believe Sunderland\u2019s record spending could save them, the jump in quality after eight years away feels insurmountable and they haven\u2019t reinforced their defence enough. A Cunha-less Wolves could fall far enough to give one side a lifeline, though.\nThe Manchester City case has still not been resolved. What does that mean for the season?\nKay: I don\u2019t know what it means for the season. I think the repercussions are felt more widely in the sense that people doubt English football\u2019s ability and authority to implement its rules and regulate its clubs. That\u2019s not a new story, but it\u2019s a worrying one because, whether you like the rules or not, the alternative is anarchy.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: The players who may have benefited from some of the earliest alleged breaches have now retired, while the charges begin to feel so drawn-out, so historic, that anyone who continues to bang on about City or scrutinise the club is depicted as being very boring or having a vendetta. But when this thing ever gets resolved, in whichever direction, it will be humongous.\nSpiers: Well, certainly nothing for City, who have spent money in 2025 like it\u2019s going out of fashion. It\u2019ll hang over the season like a Manchester raincloud and, frankly, it\u2019s ludicrous that it\u2019s gone on this long.\nMiller: That we\u2019ll have even more weak banter centred around the number 115, and news stories roughly every three weeks that say \u2018Manchester City\u2019s case could be resolved this week\u2019. I suggest nobody engages with this until it\u2019s actually done: your life will be much more pleasant.\nHughes: Nothing. Life will continue as it has ever since the investigation started.\nJames: More regular questions over the fence from my (lovely and retired) Manchester City-supporting neighbour as to whether I\u2019ve heard anything. The whole saga is tiresome (the case, that is, not talking to my neighbour).\nAkinwolere: That I\u2019ll try my best to show enthusiasm for the subject on the podcast, and Matt Slater will try his best to be enthused by the fact that nothing has changed.\nJones: That we will be answering \u2018The outcome of Manchester City\u2019s case is still under appeal, so what does that mean for the season?\u2019 this time next year \u2014 that is, if it\u2019s even got that far.\nWhich game in the opening weeks will tell us a lot about the season to come?\nKay: There are some big games early on, but Liverpool versus Arsenal on August 31 jumps out. Both will have had a tough-looking away game by then (at Newcastle and Manchester United respectively), so either of them could come out of that game looking like champions-elect or seeming vulnerable, whether that is fair or (as I suspect) not.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Newcastle versus Liverpool in the second week. And, sorry Eddie, I am not available to play up front.\nSpiers: August 24, Everton versus Brighton. Will Hill Dickinson Stadium be a shiny modern fortress for Everton, or was it the tight, thunderously atmospheric Goodison Park that was keeping them afloat all these years? More importantly, will the acoustics at the new stadium reverberate boos like Goodison did?\nMiller: There have been plenty of positive noises coming from those who have watched Manchester United in pre-season, and a front three of Cunha, Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko is potentially quite sexy. But if they get bulldozed by Arsenal on the first weekend\u2026 cue the beleaguered Portuguese man in the hoodie declaring they should just be relegated now.\nHughes: It will be interesting to see how the Club World Cup impacts the performances and results of the teams that competed in it. On one hand, they might be better prepared at the start and tire later. On the other, they might not be as fresh.\nJames: Opening weekend, never mind opening weeks. Manchester United versus Arsenal. Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha \u2014 let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got. As for Arsenal, are they finally going to win the title again, and is Gyokeres the missing piece? (A sentence I never thought I\u2019d type when I watched him score a long overdue first Swansea goal in January 2021).\nAkinwolere: It all starts on the opening weekend for me, and Manchester United versus Arsenal is big for both clubs. Arteta needs to win big this season, as does Amorim. These two need to hit the ground running and both have fanbases that want to see improvement.\nJones: Week five looks fun: Manchester United versus Chelsea will test Champions League ambitions and Wolves versus Leeds hints at whether we can expect a proper relegation battle. Most of all, Arsenal versus Manchester City helps establish if either will emerge as a clear challenger to Liverpool, or if they will just fight each other for second.\nThe thing we\u2019ll all be saying in May is\u2026\nKay: What next for Marcus Rashford/Jack Grealish/Raheem Sterling as he heads back to Manchester United/Manchester City/Chelsea after his loan spell?\nCrafton: The tickets for the World Cup are HOW MUCH?\nSpiers: Will Manchester City\u2019s 115 charges case be resolved this week?\nMiller: I wish I hadn\u2019t fallen for the Arsenal thing, again\u2026\nHughes: Time to put your feet up, Pep.\nAdvertisement\nJames: Fair play to you, Ange Postecoglou, for keeping Leeds up.\nAkinwolere: Chelsea have got their eye on another 10 players to bolster the squad ahead of next season, with more outgoings still to come.\nJones: With Premier League Golden Boot winner Harry Maguire up front, nothing can stop England. It\u2019s coming home.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "The summer can be a strange time for football fans. Showing my age here but, except in a major tournament year, summers used to be largely football-free from late May until the second half of August. You would pick up a newspaper in the UK and struggle to find much football coverage as sports such as cricket, tennis, athletics and golf took over.\nAdvertisement\nThese days, football is unrelentingly all-consuming and it can be hard to identify the gap between one season and the next. This summer has seen one tournament after another, including a new 32-team Club World Cup. The transfer market has almost begun to feel like a sport in its own right. Football is non-stop \u2014 as is The Athletic\u2019s coverage of it, for that matter. Amen to that.\nBut still, the heart quickens as a new season slowly comes around \u2014 a new dawn, new players, new kits, new hopes. The Premier League\u2019s 2025-26 campaign will begin on Friday, August 15, when champions Liverpool face Bournemouth at Anfield. Over that opening weekend, there is Aston Villa vs Newcastle United at Villa Park and Manchester United vs Arsenal at Old Trafford. The Monday, August 18, will see Leeds United\u2019s top-flight return against Everton at Elland Road.\nAnd to add to the fun, The Athletic will be launching a weekly Premier League predictions game, where I will give my thoughts on the division\u2019s upcoming fixtures\u2026 and where you\u2019ll have the opportunity not just to disagree with me, for my blatant bias against YOUR club, but to prove that you know better.\nEvery week, we will be asking a subscriber to The Athletic to predict the results in each Premier League match. To add further friendly competition, we will also have weekly scorelines from an algorithm-based predictive model and a (very informed) small child. (Why am I starting to think this has all been designed to leave me with egg on my face?)\nEach of the 38 rounds of fixtures will see a different subscriber invited to give us their scorelines.\nIf you would like to be in contention to be selected, please read the terms below and complete the Google Form with your name, email address, the place you live and the club you support.\nThe countdown to August 15 starts here!\nIf you cannot view the Google Form at the bottom of this article, please click on this direct link to enter your information.\nBy submitting the form below or participating via the link above, you agree that you have read, understand and accept the Reader Submission Terms in relation to all of the content and other information you send to us (\u201cYour Content\u201d).

      "text": "The mysterious \u201cPerson X\u201d who facilitated sponsorship payments to Manchester City in one of the deals being investigated by the Premier League was, at the time, a key aide of Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ), now the ruler of Abu Dhabi.\nAccording to an unpublished 2020 judgement made by UEFA\u2019s Club Financial Control Board (CFCB), Manchester City\u2019s lawyers name the individual involved in supplying the supposed sponsorship money from state-owned Emirati telecommunications company Etisalat as \u201cJaber Mohamed\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nThe judgement, which has been seen and authenticated by The Athletic, as well as previously by the makers of a YouTube documentary about Manchester City\u2019s legal battle with the Premier League and The Times, states he was \u201ca person in the business of providing financial and brokering services to commercial entities in the UAE\u201d.\nIt can now be revealed that, at the time, Jaber Mohamed worked as the General Director of the Crown Prince\u2019s Court (CPC), an Abu Dhabi government body that runs the public affairs of the then Crown Prince, MBZ.\nAnother even more senior figure at the CPC was also on Manchester City\u2019s board then too, a position he held for over a decade, raising uncomfortable questions not just about the source of the funding for the sponsorship payments, but also as to whether the payments were known about within the highest seats of power in the UAE.\nView this post on Instagram\nIn their 2020 judgement the CFCB concluded that Manchester City were guilty of breaking UEFA\u2019s financial rules, finding that payments from Etisalat, facilitated by Jaber Mohamed, were actually \u201cdisguised equity funding\u201d. Equity funding refers to funding that is directly injected into a club by its owners, whose cap is dictated by UEFA financial fair-play rules (FFP). Clubs are required to accurately declare their income annually to comply with FFP regulations.\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) later overturned that judgement, ruling that the claims related to Etisalat were time-barred. Manchester City have always denied any wrongdoing and insist the transactions were genuine sponsorship payments.\nMuch of CAS\u2019 judgement was redacted due to requests from the parties \u2014 including the name of a mysterious \u2018Person X\u2019 who facilitated payments from Etisalat.\nFor example, in CAS\u2019 public summary of the CFCB report, they state that UEFA found that \u201c[X] paid GBP [xxx] towards Etisalat\u2019s sponsorship obligations\u2026 no sensible explanation has ever been provided by MCFC as to why [City owners] ADUG needed to engage the assistance of [X] to make the payment.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHowever, UEFA\u2019s unredacted report reveals Person X as \u201cJaber Mohamed\u201d, finding that he was a central figure in the controversial transaction.\nInvestigators at UEFA were provided with bank statements containing Jaber Mohamed\u2019s name, with the panel stating in their conclusions that one email \u201cclearly evidences an arrangement under which cash of \u00a315million is to be paid by \u2018the shareholder\u2019 but paid through the bank account of the sponsors\u2026 In the event, a payment of \u00a315million was made from the account of Jaber Mohamed to the account of the Club on 10 January 2013, not via Etisalat.\u201d\nThe panel details: \u201ctwo payments of \u00a315million made by Jaber Mohamed on 13 June 2012 and 10 January 2013.\u201d\nIn concluding their write-up of the Etisalat segment of the judgement, the five-person panel states: \u201cThe Adjudicatory Chamber is comfortably satisfied\u2026 [that] the management of the club was well aware that the payments totalling \u00a330million made by Jaber Mohamed were made as equity funding, not as payments for the sponsor on account of genuine sponsorship liabilities.\u201d\nUEFA declined to comment on any element of this story when approached by The Athletic.\nJaber Mohamed has uploaded several pictures of himself at Manchester City on his public Instagram page, including posing with former players David Silva, Jesus Navas, and Sergio Aguero during their time at the club. Other pictures show him with chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak and the Premier League trophy.\nHis role within the power structures of the UAE has never previously been publicly identified.\nAccording to a now removed page on the CPC website, Jaber Mohamed was one of the two most senior aides to MBZ as the General Director of the CPC.\nHe variously spells his surname as Mohammed on the CPC website but as Mohamed on his personal Instagram account \u2014 these disparities are not uncommon when translating Arabic into English due to the greater tendency to use double letters in English. The Athletic has authenticated that this is the same man.\nAdvertisement\nWhilst UEFA found that Jaber Mohamed was \u201ca person in the business of providing financial and brokering services to commercial entities in the UAE\u201d, The Athletic has not been able to find evidence of him holding any business or governmental roles beyond the CPC which might explain why he would be asked to provide financial or brokering services to companies linked to Manchester City.\nMohamed and the CPC did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nView this post on Instagram\nThe CPC\u2019s website describes Jaber Mohamed\u2019s job as acting as the chief operational officer, whose role was to \u201coversee the day to day operations [\u2026and] also interact with all other divisions, sections, and units that all fall under the auspices of the CPC\u201d.\nAccording to the UAE Cabinet\u2019s website, Jaber Mohamed held the role from August 16 2005 to August 16 2022.\nMore broadly, the CPC states its own role as \u201cmanaging the public affairs of the Crown Prince, including his involvement in corporate and philanthropic projects\u201d. It also describes itself as \u201can independent entity that enjoys full legal status as a government body\u201d.\nAccording to sources with knowledge of the Premier League\u2019s current case against Manchester City, speaking anonymously as they are not authorised to discuss proceedings publicly, Jaber Mohamed\u2019s involvement in the transaction led to the role of the CPC, a government body, in facilitating the alleged sponsorship rule breaches becoming a significant line of inquiry for the Premier League as they investigated whether the payments were from the sponsors, Etisalat, or from elsewhere.\nBut the CPC\u2019s involvement also raises wider questions over the extent to which MBZ, given the alleged involvement of members of his court in providing payment, was aware of City\u2019s sponsorship arrangements.\nGiven Manchester City\u2019s strong denial of any state involvement in the ownership and control of the club, and the Europe-wide debate surrounding state ownership and control of football clubs, this link to a UAE government body raises uncomfortable questions about the nation\u2019s role at the club, which should be of significant interest to the Premier League, whose role it is to oversee such matters.\nThe Premier League offered no comment when contacted by The Athletic with these concerns.\nState ownership and control is currently permitted in the UK game provided that would not raise issues under the Owners\u2019 and Directors\u2019 Test. However the planned new football regulator is considering implementing rules outlawing state ownership or control of football clubs in the UK.\nManchester City have always insisted that it would be legally inaccurate to describe the club as state-owned. City are majority owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group, the private equity company which is owned by Sheikh Mansour, the vice president and deputy prime minister of the UAE. His brother is MBZ.\nView this post on Instagram\nAdding to the questions to be answered, it can also be revealed that another key figure at City, former board member Mohamed Al Mazrouei, is listed as working at the CPC as the organisation\u2019s undersecretary.\nThis role, according to the CPC, saw him \u201cdetermine the strategic direction and the internal policies of the CPC and supervise its implementation\u201d, where he \u201creported directly to the chairman (MBZ).\u201d He and Jaber Mohamed, at the time of the payments, were the two most senior employees of the CPC.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the UAE Cabinet\u2019s website, Al Mazrouei served as undersecretary of the CPC from 2009 to 2022, and is now the Minister of State for Defense. He sat on the City board from January 30 2010 until January 1 2022, just over a year before the Premier League announced they had charged City with at least 115 breaches of financial rules.\nIn the Premier League\u2019s case against Manchester City, which concluded in December, the club are accused of falsely increasing their revenue by inflating sponsorship deals with associated parties, including the deal with Etisalat, and also with hiding some costs by failing to declare some salaries and image-rights payments. They strongly deny any wrongdoing.\nA verdict is due in the coming weeks. Either side can appeal the decision, but if found guilty, the range of punishment which City could face is severe, including a points deduction which could relegate the club from the Premier League.\nManchester City did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n(Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images)"
