  "description": "Seventeen Democratic state officials urged major asset managers to prioritize long-term risks like climate change, rejecting Republican efforts to curb ESG investing.",
  "content": "Democratic state officials from New York to California sent letters to asset managers overseeing trillions of dollars in retirement funds, urging them to consider the long-term effects of factors such as climate change when making investment decisions.\n\nThe request from more than a dozen state treasurers and comptrollers calls for investment firms to reject pressure from the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers, and instead commit to thorough evaluations of risks tied to global warming, supply chains and corporate governance.\n\nThe Republicans are misrepresenting \"the true meaning of fiduciary duty\" by requiring asset managers to take \"a passive approach to oversight while ignoring the nature of long-term value creation in modern capital markets,\" according to one of the Democrats' letters sent to investment firms. \"In contrast, we believe that fiduciary duty calls for active oversight, responsible governance and the full exercise of ownership rights on behalf of the workers and retirees we serve.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump order opens 401(k)s to private assets: What advisors need to know\n\nThe coordinated Democratic campaign comes more than three years after Republican politicians initiated their attacks against environmental, social and governance investing, calling it a threat to capitalism. The GOP has launched investigations, introduced more than a dozen anti-ESG bills across the U.S. (many of which have failed) and gone as far as restricting some firms from doing business in their states.\n\n\n\nAnd now Democratic state officials are fighting back in one of their most concerted public efforts yet. They say the vision of asset management that has emerged from the GOP puts American retirement money at risk.\n\nTheir letters were sent to at least 18 fund managers, including BlackRock, State Street and T. Rowe Price. BlackRock said in a statement that its \"singular focus is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.\" A spokesperson for T. Rowe Price declined to comment and State Street hasn't responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"The stakes are incredibly high for retirees and Americans across the country who are trusting asset managers, financial officers and pension trustees to do the right thing with their retirement dollars,\" said Maryland State Comptroller Brooke Lierman in an interview.\n\nProtecting the financial interests of workers, retirees and taxpayers means exercising active oversight to hold companies and asset managers accountable for all types of investment risks, said Malia Cohen, the controller for California, the country's biggest state. \"Ignoring risks, whether related to governance, climate or supply chains, isn't neutrality, it's negligence,\" she said in an emailed statement.",

Roughly 8 in 10 fund managers said that they expect an elevated risk profile in 2025, according to a new\nFund managers surveyed said that their concerns around asset liabilities are driven by market volatility, regulation and inflation. But market conditions aren't the only cause for concern, the managers said.\nFinancial advisors say those same risks are being felt in their one-on-one planning. Nearly a third of advisors said they expect their clients' risk tolerance to decrease over the next three months, according to data from the February\nManaging client fears in an uncertain market\nWith the new Trump administration, there's a lot of uncertainty and\nOne of Nangle's clients, concerned that she was going to lose everything in the market, recently asked if she could put her money in a \"virtual mattress,\" Nangle said. Helping clients concerned about market conditions can involve making adjustments to their asset allocations, Nangle said, but the first step is always having a simple conversation.\n\"For the most part, it's [about] listening to them and then figuring out what's going to make them feel comfortable,\" Nangle said. \"Sometimes it's, you know, creating a bigger cash cushion so it eliminates that short-term worry. Most of the time, we end up\nOther advisors share Nangle's approach.\n\"Anytime I do talk with a client about their concerns with volatility or inflation, I emphasize the importance of having a structured financial plan that can account for different market conditions rather than having a need to react to short-term headlines,\" said Ben Loughery, founder of Lock Wealth Management in Atlanta.\nREAD MORE:\nAfter seeing 20%-plus returns over recent years, it's natural to anticipate a potential pullback at some point, Loughery said. \"There are always risks in the market, but history shows that staying invested for the long term has consistently rewarded investors,\" he said.\nAt this moment, a growing share of financial advisors say they're working to remind their clients of that bigger picture.\nA Main Street disconnect\nFinancial advisors are likely to hear a much different sentiment from their clients than they would on Wall Street right now. The American Association of Individual Investors'\nIn contrast, Citigroup's Levkovich index, a composite of indicators like margin debt levels and the put/call ratio, which measures investor sentiment from \"panic\" to \"euphoria,\" dipped slightly last week but remains in the euphoria zone.\nWhen clients come to Nangle with concerns about the market, she's focused on providing them one thing: peace of mind. Sometimes, as was the case for a couple of her clients during the 2020 stock market crash, achieving peace of mind means making short-term adjustments to their plans. But for most of her clients, Nangle said that maintaining comfort in an uncertain market comes down to simple cash flow.\nREAD MORE:\n\"A lot of it comes down to planning for near-term cash flow, so if we do have a downturn, we're not suddenly looking at having to sell out in a down market,\" she said. \"That's been pretty successful. Doesn't stop the market downturns, but it just creates some peace of mind.\"\nCarlos Salmon, a financial advisor at Wooster Square Advisors in New Haven, Connecticut, said he is taking a similar approach to addressing client concerns right now. Maintaining strong positive cash flow is one of the most important things people need to be doing in the current environment, Salmon said.\n\"We've had a couple of down days in the market, so I think people are going to probably have a little bit of discomfort,\" Nangle said. \"And that's where we reach out to our clients and earn our money, understanding what we need to do to make them feel comfortable.\""

      "text": "When Donald Trump first won the White House in 2016, his victory created one of the all-time best sales pitches for green-minded investment funds: If Washington wasn't going to push for a transition to cleaner energy to slow climate change, maybe capital markets could.\nNow, as Trump returns to power, the movement for environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG, is in a much weaker position after years of Republican backlash and a stretch of rough performance.\n\"ESG is a dead man walking,\" says Will Hild, who runs Consumers' Research, a nonprofit backed by Leonard Leo, leader of the rightward shift in the Supreme Court during Trump's first term.\nWhile Trump himself has barely mentioned ESG, his plan to embrace fossil fuels will inevitably undermine one of its key pillars, Hild says. He adds that the conservative attacks on climate finance groups are only going to get louder.\nTrump is operating from the same playbook he used eight years ago, but the same can't be said of the investment industry. Among his signature acts after first taking office was dragging the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. That raised the hackles of a growing group of investors who \u2014 back then \u2014 viewed Trump as an aberration in a world shifting into an ESG age.\nInvestors turned to the power of the shareholder ballot box, privately met with company executives and formed climate alliances to encourage companies to shift away from fossil fuels. The argument was that this was good business \u2014 companies that stuck with dirty energy were in danger of being beaten by greener competitors or burdened with mounting legal and regulatory costs.\nREAD MORE:\nAt the time, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink devoted large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to ESG issues such as fair wages and climate change. He equated climate and investment risk and said it was clear ESG drove corporate outperformance. In 2020, the US SIF Foundation reported that the market for ESG-related products had grown to about $17 trillion in the U.S. In short, Trump's first term had coincided with the golden age of ESG.\nREAD MORE:\nBut the end of the pandemic sparked soaring energy costs, inflation and higher interest rates. That cocktail, combined with the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, proved lethal for many of the capital-intensive green energy companies that had thrived just a few years earlier.\nWhen shares of wind and solar companies started to tank, Republican critics pounced. They cast ESG as a tool to channel money to liberal goals. Politicians keen to burnish their image in the party often do so by denouncing, banning or bringing lawsuits against Wall Street's ESG efforts.\nIn July, Jim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, joined a group demanding information from more than 130 firms about their ties to an alliance known as Climate Action 100+. Republicans called it a \"woke ESG cartel.\" That coincided with high-profile departures from the alliance, including Pacific Investment Management, as well as the asset management arms of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\nMeantime, Fink no longer refers to ESG in his annual letters. BlackRock and its biggest peers, Vanguard Group and State Street Global Advisors, have also slashed their support of environmental and social shareholder proposals after backing a record number in 2021.\nInvestors have been withdrawing money from ESG-focused funds in the U.S. for the past eight quarters, with outflows totaling roughly $26 billion since the end of 2022, according to researchers at Morningstar. In the same period, the ESG label was removed from more than 80 funds, while the pace of new product offerings has slowed dramatically.\nMeanwhile, there are signs that Europeans also may be cooling to ESG in the face of increasingly complex regulations. The region's fund managers, which account for more than 80% of global ESG assets, liquidated or merged roughly 350 ESG funds in the first nine months of this year, Morningstar reported. But in Asia, the market \u2014 though relatively small \u2014 is growing.\nTrump's second term will see the GOP's attacks on ESG take on a new intensity, according to analysts at Jefferies Financial Group. A day after the U.S. presidential election, they encouraged fund managers to have lawyers \"on speed-dial,\" as they risk being accused of everything from antitrust violations to the dereliction of their financial duty, depending on how states choose to enforce anti-ESG laws, the analysts said.\nAttorneys general in GOP-led states have launched probes of banks and fund managers. While those investigations are still underway, \"what would have real teeth would be if the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission believes there's enough meat on the bones of the antitrust theories of Republican politicians to pursue antitrust investigations,\" says Rob Skinner, litigation and enforcement partner at Ropes & Gray.\nESG was coined by United Nations staffers two decades ago as a way to analyze nonfinancial risks and opportunities. Yet it's confounded and confused people inside and outside the industry ever since. It mixes an array of concepts \u2014 from environmental protection to corporate governance matters like board election rules \u2014 that don't neatly fit together.\nREAD MORE:\nThe label has been added to funds whose biggest holdings are tech and finance stocks. Among the most popular today is Nvidia, which is held in roughly 70% more ESG funds than turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems A/S. In fact, the artificial intelligence behemoth currently sits in more than 3,600 ESG funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nCritics, meanwhile, have noted that Nvidia and other companies developing AI are rapidly depleting natural resources as the data centers they rely on guzzle power and water. In April, Morningstar estimated that Nvidia is emitting greenhouse gases at a pace that would align with global warming of 3.8 degrees Celsius, more than double the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees.\nFor that reason, Republicans aren't the only ones bashing ESG. Sustainable investing purists criticize the label's application to everything from energy-guzzling data centers to Bitcoin to fossil fuels. Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil and gas company, is held by more than 1,000 ESG funds, and Glencore, the world's biggest trader of commodities including coal, sits in just over 400 ESG funds, according to Bloomberg data. More than 550 ESG funds also hold Germany's biggest military-equipment maker, Rheinmetall, the data shows.\n\"I think for the sake of marketing expediency, the term has been overused,\" says Rob Du Boff, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\nDeregulation is one lever Republicans can use to kill ESG, according to Du Boff. The Trump administration is expected to try to block the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules for companies disclosing their emissions.\nIn other cases, new rules can create barriers to ESG. For example, Trump-appointed SEC leadership probably will clamp down on shareholder resolutions that focus on climate change and workforce diversity. The president-elect will probably also reverse a Department of Labor rule allowing pension funds to consider ESG factors when investing, like he did in his first term, Du Boff says.\nThe analyst says an industry correction may not be a bad thing, if it crystallizes the distinction between financial products that merely talk a green game and the real deal. A more precise application of ESG, he says, \"makes it harder for opponents to dismiss it as political wokeness.\"\nInvestor Chat Reynders, co-founder of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, which oversees $4 billion, says he still sees a strong case for many of the companies that stand to benefit from a shift to a low-carbon economy. There was record global investment in the energy transition last year.\n\"In reality, electrification isn't going away,\" Reynders says. \"Nor is demand for water infrastructure, and grid technology has been advancing dramatically.\"\nREAD MORE:\nThere's also a geopolitical argument that China is a powerhouse of green investment, leading the world in areas like electric vehicles and solar energy, says Nicolas Lockhart, an attorney at Sidley Austin who advises companies on ESG rules. If the U.S. checks out of the technological and manufacturing race toward a low-carbon future, China \"may well seek to play a greater leadership role,\" he says.\nLeslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, which runs about $1.3 billion of sustainability funds, plans to reach out to investors who are concerned about a second Trump term.\n\"We're trying to remind people that they can make a difference through their investments,\" she says.\n\u2014With Frances Schwartzkopff"
