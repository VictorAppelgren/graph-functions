  "description": "Nvidia's Next Big Test: Analysts Raise Targets Before August 27 Earnings",
  "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAug 21 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to draw investor attention as analysts raise their price targets ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report on August 27. The chipmaker's stock outlook remains supported by strong AI demand, its leadership position in the semiconductor market, and easing U.S. export restrictions.\n\u2022 Is NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nConsensus estimates call for earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $45.87 billion. Analysts remain confident that Nvidia will deliver another solid quarter, although expectations are high.\n\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh increased his price target on NVDA to $215 from $190 while reiterating a Buy rating. Vinh expects strong July-quarter results but noted guidance for the October quarter could be more cautious, as forecasts likely exclude China sales pending license approvals. If those sales are included, Nvidia could generate an additional $2 billion to $3 billion from its H20 and RTX6000D chips.\n\nSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland also lifted his target, moving to $210 from $180 with a Buy rating. Rolland cited the strength of Nvidia's data center segment and highlighted the upcoming GB300 product line as a catalyst for double-digit revenue growth, supported by higher selling prices and expanding margins.",

      "text": "Reverse DCF Model\nFinancial Strength & Profitability - Competitive Comparison\nGuruFocus DCF Calculator FAQs\nWhat is DCF modeling?\nIn a discounted cash flow model, the future cash flows are first estimated based on a cash flow growth rate and a discount rate and then, discounted to its current value at the discount rate. All of the discounted future cash flow is added together to get the current intrinsic value of the company.\nUsually, a two-stage model is used when calculating a stock's intrinsic value using a discounted cash flow model. The first stage is called the growth stage; the second is called the terminal stage. In the growth stage the company grows at a faster rate. Because it cannot grow at that rate forever, a lower rate is used for the terminal stage.\nGuruFocus DCF calculator is actually a Discounted Earnings calculator, the Earnings Per Share without NRI is used as the default. The reason we are doing this is we found that historically stock prices are more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWhat are DCF models used for?\nCompared with the valuation ratios such as P/E, P/S, P/B etc, DCF model is able to include both balance sheet value, future business earnings and earning growth. The factors that affect the value of business in the DCF model are: book value, current free cash flow, business growth rate, and terminal value.\nJust as pointed by Joe Ponzio, it only makes sense to calculate the intrinsic value for the companies that have predictable earnings. We will apply this to predictable companies only.\nHow do you calculate DCF?\nThe intrinsic value of a business can be calculated with this equation:\nIntrinsic Value = Future Earnings at Growth Stage + Terminal Value\n= E(0) * x * (1 - xn) / (1 - x) + E(0) * xn * y * (1 - ym) / (1 - y)\nwhere x = (1 + g1) / (1 + d), and y = (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\nParameters:\nE(0) \u2013 current earnings : GuruFocus default to use EPS without NRI as the input. You can switch to FCF and see the intrinsic value based on Free Cash Flow per Share.\nd \u2013 discount rate : A reasonable discount rate assumption should be at least the long term average return of the stock market, which can be estimated from risk free rate plus risk premium of stock market. We used the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate as the risk free rate and rounded up to the nearest integer, then added a risk premium of 6% to get the estimated discount rate. Some investors use their expected rate of return, which is also reasonable. A typical discount rate can be anywhere between 6% - 20%.\ng1 \u2013 growth rate at growth stage : Growth Rate in the growth stage = average earning / free cash flow growth rate in the past 10 years. If it is higher than 20%, GuruFocus uses 20%. If it is less than 5%, GuruFocus uses 5% instead.\ng2 \u2013 growth rate at terminal stage : Default to use 4%. After the growth stage, it is more reasonable to set the terminal growth rate at the inflation rate. The terminal growth rate must be smaller than the discount rate to make the calculation converge.\nn \u2013 number of years at the growth stage : Default to use 10 years.\nm \u2013 number of years at the terminal stage : Default to use 10 years.\nWhich cash flow is used in DCF?\nGuruFocus\u2019 research has found that GAAP earnings per share produces a stronger correlation between intrinsic value and margin of safety than free cash flow does. Thus, GuruFocus\u2019 DCF Calculator uses earnings per share by default although users can switch the calculation to free cash flow or dividends or use a customized base-year value.\nHow long do you project a DCF?\nMost DCF models use either five or 10 years of cash flow estimates. By default, GuruFocus projects the cash flows using two 10-year periods: a growth stage at the 10-year earnings growth rate followed by a terminal stage using 4% growth over 10 years. GuruFocus sets two growth factors: x for the growth stage and y for the terminal stage. x = (1 + growth rate at growth state) / (1 + discount rate) while y = (1 + growth rate at terminal stage) / (1 + discount rate).\nWhat is the growth-stage growth rate?\nA reasonable growth-stage growth rate is the average earnings or free cash flow growth rate over the past 10 years. However, since we do not know how the business will grow in the future, there is a big assumption in the DCF model for the future business growth rate. This is why business predictability is important. It only makes sense to apply DCF models if the business has been growing consistently. Only for consistently growing business, it is more reasonable to assume it will be growing in the same manner for the coming years.\nFurther, to account for abnormal growth situations, including fast growers and stocks that do not have enough data to compute a growth rate, GuruFocus caps the growth-stage growth rate between 5% and 20%.\nWhat is a good terminal growth rate?\nObviously no business can grow forever. At some point the growth will slow down. But the business still has its value as long as it is still generating cash for its owners. Further, while the contribution from each of the far future years is small, they do add up.\nGuruFocus has set a default of 10 to the number of years that the company will grow at the terminal growth rate. After the terminal growth years the contribution will be cut to 0.\nTerminal value = E(0) * xn * y * (1 - ym) / (1 - y), where y = (1 + g2) / (1 + d), where m is the years of terminal growth; g2 is the terminal growth rate.\nTerminal growth rate also affects the result of the DCF model. It is more reasonable to assume terminal rate at around long term inflation rate or less. To make the above equation converge, it is important to assume that the terminal rate is smaller than the discount rate.\nWhat is a discount rate in DCF?\nDiscount rate is another big assumption that can severely affect the value obtained from the DCF model. A reasonable discount rate assumption should be at least the long term average return of the stock market, which is about 11%, because investors can always invest passively in an index fund and get an average return. Some investors use their expected rate of return, which is also reasonable. A typical discount rate can be anywhere between 10% - 20%.\nGuruFocus takes the 10-year Treasury constant maturity rate, rounds it up to the nearest whole integer, and then adds a 6% equity risk premium.\nWhat is free cash flow?\nFree Cash Flow is very close to Warren Buffett's definition of Owner's Earnings, except that in Warren Buffett's Owner's Earnings, the spending for Property, Plant, and Equipment is only for maintenance (replacement), while in the Free Cash Flow calculation, the cost of new Property, Plant, and Equipment due to business expansion is also deducted. There, Free Cash Flow is more conservative than Owner's Earnings.\nIn Don Yacktman's calculation of forward rate of return, he uses Free Cash Flow for the calculation. Yacktman explained the forward rate of return concept in detail in his interview with GuruFocus. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation.\nWhat is tangible book value?\nWhen you buy a company\u2019s stock, you become a fractional owner of the business. If the company is liquidated after you buy, you are entitled to what the company owns net of its debt. This part is called shareholder\u2019s equity.\nShareholder\u2019s equity is certainly a part of business value. However, shareholder\u2019s equity may overestimate or underestimate its real value. The recent accounting rule of mark-to-market may change this, but we all know that the market is not always efficient. (That is why we are here investing as value investors.) The book value of stocks may still deviate its underlying values.\nSeveral companies have an item called goodwill, which may come from the past acquisitions of the company. This part may not be worth anything at the time of liquidation. Therefore, we use tangible book value rather than standard book value for the book value calculation.\nGuruFocus\u2019 DCF Calculator allows you to add tangible book value to the fair value calculation. Also, if you want to add a perpetuity terminal value to fair value, you can do so using this cell.\nHow do you value a company using DCF?\nGuruFocus users can quickly calculate the DCF using the DCF Calculator. Simply enter a stock ticker in the \u201cTicker\u201d cell and the parameters will be filled with the default values. Users can also change the parameters and save DCF parameter templates by clicking on the \u201cSave Parameters\u201d button.\nHow do I get DCF value in Excel?\nYou can also download the GURUF DCF Calculator template for both Excel Add-in and Google Sheets and then use the following functions.\n=GURUF(\"AAPL\",\"Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\")\n=GURUF(\"AAPL\",\"Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based)\")\nWhen should you not use DCF?\nGuruFocus does not record in the database DCF intrinsic value for stocks with unpredictable revenue or earnings (business predictability rank of one-star or unranked). Since the model projects future growth, it is assumed that the company will grow at the same rate as it did over the past 10 years. Therefore, the model works better for companies that have consistent earnings performance."
