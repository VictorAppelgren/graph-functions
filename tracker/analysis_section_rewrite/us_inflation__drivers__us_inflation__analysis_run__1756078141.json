      "feedback": "The draft shows a solid cross‑topic scaffold (policy regime, AI/data‑center capex, inflation/rates, and equity implications) and puts concrete numbers behind several links (e.g., Nvidia AI momentum; Ford EV‑cycle margins; 2025 revenue/GM for ACMR), but it needs a tighter, first‑principles causal chain, sharper regime definitions, and explicit, source‑anchored watch signals to reach world‑class quality. Actionable edits: 1) sharpen the causal chain from policy tariffs/reciprocity to reshoring/semis AI/data‑center capex, to productivity gains and supply‑side inflation, to real rates and discount rates, to risk premia and equity valuations; explicitly map each link to a cited source (avoid leaps). 2) unify regime framing: replace scattered “Regime I/Regime A/B/C” terminology with a single, clearly defined regime map (trigger definitions, thresholds, and invalidation rules) and annotate what constitutes a regime transition (e.g., wage growth momentum, inflation persistence, Jackson Hole commentary, semiconductor capex cadence). 3) align with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a concise, single synthesis: synthesize macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals into one coherent narrative, showing how Nvidia/L2 AI momentum transmits into capex and PV gains; remove any duplicative or divergent strands. 4) strengthen first‑principles grounding for fundamentals: anchor long‑horizon anchors (ACMR, Ford margins, EV transition, oil paths) to underlying drivers (productivity uplift, unit economics, real rate trajectories) with explicit, sourced sensitivities. 5) quantification discipline: present all numbers as ranges or scenario bands with confidence weights (e.g., oil regime probabilities 50/30/20; core CPI 0.30–0.40% MoM; 12–24 month transition window), and state the implied impact on valuations or discount rates under each scenario; where single figures appear, convert to ranges or attach a sensitivity. 6) citations and consistency: tie every factual claim to one or more of the IDs (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, 22PL3Q360, Y6SQOEK69, R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2); remove orphan tokens like 15/9 as stand‑alone citations or integrate them into explicit references; reconcile any cross‑source conflicts by presenting a transparent consensus range. 7) watch‑list and deciders: deliver a compact, decisive signal list with timing (12–24 months), clear thresholds (e.g., wage growth pace, capex cadence, Jackson Hole hints, tariff‑policy updates, energy path shifts), and a short invalidation rubric (e.g., unexpectedly strong disinflation or AI demand surprise). 8) consistency and polish: standardize regime naming (A/B/C vs A/B/C) across the piece, tighten prose to reduce redundancy, and ensure numerics (e.g., margins, ROIC, revenue paths) clearly map to the cited source blocks.",
