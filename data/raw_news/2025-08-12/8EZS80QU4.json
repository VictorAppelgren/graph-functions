  "title": "James Trafford\u2019s route back to Manchester City: \u2018Rhino skin\u2019, tough loans, and England No 1 expectations",
  "description": "James Trafford has returned to Manchester City this summer \u2014 this is how he developed away from the club",
  "content": "Bolton were deprived of the traditionally packed festive schedule by an outbreak of Covid-19 and only played twice in December 2021. By mid-January, they found themselves languishing just five points above the League One relegation zone.\n\nSporting director Chris Markham thought he had a belated gift for Bolton\u2019s wearied support in the form of 19-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper James Trafford.\n\nThree and a half years later, after completing a \u00a327million ($36.3m) move to Manchester City, Trafford is a European Under-21 Championship winner and the second most expensive English goalkeeper in history.\n\nAt the time, however, his arrival was received with a wave of negativity on social media. Many fans saw a scrawny 19-year-old who had been dropped as No 1 by a smaller club in the same league. They were only too keen to provide video evidence of their concern.\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the signing, the fans absolutely slaughtered him,\u201d Markham tells The Athletic. \u201c\u2018Why are we taking some kid who couldn\u2019t get a game for Accrington Stanley?\u2019.\u201d\n\nOver the next 18 months \u2014 his loan was renewed in summer 2022 \u2014 Trafford proved exactly why. He helped Bolton lift the EFL Trophy and reach the League One play-offs, redirecting his career onto a trajectory headed for the very top.\n\nRedemption has been a key element in powering his road back to Manchester City via Accrington, Bolton and Burnley over the past four years.\n\nThose who have witnessed his journey credit his \u201crhino skin\u201d as the key ingredient.\n\nHe defied those who sullied his name at Accrington. He recovered from a bruising first experience of the Premier League with Burnley to be part of a record-breaking defence last season that conceded just 16 goals in 46 games en route back to the top division of English football.\n\nHis next challenge is to prove to the doubters that he is ready to be the No 1 at Manchester City, the club he joined as a 12-year-old Cumbrian kid, exited as an ambitious teenager, and returns now as a refined 22-year-old who believes he can take the gloves from Ederson.\n\nIf it is what lies between the ears that has set Trafford apart, his upbringing in the small village of Greysouthen on the outskirts of Cumbria has played a central role in shaping it.\n\nHailing from a family of farmers, football was not a family passion. Driving his dad\u2019s tractor coloured much of his childhood, but his enthusiasm for the game saw him play locally as a midfielder.\n\nIt was only when he discovered he was better with his hands at the age of nine that he was given a place at Carlisle United\u2019s academy. Trafford\u2019s shot-stopping impressed Carlisle\u2019s goalkeeper coach Ben Benson so much that he flagged his potential to Trevor Todd, who was head of City\u2019s junior academy.\n\nCity visited the farm and convinced the family that they were the best place for his development. A compensation deal was agreed with Carlisle for the 12-year-old.\n\nAfter five years in the system, Trafford thought a surprise breakthrough may have come in 2020 when he was a 17-year-old involved in a fun post-training penalty shootout. He told The Sun: \u201cPep was taking a penalty and he said, \u2018You can have anything you want if you save it\u2019.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Can I start on the weekend?\u2019. He was laughing, but I saved it! I didn\u2019t start, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nIt was a boldness that captured Trafford\u2019s outgoing personality. Now he has his chance to truly stake his claim.\n\nIt is expected that Trafford will compete with Ederson for the No 1 jersey this season. City are open to selling Stefan Ortega, who has made 42 appearances over the past two seasons.\n\nEderson has played a major role in City\u2019s domestic dominance since joining from Benfica in 2017, but the Brazilian has not been flawless in recent years and is in the final year of his deal.\n\nTrafford has already struck up a strong relationship with Marcus Bettinelli, who was signed from Chelsea this summer to provide cover and drive standards in training.\n\nFirst-team goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor, who joined alongside Manuel Pellegrini in 2013, is afforded a great deal of power by Pep Guardiola when it comes to recruitment.\n\nAccording to sources with knowledge of the deals, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, Mancisidor was the main contact in the deal for Bettinelli joining. Mancisidor played a part in the decision to re-sign Trafford for a net fee of \u00a314million, having originally been sold to Burnley for \u00a313m.\n\nThe influence of Mancisidor \u2014 who worked with Iker Casillas at Real Madrid and Claudio Bravo at Real Sociedad before helping bring the latter to City \u2014 has been felt throughout the academy and played a part in how Trafford was developed, according to City sources, who were again kept anonymous to protect relationships.\n\nThose sources said Mancisidor helped create a goalkeeping department that runs throughout the club, from academy to first team, and helps shape how they are taught. Experienced goalkeeper coaches were said to be amazed by the intricate detail of his coaching, forcing them to reconsider established norms and view the separate aspects of goalkeeping as being interconnected.\n\nHe is described as \u201cmicroscopic\u201d in the depth he goes into, refusing to accept copy-and-paste \u2018YouTube sessions\u2019. His background is in sports science, so body mechanics are important to him.\n\nTrafford was blessed with athleticism from a young age.\n\nThose sources who witnessed his rise through the ranks note how, even as he stretched to 6ft 6in (198cm), he did not look lanky at any stage of his development. He grew at a gradual rate, which meant his coordination and movement were pleasing on the eye.\n\n\u201cLike a lot of players coming through the City academy, they have lots of potential and you always think \u2018Could he?\u2019,\u201d says Bolton sporting director Fergal Harkin, who was loans and pathway manager at City.\n\n\u201cJames was always one you thought, \u2018Yes, he could\u2019. We always had a philosophy of young players going to play as early as possible. By 19, we wanted them playing senior football.\u201d\n\nGavin Bazunu was signed in 2018 from Shamrock Rovers, which, as a fellow 16-year-old at the time, put Trafford in direct competition as they sought to make their name on loan.\n\nWhile Bazunu went to Rochdale at 18 and Portsmouth at 19 on loan before being sold to Southampton in 2022 for \u00a312million, Trafford headed to League One Accrington Stanley at the age of 19.\n\nTheir manager, John Coleman, had a connection to Trafford through his agent, David Eyres, who was a team-mate at Southport in 1987-88. \u201cOn day one, I knew James would be good enough when we went into 11 v 11 and I saw his handling and kicking,\u201d he tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cIt sounds strange as he miscontrolled the ball in his first session and gave a goal away, but you could tell straight away it didn\u2019t bother him. He didn\u2019t go into his shell. He actually came out even more. That impressed me straight away, so I had no qualms about playing him.\u201d\n\nColeman found no pretentiousness in Trafford, and he was not perturbed by the drop in facilities compared to the Etihad Campus. Indeed, he even used the City perk of membership at Mere Golf Resort in Cheshire to treat his team-mates to rounds throughout the season.\n\nOn the pitch, things became tricky. Trafford started nine of the first 10 League One fixtures, but Accrington started shipping goals, conceding 12 in three games against Wigan, Morecambe and Oxford United. Coleman replaced him with Toby Savin, who kept the shirt for 11 of the next 13 games.\n\n\u201cJames had a knock and that unsettled him a little, but there were no incidents where you would say he cost us the game,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t brought out for the fact we had conceded so many goals, as it was a team issue, but I thought it was time to put Toby in, who was also trying to make his way, and he was our \u2019keeper.\n\n\u201cThey both ticked a lot of boxes: big size, could come for crosses, and were good with their feet. We tried to play a passing style, so James\u2019 ability to do that certainly helped, but when you are in the lower leagues, it is possibly better to be able to play it long at times.\u201d\n\nSavin had interest from the Premier League last year, but a deal fell through. At the time, Coleman did not know which goalkeeper would make it to a higher level. Trafford\u2019s place on the bench piqued the interest of Bolton\u2019s sporting director, Chris Markham.\n\nBolton\u2019s first choice, Joel Dixon, was suffering a crisis of confidence, and they were on the lookout for another option in January. Markham\u2019s time at the Football Association, where he was involved in creating the data and processes behind squad selections, meant he was familiar with Trafford.\n\nHe put his scouts to work, requesting rapid reports on his time at Accrington and in the England youth ranks, as well as doing a major analysis of his distribution to determine whether he was compatible with manager Ian Evatt\u2019s passing style, which had been coined \u2018Barrowcelona\u2019 at his previous club.\n\nThe reports were positive, but Markham has a master\u2019s degree in sports psychology, which meant his main concern was not over his ability, but how a potentially damaging first loan spell could affect him mentally. He spoke to a range of his former coaches, including his former colleague Tim Dittmer, then head of goalkeeping at the Football Association and now head of coaching.\n\n\u201cEveryone we spoke to said that the mental side was just not going to be a problem for this kid,\u201d Markham tells The Athletic. \u201cTim said it was a no-brainer; we had to do it, as he just has this aura about him that means he will keep making big saves. Tim said he is going to be the next No 1 for England \u2014 he doesn\u2019t say things like that for the sake of it.\u201d\n\nTrafford\u2019s first game for Bolton came at home to Ipswich Town, where he had to cope with a less-than-effusive reception to his signing. When his first pass into midfield went straight to the opposition, the groans screamed \u2018told you so\u2019.\n\n\u201cOther goalies I know would have gone under,\u201d says Markham. \u201cNot him. He got bigger and bigger, better and better, and the fans started to see more of that confidence and personality. It became impossible not to root for him.\u201d\n\nBy the 70th minute, the home fans were chanting \u2018England\u2019s No 1\u2019. Trafford thrived at Bolton, and at the end of the season, Harkin decided it was best for him to remain there for another season to avoid too much disruption.\n\nIt was felt that Trafford had to improve his longer kicking and the speed of his decision-making, but he continuously improved and was crucial to Bolton winning the EFL Trophy in 2022-23, making a super reflex stop when 2-0 up to help secure the victory.\n\nThe semi-final saw him return to Accrington and, if the aim was to show them what they were missing, then he certainly did that. Just not in the way he intended.\n\nHe sprinted out from his goal in a desperate attempt to get to a through ball before Seamus Conneely. \u201cHe flattened him. Broke his jaw and his cheekbone,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cHe should have been sent off, but the ref only gave a foul just outside the box. The fans gave him some banter, but there was nothing malicious.\u201d\n\nWhile unfortunate in nature, Markham saw Trafford\u2019s decision to steam into the challenge as indicative of his mentality.\n\n\u201cIt was a dangerous tackle, but it was him. Full of commitment, full of charisma,\u201d he says. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait for that game as he knew they would be giving it to him. He loved that the fans were hating him and was so brazen that he was shushing the away fans.\u201d\n\nUsually, it was Trafford\u2019s mates from his hometown in Cumbria making the noise. The club reserved 10 tickets for him at every away ground, such was their dedication to following their friend.\n\nIt was indicative of how grounded he is and how different his social circle is from some footballers, choosing to go back to his dad\u2019s farm in the summer. \u201cYou know Traff was meant to be a farmer or a goalkeeper when you meet him and his handshake nearly crushes your hand,\u201d says Markham.\n\nTrafford\u2019s performances at Bolton, combined with a starring role in England Under-21s\u2019 triumph in the summer of 2023, saw newly promoted Burnley part with \u00a313million to add him to Vincent Kompany\u2019s side.\n\nThey amassed 101 points in the Championship, with fellow ex-City goalkeeper Arijanet Muric being named in the team of the year, but they believed Trafford would elevate the team.\n\n\u201cFor a young lad, he was very comfortable coming into a new team and mixing straight away,\u201d says his former Burnley team-mate Jay Rodriguez. \u201cIt was really refreshing, as even as an older pro, you are always a little cautious, but everyone loves Traff. He wore his heart on his sleeve and you knew everything about him.\n\n\u201cI remember one game he turned up with this landscaping boonie hat on. It was a big game, too. We were asking what it was and he just said, \u2018It\u2019s my mate\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u2019.\u201d\n\nNonchalant off the field, but on it, he faced a baptism of fire. His first game came against his former club, City, a respectable 3-0 defeat, but one that signalled the hail of shots about to rain down on his goal for the next 10 months.\n\nBurnley were relegated with just 24 points, and Trafford made several high-profile errors, including a stray pass against Crystal Palace that saw Josh Brownhill receive a red card as he prevented a goalscoring opportunity.\n\nThose were the risks of Kompany\u2019s playing style. Rodriguez, 14 years Trafford\u2019s senior, saw a young man completely unfazed by the pressure or scrutiny, even when he lost his place in the team. He did not play a Premier League game after March 10 that season.\n\nWhen Kompany moved to Bayern Munich last summer, Trafford\u2019s stock had taken a hit.\n\nScott Parker\u2019s arrival saw the group form an even tighter bond, and Trafford was reinstalled as a crucial part of the team. Burnley set a new record for the fewest goals conceded in English Football League history, but early in the new year, Trafford played a pivotal part in the automatic promotion race by making two penalty saves against rivals Sunderland.\n\n\u201cHe stayed so calm. I was on the bench and I remember saying to one of the lads, \u2018He is going to save this second one, too\u2019,\u201d says Rodriguez.\n\n\u201cYou believed it because he is just so confident in himself, and he is massive. I never realised it, as he is quite unassuming, but then you get next to him. He has complemented that with the gym to become a top athlete.\n\n\u201cYou have to hit corners with your finishes and be so precise against him because he is so athletic and agile that he saves things you have already turned away from thinking it was already in.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have someone like him in goals, they win you games. There were so many games where he kept us in it early with a big save, where you think how on earth has he got to that, and then we have gone on to win the game.\u201d\n\nTrafford is still only 22 and will still have to earn his spot as the No 1, but Markham believes he possesses the psychology required.\n\n\u201cThe thing about goalies is you need to have the mentality. You need rhino skin, and that is what he has got,\u201d says Markham. \u201cFrom the perspective of a goalkeeper, it is almost the perfect mix: the willingness to put the graft in, but the steeliness that if I make a mistake, it will only be one.\n\n\u201cHe has a \u2018watch this\u2019 type of mentality. It is why I am sure he will be the No 1 for City and England, however long that takes.\u201d",

Despite being dropped as No 1 at Accrington Stanley, Trafford managed to secure a \u00a327m ($36.3m) move to Manchester City three and a half years later. He is now expected to compete with Ederson as the No 1 for the upcoming season. Trafford's success has been attributed to his \u2018rhino skin\u2019 and a strong relationship with first-team goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancancancier.
