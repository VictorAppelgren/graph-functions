  "title": "Discover Hotel Don Pepe: Marbella\u2019s Iconic Luxury Retreat",
  "description": "Cradled by Marbella\u2019s Golden Mile and framed by tropical gardens and RedLevel luxury\u2014Hotel Don Pepe Gran Meli\u00e1 is the ultimate Andalusian escape.",
  "content": "et along the lazy curve of Marbella\u2019s Golden Mile, where the Mediterranean glimmers like sapphire and orange blossom drifts on the breeze\u2014Hotel Don Pepe Gran Meli\u00e1 is a sanctuary of coastal allure. Since its debut in 1964, this legendary retreat has been the discreet playground of European royalty and Hollywood stars (including Audrey Hepburn). Today? It\u2019s a masterclass in seaside sophistication\u2014where tropical gardens tumble toward the shore, marble terraces catch the afternoon light, and every moment feels drenched in gold. Whether you\u2019re sipping vermouth beneath a canopy of palms, floating in a pool framed by hibiscus blooms, or watching as the horizon melts from your private balcony\u2014Don Pepe invites you to surrender to the rhythm of southern Spain, one golden hour at a time.\n\nMarbella\u2019s \u2018Golden Mile\u2019 exudes quiet grandeur\u2014where saffron-streaked mountains meet the shimmering Mediterranean in a slow, cinematic embrace. Along this storied stretch, pine-shaded gardens drift toward a palm-lined promenade\u2014with golden sands just beyond. Meanwhile, cyclists glide past boutique galleries and beach caf\u00e9s, as locals linger over cortados beneath jacaranda trees. A short stroll inland reveals the old town\u2019s whitewashed alleys\u2014where bougainvillea spills from wrought-iron balconies and flamenco hums from hidden courtyards. To the west, Puerto Ban\u00fas gleams with superyachts and designer boutiques\u2014just minutes away by car or bike. Behind it all, the Sierra Blanca mountains rise dramatically, and further afield\u2014the road winds toward M\u00e1laga\u2019s Moorish grandeur and the cliffside charm of Ronda.\n\nHotel Don Pepe is a portrait of Mediterranean glamour. Its glass-boxed lobby sets the tone: think gleaming marble floors, mirrored cabinets, and curated artworks that echo Andalusia\u2019s rich cultural heritage. Step outside\u2014and the estate unfolds like a tropical reverie. A centuries-old oak tree anchors the garden\u2014its gnarled limbs casting dappled shadows across plush sunloungers\u2014while winding paths lead through whispering bamboo and bird-of-paradise blooms. Its grounds stretch all the way down to the seafront, framed by umbrella pines and swaying palms\u2014while two circular pools shimmer beneath the sun, encircled by Bali beds. Every inch of Don Pepe feels intentional, yet effortless\u2014from the clean lines of poolside cabanas to its vintage cocktail bar\u2014fusing Andalusian warmth with cosmopolitan flair.\n\nWith 194 rooms and suites, Don Pepe captures Marbella\u2019s natural beauty in cinematic detail. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors open to private balconies where the sea unfurls to the horizon and mountains anchor the skyline. Meanwhile, interiors are serene, yet striking\u2014think chalk-white walls, honeyed oak floors, and gold-trim mirrors\u2014while fresh-cut lilies and curated artwork add a loving touch. Its RedLevel suites are luminous sanctuaries with panoramic views, pillow menus, and discreet butler service. Here, marble bathrooms feature rainfall showers and deep soaking tubs; and living areas are made for lingering with a glass of Rioja and the glow of sunset. It\u2019s crowning glory? The Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Suite: 300 square meters of pure indulgence: picture a designer terrace with hydromassage tub, Bali bed, and golden putting green, plus a piano lounge and walk-in closet\u2014all wrapped in champagne elegance.\n\nDining at Don Pepe is a tribute to Andalusian flavors. ERRE & Urrechu, the hotel\u2019s signature steakhouse\u2014led by renowned Basque chef I\u00f1igo Urrechu\u2014offers flame-grilled chuletones and fresh seafood paired with bold Spanish Riojas in a chic, fire-lit setting. Meanwhile, Tahini Sushi Bar & Restaurant presents a sleek, minimalist retreat with sweeping ocean views and fine Japanese bites: picture toro sashimi, miso black cod, and fine sake pairings. Bardot Pool Club, however, is its sun-drenched terrace where Mediterranean tapas, chilled sangria, and gourmet burgers are served poolside\u2014and Caf\u00e9 Cappuccino, perched along the promenade, is ideal for breakfast with a view\u2014grazing on fresh pastries, fruit platters, and cappuccinos enjoyed as the waves roll in. Evenings begin at the Lobby Bar, where mixologists stir up cocktails with Andalusian flair\u2014think rosemary-infused gin and tonics, sherry-laced Negronis, and sangria kissed with citrus and spice. Then, later, as twilight deepens\u2014the rooftop Sky Lounge beckons with panoramic vistas and live flamenco rhythms\u2014where guests toast under the stars with cava.\n\nWellness at Don Pepe is seamlessly woven into the soul of the estate\u2014from beachside yoga to garden meditations. Its TACHA spa, however, is a sensory utopia\u2014where treatments blend botanical science with Mediterranean rituals. Indulge in aromatherapy massages with Andalusian oils, anti-aging facials, or couples\u2019 rituals in candlelit treatment rooms. Meanwhile, the spa also boasts a Turkish bath, heated indoor pool, and sauna\u2014while the 24-hour fitness center features cutting-edge gear (think Technogym cardio stations and resistance machines) and personal trainers on-hand. Outdoors, the main pool becomes a lively gathering place\u2014chilled cava delivered right to your sunbed and live acoustic music drifting through the breeze\u2014while the estate also features pristine tennis and padel courts: ideal for a sunlit rally or a spirited doubles match. Best spot? Head for the adults-only pool\u2014framed by cypress trees and birdsong: a serene retreat for reading, napping, or simply being.\n\nHow To Do It\n\nEntry-level rooms at Hotel Don Pepe start from $420 per night during the low season (November and January), rising to $1,165 in August at the height of summer.

      "text": "Cradled in the English Channel, Guernsey rises like the lost city of Atlantis\u2014a storybook island and self-governing British Crown dependency, with a rich tapestry of ancient history and wild beauty\u2014far beyond the tourist poster of sunny cream teas. Here, granite cliffs plunge into turquoise waters, and flower-filled lanes wind past medieval towers and hidden smugglers\u2019 coves\u2014inspiring world-famous painters like Renoir\u2014while French flair blends effortlessly with British charm. As the second-largest of the Channel Islands, the island is quieter than its neighbor, Jersey, but still offers a surprising mix of sun-drenched beaches, secret gardens, eye-boggling history (from German bunkers to ancient castles), lively bars, adventure sports\u2014like coasteering and rock climbing\u2014and a myriad of fabulous seafood restaurants. So whether exploring the cobbled lanes of its capital, St Peter Port (one of Europe\u2019s prettiest harbor towns), or venturing further afield to car-free Sark\u2014here is our expert guide to gorgeous Guernsey.\nBest Hotels In Guernsey\nThe Old Government House\nAs Guernsey\u2019s only five-star hotel, the grand Victorian Old Government House sits in the bustling heart of St Peter Port, just a 5-minute stroll from the scenic quayside. A proud member of the highly-acclaimed Red Carnation Hotel Collection, it traces its roots to the 1700s, once owned by Guernsey\u2019s most revered Lieutenant Governor, Sir John Doyle. Today, it serves as a chic capital mansion with pumpkin marble pillars, Venetian chandeliers, stately drawing rooms, old-grandeur suites, a fabulous \u2018Aladdin\u2019s cave\u2019 spa, and exquisite restaurants from its apple candy-striped Brassiere to its dark, sexy Curry Room.\nRead More:\nBest Restaurants In Guernsey\nThe Hook\nNestled along the promenade of St Peter Port, The Hook serves a flame-kissed, no-fuss menu, cooked over coals. Begin with smoky oysters and grilled flatbread, before grazing on small plates of crispy chicken thighs, scallops, and tender lamb belly. Communal feasting is encouraged, sharing large plates of whole bream, pork chop, and succulent beef sirloin on the bone\u2014complete with Basque cheesecake, chocolate ganache, or its daring \u2018beer ice cream\u2019. Pair it with tickling cocktails like The Botanist (made with St. Germain elderflower liquor, Aperol, and martini vibrante) and plum-laced Murasakis.\nPuffin and Oyster\nHidden in the snug harbor of Le Grand Havre on the rocky cove of Rousse\u2014with little bobbing fishing boats and a small sloping sandy beach\u2014the Puffin and Oyster is one of Guernsey\u2019s finest gastropubs, nestled between two ancient artillery towers, Chouet and Rousse tower, which defended the coastline in the late 18th century. Cozy and homely, you can snuggle up and pick at plates of hand-dived Guernsey scallops and crispy calamari\u2014before feasting on juicy burgers and thick cuts of dry-aged 10oz ribeye with a cool pint of Liberation Ale (brewed at nearby Jersey).\nRead More:\nBest Things To Do In Guernsey\nHauteville House\nPerched on the heights of St Peter Port, Hauteville House was Victor Hugo\u2019s residence for 15 years during his exile in Guernsey, in 1855\u2014where he penned many of his masterpieces, from Les Mis\u00e9rables to the Toilers of the Sea, from his glass \u201cLook-Out\u201d conservatory, with commanding views of the 800-year-old Castle Cornet. Each of the five floors unfurls like a chapter\u2014sumptuous and eccentric, meandering from Gothic to Renaissance and Baroque interiors\u2014with a myriad of Chinese tapestries, Turkish rugs, swathes of red silks, ceramics, and ornately carved fireplaces (tickets from $15 per person).\nSark\nBobbing along the English Channel on a 45-minute ferry from St Peter Port (return tickets from $38 with Isle of Sark Shipping), you\u2019ll reach Sark\u2014a serene utopia, known as the \u2018crowning jewel of the Channel Islands,\u2019 with a distinctly French feel. As a car-free island, you\u2019ll travel by horse-drawn carriage\u2014clip-clopping down narrow wild lanes flanked by ancient bluebell woods and primrose-blanketed headlands\u2014while discovering Sark\u2019s centuries-old history. The island was settled in 1565 by Helier DeCarteret, who was granted a charter by Queen Elizabeth I to colonize and defend it against pirates. With forty men at his side, Helier became the island\u2019s first Seigneur and feudal ruler (Sark was the last feudal state in Europe until 2008) and helped cultivate the local Patois language, Sercquaise, still visible in almost all of the island\u2019s house, street, and landmark names today.\nCross the windswept isthmus of La Coupee\u2014an organic bridge connecting Big and Little Sark\u2014or visit Sark\u2019s postcard-perfect jewels like The Mill, L\u2019Eperquerie (once used by the Monks on Sark to dry conger eels), St. Peter\u2019s Church, and the elegant La Seigneurie House and Gardens (tickets from $16), considered one of the finest in the Channel Islands. Dating back to 1675, it was previously home to two of Sark\u2019s Seigneurial families\u2014the Le Pelleys and the Collings\u2014but today, you can wander its walled garden filled with creamy blossoms, giant rhododendrons, an amphitheater, vinery, and a pretty vegetable garden. Round off your day with a bite at its restaurant, Hathaway\u2019s\u2014serving warm baked camembert and succulent lobsters pulled fresh from Sark\u2019s waters.\nRead More:\nSauzmarez Manor\nDating back to the late 12th century, Sauzmarez Manor is Guernsey\u2019s grandest stately home\u2014under an 800-year-old occupancy of the Seigneurs de Sausmarez, a family of sailors, Colonial governors, inventors, artists, high court judges, clergymen, diplomats, and more. Join one of its house tours (tickets from $13 per person) as you gawp at mesmerizing tapestries, a wall of Seigneurs de Sausmarez family portraits, and the sofa the Queen Mother sat on during her royal visit in 1963. Outside, you\u2019ll find its Wild Subtropical Garden, an ancient woodland with narrow paths winding through towering palm trees, 200 varieties of camellia, Bromeliads, Ginger Lilies, and around 40 different bamboos. There\u2019s even a 9-hole pitch and putt course, a coffee museum, and the only working coppersmith in the Channel Islands. In the summer, it hosts Guernsey\u2019s longest-running outdoor farmer\u2019s market\u2014meanwhile, at night, join its famous ghost tours.\nMoulin Huet Bay\nHidden beneath dramatic cliffs, Moulin Huet Bay is a secluded cove sitting in the depths of Saint Martins, where turquoise waters cling to its craggy fa\u00e7ade. Follow the self-guided \u2018Renoir Walk\u2019\u2014a trail that reveals why legendary impressionist painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, fell in love with this hidden gem\u2014inspiring 15 of his famed paintings after his visit in 1883 (one of which hangs in London\u2019s National Gallery). You\u2019ll pass five marked viewpoints, each framed to mirror the artist\u2019s perspective (with a QR code on each frame to access an audio guide narrated by an art historian), before retreating to the charming Renoir Tea Garden\u2014renowned for its homemade cakes, crab sandwiches, and slices of authentic Guernsey g\u00e2che.\nHow To Do It\nResidents and travelers in London can hop on a speedy 70-minute direct flight from London Gatwick to Guernsey with Aurigny\u2014one of the world\u2019s longest-serving regional airlines. With flights to 11 UK destinations year-round and more added seasonally, your island escape is merely a short hop away. Book now at aurigny.com.

      "text": "Nestled within Derbyshire\u2019s rolling countryside, Bakewell\u2014synonymous with the famed English pudding\u2014is a quintessential Peak District town that feels plucked straight from a Jane Austen chapter; famously rumoured to have inspired \u2018Lambton\u2019 in Pride and Prejudice. Here, narrow cobbled streets wind through a town bathed in warm, honeyed hues, where ivy spills over stone cottages and the River Wye threads through like a silver ribbon, as wild ducks drift lazily beneath mossy footbridges and locals picnic beneath the arching shade of age-old, leafy willows.\nAt the heart of the town, glowing bakeries tempt tourists to queue for a taste of the legendary Bakewell Pudding. While nearby, buzzing market stalls brim with handmade crafts, crumbly English cheeses, and fragrant blooms. Tucked into sleepy alleyways, tiny galleries unveil the works of local Peak District artists. While All Saints Church watches over Bakewell, standing noble and proud, with ancient Saxon crosses whispering stories of long-gone times.\nBut don\u2019t be fooled\u2014Bakewell comes alive after dusk, as Victorian lampposts flicker and crowds gather in its classic English pubs to cheers local Peak Ales. So, whether you\u2019re tracing Jane Austen\u2019s literary footsteps at nearby Chatsworth House or rambling through sunlit meadows ablaze with buttercups, you\u2019ll discover plenty of jewels in the capital of Bakewell Pudding.\nWhere To Stay\nThe Rutland Arms Hotel\nTowering over Rutland Square, The Rutland Arms is Bakewell\u2019s iconic Grade II-listed coaching inn, originally commissioned in 1804 by the Duke of Rutland. With its honey-hued sandstone fa\u00e7ade, Doric-columned entrance, and hand-carved coat of arms by White Watson, this boutique bolthole radiates timeless grandeur.\nStep inside and you\u2019re greeted with a whimsical, almost theatrical, Alice In Wonderland-esque cavern\u2014think medusa-like chandeliers, rich velvet banquettes, and walls adorned with grand oil portraits of Tudor royals, Georgian aristocrats, and playful countryside prints.\nUpstairs, check into its petite Deluxe Four Poster Suite\u2014the hotel\u2019s crown jewel\u2014dressed with a stately four-poster bed, a stylish lounge area (think long floral drapes, retro Roberts radios, regal armchairs, and historic prints of Haddon Hall), and a snug ensuite with a small bath tub and a glowing vanity mirror.\nPeckish? Downstairs, dine in its AA Rosette restaurant\u2014where period grandeur meets modern flair\u2014with neon coffered ceilings, suspended stagelights, ornate Georgian mirrors, and regal wingback armchairs. Sink into royal blue booths and nibble on small plates of popcorn chicken, Thai fishcakes, and salt & pepper chicken bao buns\u2014before diving into hearty British mains\u2014think slow-cooked Derbyshire lamb, treacle-cured pork chops, and 12oz T-Bone steak.\nAfternoon tea is a ritual here: expect lofty finger sandwiches, warm fluffy scones, and a selection of weighty patisserie treats with teapots of Jasmine Blossom or Darjeeling. Then, retire to the Nell Gwynn Bar next door, with its crackling log fires, velvet armchairs, and fine curated gin selection.\nThe best bit? You\u2019re mere footsteps from Bakewell\u2019s bustling market, quaint bakeries, and meandering riverside walks\u2014or, simply watch it all unfold from your birdseye-view suite above the square (Deluxe Four Poster Suite from $335 per night).\nRead More:\nBest Things To Do In Bakewell\nChatsworth House\nRising from the folds of the Peak District, Chatsworth House is a regal Georgian stately home owned by the wealthy Dukes of Devonshire\u2014famously immortalised as \u2018Pemberley\u2019 in the 2005 film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Start in its Painted Hall, where mythological frescoes swirl above golden balustrades\u2014then, wander the Sculpture Gallery, where Roman marble figures gaze solemnly beneath vaulted skylights and marvel at the Library, lined with thousands of leather-bound volumes. Outside, the 105-acre garden unfurls with dramatic flair: a 300-year-old tumbling waterfall and its grand Emperor Fountain shooting skyward (built to impress Tsar Nicholas I). Or, simply lose yourself in the twisting yew hedges of its Maze. Hungry? Just a 10-minute drive away, you\u2019ll find Chatsworth Kitchen\u2014serving warm Derbyshire oat cakes, garden vegetable linguine, and the house-favorite Chatsworth Kitchen Burger (House & Garden tickets from $45 per person).\nBakewell Pudding Shop\nDeep in the heart of Bakewell\u2019s cobbled town square stands The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, inside a charming 17th-century stone building, once owned by the Duke of Rutland. It was the birthplace of the legendary Bakewell Pudding\u2014by happy accident\u2014in the 1800s. As the story goes, a cook at the nearby White Horse Inn misinterpreted a recipe, layering an egg custard over jam instead of folding it into the pastry. The result? A silky, almond-rich custard nestled in flaky puff pastry that became a British classic. Step inside and you\u2019re greeted by the smell of warm butter and toasted almonds as you clock a counter overflowing with handmade puddings, golden tarts, and whimsical surprises like Bakewell Pudding Gin. Bonus: Use their clever \u201cPost a Pudding\u201d service and you can send a Bakewell Pudding anywhere across the globe.\nRead More:\nMonsal Trail\nWinding through Derbyshire\u2019s limestone dales, the Monsal Trail is an 8.5-mile ribbon cut from the old Midland Railway line. You\u2019ll meander through six tunnels\u2014like the Headstone Tunnel, echoing with footsteps\u2014past craggy cliffs, wild garlic-filled woods, and limestone valleys. Then, emerging into sunlight, you\u2019ll be greeted by the majestic Headstone Viaduct, towering above Monsal Dale with hawks circling overhead. In spring, bluebells carpet the banks; as you pass by two relics of the Industrial Age: Litton Mill and Cressbrook Mill, once powered by the river\u2019s rush, now silent beneath ivy. Grand finale? Make a stop at Hassop Station Caf\u00e9 for a slice of Bakewell tart or picnic beside the lime kilns, where butterflies flit between ox-eye daisies.\nBest Restaurants\nThe Woodyard\nPerched beside the River Wye, The Woodyard is a charming riverside restaurant\u2014housed in a former 1810 marble works\u2014its glass floor revealing the old millstream trickling below. Exposed stone walls, timber beams, and flickering candlelight are married with the smell of wood-fired pizzas, blue cheese mayo-topped Woodyard burgers, and crispy steak and Guinness pies with rich gravy. Sip punchy cocktails too\u2014from \u2018Bakewell Sours\u2019 to spicy margaritas\u2014in its sun-drenched beer garden; the only in Bakewell that overlooks the river.\nRead More:\nLovage\nSecreted away in a former 19th-century stable block, Lovage is one of Bakewell\u2019s most refined culinary jewels\u2014led by its Chef-owner, \u2018Great British Menu\u2019 finalist, Lee Smith. Candlelight flickers off wood-paneled walls and Derbyshire stone as you indulge in seven-course tasting menus: think roasted beetroot with goat\u2019s cheese and dukkah, or stone bass with foraged herbs, and dreamy raspberry souffl\u00e9. The wine flight is superb, too\u2014featuring Loire whites and Pfalz reds.\nHow To Get There\nTravelers and residents in London can hop on a 125-minute train from St Pancras International to Matlock, changing at Derby, with East Midlands Railway.

Watch as the region\u2019s famed Four Corners Bread emerges with a golden crust, its aroma both earthy and smoky. Then, naturally, enjoy a rustic tasting.\nRead More:\nStaying onboard? You\u2019ll slip under mighty iron bridges, past vine-laced cliffs and sun-drenched hillsides, toward Folgosa, where you\u2019ll visit Quinta das Carvalhas. Draped across the steepest slopes of the Douro Valley, this historic estate\u2014often called the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Real Companhia Velha\u2014dates back to 1756, spanning over 600 hectares. Here, century-old vines cling to its vertiginous hillsides, framed by wild lavender, knotted olive groves, and bursts of rosemary and thyme.\nWander past Vinhas Velhas, ancient field blends boasting up to 50 indigenous grape varieties\u2014from Touriga Nacional to Tinta Roriz and Sous\u00e3o\u2014each adding complexity and depth to Carvalhas\u2019 celebrated Ports and DOC Douro wines. Finale: enjoy a personally-cured tasting of the Quinta\u2019s finest: ruby Ports and crisp whites\u2014served with warm fluffy breads, local cheeses, and smoky cured meats ($199 per person with Viking).\nYou\u2019ll rejoin Helgrim in R\u00e9gua for a \u2018Viking Explorer Society\u2019 cocktail party\u2014think Italian negronis and rosy cosmopolitans\u2014before setting off the next morning to visit the sacred pilgrimage town of Lamego.\nIts cobbled streets wind past 17th-century villas, gothic spires, and azulejo-lined staircases. At its heart, you climb up the 686 steps\u2014zigzagging through nine lush terraces, grand fountains, and sculpted obelisks\u2014to the elegant \u2018Sanctuary of Our Lady of Remedies\u2019, an 18th-century twin-towered baroque chapel, perched high on the hill like a crown. Even today, pilgrims take the long upward journey on their knees, seeking blessings from its ornate Rococo shrine, said to offer spiritual healing.\nBack in Lamego\u2019s center, explore its 12th-century castle, peer into the ornate Lamego Cathedral, or wander the Museu de Lamego\u2014a former bishop\u2019s palace housing Flemish tapestries.\nLater in the afternoon, back onboard Helgrim, you\u2019ll be served a mini \u2018High Tea\u2019 in the Viking Lounge\u2014think tiny finger sandwiches, warm fluffy scones, sweet macarons, and a wide tea menu featuring aromatic blends like jasmine blossom. Afterward, join a vintage Port wine demonstration before arriving in Vila Nova de Gaia, welcomed by a lively \u2018Tuna Folk Show\u2019\u2014a spirited serenade performed by university students in velvet capes, strumming mandolins and acoustic guitars.\nEdging along the shimmering riverbanks, you\u2019ll gently glide back into Porto\u2014completing your full Douro circle\u2014visiting Portugal\u2019s first capital, Guimar\u00e3es\u2014known as \u201cthe cradle of Portugal.\u201d\nNestled in the verdant hills of northern Portugal, its UNESCO-listed Old Town is a labyrinth of granite alleyways, ivy-cloaked monasteries, and palaces that whisper tales of kings and conquests\u2014with the phrase \u201cAqui nasceu Portugal\u201d (Portugal was born here) etched into its ancient city walls, a declaration of national identity.\nAt its heart stands the Castle of Guimar\u00e3es, a formidable 10th-century fortress with jagged battlements and a towering keep, believed to be the birthplace of Afonso Henriques\u2014Portugal\u2019s first king. Nearby, however, the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza stuns with its Gothic arches and red-tiled turrets.\nWander down narrow medieval streets, past half-timbered houses and flower-filled balconies, and arrive at the Church of Our Lady of Oliveira, a Romanesque-Gothic marvel nestled beside a centuries-old olive tree\u2014before sampling gorgeous Portuguese pastries at a charming local bakery.\nFinale? Gather with your fellow passengers and crew in the Viking Lounge one last time\u2014clinking crystal glasses of aged Port and toasting the Golden River: a waterway that doesn\u2019t rush, but seductively unfurls its splendour. With ribboning terraced vineyards, glittering emerald hillsides, towering locks, and a stirring procession of ornate palaces, ancient villages, and sleek quintas, it\u2019s a journey that lingers long after the last sip. Sa\u00fade!\nHow To Do It\nJoin Viking\u2019s 8 and 10-day Douro River cruises\u2014with stops in jewels like Porto, R\u00e9gua, Pinh\u00e3o, Barca d\u2019Alva, and Salamanca.

The resort\u2019s 343 suites and 15 villas are scattered across its uber-chic grounds\u2014as bougainvillea climbs stone walls and charming boulevards wind past mini snack caf\u00e9s, flamingo-pink telephone boxes, and gourmet gelato huts.

Ranging from the entry-level 110m\u00b2 Seascape Suite to the opulent five-bedroom Crown Signature Suite. Its crown jewel? The uber-chic Amber Lagoon Suite.

Your own personal golf buggy to whiz around the resort and a dedicated butler to ensure every whim is met\u2014from pillow menus to sunset canap\u00e9s.\nFood and Beverage\nFeasting at The Crown is a journey through Anatolia and beyond. Al Waha, one of five \u2018Fine Dining\u2019 restaurants, is a Middle Eastern escape serving spiced lamb and sumac-dusted mezze beneath lantern-lit skies. While ALIA beach restaurant offers breezy, bohemian-style breakfasts by the sea\u2014think artisanal simit, local honeycomb, and tangy Ezine cheese. Daphne, however, is its vibrant food hall\u2014inspired by Istanbul\u2019s Grand Bazaar, with sizzling g\u00f6zleme stations, smoky seafood grills, and meze counters.

This serene sanctuary unfurls along winding paths that weave between a traditional Turkish hammam, bubbling whirlpool, steam room, and dry sauna. While little bridges arch over streams, leading to a secluded pool flanked by shaded loungers, where lazy cats stretch out and Turkish tea is served in delicate tulip-shaped glasses. Treatments range from gold-leaf facials to volcanic stone massages. But the standout? Go for the Balinese Sea Dream: a 75-minute ritual inspired by the ancient healing traditions of Bali, with a silky coconut body scrub, nutrient-rich wrap, and a soothing Balinese massage using warm coconut oils ($245 per person).
