  "description": "Jennifer Lawrence warned Emma Stone against shaving her hair off for Yorgos Lanthimos' 'Bugonia.'",
  "content": "Jennifer Lawrence admitted to Vogue as part of Emma Stone\u2018s new cover story that she originally argued against Stone shaving all her hair off for Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 upcoming \u201cBugonia,\u201d a reimagining of the 2003 South Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d that casts Stone as a pharmaceutical CEO who gets kidnapped by a pair of conspiracy theorists (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) convinced she is an alien set on destroying Earth.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want her to shave her head,\u201d Lawrence said about her two-time Oscar-winning friend. \u201cI had already lived through the Billie Jean King haircut.\u201d\n\nLawrence is referring to the hairdo Stone rocked in \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d in which she played the iconic tennis player Billie Jean King. For \u201cBugonia,\u201d Stone channeled her inner Natalie Portman in \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d and shaved her hair off on camera while filming a scene for the dark comedy in the back of a Range Rover. The actor broke down in tears in her trailer before shooting the shaving scene as it reminded her of when her mother, Krista, battled breast cancer. As Stone put it: \u201cShe actually did something brave. I\u2019m just shaving my head.\u201d\n\nBut Stone ended up loving it, saying: \u201cNo better feeling in the world. The first shower when you\u2019ve shaved your head? Oh my God, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nThe final result also had Lawrence admitting she was wrong, too. As Lawrence told Vogue: \u201cHonestly, she looked beautiful. She pulled it off.\u201d Even Stone\u2019s mom reacted by telling her daughter: \u201cI\u2019m so jealous. I want to shave my head again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more challenging it gets, the more I like it,\u201d Stone added about her acting career. \u201cIf you\u2019re not growing or pushing yourself to different places\u2014and I feel it\u2019s the same for most people in almost any job\u2014you get stagnant.\u201d\n\nStone won her second best actress Oscar for \u201cPoor Things,\u201d also directed by Lanthimos. Lawrence happened to be on stage at the time and fellow presenter Michelle Yeoh handed off the Academy Award to Lawrence so that she could bestow it to her longtime friend Stone.\n\n\u201cIn true Emily form, as soon as we got offstage and ran into the bathroom to scream and cry,\u201d Lawrence said about the moment, \u201cI whispered, \u2018Two-time best-actress winner,\u2019 and she replied, \u2018I feel like that\u2019s bad, though.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBugonia\u201d is set to world premiere in competition at the Venice Film Festival before releasing in theaters Oct. 24 from Focus Features.

      "text": "On a gray New York City morning, Emma Stone steps inside a quiet breakfast spot downtown, and you can feel the ions in the room begin to stir. Service, heretofore professional, notches up a tick. The manager and someone who appears to be the manager\u2019s manager stop at our table\u2014How are you, good to see you, what can I get you, okay, perfect, of course, right away. Everything comes right away, because it\u2019s Emma Stone, and you or I would do the same.\nWho doesn\u2019t adore or at least admire Stone? In an acrimonious era during which it\u2019s near impossible to achieve critical unity on any being or concept\u2014even Stevie Wonder and sunny afternoons have their antagonists\u2014the 36-year-old actress and producer has reached a rare altitude of public goodwill.\nMaybe it\u2019s because Stone\u2019s really good at what she does for a living, like double-Oscar good. Maybe it\u2019s because she keeps taking devilish risks with outr\u00e9 collaborators like auteur Yorgos Lanthimos and pilot Nathan Fielder. Maybe it\u2019s because, despite all of her plaudits, Stone remains Emily\u2014a self-deprecating, anxious girl from the Arizona suburbs who regularly worries the whole thing\u2019s about to fall apart, and would never use the word plaudits.\nStone settles into our table wearing a Silk Laundry vest over a white T-shirt, Agolde jeans with Common Projects sneakers, and if you think I had to ask her to tell me all those things, bingo. (She offers a cheeky rundown: \u201cFor the record, they\u2019re long black jeans, kind of a wide leg\u2026.\u201d)\nHer red hair is short and still growing out\u2014\u201cPretty slowly for how long it\u2019s been,\u201d she says\u2014from a film for which she dramatically shaved her head. (More on that in a sec.) She orders a croissant and what appears to be a bottomless cup of coffee and congratulates me when I turn down a refill.\n\u201cI\u2019m so impressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m such a caffeine freak.\u201d\nI\u2019ve known Stone for a little while. The first time I wrote about her for this magazine was in 2014, when we went to an LA mall and visited two iconic Vogue haunts, Build-a-Bear and Hot Dog on a Stick. The second time was in 2016, just before La La Land, which would go on to win the Academy Award for best picture for approximately two minutes. Stone, of course, won best actress\u2014and got to keep that one.\nStone\u2019s acting career has only flourished further since. There was Battle of the Sexes, in which Stone played Billie Jean King and attained a respectable volley. There was The Favourite, the first of four films so far with Lanthimos, the absurdist Greek director who would conspire with Stone on her most daring role, the randy, reanimated Bella Baxter of 2023\u2019s Poor Things, for which she won a second Oscar. Stone and Lanthimos\u2019s next film, the rivetingly unhinged Bugonia, arrives in October.\nAlong the way was a Zombieland sequel, a TV drama called Maniac with old pal Jonah Hill, a wild Lanthimos triptych called Kinds of Kindness, the meta series The Curse with Fielder, and Cruella, the finest 101 Dalmatians\u2013inspired fashion saga ever made\u2014and if you disagree, my daughter and I will chase you with sticks.\nMeanwhile there have been bright developments in Stone\u2019s personal life. A lifelong Saturday Night Live obsessive and a five-time host, Stone would meet and begin dating Dave McCary, an SNL writer-director. The pair, who are now producing partners, would confirm their engagement in 2019. The following year, Stone would marry into the Studio 8H mafia, wearing a dress designed by her close friend (and Louis Vuitton women\u2019s artistic director) Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2014plus a black eye she gave herself after yanking a handle off a refrigerator door.\n\u201cTruly a cosmic joke,\u201d Stone says. \u201cWhose refrigerator handle breaks off while opening it?\u201d\nMost profoundly: In March 2021, Stone and McCary welcomed a child, Louise Jean, her middle name shared with her mother. Three years later Stone would memorably thank her daughter from the Academy Awards stage for turning her parents\u2019 lives \u201cTechnicolor.\u201d\nMotherhood, marriage, movies, two Oscars, Saturday Night Live, producing, a self-inflicted black eye from a fridge handle\u2014it\u2019s been an audacious stretch.\nWhere does one begin?\nI agree completely. Let\u2019s talk about Emma Stone\u2019s shaved head.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want her to shave her head,\u201d Stone\u2019s longtime close friend Jennifer Lawrence writes by email. \u201cI had already lived through the Billie Jean King haircut.\u201d\nHere\u2019s our scenario, and I promise I\u2019m not spoiling anything: In Bugonia, Stone\u2019s character is a pharmaceutical CEO who\u2019s kidnapped by a pair of conspiracy theorists played by Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis. The two men believe their hostage\u2019s hair must go, and so they shave her head, with an electric clipper, in the back seat of a stolen Range Rover. This is all done on film, with zero CGI\u2014those are Stone\u2019s actual locks, spilling onto the leather interior.\nStone is not the first high-profile actress to go head-shaven for a part, of course. Natalie Portman did it for V for Vendetta; Charlize Theron for Mad Max: Fury Road; and please don\u2019t make me explain what a big deal it was when Demi Moore buzzed for G.I. Jane.\nStill, it\u2019s a massive show of commitment, which was not lost on Plemons and the Bugonia gang when the moment arrived. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Here we go\u2014Emily has shaved her head,\u2019 \u201d Plemons says. \u201cWe better make this good!\u201d\nStone loved it. \u201cNo better feeling in the world,\u201d she says of the cut, which, in case you\u2019re mulling it, deployed a 1.5-millimeter blade. (\u201cThe first shower when you\u2019ve shaved your head? Oh my God, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says, sounding like Laird Hamilton raving about the curls at Teahupo\u2018o.) Stone had no hesitation\u2014and she did get to shave Lanthimos\u2019s head first\u2014but admits that, right before, she burst into tears in her trailer. Years ago, Stone\u2019s mother, Krista, lost her hair during treatment for breast cancer. \u201cShe actually did something brave,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cI\u2019m just shaving my head.\u201d\nTurns out Krista Stone was envious. \u201cMy mom was like, \u2018I\u2019m so jealous. I want to shave my head again.\u2019 \u201d\nBugonia\u2014based on a 2003 South Korean film called Save the Green Planet!\u2014is an intense movie shot within tightly confined spaces, one of which is the basement of a rural house. For long stretches, Lanthimos, working with Poor Things cinematographer Robbie Ryan, trains the camera directly on Stone\u2019s face and shorn scalp. The effect is mesmerizing, almost feral.\n\u201cHonestly, she looked beautiful,\u201d writes Lawrence. \u201cShe pulled it off.\u201d\nDuring filming, Stone wore hats in public and turned up at the New York Film Festival in a wig. Her shorter mane was praised as a style move at awards season\u2014\u201cEmma Stone Debuts Pixie Cut at Golden Globes,\u201d read one headline. The secret came out when a Bugonia teaser arrived with a shot of clippers digging into Stone\u2019s scalp.\nStone misses it, honestly. \u201cI was bummed I wasn\u2019t going out with it,\u201d she says. \u201cJust straight-up bald. I think that would have been fun.\u201d\nAlright. Enough about the hair.\nThen again, cutting off all her hair is emblematic of what Stone\u2019s done with acting: See the sharpest turn and swerve right into it.\nThere\u2019s a version of Stone\u2019s career in which, year after year, she signs up for action capers and romantic comedies in which she plays, I don\u2019t know, a narcoleptic lawyer who can\u2019t get a second date.\nInstead, she\u2019s taken a riskier path. This is most evident in her extended partnership with Lanthimos, a 51-year-old filmmaker pathologically averse to standard Hollywood fare. In Stone, he\u2019s found a kindred spirit. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can be any other way,\u201d Lanthimos says. \u201cShe wants to be excited by the stuff that she does, to try different things. It\u2019s more about the experience for her.\u201d\nNowhere was this clearer than in Poor Things, the Mary Shelley\u2013inspired Victorian romp in which Stone played a dead-by-suicide pregnant woman reanimated with the brain of her own baby, and gang, that\u2019s just the half of it. Stone\u2019s performance\u2014Bella wobbling like a toddler, then voyaging into adult independence, self-discovery, and a libertine sexual awakening\u2014was unlike anything she\u2019d done.\n\u201cWhen it was going out into the world, I was like, I have no idea what people are going to say about this,\u201d Stone recalls. \u201cI started to get scared, but then I was like: There\u2019s nothing you can do. Yorgos and I have talked a lot about this. There\u2019s no reason to be prescriptive to an audience about what it should like and not like. If you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s not for you, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nAudiences went amok for Poor Things\u2014the film grossed $117 million worldwide, making it Lanthimos\u2019s biggest hit and a crazy uncle in the cookie-cutter multiplex. Plotwise, Bugonia is a 180 pivot, but it\u2019s just as provocative, a meaty rumination on modern conspiracy theorizing, medical-industry corruption, and obsessions like extraterrestrials, and again gang, that\u2019s just the half of it.\n\u201cThe more challenging it gets, the more I like it,\u201d says Stone, who also appeared this summer in Eddington, writer-director Ari Aster\u2019s bonkers riff on COVID-era American paranoia. \u201cIf you\u2019re not growing or pushing yourself to different places\u2014and I feel it\u2019s the same for most people in almost any job\u2014you get stagnant.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all a long way from making tiramisu with Jonah Hill in home-economics class. Stone often credits legendary casting director Allison Jones for her breakthrough as Hill\u2019s sharp-witted Superbad crush, Jules. Jones remembers Stone well: She first encountered Stone as a teenager, when she and Lawrence (brought in by another casting director) tested for the same part in a comedy pilot. Stone and Lawrence were often up for the same things; neither got this one, and the sitcom never went to series.\n\u201cShe was a young Shirley MacLaine, even as a teenager,\u201d Jones emails, recalling Stone\u2019s \u201craspy voice and her ability to \u2018get the joke,\u2019 \u201d which made an impression at a Superbad table read.\nJesse Plemons, who first worked with Stone on Kinds of Kindness, says Stone was an invaluable guide to Yorgos World, where extensive rehearsals and acting exercises are part of the cast\u2019s bonding process. \u201cSeeing her throw herself into these exercises and games gives you more confidence to do the same,\u201d Plemons says. \u201cShe takes the work seriously\u2014but not herself too seriously.\u201d\nLawrence believes two Oscars make Stone \u201cundeniable\u201d\u2014even if Stone doesn\u2019t see it that way. A winner herself, Lawrence was onstage at the Dolby Theatre for Stone\u2019s second triumph, when co-presenter Michelle Yeoh gracefully passed the statue over so the two friends could have a moment.\n\u201cIn true Emily form, as soon as we got offstage and ran into the bathroom to scream and cry,\u201d Lawrence writes, \u201cI whispered, Two-time best-actress winner, and she replied, \u2018I feel like that\u2019s bad, though.\u2019 \u201d\nThis is the Stone her close friends know and love\u2014even in exultant moments, always worrying that the other shoe is going to drop. \u201cAlways, always, always,\u201d Stone says. Such anxiety might encourage career caution, but Stone has prioritized a more radical path, pursuing partnerships where trust and familiarity allow her to take chances. \u201cWhen you find people you really have a shorthand with,\u201d she says, \u201cto me, that\u2019s the dream.\u201d\nSimilarly adventurous is Stone\u2019s almost decade-long professional collaboration with Ghesqui\u00e8re and Louis Vuitton. Stone and Ghesqui\u00e8re met at the Met Gala in 2012, introduced by the late Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz, who made Stone a red minidress embroidered with crystal flowers.\n\u201cIt was the best introduction possible\u2014she was so sweet, so charismatic,\u201d says Ghesqui\u00e8re, who designed all the fashion for the images accompanying this story, which were photographed at the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Here, for Stone and Vogue, the acclaimed designer has ventured into the exacting discipline of handmade fashion\u2014akin to French couture.\n\u201cCouture is about experimentation, which she loves,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. He calls it \u201ca story in my head, a movie that doesn\u2019t exist in which she is the lead character.\u201d\nGhesqui\u00e8re and Stone have proven to be an auspicious match\u2014he arrived at Vuitton just as Stone ascended to the Hollywood mountaintop. A dedicated movie fan (he has a soft spot for Stone\u2019s early Crazy, Stupid, Love), Ghesqui\u00e8re has been inspired by her onscreen performances. For Stone\u2019s public appearances around Poor Things, he drew on costume designer Holly Waddington\u2019s Oscar-winning creations, in one instance pairing a blue midi-dress with a scrunchy robe that mimicked Bella Baxter\u2019s exaggerated shoulder lines.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a fashion addict,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says of Stone. At the same time, \u201cShe loves the quality of the clothes, the fabric, the craftsmanship. She\u2019s curious about the way things are done. It\u2019s a very inspiring exchange\u2014like a tennis match where we keep sending things to each other.\u201d\n\u201cNicolas is just somebody you can sit, have dinner with, talk about life and everything going on,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThe only relationship I had like that with a designer was with Alber, who I miss terribly. He was so human and loving. Nicolas has that kind of humanity to him.\u201d\nStone points out that she and Ghesqui\u00e8re both have partners from San Diego\u2014McCary grew up there, as did Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s partner, Drew Kuhse\u2014and also share a sense of humor. This helped at the 2024 Oscars, when Stone realized on her way to accepting her statue for Poor Things that her strapless tulip-shaped Vuitton dress had broken a zipper.\nGhesqui\u00e8re, watching on TV, was aghast. But Stone joked onstage\u2014\u201cI think it happened during \u2018I\u2019m Just Ken,\u2019 \u201d she said, referring to old pal Ryan Gosling\u2019s Barbie musical performance\u2014and turned the mishap into self-effacing magic. \u201cIt was human,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. \u201cThe whole thing for me, that accident, was quite beautiful,\u201d he continues, before adding: \u201cNow we make sure we make solid zippers.\u201d\nFor Stone and McCary\u2019s small outdoor wedding in 2020, Ghesqui\u00e8re created both Stone\u2019s wedding dress and a feathered reception minidress, the latter of which she didn\u2019t wear because social-distance rules precluded a real party. She decided to give it an encore at the 2022 Met Gala.\n\u201cThat dress was a lifetime memory,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have a friend like that.\u201d\nStone-McCary is a union born of Saturday Night Live\u2014in 2016, McCary, then a staff writer, directed her in a satirical commercial called \u201cWells for Boys,\u201d in which Stone played the doting mother of a comically sensitive son. Their relationship went public with a courtside appearance at an LA Clippers game in early 2019. The couple remain devoted sports fans, Stone converting McCary into a supporter of her beloved Phoenix Suns; McCary turning Stone into a die-hard for the San Diego Padres.\nSNL remains a through line. Stone describes herself as an SNL \u201cWAG,\u201d and has been part of the show for a long time, says its creator, Lorne Michaels. \u201cSo when you see her at the studio, you\u2019re not surprised. She\u2019s completely comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAll my heroes growing up were SNL people,\u201d says Stone. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not \u2018cast member\u2019 material.\u201d (Michaels disagrees: \u201cOh yeah\u2014she\u2019s a star. That was evident early.\u201d)\nFor SNL\u2019s 50th anniversary in February, Stone did a jump-kick onstage with Molly Shannon\u2019s quinquagenarian Sally O\u2019Malley, and her dress, designed by Ghesqui\u00e8re, had hip-side popcorn buckets as an homage to the kernel-loving Michaels.\nToday, Stone and McCary have a joint production company, Fruit Tree. Like Stone\u2019s acting choices, Fruit Tree\u2019s slate is impossible to pigeonhole: three films from longtime Stone friend Jesse Eisenberg, who refers to Stone as his \u201cfairy godmother\u201d; comedies with Julio Torres; a raw documentary called The Yogurt Shop Murders. The company also coproduced The Curse, which brought Stone together with Fielder (who wrote the series with Benny Safdie). She\u2019s a massive fan of Fielder\u2019s other series The Rehearsal. \u201cI want him to win a Nobel,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019m drawn to material that asks more questions than gives you answers,\u201d Stone says. \u201cI think critical thinking is the most valuable resource that a person can have, and I like that feeling of being asked to answer things for myself.\u201d At Eisenberg\u2019s urging, Stone recently dove into When We Cease to Understand the World, Benjam\u00edn Labatut\u2019s 2020 book on morality and science. When we speak, she\u2019s halfway through Edith Wharton\u2019s The Custom of the Country.\nStone and McCary, who are based in New York City, turn up at red carpets now and then, and there\u2019s a 300 percent chance of finding them at the ballpark when the Padres are in town\u2014but otherwise, they lead a low-key city life. Stone, who made her Broadway debut as Sally Bowles in Cabaret in 2014, raves over Cole Escola\u2019s Tony-winning Oh, Mary! about Mary Todd Lincoln, and is very open to theater again. (A role she covets down the road: Martha in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)\nShe famously avoids posting on social media\u2014you won\u2019t find her chugging out TikToks\u2014and is far more likely to be making pumpkin oatmeal cookies or watching Bluey with Louise Jean, who\u2019s now four. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I feel luckier about,\u201d she says of her daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s the greatest gift of my life, for sure.\u201d (As for Bluey, she champions the canonical second-season episode \u201cSleepytime.\u201d)\n\u201cMotherhood can be so difficult, and she\u2019s handling it with grace,\u201d says Martha MacIsaac, the actress who played Becca, friend to Stone\u2019s Jules in Superbad. MacIsaac has two children, and she and Stone have stayed close: \u201cI FaceTimed her during both of my labors. Her medical advice is very sound.\u201d\nMotherhood now impacts Stone\u2019s creative choices. \u201cIt\u2019s streamlined everything,\u201d she says. She now asks herself if a job is worth it\u2014spending months away, not seeing her daughter for long stretches on set. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9d thing to say, but it changes everything. And simplifies everything.\u201d\nHas being a parent made her better at what she does\u2014has it opened deeper emotional registers as an actor?\nShe pauses for a moment.\n\u201cI do think it unlocks different things,\u201d Emma Stone says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s specifically that, but I feel everything I could possibly feel, because everything has exploded.\u201d\nIn this story: hair, Mara Roszak using R\u014cZ hair; makeup, Pat McGrath; tailors, Francesca Camugli and Michael Morgado; manicurist, Emi Kudo. Produced by Farago Projects.\nThe September issue is here featuring Emma Stone. Subscribe to Vogue."

      "text": "For its 31tst edition, New Nordic Films, the Norwegian International Film Festival\u2019s industry confab, will be hitting new heights with a stronger than ever lineup of projects and completed titles, to be showcased over Aug. 19-22 in Haugesund, Norway.\nHeadlining the list of 21 films in development to be pitched at the Nordic Co-Production Market (NCPM), is Primetime Emmy and Sundance winning doc filmmaker Benjamin Ree (\u201cThe Remarkable Life of Ibelin,\u201d \u201cThe Painter and the Thief\u201d) and his regular Norwegian prodco Medieoperat\u00f8rene. They will be presenting \u201cThe Greatest Illusion,\u201d a portrait of acclaimed illusionist Alexx Alexxander and his siblings. Through archival footage and intimate family videos, the documentary explores profound themes like trauma, memories, crime, and redemption.\nOther filmmakers on the watch list take in Bulgarian-Finnish Tonislav Hristov (\u201cThe Good Postman,\u201d \u201cThe Magic Life of V\u201d) with \u201cQuiet Lake,\u201d a new drama about fitting in, and a handful of promising Nordic female voices. Iceland\u2019s Ninna Palmad\u00f3ttir, selected for Toronto\u2019s 2023 Discovery strand with \u201cSolitude,\u201d is turning to \u201cOn a Scale of One to Ten\u201d for newly-established Lushkin Films in the U.K.; Finland\u2019s Aino Suni (\u201cHeartbeast\u201d) is diving into \u201cAbyss\u201d produced by high-profile Aaamu Film, and Denmark\u2019s Patricia Bbaale Bandak is working on Monolit\u2019s \u201cWannabe,\u201d pitched earlier at New Nordic Films\u2019 twin event Nordic Film Market in Gothenburg.\nPopular on Variety\nOne noticeable trend is the return to feature film of seasoned directors after a long hiatus spent in serialised drama. Icelandic actor-writer Bj\u00f6rn Hlynur Haraldsson (\u201cVigd\u00eds,\u201d \u201cBlackport\u201d) is preparing \u201cKlara\u201d for prominent creative collective Vesturport; Swedish DP-director M\u00e5ns M\u00e5nsson (\u201cEstonia\u201d, \u201cSnabba Cash\u201d), twice selected for the Berlinale with the films \u201cThe Real Estate\u201d and \u201cThe Yard,\u201d has \u201cThe Cannibal,\u201d set up at the TF1Studios controlled Anagram banner, while prolific Icelandic showrunner Baldvin Z (\u201cBlack Sands\u201d) is prepping \u201cDark Ocean\u201d for Glassriver, his fourth pic after the acclaimed \u201cJitters,\u201d \u201cLife in a Fishbowl\u201d and \u201cLet Me Fall.\u201d\nTwo hot TV names are making their first foray into film as directors: Norwegian screenwriter Johan Fasting (\u201cPower Play\u201d, \u201cHome Ground\u201d) with \u201cHow to Steal a Bike,\u201d produced by Motlys and \u201cYoung Royals Season 3\u201d helmer Julia Lindstr\u00f6m with \u201cLisa & Lily,\u201d produced by Nordic Drama Queens. Norwegian star actor and screenwriter Nicolai Cleve Broch (\u201cBeforeigners,\u201d \u201cAcquitted\u201d) will make his directorial debut with \u201cInto the Ice,\u201d produced by \u201cHandling the Undead\u201d\u2019s Einar Film.\nAs announced in Variety, six Baltic projects will complete the NCPM slate as part of a Baltic Focus.\nNew Nordic Films honcho Gyda Velvin Myklebust said she is thrilled to showcase \u201ca super solid\u201d slate at NCPM, assembled out of a record 92 submissions. But she also highlighted the bottleneck of projects in development, which reflects the on-going crisis in financing, hitting the Nordic film industry.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had COVID, then cuts in TV investment, Iceland for instance has paused film funding and in Norway, there is a finite number of projects that can get development support, which is why producers are exploring different routes to raise financing. This is where film markets such as ours fill an important role,\u201d she stressed.\nWorks in Progress\nNew Nordic Films\u2019 other star pitch event \u2013 the Works in Progress \u2013 will showcase 16 projects in post-production, such as Linda Hamb\u00e4ck\u2019s animation pic \u201cDante,\u201d voiced by Stella Skarsg\u00e5rd and David Dencik.\nThe project, slated for a 2026 release, is sold worldwide by Attraction Distribution. Other titles with sales agents attached at press time, take in TrustNordisk\u2019s Norwegian horror \u201cKraken\u201d by genre specialist P\u00e5l \u00d8ie, pre-sold to key territories including the U.S. (Samuel Goldwyn Films), Germany (Splendid) and France (Mediawan) and LevelK\u2019s Finnish absurdist comedy \u201cKidnapping of a President,\u201d directed by Samuli Valkama. A further title is \u201cThe Resident\u201d helmer Antti J. Jokinen\u2019s upcoming epic \u201cThe Son of Revenge \u2013 The Story of Kalevala,\u201d sold by REinvent.\nAmong titles up for grabs, \u201dDon Quijote of Barcelona\u201d is a heartfelt buddy drama, helmed by Yle head of drama Jarmo Lampela, \u201cArr\u00f9\u201d a S\u00e1mi musical by choreographer-turned-director Elle Sofe Sara, and \u201cClementine Orange\u201d a love drama starring Gizem Erdogan (\u201cThe Playlist,\u201d \u201cLove & Anarchy\u201d), and Erik Enge (\u201cTigers,\u201d \u201cBlack Crab\u201d) helmed by first-timer Lisa Forslund.\nIn total, over 250 delegates have signed up for New Nordic Films, including nearly 20 sales outlets such as The Coproduction Office, Le Pacte, Beta Cinema and The Playmaker as well as a dozen programmers from Sundance, Tribeca, Rome to Karlovy Vary, and top buyers including Netflix and HBO Max.\nFollowing a presentation of the Nordic Council Film Prize\u2019s nominees on Aug. 19, New Nordic Films will open with the screening of the Cannes Premiere entry \u201cThe Love that Remains\u201d by one of Iceland\u2019s most visionary filmmakers, Hlynur P\u00e1lmason. The drama, sold by New Europe Film Sales, will be showcased at the market, alongside 19 other recent Nordic titles including this year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or contender \u201cEagles of the Republic\u201d by Tarik Saleh, due to close the Norwegian Film Festival Aug. 22.\n\u201cWe have a truly amazing selection this year,\u201d summed up Myklebust who pays tribute to the filmmakers\u2019 passion \u201cwhich is stronger than ever\u201d and their ability to engage the audience with \u201cthought-provoking works that reflect our time. People seem to refocus on what it means to be a human being and they also say this with humor,\u201d she said.\nOn the panel front, New Nordic Films will lend its platform to Nordic Indigenous Cinema, hosted by the International S\u00e1mi Film Institute\u2019s managing director Anne Lajla Utsi, Baltic-Nordic co-productions, Nordic animation with six prominent outfits under the spotlight, marketing with a presentation from Usheru co-founder Oliver Fegan, and distribution with Europa Distribution\u2019s focus on two successful Nordic features: \u201cLoveable\u201d by Lilja Ingolfsd\u00f3ttir, and \u201cDreams\u201d by Dag Johan Haugerud.\nIn a new initiative to strengthen the ties between Nordic and European film professionals, 10 producer members of the European Film Club, will be on hand in Haugesund.\nNordic Co-Production Market Lineup\n\u201cAbyss\u201d (Aino Suni, Aamu Film Company, Finland)\n\u201cBeatrice\u201d (Vallo Toomla, Stellar Film, Estonia)\n\u201cBlood-The Devil in Helsinki\u201d (Viivi Huuska, 61North, Finland\n\u201cDark Ocean\u201d (Baldvin Z, Glassriver, Iceland)\n\u201cFlood\u201d (Jor\u016bn\u0117 Grei\u010di\u016bt\u00e9, Smart Casual, Lithuania)\n\u201cGod is Tango\u201d (Annika Grof, Tarasow Films, Finland)\n\u201cHow to Steal a Bike (Johan Fasting, Motlys, Norway)\n\u201cI\u2019m Going to Change the World\u201d (Inesa Kurklietyt\u00e9, Fralita Films, Lithuania)\n\u201cInto the Ice\u201d (Nicolai Cleve Broch, Einar Film, Norway)\n\u201cKicksled Choir\u201d (Torfinn Iversen, Fjordic Film, Norway)\n\u201cKlara\u201d (Bj\u00f6rn Hlynur Haraldsson, Vesturport, Iceland)\n\u201cLegato\u201d (Ilze Burkovska Jacobsen, Trickster Pictures, Latvia)\n\u201cLisa & Lily\u201d (Julia Lindstr\u00f6m, Nordic Drama Queens, Sweden)\n\u201cOn a Scale of One to Ten\u201d (Ninna P\u00e1lmad\u00f3ttir, Lushkin Films, UK)\n\u201cQuiet Lake\u201d (Tonislav Hristov, Making Movies, Finland)\n\u201cSave Our Souls\u201d (Jonas Steinacker, Lichtschloss Filmproduktion, Germany)\n\u201cSilverwhite\u201d (Martti Helde, Three Brothers, Estonia)\n\u201cThe Sourcerer\u2019s Eye\u201d (Aik Karapetian, Mistrus Media, Latvia)\n\u201cThe Cannibal\u201d (M\u00e5ns M\u00e5nsson, Anagram, Sweden)\n\u201cThe Greatest Illusion\u201d (Benjamin Ree, Medieoperat\u00f8rene, Norway)\n\u201cWannabe\u201d (Patricia Bbaale Bandak, Monolit Film, Denmark)\nWorks in Progress\n\u201c\u00c1rru\u201d (Elle Sofe Sara, St\u00e6r Film, Norway)\n\u201cClementine Orange\u201d (Lisa Forslund, MDEMC Produktion, Sweden\n\u201cDante\u201d (Linda Hamb\u00e4ck, Lee Film, Sweden)\n\u201cDon Quijote of Barcelona\u201d (Jarmo Lampela, Vegetarian Films, Finland)\n\u201cDisturbed\u201d (Bragi \u00de\u00f3r Hinriksson, H.M.S.
