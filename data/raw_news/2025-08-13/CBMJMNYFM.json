  "title": "Why Perplexity is going after Google Chrome - and yes, it's serious",
  "description": "Perplexity has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google's web browser and claims it has the backing to pull it off.",
  "content": "\u2022 Deal would give Perplexity a gateway to the AI-driven web.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal broke the news that AI company Perplexity made an unsolicited all-cash offer of $34.5 billion to buy Google's Chrome browser, some people asked me, \"Are they serious?\" Oh, yes, it is.\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why I still prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\n\nIn fact, I predicted Perplexity would try to buy the world's most popular web browser in May.\n\nThe evidence was there\n\nIt's not that I'm a genius. The evidence was already there. Perplexity, the AI-driven search startup, has shown interest in Chrome. Acquiring Chrome would provide Perplexity with a shortcut to user acquisition and enhance data collection for targeted advertising.\n\nEven now, Perplexity's own AI-enabled web browser, Comet, is built -- like all web browsers except Firefox -- on Chromium, Chrome's open-source ancestor. It would give Perplexity a leg up on OpenAI, which has its own plans for an AI web browser.\n\nAlso: I used Perplexity to make a restaurant reservation - now I'm wondering if Google is holding us back\n\nPerplexity has also made no secret of its desire to \"out-Google\" Google when it comes to search. As far as I'm concerned, Perplexity is a better search engine than Google.\n\nTrue, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas had said earlier that \"Chrome should remain within and continue to be run by Google,\" but if the Department of Justice and the courts are going to force Google to get rid of Chrome anyway, well, what's a CEO to do except make the best possible deal? As Srinivas said in the offer letter, the proposal is \"designed to satisfy an antitrust remedy in highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator.\"\n\nAlso: Perplexity is the AI tool Gemini wishes it could be\n\nThe federal judge handling the case, Amit Mehta, is expected to issue a ruling on remedies in the Google search antitrust case in August. He's already put Google's divesting of Chrome on the table. He's also taken a hard line on Google, stating last year in his ruling that Google \"is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters' reporting: \"Perplexity's bid pledges to keep the underlying browser code called Chromium open source, invest $3 billion over two years, and make no changes to Chrome's default search engine.\"\n\nThis multibillion-dollar bid is nearly twice Perplexity's own latest valuation. However, Perplexity has already stated that several major venture capital investors back its bid. While no names have been mentioned, Perplexity has substantial backing from Accel, Softbank, and Bessemer, and supporters such as Nvidia and Jeff Bezos. None of these entities would balk at a few billion here or there, especially for something as potentially valuable as Chrome.\n\nAlso: Perplexity says Cloudflare's accusations of 'stealth' AI scraping are based on embarrassing errors\n\nBesides, if you know your business history, this wouldn't be the first time a small company bought a much bigger property. For example, Dell Technologies' acquisition of EMC and subsequent reverse merger with VMware was a far larger deal at $67 billion.\n\nSome experts have suggested Perplexity wants attention. Bloomberg managing editor Mark Gurman tweeted: \"Google Chrome isn't worth $35 billion, let alone $3.5 billion, without the Google user base. Browsers are completely commoditized, and their core tech is open source. Absolute head scratcher.\"\n\nAlso: 5 reasons why I still prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\n\nOthers, such as Alon Yamin, co-founder and CEO of Copyleaks, an AI-based content verification startup, said the deal makes perfect sense.\n\nIn an email, Yamin told ZDNET: \"Perplexity AI's $34.5 billion bid for Chrome is more than a bold acquisition attempt; it's a signal that control over the browser is becoming one of the most valuable frontiers in the AI era. Whoever owns the gateway to the web holds immense influence over how information is accessed, prioritized, and trusted.\"\n\nAlso: I tested ChatGPT's Deep Research against Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok AI to see which is best\n\nGoogle doesn't want to sell Chrome and is appealing the antitrust decision. The courts, however, may not give it any choice in the matter. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nI suspect that if others agree with Yamin, we may see a bidding war for Chrome. After all, ChatGPT's head of product, Nick Turley, said in April that if Google were forced to sell Chrome, OpenAI would be interested.",

      "text": "I tested ChatGPT's Deep Research against Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok AI to see which is best\nMore AI chatbots now offer a deep research option, through which they can investigate a topic for you. Acting as autonomous AI agents, the bots will surf the web on your behalf, find the right online sources, and then present you with a detailed report based on their findings. The goal is to save you the time of checking out dozens or hundreds of websites yourself.\nDeep Research is quickly becoming a powerful feature among a host of AIs. You'll find it with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity AI, and even xAI's Grok (which calls it DeepSearch). Microsoft introduced a type of deep research with two AI agents, Researcher and Analyst; however, they require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license with an Enterprise or Business subscription, so they're not yet available to the average Copilot user.\nAlso: The telltale sign that you used ChatGPT - and a trick to avoid it\nThis certainly sounds like a useful and helpful skill. But how do different AI services fare when presented with this challenge? To answer that question, I tried Deep Research across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity AI, and Grok. I submitted the same query at each one, asking it to \"explore how time travel is portrayed in film and television and what it says about our values, fears, and desires.\"\nHere's how each AI's research mode works and how each handled my topic.\nChatGPT\nOpenAI's ChatGPT offers two different flavors of Deep Research: the full version and a lightweight version. The full version delivers a detailed, in-depth report but can take up to 30 minutes to find the best sources and present its findings. The lightweight version provides a much shorter, less in-depth report, but typically takes only a few minutes to finish. Which one is available to you, and how many queries you can submit, depends on your plan.\nChatGPT Plus, Team, and Edu users get 25 queries per month (10 full and 15 lightweight), Enterprise users get 10 (all full), Pro users get 250 (125 full and 125 lightweight), and free users get 5 (all lightweight). Once you reach your limit for the full version of Deep Research, your queries automatically default to the lightweight version.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot\nWhether you're using the full or lightweight version, the process is the same. Head to the ChatGPT website or open the app for iOS or Android. You can also use the desktop app for Windows or macOS. Type or speak your query at the prompt, select the button for Deep Research, and then submit your request. If the full version is in effect, prepare to wait a while for the response. If the lightweight edition is in play, you won't have to wait as long.\nI submitted my query about time travel in film and television to both the full Deep Research version and the lightweight version -- using my Plus subscription in the first instance and a free account in the second. Both used the GPT-4o model. Both also asked me to clarify the kind of analysis I wanted, such as deciding between a thematic take or a more historical one and whether to include only classic films and TV shows or modern ones as well.\nAlso: 5 reasons I turn to ChatGPT every day - from faster research to replacing Siri\nThe full version took about 17 minutes to search the web and compile the results, but it delivered a detailed, in-depth report with several examples and a helpful chart of TV shows and movies. The lightweight version took only about eight minutes from start to finish, but it provided a shorter, much less in-depth report -- a Cliff's Notes version of the full report. Both reports addressed my topic and were interesting to read, though the full Deep Research version gets the nod for thoroughness.\nGoogle Gemini\nGemini's Deep Research mode is available to both subscribers and free users. Subscribers typically get 20 queries per day, though that number could vary. Free users are limited to 5 queries per month. To try this, go to the Gemini website or set up the mobile app for iOS or Android.\nAlso: Why Gemini Deep Research is my new favorite rabbit hole finder - and it's free\nTo enable Deep Research, click the dropdown menu at the upper left that lists the current model. Subscribers can choose among 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro (experimental), and Deep Research with 2.5 Pro. Free users can select either 2.0 Flash or Deep Research. After choosing the model you want, the button for Deep Research should appear under the prompt. Type your question at the prompt, select the button for Deep Research if it's not already highlighted, and then submit your request.\nAfter I submitted my query about time travel, Gemini's Deep Research quickly generated an outline of how it planned to tackle my topic, which I could tweak or approve as is. I gave it a thumbs up, and Gemini took to the web to conduct its research.\nThe AI kept me informed at each step of the way, indicating the actions it was performing, the websites it was consulting, and the ways the report was progressing. The entire process took around 10 minutes.\nAlso: 5 easy Gemini settings tweaks to protect your privacy from AI\nThe resulting report was quite in-depth, thorough, and long. I liked the included table with examples of the films discussed. Gemini's writing style was more scholarly than ChatGPT's, which was less formal and more interesting to read. But Gemini still proved worthy of the task.\nPerplexity AI\nPerplexity's Deep Research mode is available for paid subscribers and free users. Pro subscribers get a whopping 500 queries per day, while free users receive five queries each day. To get started, head to the Perplexity AI website or use the app for iOS, Android, Windows, or macOS. At the prompt, type your question, select the Research button, and submit your request.\nI gave Perplexity's research mode the same time travel topic to chew on. Here, the AI kept me abreast of its progress, telling me which specific subtopics it was researching and which websites it was analyzing. Perplexity took only around five minutes to compile its findings and present its report. But the results were disappointing.\nAlso: Perplexity is the AI tool Gemini wishes it could be\nThe report itself was much shorter than those generated by the other AIs. Each theme or element garnered only a couple of paragraphs, most of which were lacking in any in-depth analysis. The report wasn't bad as a quick read. But it reminded me of a homework assignment turned in by a kid who just wanted to get it done without expending too much time or effort.\nGrok AI\nxAI's Grok 3 offers two variations of a deep research mode: DeepSearch and DeeperSearch. DeepSearch looks at a large number of online sources, though not all of them are useful or reliable. This mode also gets the job done very quickly. DeeperSearch is an upgraded version of DeepSearch that taps into more high-quality sources and takes longer to run but typically delivers a more in-depth report.\nAlso: X's Grok did surprisingly well in my AI coding tests\nWhichever mode you choose, X Premium+ subscribers enjoy an unlimited number of queries, while free and Basic users are limited to 10 DeepSearch queries every 24 hours. X also offers a $30-per-month SuperGrok plan with extended access to DeepSearch and DeeperSearch. Beyond trying Grok 3 and DeepSearch directly in X (aka Twitter), you can also use it through the dedicated Grok web page, the iOS app, and the Android app.\nTo try this, type your query at the Grok prompt, click the download arrow for DeepSearch, and choose either DeepSearch or DeeperSearch. When ready, submit your request.\nI tossed the same time travel query to Grok. With DeepSearch mode, the AI took only a minute and a half for the entire process, a speed record. DeeperSearch took slightly longer, clocking in at two and a half minutes. Given the speed, I was expecting a poor report in response. But the results surprised me. In both modes, Grok delivered reports that were interesting and informative, albeit brief. The research listed a variety of examples, a helpful table of TV shows and films, and some clever analysis. Not bad at all.\nOK, so which AI fared the best? I'd have to declare ChatGPT the winner. Though it took the longest to finish the job, its report was the most thorough, in-depth, well-written, and interesting to read. Otherwise, if you're in a hurry, Grok is certainly worth trying. Of course, all of this is based just on one query. With other topics, I might name a different champion. But the results are still worth considering the next time you need an AI to handle your own type of deep research.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "I used Perplexity to make a restaurant reservation - now I'm wondering if Google is holding us back\nZDNET's takeaways\n- Perplexity's new feature lets you make a restaurant reservation straight through OpenTable.\n- The feature uses OpenTable's system, so you don't have to trust the AI to do it for you.\n- Instead of navigating between apps or tabs to find a restaurant and then book a table, Perplexity handles everything.\nFinding the perfect restaurant and making a reservation just got a whole lot easier thanks to a new feature in Perplexity.\nThe chatbot (which ZDNET's Steven Vaughan-Nichols prefers over every other chatbot) announced a new partnership with OpenTable this week that lets you reserve a restaurant table straight from Perplexity.\nAlso: I tested 3 text-to-speech AI models to see which is best - hear my results\nThis means you can hit up the AI for ideas and make sure you have a table without switching between apps or tabs.\nTo try out the new reservation mode, I presented Perplexity with a simple query: the best date night restaurants near me. But to go a step beyond what a simple Google search would do, I asked the AI to find date night spots located in historic buildings.\nAs a bit of a foodie, I didn't expect to see anything unfamiliar on the list, but I was surprised by Perplexity's response. The AI curated a list of five local restaurants, two of which I had never heard of before. Beyond just listing locations, though, Perplexity also gave details about the history behind each building.\nI decided to give one of the new ones a shot.\nBooking a restaurant with Perplexity\nPerplexity's restaurant reservation feature isn't like ChatGPT's agent mode, which switches between two services; it actually uses the reservation platform. Making a reservation works exactly the same as if I went straight to OpenTable.\nAfter choosing a restaurant, I selected a date, time, and party size. The next screen asked for my contact information and any special requests, such as whether I was celebrating a birthday or anniversary. Once that was done, I had a table. I got a link to manage the reservation and email confirmation from OpenTable. I had no reason to doubt things worked correctly, but I was able to access my reservation by going directly through OpenTable, too.\nWhile I could accomplish the exact same thing without using Perplexity, the process was so smooth that I'll definitely use it again -- both for finding restaurants and booking a table.\nAlso: This handy AI voice recorder has changed the way I work (and it's easy to use)\nBefore, I'd usually use Google to find restaurants and then head off to another site to make a reservation. I might ask an AI chatbot for help, but I'm usually one to read through reviews first. Perplexity's partnership removes that middle step and makes the process a lot easier. In fact, after trying it out a few times, it's probably going to be my new source for trying to decide on a restaurant.\nWant more stories about AI? Sign up for Innovation, our weekly newsletter."

      "text": "Guide for the perplexed \u2013 Google is no longer the best search engine\nSeek and ye shall find\nOpinion Perplexity offers several advantages over Google as a search engine, making it a compelling alternative for many.\nBack in the 1970s, when this columnist was a happy teenage graduate student, I started my first business: Researchers at Large. I was one of the first people to make a living by being able to get answers from early search tools such as OCLC, NASA/Recon, and Dialog. Later, I used the early internet search services like Gopher, Archie, and WAIS. Then, I became one of the first users of search engines including AltaVista, WebCrawler, and Lycos. When Google came along in 1998 to topple all the other services, I'd used search services for decades.\nWhat all this means is I know how to search about as well as anyone on the planet. This is why I must tell you that Google is losing its spot as the top search engine.\nIt has been a good run \u2013 26 years \u2013 but Google has been losing its mojo for a while. It wasn't Microsoft Bing, which is still an also-run in my book. No, Google has spent the last few years shooting itself in the foot.\nIt all started because Google has been slowly losing its ad dominance, from its high of 34.7 percent in 2017 to an estimated 28.8 percent in 2024, to rivals such as Amazon, with its product search, and TikTok with its in-service search functionality. It's even beginning to look like Google may drop below 50 percent when it comes to web search-based ads.\nSo, to make up for its slowly shrinking market share, Google started injecting ads into its search results. The result? That once invaluable first page of search results is now overflowing with ads and wrong answers.\nAs writer Cory Doctorow put it so well, \"Google, the poster-child for enshittification \u2026 has decayed so badly and so rapidly that whole sections of the internet are disappearing from view for the 90 percent of users who rely on the search engine as their gateway to the internet.\"\nThis wasn't by mistake. It was by design. Ed Zitron, writer and CEO of EZPR claimed in his must-read essay, \"The Man Who Killed Google Search,\" that by putting ads over search results, \"Google's finance and advertising teams, led by CTO Prabhakar Raghavan with the blessing of CEO Sundar Pichai, actively worked to make Google [search] worse to make the company more money.\" Good for Google in the short run. Bad for everyone else in the short and long run.\nThis wouldn't have mattered so much if Google only had Bing and the like to worry about it. Unfortunately for Google, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT 3.0 arrived, and suddenly AI went from something that would matter Real Soon Now to the World Is Finally Changing.\nToday, thanks to AI, Google has some more competition. While people like to compare Google's AI-enabled search to ChatGPT and the like, most AI chatbots aren't real competition. They give you answers, which are often still too bogus to be useful, and not search results.\nThat's why Paul Buchheit, one of Gmail's creators, tweeted in 2022 that \"Google may be only a year or two away from total disruption.\nHe added: \"AI will eliminate the Search Engine Result Page, which is where they make most of their money. Even if they [Google does] catch up on AI, they can't fully deploy it without destroying the most valuable part of their business.\"\nHowever, only when an AI engine gives you the sources of its answers as well as an answer, will Google search face a major threat. That alpha competitor is Perplexity.\nBesides giving you what looks like an answer, Perplexity gives you the exact search results you need to see if the answer is right. Spoiler alert: AI answers are still wrong far too often for you to rely on. But, armed with the research Perplexity used to come up with those answers, you can work out the real answers.\nThat, my friends, is a killer app.\n- Reddit rolls out AI-powered 'Answers' search feature, redditors don't rejoice\n- OpenAI denies it is building ad biz model into its platform\n- Tech support chap showed boss how to use a browser for a year \u2013 he still didn't get it\n- How US Dept of Justice's cure for Google could inflict collateral damage\nUnlike Google, with its ad-laden results, Perplexity offers a cleaner, more focused search experience. This not only improves the user experience but also enhances the accuracy of search results, as paid placements do not influence them.\nPerplexity lets you use natural language to get search results and answers like all chatbots. If those aren't good enough, the chatbot makes it easy to refine your query to get to the right sources and answers.\nYes, learning how to create successful queries is a skill in itself, but to really get results from Google, you still need to know your way around its underlying structure, syntax, and Boolean logic. Perplexity makes search much easier.\nWhat I really love about Perplexity is that it provides links to verifiable sources alongside its responses. This enables me \u2013 and you \u2013 to fact-check and explore a topic more deeply.\nThis may not be the AI that can answer all your questions without thought that many people seem to want, but it's the smart search engine I've been waiting for all my life.\nGoogle? It will have its chance to make a comeback. If it doesn't, well, remember when Yahoo was briefly what everyone used to navigate the web? Yahoo didn't die the way AltaVista did, and neither will Google. But there are darn few people who go to Yahoo for their answers today, and Google may face a similar fate if it doesn't get its act together. \u00ae"

Most people use Chrome as their default browser, but I continue to favor Firefox for several reasons.\nFor my purposes here, I'm comparing and contrasting Firefox with Chrome and Edge in the Windows desktop browser world. Yes, there are other great desktop browsers beyond the big three, including Brave, DuckDuckGo, Vivaldi, Opera, and Tor Browser. I've tried all of those and more, both for personal and professional reasons. However, for everyday use, I typically turn to one of the majors.\nAlso: Microsoft gives Copilot a face - here's how to try your new Appearance chat buddy\nWhy Firefox, you may ask, especially when others have given up on it? Part of the reason is the force of habit. I've used Firefox for years and know all its nooks and crannies. Although I increasingly use Chrome and sometimes Edge as alternatives, I've found no compelling reasons to renounce Firefox as my default browser.\nHere are the specifics on why Firefox remains my favorite among the three major browsers and why I think it deserves more recognition and respect than it sometimes gets.\n1. Strong privacy controls\nThough Firefox, Chrome, and Edge all offer settings to help you control your privacy, Firefox stands out in this area.\nBy default, Firefox offers Enhanced Tracking Protection, which, even in Standard mode, blocks social media trackers, cross-site cookies, all tracking items in private windows, cryptominers that hijack your browser resources to mine for cryptocurrencies, and fingerprinters that try to track you through certain browser data. Also on by default is Total Cookie Protection, which prevents third-party cookies from tracking you across other websites.\nAlso: I thought my favorite browser blocked trackers, but this free privacy tool proved me wrong\nI've enabled both Enhanced Tracking Protection and Total Cookie Protection to protect my browsing activities from trackers.\nChrome and Edge have a Do Not Track option, but that's largely ineffective and unenforceable, so most websites ignore it. Instead, Firefox has an option called Global Privacy Control, which tells sites not to share or sell your data and is legally binding in certain states.\nFirefox, Chrome, and Edge all require you to sign in with an account to sync your bookmarks, passwords, extensions, settings, and other browser data. But a Mozilla account is less intrusive and invasive than a Google account or a Microsoft account, better preserving your privacy.\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\nAll three browsers let you manually remove cookies, history, and other data. But Firefox can also automatically delete cookies and other data each time you close the browser. Plus, you can set exceptions for specific sites. Google has no such option. Edge can delete browsing data when you exit, but it won't allow you to set exceptions for sites. I always enable this setting when using Firefox on a shared or public PC to remove all traces of my activity.\n2. Robust customization\nFirefox is the champ when it comes to customization. Tweaking the top toolbar is a perfect example. Just right-click on the Firefox toolbar and select \"Customize Toolbar\" from the menu. You can then easily add and remove toolbar icons just by dragging and dropping them. You can even add items to an overflow menu so they're still accessible but don't take up space on the visible toolbar. For me, using this drag-and-drop method to customize the browser is quick and simple.\nIn contrast, Chrome and Edge make you go to the Appearance section under Settings, where modifying the toolbar is a more manual and less friendly process.\nAlso: Could OpenAI's rumored browser be a Chrome-killer? Here's what I'm expecting\nFirefox, Chrome, and Edge all open a new tab page when you start the browser or launch a new tab. Chrome takes you to the Google search page, with links to websites. Edge displays a search page with news stories. Firefox also displays a search page with news items, but this area is customizable. You can add and remove specific content on the new tab page and even replace it with a URL or a blank page.\nFor the tweakers among us, Firefox can also tap into a CSS stylesheet for loads of customizations. Known as userChrome.css (despite the name, it's designed for Firefox), this file works as a typical stylesheet. You can add, remove, and modify specific style rules to control how Firefox appears. I've used this file to change the line spacing in Firefox's menus, for example.\n3. User-friendly interface\nI prefer the interface in Firefox over those in the other browsers. By customizing the toolbar, you can add icons for an easily navigable Bookmarks menu, a control to zoom in and out, a way to quickly delete your browsing history, an option to switch to full screen mode, a search tool to find text on your current page, and a way to view synced tabs. With Chrome and Edge, most of those options aren't available as toolbar icons, making them more difficult to access.\nFirefox offers a variety of built-in themes that you can apply to jazz up its appearance. I often use the Brushed Metal theme to give the browser a sleek but simple look. Lots of themes are available for Chrome and Edge. Certain ones are built into the browser. But for really cool ones, you have to head to the Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons to snag them.\nAlso: 7 browser features I can't live without that Chrome doesn't offer\nManaging open tabs is a challenge in any browser. As you open more tabs in Chrome and Edge, the size of the tab name at the top shrinks in width, making it more difficult to read. Firefox also reduces the width of the tab name, but offers ways to compensate.\nYou can cycle through recent open tabs by using the familiar Ctrl+Tab keystroke. You're able to view and access each open tab by hovering over the Firefox icon on the Windows taskbar. Plus, with Firefox's Configuration Editor, you can set a minimum tab width. Both Firefox and Edge offer a Vertical Tabs option to view open tabs vertically in the sidebar, a feature that Chrome currently lacks.\n4. Cool features\nSide panel: Firefox offers a handy side panel that you can easily tweak to display your bookmarks, tabs from other devices, your history, and various AI chatbots. I often use this panel to display my bookmarks when I want to access one page after another or manage them collectively. Chrome offered a similar feature previously, but removed it in favor of a toolbar customization option that doesn't work as well. Edge has its own Copilot sidebar that you can also customize by adding various tools and websites.\nReader view: Firefox offers a Reader View in which you can read an article or web page in a reader-friendly layout and even listen to the text read aloud. Edge has a similar Immersive Reader feature that works well. Chrome also provides a Reading Mode tool that splits your screen in half, but doesn't have a read-aloud option.\nUnified search button: Here's a feature I like. Though you can switch among different search engines and similar pages in any browser, only Firefox lets you do this task directly from the address bar. Just click the unified search button at the left end of the address bar. You can then bounce among Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Amazon, eBay, and Wikipedia. You can also search for items across your bookmarks, tabs, and history.\nBrowser containers: If you want to organize your browsing activity into different categories, Firefox has a handy feature called containers. Using Firefox containers, you're able to place web pages into color-coded tabs, with each one isolated from the other. This approach lets you separate your work and personal browsing without logging in to different accounts. Neither Chrome nor Edge offers a similar feature.\nFacebook container: All the major browsers provide their own sites for extensions and add-ons. But there's one particular extension found only in Firefox. With the Facebook container, you can prevent the social network from tracking your activities across other websites, a nasty habit that Facebook likes to pull off.\n5. Open-source underdog\nFinally, there's something to be said for supporting the underdog.\nIn the Windows desktop browser arena, Chrome is still the top dog by far (though some of the upcoming AI-based browsers may start nipping at its heels). Edge is in second place. That puts Firefox in third. But I think the browser should be defined by much more than its third-place status.\nUnlike Google and Microsoft, which are major corporate giants, the Mozilla Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a strong bent toward online privacy and transparency. That's one reason I prefer Firefox.\nAlso, if Firefox disappeared, we'd be left with just two major Windows desktop browsers, neither of which places extra emphasis on privacy. That's another reason I favor Firefox.\nAlso: This new browser won't monetize your every move - how to try it\nDespite my fandom for Firefox, I'm certainly not blind to its weaknesses nor to the criticisms leveled against it.\nWhile Chrome and Edge use the Blink engine to render web pages, Firefox taps into its own Quantum/Gecko engine. This is important because some web developers make sure their sites render properly in Chrome and Edge but leave Firefox as an afterthought.\nMany benchmarks also peg Chrome and Edge as faster than Firefox depending on the pages you load and the tasks you run. Additionally, I've found that Firefox typically chews up more memory than Chrome, especially when running multiple tabs.\nThen there are the gripes against Mozilla itself. Back in March, Mozilla changed some of the language used in its privacy policy, triggering concerns over its continued focus on user privacy.\nAs I mentioned, I use Chrome and Edge, so those browsers do play a role for me both personally and professionally. But among the three, I still favor Firefox. I find that most web pages work fine in Firefox, that the browser is fast enough, and that the focus on privacy is still strong, especially with the settings that you can tweak and tighten. For those reasons and more, I remain a dedicated Firefox user."

      "text": "I tried Perplexity's Comet AI browser, and I like where it's going (but it's not there yet)\nPerplexity Comet isn't the first AI-powered web browser to arrive. That honor goes to Dia, but thanks to the popularity of Perplexity as an AI-enabled search engine and chatbot, it's getting a lot of attention. It deserves it.\nAn agentic browser, Comet isn't just a web browser with AI glued to it, as are Chrome with Gemini and Edge with Copilot. It's designed from the ground up to use AI to automate tasks and improve your workflow.\nWhat Comet is aiming for\nIts architecture is built around an AI assistant, Comet Assistant, that lives in a sidebar. There, it can work on the content of any active webpage. So, for instance, you can ask questions about YouTube videos, analyze Google Docs, or summarize articles without leaving your page or other open tabs. You can also use it to perform such tasks as booking meetings, making purchases, or signing up for services.\nIn short, Comet Assistant is context-aware, able to reference open tabs for research, summarize content inline, and answer questions about web pages without copy-pasting. This is especially useful for tasks like comparing products across sites or analyzing information on the fly.\nAlso: 5 AI coding tips every pro should know to actually save time - and stay out of trouble\nIf you're the kind of person who keeps dozens of tabs open when you're working on a problem, you'll love how Comet can pull information from all your tabs to give you answers.\nThe answers themselves come from the main Perplexity Large Language Model (LLM). As before, I found Perplexity to give good answers, generally speaking. Better still, since Perplexity cites sources for everything it tells you, it's easy to ensure its responses are accurate.\nLet me add, for those of you who want AI to solve all your questions without work, you need to check those citations. Like all LLMs, Perplexity still frequently gets facts wrong. Always, always double-check its responses.\nLimited compatibility & availability (for now)\nComet is built on Google's open-source Chromium -- yes, it's yet another Chrome-based browser -- so it should be compatible with almost all Chrome extensions, and seamlessly import your bookmarks and settings.\nThat proved to be the case when I tested Comet on my Apple 2023 Mac Mini with an M2 processor and 8 GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia 15.5. Indeed, the setup process took mere moments, with all my Chrome bookmarks, extensions, and logins transferring over smoothly. For now, the only way you can install and run Comet is on a Mac with an M processor.\nComet will not run on an Intel-powered Mac. I know. I tried it just for giggles on my Intel-based Mac mini. I liked my old Macs, but it's past time to move on.\nEventually, you'll be able to run Comet on Windows, but it won't be in the next few days. Sometime after that, Comet will be available on Linux. While the browser itself is free -- and always will be -- for now, you must also be a Perplexity Max tier subscriber, which costs $200 per month to use it fully. Even then, not everyone will get it immediately. Perplexity is rolling it out gradually to waitlisted users. As users are added, new ones will receive a limited number of invites to share.\nAlso: Perplexity joins high-powered, high-priced AI race - here's everything 'Max' includes\nIf you can't wait, you can download the program for the Mac today. However, it won't be fully functional unless you've received an invitation. The one feature you will be able to use in Perplexity will be able to read your current tabs and use their information to answer your queries. You'll also frequently see an error message telling you, \"Your Comet experience is restricted.\"\nMy experience with Comet\nOnce I had it installed, I found it worked quickly, but its performance wasn't outstanding. Rather than just relying on my impression, I benchmarked the program with Speedometer 3.1. This is an open-source web browser benchmark that measures web application responsiveness by timing simulated user interactions on various workloads across many popular JavaScript frameworks and technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue. Started by Apple, Speedometer is now under the guidance of Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.\nOn Speedometer, Comet had a score of 29.3, while Chrome 138, the latest version, scored 34.3. Keep in mind, however, as a beta program, Comet contains code that hasn't been optimized for speed yet.\nI'm sorry to report that some of Comet's features are still not working well. In particular, Comet Assistance promises it could do all kinds of neat things with my Gmail and Google Calendar accounts, such as answering emails, booking appointments on my schedule, you know, the usual \"How AI will make your life easier stuff.\" Spoiler alert: It failed.\nAlso: I loved Arc browser and was skeptical of its agentic Dia replacement - until I tried it\nBuilt on Google's Chromium, it should work smoothly with Google services. It doesn't. Specifically, while Perplexity Comet is designed to integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar and automate associated tasks, I had a heck of a time authenticating my Gmail account with it.\nMy problem was that Perplexity Connector and Google kept refusing to sync with each other. Even after I got it nailed down, while Comet Assistant could read, summarize, and search emails or calendar events, it often failed to perform more advanced actions like sending emails, replying, or managing calendar invites. This is due to conflicts with Google security restrictions, which prevent third-party tools from executing specific actions on a user's behalf without explicit, repeated authorization. In many cases, Comet provided manual follow-up instructions, but that was a pain.\nOf course, if privacy is a concern, you don't want to use Comet at all. While it includes a native ad blocker out of the box, according to its privacy policy, \"Your input and output, such as questions, prompts and other content that you input, upload or submit to the Services, and the output that you create, and any collections or pages that you generate using the Services\" will be kept by the company. So, if you give it access to your Google account, any data pulled from it will be in Perplexity's hands as well.\nThis should not be a shock. If you use AI, AI will use your data. If you're willing to make the trade, any AI system will make that deal with you.\nI like what Comet is trying to do, but it's just not there yet. Give it time. I think Perplexity will get it there.\nIn the meantime, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has grand dreams for Comet. At the June Bloomberg Tech Summit, he said, \"If people are in the browser, it's infinite retention. Everything in the search bar, everything on the new tab page, everything you're doing on the sidecar, any of the pages you're in, these are all going to be extra queries per active user, as well as seeking new users who just are tired of legacy browsers, like Chrome.\" Yes, you're not reading between the lines, Google and Chrome are the target.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

The AI-fueled web browser is set to launch this month, as first spotted by Testing Catalog.\nHints about the AI search engine developer's plan for a browser have been seen here and there in recent weeks, including a a new homepage, separate from Perplexity\u2019s main website, a Learn Comet button on some people's Perplexity web interface, and even a briefly viewable promotional video that Perplexity soon took down.\nBased on the drip of information, it looks like Perplexity is pitching Comet as a Google Chrome alternative that can aid in any research you need done online. Comet will apparently integrate with Google services, as well as access your history and follow along with your browsing to respond in context to your requests. So, you might ask Comet to \u201cfind that thing I was looking at about sea otters last Tuesday,\u201d and it will dig up the article about how they hold hands to keep from losing each other. No more keyword-guessing or digging through all of your open tabs like an archaeologist of your own disorganized mind.\nThe eye on taking Chrome's crown isn't hyperbole, either. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has already boasted about how Comet will beat Chrome when it comes to reopening old tabs, declaring that \"Chrome is on its way out.\"\nOn Comet, you can simply ask in English what you want it to reopen specifically. No need to remember fancy shortcuts. Chrome is on its way out. https://t.co/qCg6CoKCx2April 30, 2025\nComet AI\nPerplexity is attempting to get ahead of the biggest obvious concern some might have about Comet, namely, privacy. The idea of a browser that reads what you\u2019re looking at and remembers what you did last week might sound convenient to some, but like dystopian surveillance to others. Comet will have privacy settings, including native ad-blocking, and an opt-out for data sharing.\nMeanwhile, the competition isn\u2019t standing still. Microsoft is stuffing increasingly bold AI features into Edge, and of course, Google Chrome is expected to unveil many new AI integrations at Google I/O this year. Comet will need to make its AI assistance feel intuitive to stand out. If Comet's AI can help you stay focused, organized, and smart about navigating the chaos of the internet, it could entice a lot of new users. If not, it risks being seen as more of an unhelpful Chrome extension.\nPerplexity needs to get past people asking if they really need another browser, and promise to resolve your frustrations with your current one. If you\u2019re tired of being bombarded with ads and manually digging through your history, Comet, when it comes, might offer a welcome change.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

      "text": "Dell buys EMC for $67 billion: Will bigger be better?\nDell said it will acquire EMC for about $67 billion in cash and stock in what equates to a bet that bigger is better in enterprise technology and hybrid data centers.\nThe combination of Dell and EMC will create the largest \"privately-controlled, integrated technology company.\"\nFeatured\nHere's the big question: Will bigger necessarily be better for enterprise customers? EMC and Dell are creating a mega-vendor just as other technology players such as Hewlett-Packard and eBay are splitting up to compete with nimbler rivals.\nEMC shareholders will get $24.05 a share in cash and a tracking stock that represents VMware. EMC owns a majority stake in the virtualization giant. EMC shareholders will get 0.111 shares of the VMware tracking stock for each EMC share they own.\nAdd it up and EMC shareholders get about $33.15 a share in cash and the tracking stock of VMware, which remains a publicly traded independent company. Dell plans to increase its interest in VMware over time.\nThe deal, which is expected to close in mid-2016, is financed via equity from Michael Dell, MSD Partners, Silver Lake, and Temasek, debt financing, cash and the issuing of the tracking stock. Dell and his partners will own 70 percent of the combined company.\nDell will remain CEO and chairman. EMC's CEO Joe Tucci will stick around until the deal closes. In a letter to customers, Dell said:\nWe are bringing together Dell's strength in small-business and the mid-market with EMC's strength in large enterprises. Together, we can serve you better and fuel innovation across our end-to-end portfolio of solutions and across customer segments to generate significant cash flows. In fact, the expected revenue synergies of our combination are three times the cost synergies. This union is all about opportunity, growth and innovation for us and for you. We will be positioned to meet our obligations and continue to invest for the long term success of your organization.\nOn a conference call, Tucci said \"we are entering a new era where the IT landscape is seeing massive disruption and vast opportunities.\" Tucci said the Dell merger was the best way to position EMC for the future.\n\"We will have complementary market portfolios,\" said Tucci.\nKey points:\n- Pivotal will operate as it is now under current leadership.\n- VMware will remain independent.\n- The combined company can have $1 billion in synergies.\n- The companies will look to grow converged infrastructure, cloud and data center businesses.\n- EMC's core businesses will remain based in Hopkinton, Mass.\nWith the move, Michael Dell largely transforms his company, which went private to diversify the business away from PCs.\nThe EMC acquisition will do the trick. The combined company aims to be a leading enterprise player in the following markets:\n- Servers;\n- Storage;\n- Virtualization via VMware;\n- Converged infrastructure (EMC owns VCE);\n- Hybrid cloud;\n- Mobile;\n- And security via RSA, which is owned by EMC.\nThe combined company will also have a big data play via its Pivotal unit. The lineup in the combined company will go from various end points right to the data center.\nUltimately, EMC and Dell are going to have to combine their wares in an integrated way. EMC's federation approach was a handicap for enterprise customers and the narrative was hard to follow.\nDell noted that the companies are complementary and will be able to invest in research and development. Dell made a point throughout its statement to point out EMC's Virtustream unit. That emphasis is worth noting since EMC acquired Virtustream to build out a managed cloud business. To play to the hybrid cloud market, EMC and Dell will both need a public compute story.\n\"Our investments in R&D and innovation along with our privately-controlled structure will give us unmatched scale, strength and flexibility, deepening our relationships with customers of all sizes,\" said Dell.\nPutting the parts together\nOne thing worth noting about the Dell-EMC merger announcement is that the financial disclosure was lacking. Usually companies provided combined revenue figures and synergy possibilities. EMC and VMware executives talked about their financials, but Michael Dell wasn't on the conference call.\nSince Dell is private, its side of the revenue equation wasn't detailed.\nJefferies analyst James Kisner has modeled some scenarios and estimates that the combined company will have revenue between $74 billion and $76.5 billion. That estimate is based on a partial VMware spin off, which may be similar to the tracking stock arrangement.\nR&D will likely be about 5 percent of revenue in the combined companies. Total debt for the combined company may be in the $50 billion to $53 billion range, according to Kisner. It remains to be seen if that debt load is an issue over time.\nAs the deal was announced, both EMC and VMware outlined third quarter results.\nEMC said its third quarter revenue will be between $6.05 billion and $6.08 billion with non-GAAP earnings of about 43 cents a share. That tally fell short of expectations. Wall Street was looking for revenue of $6.24 billion with non-GAAP earnings of 45 cents a share.\nHowever, EMC did note that there was a build in unshipped storage product orders. Those bookings will show up in the fourth quarter. That development hurt earnings by 2 cents a share.\nVMware raised its outlook for the third quarter on Monday, as the company aims to show it can continue to execute while parent EMC and Dell prepare their merger.\nThe company said its third quarter revenue will be $1.67 billion, up 10 percent from a year ago with non-GAAP earnings of $1.02 a share. CFO Jonathan Chadwick said that VMware was pleased with results and revenue growth would have been 14 percent in constant currency. VMware's net income for the third quarter will be about 60 cents a share.\nWall Street was looking for revenue of $1.66 billion with non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents a share.\nThe two outlooks from EMC and VMware highlight that the combined company will have to manage a slower growth storage business and depend on software defined data center licenses for revenue gains. Dell's real rationale for the EMC purchase may ultimately be VMware in terms of value creation.\nExecutives said that Dell intends to acquire more of an economic interest in VMware over time.\nThe questions ahead\nOn the surface, EMC and Dell fit together pretty well. The sales teams are largely complementary and the product lines fit together well. There's no arguing that Dell-EMC will have a full stack for enterprises to buy. The only gap would be networking, but VMware's software defined efforts may change that equation.\nEMC's VCE converged infrastructure still includes Cisco as a partner. Cisco will remain a partner going forward.\nTucci said on a conference call that the merger is \"historic.\" Whether Tucci's take is correct depends on how the combined companies address the following questions:\n- How will EMC and Dell compete with hyperscale cloud providers? EMC and Dell will be able to sell all the cloud building blocks an enterprise wants to buy. But it's not clear whether enterprises will want to build their infrastructure. EMC and Dell need to compete with the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Credit Suisse estimates that every dollar that goes to Amazon Web Services is $4 lost to traditional IT vendors.\n- Does the narrative become easier? EMC's big problem was that its federation approach was confusing and it wasn't clear whether units could truly operate as one. With VMware independent, Pivotal operating as is and EMC continuing to be based in Massachusetts the EMC federation just looks like it's renamed under the Dell banner.\n- Product roadmaps match, but will sales teams? Enterprise customers are likely to deal with both Dell and EMC reps and account managers. How those accounts come together will be critical. Executives noted $1 billion in revenue synergies are possible.\n- Will VMware be seen as independent? VMware will become a tracking stock of the combined Dell-EMC, but the ecosystem could rumble. EMC's ownership of VMware wasn't as worrisome to the likes of Cisco, HP and Lenovo since the company's specialty was storage not servers. Dell is a major server player and competitive with VMware partners.\n- Will this deal actually happen? There's a 60-day go shop provision for EMC. In other words, EMC has two months to find a better deal beyond Dell. Cisco could swoop in as a buyer. The list of companies that could pull off an acquisition this large is short. But the uncertainty is an overhang."

Lately, like everyone else, I've been looking at AI a lot more closely. While it's nifty and getting genuinely useful, it can still blunder, like the time Google's AI Overviews recommended users to eat \"at least one small rock per day.\" AI can also lose its mind, such as when Grok went totally MechnaHitler. Even when I tell J. Random Chatbot to summarize an Otter.ai transcription of a meeting, it gets things wrong.\nAlso: 60% of managers use AI to make decisions now, including who to promote and fire - does yours?\nTherefore, I treat the results of my AI queries with great caution. However, I found an AI chatbot whose work I can easily double-check to ensure it's in the ballpark of being accurate: Perplexity.\nThat may not sound like much, but it's a critical feature. Because AI chatbots are trained on information scraped from the web, they are all capable of hallucinating or spouting errant nonsense. For instance, a recently published AI-generated list of the 15 best novels to read this summer included 10 novels that didn't exist. Whoops.\nSure, Perplexity also hallucinates, but it values data from trustworthy sources. Here's what it can do, and why it's my favorite AI chatbot.\n1. Reliable for research\nI'm very picky about my research programs. I have reason. My first business, which I founded in 1978, was named Researchers at Large. In those days, I used the online databases of the day -- DIALOG, NASA RECON, and OCLC -- to do paid academic research. My research skills remain a major reason why I'm still a successful journalist. Today, Perplexity is good enough that it has become the first AI chatbot I trust as a genuine research tool.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT isn't the only one worth trying\nFor example, chances are you've never heard of him, but I did some of my doctoral work on Dr. Norman Leys, an early 20th-century East African anti-imperialist. Perplexity provided a decent summary of his career, and, importantly, pointed me to the academic studies that cover his life in more detail. Other AI chatbots provided me with much broader and sometimes inaccurate information, but they didn't disclose their sources. Because I studied his life, I could tell the difference. Most people would never realize they'd been led astray.\nBy the way, before you commit to using any AI chatbot, I recommend that you do the same. Ask it detailed questions about a topic you know very well, whether it's Pittsburgh Steelers football in the '70s, Star Wars movies, or clog dancing. If it provides accurate answers to obscure questions and clearly sources the information, you can be more certain that it's worth using.\nI found that Perplexity does this with all the topics it covers. Whether you're doing academic, investment, or sports research, it can handle complex queries and provide accurate, detailed, and context-aware answers.\n2. Source and citation quality\nAnother element that makes Perplexity great for research is its sources. Most notably, it gathers its data from academic studies and other reliable sources. It doesn't consider Joe Random's comments to be just as valid as Dr. Josephine Expert's refined answer.\nThe free Focus feature also lets you fine-tune your searches and avoid some sources. When I was looking up Norman Leys, for example, I told Perplexity to use only academic sources, so I could avoid Wikipedia and other less reliable sites. Or, if you need helpful content on how to fix your washing machine, you can set it to focus only on YouTube videos.\nAlso: The best AI search engines of 2025\nSince I first looked at Perplexity, other major chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly improved their citation and source transparency features. While they're closing the gap, Perplexity's attribution is still better at telling you precisely where it got its answers. For example, while it might still pull part of an answer from Reddit, it will tell you where to find the specific post it's quoting from. You can then look for yourself to see if you think the information is trustworthy.\nLet me add, though, that the accuracy of all chatbots is on the decline. I find that their answers now are less trustworthy than when I first checked in with Perplexity in May 2024. That's because AI's large language models (LLMs) are now \"learning\" from AI-written results. The result is garbage-in/garbage out, or -- as it's more formally known in AI circles -- we're already going into Model Collapse.\nThe moral of the story? When Perplexity gives you an answer, dig deep into those citations. You may find, as I do sometimes now, that the citations themselves are based on AI slop.\nFinally, Perplexity has one good feature that, as far as I know, no other AI has. It tells me when it can't find an answer. The others all too often make up answers from whole cloth. While prone to hallucinations like all the LLMs, Perplexity appears to try to stick to the facts.\n3. Depth and organization\nHere's another subject close to my heart that most people don't know that well: I feel Shoeless Joe Jackson should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Unless you're a hard-core baseball fan, you'll most likely know of him from the movie Field of Dreams. While Perplexity doesn't mention the movie or the book it was based on, W.P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, the chatbot did a good job summarizing the arguments, pro and con, for letting him back into baseball. Now that Major League Baseball has reinstated Shoeless Joe, along with a guy you probably have heard of, Pete Rose, Joe should finally make it.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nWhere Perplexity stands out from the rest is that it also provided additional questions to continue my search, including: What is the history of Shoeless Joe Jackson's ban from baseball? What other players have been banned from baseball? And \"What is the Black Sox Scandal?\"\nWhatever topic you're interested in, Perplexity will help you dig deeper into the subject.\nAs you examine an issue, the Collections feature helps you organize your findings and thoughts in a structured manner. You can keep your research notes to yourself or share them with up to five co-workers or friends.\n4. Integration with multiple LLMs\nUnlike other popular AI chatbots, Perplexity AI Pro ($20/month) and Max ($200/month) users can access multiple LLMs. Thus, you can pull answers from OpenAI GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude and Sonnet 4.0, DeepSeek R1, Google Gemini 2.5, xAI Grok 4.0, in addition to its own model, Sonar, which is based on Llama 3.1 70B.\nFree users default to Sonar Large with limited access to advanced models for a few queries per day. Perplexity AI Pro ($20/month) users can manually select their models or use \"Best Mode\" to automatically choose the model that Perplexity thinks is best for their query. Pro users can also use \"Pro search\" to dig deeper with its internet search, with up to three times the number of sources for the usual query.\nPerplexity Max ($200/month) includes all the above and access to more advanced AI models such as OpenAI o3-pro and Claude Opus 4.\nAlso: I tried Perplexity's Comet AI browser, and I like where it's going\nThis multimodel approach enables you to select the best model for your specific needs, thereby enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the responses. The Pro version allows you to toggle between different LLMs, providing you with a tailored search experience or enabling you to compare answers from different chatbots without exiting Perplexity.\nTo switch between models, take the following steps:\n- Open Perplexity AI on your browser and log in to your account.\n- Click the gear icon in the interface's bottom-left corner to open the Settings menu.\n- In the Settings menu, look for the AI Model section under the Perplexity Pro subsection.\n- Select from the available models.\n- After selecting your preferred model, ensure that you save the changes.\nWhat actually happens when using another AI model? First, Perplexity takes your question and works with your selected model to understand your question. Then, Perplexity's web search engine, which, for my money, is the best web searcher available today, gathers the relevant web content. Perplexity then feeds this back into your chosen model, and that model provides the answer. Perplexity then delivers that response to you and adds citations, if required, so you know where the answers came from.\nAlso: Perplexity joins high-powered, high-priced AI race - here's everything 'Max' includes\nIn addition, Pro users and above can create images with Perplexity. They can also use other models such as DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL, and Flux1 to make images.\nOf course, you could use the other chatbots directly. Perplexity's value lies in combining real-time web search with model-based synthesis, grounding answers in up-to-date, sourced information, and providing interactive features such as follow-up questions, document/image uploads, and context-aware threads. Lastly, it's more cost-effective to use Perplexity alone rather than subscribing to multiple LLMs.\nThe one caveat is that if the model has any special features, you won't be able to use them from Perplexity. So, for example, ChatGPT enables you to assemble GPTs -- custom AI assistants that can work with other programs such as Zapier, Google Sheets, or Slack -- but you can't get to these from Perplexity.\n5. Optimized news and search\nWhile many chatbots now pull information from the web in real time, Perplexity, which has been at this longer than the others, still does the best job of pulling in current information.\nPerplexity updates its search data in real time for each individual query. When you submit a question, Perplexity performs a live web search, retrieving the latest information from trusted sources at the moment you ask, rather than relying on a fixed database or cached results. This approach ensures answers reflect the most up-to-date facts, news, and developments. This is in stark contrast to most LLMs that operate from a dataset frozen in the past.\nAlso: 5 projects Perplexity's new Labs AI tool can whip up for you now - in minutes\nThe tool also uses contextual search to bridge the gap between traditional search engines and LLMs. This enables you to make structured searches that can help you find exactly what you're looking for, rather than simply hoping that the right keywords will give you the answer you want on the first page of results.\nI much prefer this user experience over Google's search experience, which tends to be cluttered with ads and AI-generated slop that may or may not answer my query.\nI'm not the only one who prefers Perplexity for search.\nA recent Harvard Business School case study, \"Perplexity: Redefining Search,\" found that \"Perplexity had rapidly evolved from a modest startup into a popular 'answer engine' that directly challenges Google and other search engines.\" The study highlights how Perplexity's core features, real-time web search, answer synthesis, and citations, are driving user migration from traditional search engines. The report credits Perplexity's \"user-centricity, speed, and quality\" as essential to its rapid adoption and trust among consumers and enterprises..\nIf you don't need Perplexity to search the web or news, and just need an answer to, say, a programming question, you can click the Focus button and change it to \"Writing mode.\" This will give you results only from Perplexity's LLMs. The results will resemble those provided by ChatGPT and other AI chatbots.\nOverall, Perplexity AI is my pick over other chatbots because it excels at detailed research, but it can also translate between languages, generate document summaries, and answer both simple and complex questions. Plus, you can use it to do the usual AI tricks, such as creating poems, code, email messages, and articles.\nAlso: The best AI image generators: Gemini, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and more\nIt doesn't do everything. Unlike other chatbots, such as Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT with DALL-E 3, Perplexity does not include free AI image creation functionality. You have to subscribe to Perplexity Pro or Max for basic AI-image creation tools, and they're not equal to the best AI image generators.\nThat said, if you need reliable, in-depth answers to your queries, it's my top choice. Although it may not receive as much attention as Google, Meta, Microsoft, or OpenAI, the results speak for themselves.\nWant more stories about AI? Sign up for Innovation, our weekly newsletter."

      "text": "Could OpenAI's rumored browser be a Chrome-killer? Here's what I'm expecting\nSometime soon, perhaps as early as next week, OpenAI will follow up on its release of ChatGPT agent with its AI-enabled web browser.\nOfficially, neither OpenAI nor its usually chatty CEO, Sam Altman, has anything to say about this browser. Unofficially, it's an open secret that the company is working on one to compete not just with the already shipping AI-enabled web browsers, Perplexity Comet, and Dia, but with the 800-pound gorilla of web browsers, Google Chrome.\nWhy? Just look at ChatGPT agent. For all of the usual AI agent tricks in its bag, such as ordering groceries or booking meetings, it's still an external program that runs its own computer to handle \"complex tasks from start to finish,\" with a \"visual browser that interacts with the web.\" Behind the scenes, it leverages Operator's ability to interact with websites, Deep Research's skill in synthesizing information, and ChatGPT's intelligence and conversational fluency to deliver good answers.\nAlso: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon\nAs Altman said at a May 2025 Sequoia Capital event, people use ChatGPT differently depending on age: \"Older people use ChatGPT as a Google replacement\", while \"people in their 20s and 30s use it like a life advisor\" and \"people in college use it as an operating system.\" To do any of these, whether you're a Boomer, GenX, Millennial, or Generation Alpha, you use a browser.\nSo it makes perfect sense for OpenAI to offer a dedicated web browser. Today, most of us use our web browsers for all our work. How many tabs do you have open right now? Would you rather open another, separate program or just stay in your browser? Yeah, me too. I'd rather stay in the browser.\nWhat to expect from OpenAI's AI browser\nTherefore, what I expect the program to look like is a Chromium-based web browser -- because it's what everyone outside of Mozilla uses now -- with a fully integrated AI assistant. This will combine everything that the current assistant offers with full browser integration. So, for example, just like Comet already does, it will be able to pull data from your open tabs to give better responses to your requests.\nAlso: Too many open browser tabs? This is still my favorite solution - and has been for years\nIn addition, since Chromium is a de facto industry standard, OpenAI won't have to reinvent the browser wheel. It will also make it easier for OpenAI's browser to support existing websites, extensions, and web apps. That way, its developers can focus on integrating advanced AI features.\nEarly reports purporting to come from developers and beta releases suggest it will also include features such as AI-generated summaries of articles, videos, and PDFs, and support for images, voice, and files, building on capabilities seen in GPT-4o. In addition, beyond traditional autofill, the browser is purported to be able to intelligently complete forms and schedule tasks based on user intent. For example, I use different email accounts for business and personal use. Theoretically, it would know to use my work account for my Delta and Marriott travel reservations, but my personal account for my Amazon orders.\nBy owning the browser, OpenAI will get access not just to user questions, but pretty much all user behavior and data. Historically, that's been the cornerstone of Google's business model, and OpenAI, and all the other AI companies, would love to grab that brass ring as well.\nAlso: 5 reasons why I still prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\nIn turn, that means the more access OpenAI gets to your data, the less you'll be giving to Google or other third parties. That's a win-win from where Altman sits.\nThe AI browser competition\nAs for its AI browser competitors, OpenAI's strategy appears to be about embedding AI as the user's digital proxy. In the best of all possible worlds, you'll get up in the morning, and start working and playing with OpenAI until the close of the day.\nComet with Perplexity, on the other hand, has a more traditional take. It's a browser for deep researchers and professionals, with an emphasis on summarization, contextual understanding, source citing, and cross-tab automation. It replaces traditional search with Perplexity's own answer engine.\nAlso: AI's biggest impact on your workforce is still to come - 3 ways to avoid getting left behind\nDia is a ground-up rebuild with AI as the default mode of interaction. It promises a \"workspace OS,\" where AI proactively manages workflows, recalls session history, suggests next actions, and contextualizes intent. With it, you're not so much browsing as you're letting it drive you to your destinations and answers.\nLet's not forget Google has a horse in this race, too. Google's approach is incremental but ambitious. It's been embedding conversational AI into daily browsing while avoiding sudden, disruptive changes. For example, Gemini in Chrome has brought conversational AI directly into the browser interface. With it, you can now invoke Google's Gemini right from the current web page if you have one of Google's AI subscriptions: The $20-per-month Google AI Pro plan or the $250-per-month Google AI Ultra plan.\nHowever, it's unlikely that Google will integrate AI as deeply into its browsers as other companies will. You must remember that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is still pushing Google to divest Chrome. Integrating AI deeply into Chrome won't help its case. Indeed, it's possible OpenAI might end up buying Chrome.\nOf course, Microsoft is even more all-in on AI in its programs. Microsoft Edge is now a Copilot-native browser. Users can access Copilot with a single click from the sidebar or by typing @copilot in the address bar, turning the browser into a real-time AI assistant that can answer questions, summarize pages, and help with creative tasks, all without leaving the current tab.\nAlso: Coding with AI? My top 5 tips for vetting its output - and staying out of trouble\nAs you also almost certainly know, AI is now baked into Windows 11. Microsoft started building AI into Windows in 2023. These days, Copilot is such an integral part of Windows that with Copilot Vision on Windows 10 and 11, it can look over your virtual shoulder at everything on your screen to help you work.\nNeed I add that at this point, if you use any of these programs, you can kiss your privacy goodbye?\nThat said, which will be best for you? Personally, I prefer Perplexity and Comet, but it's too early to say for certain. AI programs change so quickly that it's almost impossible to keep up with them. I wouldn't commit to any of them at this point. I would, on the other hand, kick their tires. Chances are you'll be using one of them sometime soon."

      "text": "Perplexity says Cloudflare's accusations of 'stealth' AI scraping are based on embarrassing errors\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Cloudflare claims Perplexity ignores websites' wishes in its content hunt.\n- Other AI companies, such as OpenAI, don't wipe content, Cloudflare says\n- Cloudflare now offers services to block aggressive AI crawlers.\n- Perplexity is denying Cloudflare's claims.\nCloudflare, a leading content delivery network (CDN) company, has accused the AI startup Perplexity of evading websites' \"no crawl\" directives by stealthily deploying web crawlers to scrape content from sites that have explicitly blocked its official bots.\nIf that sounds familiar, you've heard these accusations before. Last year, WIRED and Forbes both accused Perplexity of doing the same thing to their sites.\nHow Perplexity allegedly bypasses 'no crawl' directives\nAccording to Cloudflare, when Perplexity's web crawler encounters a robots.txt file, which sites use to block their content from being crawled, Perplexity pretends to be an ordinary Chrome web browser on a Mac. This enables it to bypass the bot barriers.\nAlso: Perplexity's Comet AI browser is hurtling toward Chrome - how to try it\nCloudflare started investigating when it received complaints from customers who had \"both disallowed Perplexity crawling activity in their robots.txt files and also created WAF [Web Application Firewall] rules to specifically block both of Perplexity's declared crawlers: PerplexityBot and Perplexity-User.\" The customers said their content still ended up in Perplexity, even after they had blocked it.\nThe CDN then set up new test domains, explicitly prohibiting all automated access in its robots.txt files and through specific WAF rules that blocked crawling from Perplexity's acknowledged crawlers. Cloudflare found that Perplexity would use multiple IP addresses not listed in its official IP range and rotate through these IPs to sneak into the sites' content and records.\n\"In addition to rotating IPs, we observed requests coming from different Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) to evade website blocks,\" Cloudflare said. \"This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day.\"\nAlso: Samsung users can get Perplexity Pro AI free for an entire year - that's $240 off\nThe result? Cloudflare said it observed \"Perplexity not only accessed such content but was able to provide detailed answers about it when queried by users.\"\nCloudflare's plan to stop Perplexity\nMoving forward, Cloudflare has claimed its bot management system can spot and block Perplexity's hidden User Agent. Any bot management customer who has an existing block rule in place is already protected.\nIf you don't want to block such traffic on the grounds that it might be from real users, you can set up rules to challenge requests. This allows real humans to proceed. Customers with existing challenge rules are already protected.\nAlso: I tested ChatGPT's Deep Research against Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok AI to see which is best\nFinally, Cloudflare has added signature matches for the stealth crawler to its managed rule, which blocks AI crawling activity. This rule is available to all Cloudflare customers, including free users.\nCloudflare noted that OpenAI does obey the robots.txt restrictions and doesn't try to break into websites. That said, Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\nCloudflare has recently started offering its customers the option to automatically block all AI crawlers. To complement the move to block AI crawlers, Cloudflare has also launched its Pay Per Crawl program, enabling publishers to set rates for AI companies that want to scrape their content.\nAlso: 5 reasons why I still prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\nThis follows numerous deals in which media businesses are permitting AI companies to legally use their content to train their large language models (LLMs). Examples include The New York Times with Amazon, The Washington Post with OpenAI, and Perplexity with Gannett Publishing.\nIn the meantime, Perplexity appears to continue to break the rules in its hunt for content. ZDNET has asked Perplexity about Cloudflare's claims, but the company has not responded.\nPerplexity strikes back\nSince then, Perplexity has publicly and loudly announced that Cloudflare has it all wrong. In a blog post, Perplexity claims:\nThis controversy reveals that Cloudflare's systems are fundamentally inadequate for distinguishing between legitimate AI assistants and actual threats. If you can't tell a helpful digital assistant from a malicious scraper, then you probably shouldn't be making decisions about what constitutes legitimate web traffic.\nThose are fighting words! Further, Perplexity states, \"Technical errors in Cloudflare's analysis aren't just embarrassing -- they're disqualifying. When you misattribute millions of requests, publish completely inaccurate technical diagrams, and demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of how modern AI assistants work, you've forfeited any claim to expertise in this space.\"\nThis fight is on.

I'll dig into just about any AI-related technology and see what I can make it do. Many of you have read my ongoing shootouts comparing AIs for programming and AI content checkers, among other kinds of tools.\nBut that's using AI in a rigorous lab environment to provide test results to ZDNET readers. Like many of you, I've also started using AI to augment my workflow and increase my productivity.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nI wear a lot of hats; I run a small business with my wife, who also has her own business, where I'm the tech guy and designer. I also work with a number of industry groups. I have a fairly popular security software product for WordPress users. And I'm constantly working on projects, ranging from 3D printing the ultimate charging tower, to trying to make an AI-assisted Etsy store, to composing and publishing music, and using an AI for help with some of the marketing activities.\nI should note that I never, ever use AI to produce my core content. No article, song, or social media post is ever written using an AI tool. My work product is mine. But I do use AI to help me get through other aspects of my workload.\nI have a particular interest in how AI helps programming, how AI can support graphics work, and how AI can support video production.\nHere are the tools I'm willing to pay for -- and why.\n1. ChatGPT Plus - $20/mo\nSpeaking of AI and programming, it has essentially doubled my programming output. I use AI to help me with common-knowledge programming. I talked about it in-depth in my 25 tips article, but the core benefit is getting ChatGPT to write code for published APIs, so I don't have to spend time searching for code examples and trying to reverse-engineer comments on various programming boards.\nAnd yes, I mentioned ChatGPT. While more chatbots capable of passing my programming tests have been introduced in the last year, ChatGPT does the job well enough, and hey, who wants another monthly fee?\nAlso: How ChatGPT actually works (and why it's been so game-changing)\nIn fact, that's a big part of why I'm paying $20/mo for ChatGPT Plus. Sure, I've signed up and paid for some of the other AIs just to test them, but ChatGPT Plus is the only chatbot I have found so consistently useful that I keep it as a regularly used tool.\nI use ChatGPT for lots of research tasks, sometimes throwing math problems at it, and all sorts of other questions and problems I'm dealing with. While I never take its output as an unimpeachable source of truth, I do find ChatGPT to be a very useful sounding board, substantially more so than a quick Google search.\nNow, to be fair, I did outline five ways that an AI could help me in Gmail. If Gemini could do these things reliably, I'd sign back up in a heartbeat. But I just don't need the current email message I'm reading summarized, and I sure don't need it to write a friendlier or more professional version of whatever I've currently written. I tried Gmail's new AI unsubscribe feature, and it only found about 10 newsletters, yet I get thousands of emails and hundreds of newsletter-style messages every day. So, I'm leaving that one unbought.\n2. Midjourney - $10/mo\nI played around a lot with DALL-E, ChatGPT's earlier image generation tool. But recently, OpenAI introduced a new image generator in GPT-4o, and it's quite the beast. I have found that it generates great results, but it has more guardrails than another tool I pay for, Midjourney.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nBut even though I get image generation with my $20/mo ChatGPT Plus fee, I pay an extra $10/mo for Midjourney. Why?\nOne of the reasons is subjective. I like a lot of the images I get with Midjourney. Midjourney also allows me to describe artist styles, and lets me riff off a vast array of stylistic choices. ChatGPT, perhaps because of guardrails imposed by OpenAI, doesn't present as many choices.\nBut I also have two specific and objective reasons for paying for Midjourney. First, because image generation is so subjective, it's nice to have a variety of tools when seeking a representation of what you have in your head. I'll try different prompts and even the same prompts with both tools and take what works best.\nAlso: How to selectively modify a Midjourney image to create an artistic statement\nSecond, every month I generate a promotional image for my wife's online business. She has an e-commerce site that supports a popular hobby. Each month, on her very active Facebook group, she gives a craft-along theme to her users. I generate an image for that theme. Over the months, I've found that Midjourney does a far better job of generating an image that incorporates elements of the hobby. That said, some months I bounce back and forth between both tools until I can get an image that meets her business's needs.\nBecause Midjourney shaves what used to be two to three hours of work pushing pixels in Photoshop to generate those images down to about 10 minutes, it's worth the $10/month to me just for that project.\nPhotoshop Generative Fill - Honorable mention\nIn the title of this article, I said I pay for two AI tools. That's sort of true. I pay for Adobe's Creative Cloud suite in addition to ChatGPT Plus and Midjourney. But since I've been using and paying for Creative Cloud -- and before that, Photoshop -- long before there was generative fill, I'm not counting it in my AI tools list.\nAlso: I use Photoshop's AI tool every day - here are my 5 essential tips for the best results\nIf Adobe removed generative fill tomorrow, I'd still pay for Photoshop. To be clear, I don't like paying for it. It's costly, and the two-computer license limitation is restrictive. But a few years back, I tried switching to Affinity Photo, which at the time was $50 (it's now $70). That one-time fee is roughly what I pay each month for Creative Cloud, so it had a lot of potential.\nTo be clear, Affinity Photo is a fine application. But I've been using Photoshop since before the Clinton administration. To say I have Photoshop muscle memory is an understatement. It's a product I use almost every day. Switching to another application, while I could do it if I had to, slows down my workflow considerably.\nAlso: What to do if Generative Fill is grayed out in Adobe Photoshop AI\nSo, I don't consider my monthly expense for Creative Cloud to be an AI expense. That said, I find generative fill (and its various other AI tricks) very helpful. I often use it in concert with Midjourney and ChatGPT image generation.\nThree tools I'm thinking about\nI run a business online and, as such, rely on a wide variety of cloud services. Those fees add up, and now they're all going up in price. So while it might be nice to add more AI tools, I'm keeping it under control. It's very easy to just click OK and find yourself spending hundreds of dollars more every month.\nThat said, I am thinking about adding three more tools. I'm a bit hesitant, because each one has its annoyances and limitations, but they're on the short list for a quick order if I can ever justify an immediate performance improvement on one project or another.\nNotion AI\nThe first is Notion AI. I am deeply invested in Notion for all my project work. I also use it to write and organize all my articles, as well as schedule them, plan them, research them, and capture notes and assets. Notion AI is interesting because it would work like NotebookLM, limiting its knowledge base to my Notion account. That could be very useful as I work on more projects. But at one point, when Notion overcharged my wife's account, they were completely unsupportive and unsympathetic. So, I hesitate to give them more business.\nNotebookLM Pro\nGoogle's NotebookLM Pro is another contender. Now that Pocket, the article archiving service, is being discontinued, I considered using NotebookLM Pro as a replacement. The idea that I could save articles in NotebookLM as sources and then have the AI review them, summarize them, and analyze them seemed ideal, especially as a research tool.\nBut... the free version of NotebookLM only allows 50 sources per notebook. The Pro version, which is normally another $20/mo ( you can usually get a few starter months at a discounted rate), increases that limit, but only to 300 sources per notebook. My archive has well over 30,000 sources, which is beyond NotebookLM's limits. There is a $249/month plan (yowzah!), but all Google will say about limits is \"Highest limits and best model capabilities (later this year)\". What does that even mean?\nDescript\nDescript (for $16-$24/mo) is an AI video editing tool. This isn't a tool that does text-to-video generation. Instead, it's a tool that helps you take your video clips and edit them. Right now, I'm a very big Final Cut Pro user. Final Cut has added some AI features, but it lags far behind DaVinci Pro and Premiere Pro (because Apple lagging in AI is no surprise, right?).\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my top trick for debugging what it generates\nDescript automatically removes filler words and retakes, cleans up sound quality without any fuss, and does automatic multicam editing. It also promises to take long-form videos and automatically create clip videos, which could be a huge time-saver. The product also has some more \"out there\" features which I wouldn't use, including fake avatar generation and fake speech generation.\nThe thing is, Descript is aimed more at multiple talking head videos. I'm not sure it could handle the sort of in-depth technical hands-on project videos I do. So, it's still in the \"maybe someday\" category, for now at least.\nWhat do you use?\nDo you pay for any AI tools? Which ones, and why? Is there an AI tool that you strongly recommend I should be using that I didn't mention?

      "text": "Google controls an illegal monopoly in internet search, US judge rules\nA US District Court judge has found that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in online search and search advertising, violating US antitrust laws.\nOn Monday, Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia handed down his ruling: the company violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by stifling competition and arranging exclusive and restrictive contracts with other companies. In a case that the US Department of Justice filed in 2020 and took to court in September 2023, the ruling represents a major blow to Google.\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in the 277-page ruling.\nAlso: You can now use Google Lens with your voice to search. Here's how\nSiding with the DOJ, the judge found that Google engages in practices that prevent rival companies from competing fairly. Judge Mehta also criticized the company's contracts with Apple and other tech players that require them to use Google as the default search engine in their products.\n\"The long-drawn-out decision by a federal judge, Judge Amit Mehta, that confirmed Google's violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act was significant and expected,\" Ted Sfikas, field CTO at digital analytics provider Amplitude, told ZDNET. \"Judge Mehta focused on Google general search services and search advertising, but all of the other satellite services are impacted too.\"\nFollowing the judge's ruling, the Antitrust Division of the US DOJ issued a statement from Attorney General Merrick Garland and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter.\n\"This victory against Google is a historic win for the American people,\" Garland said. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\nCalling this a landmark decision that holds Google accountable, Kanter said it \"paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\nConsidering Google's search engine is responsible for 90% of all searches, Sfikas called it one of the strongest monopolies to ever exist.\nAlso: How to use Google Wallet - and why you should already\n\"Imagine if AT&T owned 90% of the telecom market,\" Sfikas said. \"Would your phone bill be higher or lower? Businesses realistically have no choice but to advertise with Google's search ads. Only 6% use Bing, and I don't blame them. Is it Google's fault that everyone uses their search engine? We could say 'No, it's not,' but only if the typical consumer could easily choose the other ones using a simple interface that walks them through it.\"\nIn a response posted on X, Google Global Affairs President Kent Walker announced the company's intention to appeal the decision:\nThis decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.'\nGiven this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal.\nDespite finding Google culpable of violating antitrust laws, the judge didn't suggest any penalties, at least for now. Instead, the court will rule on possible remedies sometime in the next few months. And for that, Sfikas suggests looking to the past.\n\"We can look at past history to get a sense of what might happen to Google now,\" Sfikas said.\n\"In 1998, it was Microsoft that first encountered an antitrust suit from the US government. Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, was determined to be so intertwined with the Windows operating system that it was causing a barrier to entry in the adjacent web application market,\" Sfikas said. \"Microsoft settled this suit by decoupling the browser from the operating system and this ushered in an age of competing browsers and the subsequent online applications that we know and use today, like Google, Amazon, TikTok, Meta.\"\nIronically, it's now online applications that have helped Google achieve a dominant position, Sfikas added. Google's share of the market is linked to Chrome, the Google Ad Network, the Google Ads Hub, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager, affecting prices and the quality of service. The government will take the approach that this harm to the market is the reason it took action, a position that Google will naturally argue.\n\"Based on all of this, I believe Google will settle in much the same way its predecessor in [the] antitrust case did,\" Sfikas said. \"They will voluntarily make it a distinct choice as to which browser to use, not just a checkbox per se, but an actual screen that offers immediate download of any other browser right at the beginning when you first turn on your Android [device].\"\nOn a greater scale, what does the ruling itself mean for the search engine and online advertising markets?\n\"If the ruling results in a decomposition of [the] search engine upon devices and browsers, that should result in increased usage of Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and many more.\" Sfikas said. \"With the upcoming release of the highly anticipated OpenAI Search engine, this may further recalibrate the market. In either or both scenarios, the result will be a more agnostic data architecture in place globally to work with them all.\"\nThe legal battles aren't over for Google. The company faces another trial in September focused on digital advertising. A lawsuit filed in January 2023 by the DOJ and several states accuses Google of monopolizing the market for online advertising. That trial stands to impact Google even more dramatically.\n\"When the AdTech trial starts this September, I believe the stakes are much higher,\" Sfikas said. \" I believe that Google's monopoly within the system of Google's Ad Network, Search, Ads Hub, and Analytics constitute a unique platform and unfair market advantage that no other competitor can replicate. I believe that the government will move to split those platforms up as separate entities, in an effort to decouple Search from the Ad Network.\""

      "text": "If Google is forced to give up Chrome, what happens next?\nIt's going to be very, very interesting in a 'May you live in interesting times' way\nOpinion When Donald Trump entered the White House, I expect Google thought its worries were over. A million-dollar \"donation\" for the inaugural ball, some face time between Sundar Pichai and Trump \u2013 and President Joe Biden's pesky Department of Justice (DoJ) demanding Google divest itself of its Chrome web browser would all be forgotten.\nDoJ wants Google to sell off Chrome and ban it from paying to be search default\nREAD MORERight? Wrong. Instead, Trump's DoJ still wants Google to sell off Chrome.\nDarn it! As 19th century American politician Simon Cameron said, \"An honest politician is one who, when he is bought, will stay bought.\" You can't count on anyone these days.\nSo what happens next? Well, besides the obvious of a bigger contribution to, say, the 2028 Trump presidential campaign.\nHere's what's in the cards. First, Google may end up selling Chrome. Chrome is worth serious money. It's easily the most popular web browser. The best market numbers for browsers, I've found, are those provided by the US federal government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP). It gives us a running count of the last 90 days of US government website visits. While it doesn't tell us much about global web browser use, it's the best information we have about American web browser use.\nAccording to DAP, Chrome is number one, as of May 7, 2025, with 51.7 percent. Safari, thanks to the iPhone, is second with 30.3 percent. My guesstimate for Chrome on the desktop would be close to 70 percent, while Statcounter shows it at 66.19 percent.\nWith that kind of market share, there are already numerous would-be buyers. There are, in no particular order:\nOpenAI: The ChatGPT maker has expressed strong interest in acquiring Chrome to integrate its AI capabilities directly into the browser. The goal here would be to create an \"AI-first\" browsing experience.\nThis would enable OpenAI to expand its user base and embed AI-powered search and agents more deeply than current Chrome extensions. OpenAI's head of product testified about this interest during the antitrust trial, highlighting the strategic value of Chrome's vast user base and data for advancing AI technologies.\nYahoo \u2013 yes, Yahoo, remember them? \u2013 after years of being barely an afterthought on the web, wants back in the game. Yahoo views Chrome as a critical asset for its comeback strategy, aiming to re-enter and compete in the search market. Owning Chrome would provide Yahoo with immediate scale and distribution, supporting its ambitions in search, social engagement, and advertising.\nNow, you might well ask, \"How can Yahoo afford this?\" I've seen estimates of Chrome being worth $50 billion, while frankly, I think it could go for a lot more. According to Yahoo's search GM Brian Provost, the company might be able to pull it off with backing from its parent company, Apollo Global Management.\nOpenAI's not the only AI power that lusts for Chrome. Perplexity, the AI-driven search startup, has also shown interest in buying Chrome, thereby leveraging the browser's massive reach to boost its own services. While Perplexity is developing its own browser, Comet, let's face it, acquiring Chrome would be a shortcut to user acquisition and enhance data collection for tailored advertising.\nWould you believe DuckDuckGo, the anti-Google search engine, wants Chrome? Believe it. Although CEO Gabriel Weinberg expressed interest in Chrome as the foundation for a privacy-focused alternative, Weinberg acknowledged DuckDuckGo probably can't afford Chrome's high price tag. Still, hope springs eternal.\n- America's cyber defenses are being dismantled from the inside\n- AI running out of juice despite Microsoft's hard squeezing\n- Musk's move fast and break things mantra won't work in US.gov\n- Windows 10's demise nears, but Linux is forever\n- The US government wants developers to stop using C and C++\nWhile not explicitly confirmed, word is that Microsoft, too, is interested. After all, it already has investments in browsers, the Chrome-based Edge, search, and Bing. However, acquiring Chrome would raise antitrust concerns about consolidating browser market power.\nWhat about Firefox developer Mozilla? It has its own worries. The last thing Mozilla wants is for Google to be fully spanked by the Dept of Justice. What's that you say? Isn't Firefox Chrome's arch-enemy? Please. Stop with the fanboi nonsense.\nAs well as demanding a Chrome sell-off, American prosecutors also hope to ban Google from paying other browser makers \u2013 including Moz \u2013 to be the default for web search. Mozilla can't survive without the cash it gets from Google search.\nDon't believe me? Would you believe Mark Surman, President of Mozilla? In a blog post, giving Mozilla's response to DoJ's demands on Google, Surman said, \"The big unintended consequence here is the handing of power from one dominant player to another. So, from Google Search to Microsoft, or Bing for example \u2013 while shutting out the smaller, independent challengers that actually drive browser innovation and offer web users privacy and choice.\u201d\nWithout this money, Mozilla feels it couldn't develop and maintain Gecko, Firefox's web browser engine. That, in turn, means, Surman claimed, \"it's game over for an open, independent web. Look, Microsoft \u2014 a $3 trillion company \u2014 already gave up its browser engine in 2019, and Opera gave up theirs in 2013. If Mozilla is forced out, Google's Chromium becomes the only cross-platform browser engine left.\"\nThere is another card in play, which I haven't seen mentioned. You may not have noticed, but I sure did, that back in January, Google and the Linux Foundation announced the founding of Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers. This is a neutral space where developers and the broader open source community can collaborate to support Chromium projects. Guess what? Major tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, and Opera, already support this initiative.\nWhat this means, I think, is that even if Google is forced to sell Chrome, it could replace it with a true open source web browser with broad industry support. This way, Google would technically comply while still having a browser to call its own.\nLike I said in the beginning, we're living in interesting times. \u00ae"

In 2016, Dell acquired EMC in a massive $67 billion deal. The agreement also included EMC's majority stake in VMWare, which now has a market cap of around $50 billion, as well as ownership of Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA and VirtuStream.\nEarlier this year, Dell disclosed that it was considering a reverse merger with VMware as part of its public market return. While that scenario didn't quite play out, VMware is still integral to Dell's strategic maneuvering. VMware is financing the cash component of the deal with a one-time, $11 billion special dividend paid pro-rata to its shareholders.\nOnce the deal closes, DVMT shareholders (Class V shareholders) will own between 20.8 percent and 31 percent of Dell depending on cash election amounts.\n\"Over the last five months, with the assistance of our independent financial and legal advisors, we have conducted a thorough evaluation of a number of alternatives to maximize stockholder value,\" said a special committee of VMware directors.\nMichael Dell, who will continue on as CEO and chairman after the deal, said he remains committed to the company's long-term strategy and the independence of VMware.\n\"Unprecedented data growth is fueling the digital era of IT, and we are uniquely positioned with our portfolio of technologies and services to enable the digital, IT, security and workforce transformations of our customers,\" he said. \"After the transaction concludes, I am looking forward to VMware's continued independent status, strategy and capital allocation policy for organic investment, M&A and shareholder returns.\"\nGoing forward, industry analyst Patrick Moorhead expects Dell to capitalize on its most profitable market opportunities, including IoT, the edge, AI and connectivity, all buttressed by software and services from VMware, RSA, Secureworks and Pivotal.\n\"Dell loses its ability to be as nimble from quarter to quarter, but the reality is that it had to file quarterly reports anyways, given its VMware stake,\" said Moorehead. \"The street will scrutinize its GAAP versus non-GAAP numbers but as I have tracked those numbers for years, the two have come closer together.\"\nRead also: How Dell aims to raise awareness of environmental issues - TechRepublic\n\"Paying down the debt will be key, but given some giant, industry downturn, I don't see that as an issue,\" Moorhead added. \"The company paid down 25 percent of its $42 billion debt in two years and cash flow is strong.\"\nPrevious and related coverage:\nMicrosoft, VMware, Dell team up on IoT offering\nJoint Internet of Things offering to combine Azure IoT Edge, VMware Pulse IoT Center, and Dell Edge Gateways.\nDell Technologies aims modular data center at AI, machine learning\nDell Technologies eyes composable architecture, PowerMax storage, PowerEdge servers, and converged systems for handling emerging and new workloads.\nDell changes its approach and goes OS-agnostic in security\nZDNet caught up with Dell's data security chief at the RSA Conference to hear how the PC industry is changing its approach to cybersecurity."

      "text": "What is ChatGPT? How the world's most popular AI chatbot can benefit you\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot with advanced natural language processing (NLP) that allows you to have human-like conversations to complete various tasks. The generative AI tool can answer questions and assist you with composing text, code, and much more.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT\nIt's currently open to use for free. OpenAI launched a paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus in February 2023, which guarantees users access to the company's latest models, exclusive features, and updates but is not necessary for basic usage.\nWhat is ChatGPT used for?\nChatGPT offers many functions in addition to answering simple questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, have philosophical conversations, do math, and even code for you.\nThe tasks ChatGPT can help with don't have to be so ambitious. For example, my favorite use case for ChatGPT is to help create basic lists for chores, such as packing and grocery shopping, and to-do lists that make my daily life more productive. The possibilities are endless.\nZDNET has published many ChatGPT how-to guides. Below are some of the most popular ones.\nUse ChatGPT to:\n- Write an essay\n- Create an app\n- Write code\n- Build your resume\n- Write Excel formulas\n- Summarize content\n- Write a cover letter\n- Start an Etsy business\n- Create charts and tables\n- Browse the web\n- Create custom AI assistants\n- Analyze PDFs\n- Digitize handwritten notes\n- Write Arduino drivers\nIs ChatGPT available for free?\nChatGPT is free, regardless of what you use it for, including writing, coding, and much more.\nThere is a subscription option, ChatGPT Plus, that costs $20 per month. The paid subscription model gives you extra perks, such as priority access to GPT-4o, DALL-E 3, unlimited photogeneration, Canvas, Voice Mode, and the latest upgrades.\nAlso: ChatGPT vs ChatGPT Plus: Is it worth the subscription fee?\nAlthough the subscription price may seem steep, it is the same amount as Microsoft Copilot Pro and Google One AI Premium, which are Microsoft's and Google's paid AI offerings.\nHow can you access ChatGPT?\nOn April 1, 2024, OpenAI stopped requiring you to log in to ChatGPT. Now, you can access ChatGPT simply by visiting chat.openai.com. You can also access ChatGPT via an iPhone, Android, or desktop app.\nOnce you visit the site, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT. A great way to get started is by asking a question, similar to what you would do with Google. You can ask as many questions as you'd like.\nAlso: ChatGPT no longer requires a login, but you might want one anyway. Here's why\nCreating an OpenAI account still offers some perks, such as saving and reviewing your chat history, accessing custom instructions, and, most importantly, getting free access to GPT-4o. Signing up is free and easy; you can use your existing Google login.\nFor step-by-step instructions, check out ZDNET's guide on how to start using ChatGPT.\nIs there a ChatGPT app?\nYes, an official ChatGPT app is available for iPhone and Android users. Make sure to download OpenAI's app, as many copycat fake apps are listed on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store that are not affiliated with OpenAI.\nAlso: I changed 5 ChatGPT settings and instantly became more productive - here's how\nThere's also a ChatGPT app for MacOS and Windows, which lets you access the chatbot quickly via a keyboard shortcut. The Mac app was initially only available for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but OpenAI recently made it available to all users. The Windows app is still limited to ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise, and EDU users.\nIs ChatGPT safe?\nPeople have expressed concerns about AI chatbots replacing or atrophying human intelligence.\nFor example, chatbots can write an entire essay in seconds, raising concerns about students cheating and not learning how to write properly. These fears even led some school districts to block access when ChatGPT initially launched.\nNow, not only have many of those schools decided to unblock the technology, but some higher education institutions have been catering their academic offerings to AI-related coursework.\nAlso: Two ways you can build custom AI assistants with GPT-4o - and one is free\nAnother concern with AI chatbots is the possible spread of misinformation. ChatGPT says: \"My responses are not intended to be taken as fact, and I always encourage people to verify any information they receive from me or any other source.\" OpenAI also notes that ChatGPT sometimes writes \"plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.\"\nLastly, there are ethical and privacy concerns regarding the information ChatGPT was trained on. OpenAI scraped the internet to train the chatbot without asking content owners for permission to use their content, which brings up many copyright and intellectual property concerns.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to analyze PDFs for free\nThere are also privacy concerns regarding generative AI companies using your data to fine-tune their models further, which has become a common practice. OpenAI lets you turn off training in ChatGPT's settings.\nSo, is ChatGPT safe? If your main concern is privacy, OpenAI has implemented several options to give users peace of mind that their data will not be used to train models. The company even allows you to turn off your chat history. If you are concerned about moral and ethical problems, they are still being hotly debated.\nWill my conversations with ChatGPT be used for training?\nCompanies train generative AI models on user inputs. Therefore, when familiarizing yourself with how to use ChatGPT, you might wonder if your specific conversations will be used for training and, if so, who can view your chats.\nAlso: This ChatGPT update fixed one of my biggest productivity issues with the AI chatbot\nOpenAI will, by default, use your conversations with the free chatbot to train data and refine its models. You can opt out of it using your data for model training by clicking on the question mark in the bottom left-hand corner, Settings, and turning off \"Improve the model for everyone.\"\nCan ChatGPT help me apply for jobs?\nYes, ChatGPT is a great resource for helping with job applications. Undertaking a job search can be tedious and difficult, and ChatGPT can help you lighten the load. ChatGPT can build your resume and write a cover letter.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write an essay\nIf your application has any written supplements, you can use ChatGPT to help you write those essays or personal statements. You can also use ChatGPT to prep for your interviews by asking ChatGPT to provide you mock interview questions, background on the company, or questions that you can ask.\nCan you use ChatGPT for schoolwork?\nChatGPT can be an excellent resource in assisting students with their work. A popular misconception is that ChatGPT and other AI resources will do students' work for them. However, it can be used as a personal tutor or editor, giving students assistance outside of the classroom.\nAlso: 5 free AI tools for school that students, teachers, and parents can use, too\nFor example, a student can drop their essay into ChatGPT and have it copyedit, upload class handwritten notes and have them digitized, or even generate study outlines from class materials.\nIt is especially helpful for coding homework since most coding languages are very character-sensitive, and one missing semicolon can throw the entire result off. Instead of staring at the screen for ages, you can ask ChatGPT to identify errors for you, which allows you to grow.\nWhat does ChatGPT stand for?\nThe last three letters in ChatGPT's namesake stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a family of large language models created by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate human-like, conversational text.\nAlso: What does GPT stand for? Understanding GPT 3.5, GPT 4, GPT-4 Turbo, and more\nThe \"Chat\" part of the name is simply a callout to its chatting capabilities.\nCan ChatGPT generate images?\nYes, ChatGPT can generate images using DALL-E 3. However, the limits vary depending on whether you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber or a free user. ChatGPT Plus subscribers are allowed 50 generations per day, while free users are allotted two.\nAlso: The best AI image generators of 2024: Tested and reviewed\nSince OpenAI discontinued DALL-E 2 in February 2024, the only way to access its most advanced AI image generator, DALL-E 3, through OpenAI's offerings is via its chatbot.\nMicrosoft's Copilot offers free image generation, also powered by DALL-E 3, in its chatbot. This is a great alternative if you don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus but want high-quality image outputs for free.\nHow does ChatGPT work?\nChatGPT runs on a large language model (LLM) architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Since its launch, the free version of ChatGPT ran on a fine-tuned model in the GPT-3.5 series until May 2024, when OpenAI upgraded the model to GPT-4o. Now, the free version runs on GPT-4o mini, with limited access to GPT-4o.\nAlso: How does ChatGPT actually work?\nWith a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access GPT-4, GPT-4o mini or GPT-4o. Plus, users also have priority access to GPT-4o, even at capacity, while free users get booted down to GPT-4o mini.\nThe LLMs used in generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more, typically via web scraping, where the entirety of the internet is scraped for information.\nWho owns ChatGPT currently?\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. OpenAI has also developed DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3, popular AI image generators, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives\nAs a result, OpenAI owns ChatGPT. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI thanks to multiyear, multi-billion dollar investments. Elon Musk was an investor when OpenAI was first founded in 2015 but has since completely severed ties with the startup and created his own AI chatbot,Grok.\nIs ChatGPT better than a search engine?\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot created to converse with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help users find information. One is not better than the other, as each suits different purposes.\nWhen searching for as much up-to-date, accurate information as possible, your most reliable option is a search engine. It will provide you with pages upon pages of sources you can peruse.\nAlso: ChatGPT has officially replaced Google Search for me - here's why\nIn November 2024, OpenAI already unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature within the ChatGPT app that lets users search the web for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources.\nWith ChatGPT Search, you can enter your sentence as your train of thought takes you, and the AI will understand the meaning of your query by leveraging its NLP capabilities. This means you can spend less time crafting a tailored search query but still get exactly what you want.\nIf you are looking for a platform that can explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, then ChatGPT might be what you want. If you want the best of both worlds, plenty of AI search engines combine both.\nThe search experience is available on the ChatGPT website, desktops, and mobile apps for all ChatGPT Plus, Team users, and SearchGPT waitlist users.\nWhat is SearchGPT?\nSearchGPT is an experimental offering from OpenAI that functions as an AI-powered search engine that is aware of current events and uses real-time information from the Internet. The experience was a prototype. OpenAI integrated the best features directly into ChatGPT with ChatGPT Search.\nUpon launching the prototype, users were given a waitlist to sign up for. However, shortly after, OpenAI closed its waitlist. Those users were given priority access to ChatGPT Search when it launched.\nWhat is ChatGPT Search?\nIn November, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature that lets users search the web directly within ChatGPT for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources. The tool can be called on manually or activated whenever a user prompt could benefit from web-based information.\nWhat are ChatGPT's limitations?\nDespite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT still has limitations. Users sometimes need to reword questions multiple times for ChatGPT to understand their intent. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in responses, which can sometimes be plausible-sounding but are verbose or make no practical sense.\nAlso: Police are using AI to write crime reports. What could go wrong?\nInstead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model guesses what your question means, which can lead to poor responses. Generative AI models are also subject to hallucinations, which can result in inaccurate responses.\nDoes ChatGPT give wrong answers?\nAs mentioned above, ChatGPT, like all language models, has limitations and can give nonsensical answers and incorrect information, so it's important to double-check the answers it gives you.\nAlso: 8 ways to reduce ChatGPT hallucinations\nOpenAI recommends you provide feedback on what ChatGPT generates by using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to improve its underlying model. You can also join the startup's Bug Bounty program, which offers up to $20,000 for reporting security bugs and safety issues.\nCan ChatGPT refuse to answer my prompts?\nAI systems like ChatGPT can and do reject inappropriate requests. The AI assistant can identify inappropriate submissions to prevent unsafe content generation.\nAlso: 6 things ChatGPT can't do (and another 20 it refuses to do)\nThese submissions include questions that violate someone's rights, are offensive, are discriminatory, or involve illegal activities. The ChatGPT model can also challenge incorrect premises, answer follow-up questions, and even admit mistakes when you point them out.\nThese guardrails are important. AI models can generate advanced, realistic content that can be exploited by bad actors for harm, such as spreading misinformation about public figures and influencing elections.\nDoes ChatGPT plagiarize?\nYes, OpenAI scraped the internet to train ChatGPT's models. Therefore, the technology's knowledge is influenced by other people's work. Since there is no guarantee that ChatGPT's outputs are entirely original, the chatbot may regurgitate someone else's work in your answer, which is considered plagiarism.\nAlso, technically speaking, if you, as a user, copy and paste ChatGPT's response, that is an act of plagiarism because you are claiming someone else's work as your own. This act could have repercussions based on the rules enforced by your workplace or educational institution.\nIs there a ChatGPT detector?\nIn short, the answer is no, not because people haven't tried, but because none do it efficiently.\nIn January 2023, OpenAI released a free tool to detect AI-generated text. Unfortunately, OpenAI's classifier tool could only correctly identify 26% of AI-written text with a \"likely AI-written\" designation. Furthermore, it provided false positives 9% of the time, incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced.\nAlso: I tested 7 AI content detectors - they're getting dramatically better at identifying plagiarism\nThe tool performed so poorly that, six months after its release, OpenAI shut it down \"due to its low rate of accuracy.\" Despite the tool's failure, the startup claims to be researching more effective techniques for AI text identification.\nOther AI detectors exist on the market, including GPT-2 Output Detector, Writer AI Content Detector, and Content at Scale's AI Content Detection tool. ZDNET tested these tools, and the results were underwhelming: all three were unreliable sources for spotting AI, repeatedly giving false negatives. Here are ZDNET's full test results.\nWhat is GPT-4?\nGPT-4 is OpenAI's language model, much more advanced than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in a series of simulated benchmark exams and produces fewer hallucinations.\nWhat is GPT-4o?\nGPT-4o is OpenAI's latest, fastest, and most advanced flagship model. As the name implies, GPT-4o has the same intelligence as GPT-4. However, the \"o\" in the title stands for \"omni,\" referring to its multimodal capabilities, which allow the model to understand text, audio, image, and video inputs and output text, audio, and image outputs.\nAlso: 6 ways OpenAI just supercharged ChatGPT for free users\nThe model is 50% cheaper in OpenAI's API than GPT-4 Turbo while still matching its English and coding capabilities and outperforming it in non-English language, vision, and audio understanding -- a big win for developers.\nWhat is ChatGPT o1?\nIn September 2024, OpenAI unveiled its o1 models, which are capable of more advanced reading, making them ideal for math, science, and coding. For example, it scored 83% on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam. For comparison, GPT-4o correctly solved only 13% of problems.\nAlso: What are o1 and o1-mini? OpenAI's mystery AI models are finally here\nZDNET's David Gewirtz put o1- preview to the test and was impressed by its ability to tackle several complex tasks with lots of detail, including writing a WordPress plugin, rewriting a string function, finding an annoying bug, and more.\nWhat are the best ChatGPT alternatives?\nAlthough ChatGPT gets the most buzz, other options are just as good -- and might even be better suited to your needs. ZDNET has created a list of the best chatbots, all of which we have tested to identify the best tool for your requirements.\nAlso: Claude AI can now analyze PDFs - here's how to try it\nDespite ChatGPT's extensive abilities, other chatbots have advantages that might be better suited for your use case, including Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, and more.\nWhat are GPTs?\nOpenAI once offered plugins for ChatGPT to connect to third-party applications and access real-time information on the web. The plugins expanded ChatGPT's abilities, allowing it to assist with many more activities, such as planning a trip or finding a place to eat.\nAlso: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus features and the remarkable things I can do with them\nHowever, on March 19, 2024, OpenAI stopped letting users install new plugins or start new conversations with existing ones. Instead, OpenAI replaced plugins with GPTs, which are easier for developers to build.\nWith the latest update, all users, including those on the free plan, can access the GPT Store and find 3 million customized ChatGPT chatbots. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of spam in the GPT store, so be careful which ones you use.\nWhat is Microsoft's involvement with ChatGPT?\nMicrosoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the AI startup behind ChatGPT, long before ChatGPT was released to the public. Microsoft's first involvement with OpenAI was in 2019 when the company invested $1 billion. The company invested another $2 billion in the years after. In January 2023, Microsoft extended its partnership with OpenAI through a multiyear, multi-billion dollar investment.\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Copilot: Which AI chatbot is better for you?\nNeither company disclosed the investment value, but unnamed sources told Bloomberg that it could total $10 billion over multiple years. In return, OpenAI's exclusive cloud-computing provider -- Microsoft Azure, powers all OpenAI workloads across research, products, and API services.\nMicrosoft has also used its OpenAI partnership to revamp its Bing search engine and improve its browser. On February 7, 2023, Microsoft unveiled a new Bing tool, now known as Copilot, that runs on OpenAI's GPT-4, customized specifically for search.\nHow does Copilot compare to ChatGPT?\nCopilot uses OpenAI's GPT-4, which means that since its launch, it has been more efficient and capable than the standard, free version of ChatGPT, which was powered by GPT 3.5 at the time. At the time, Copilot boasted several other features over ChatGPT, such as access to the internet, knowledge of current information, and footnotes.\nAlso: I was a Copilot diehard until ChatGPT added these 5 features\nIn May 2024, however, OpenAI supercharged the free version of its chatbot with GPT-4o. The upgrade gave users GPT-4 level intelligence, the ability to get responses from the web, analyze data, chat about photos and documents, use GPTs, and access the GPT Store and Voice Mode. After the upgrade, ChatGPT reclaimed its crown as the best AI chatbot.\nWhat is Gemini and how does it relate to ChatGPT?\nGemini is Google's AI chat service, a rival to ChatGPT. On February 6, 2023, Google introduced its experimental AI chat service, which was then called Google Bard.\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?\nOver a month after the announcement, Google began rolling out access to Bard first via a waitlist. Now, the tool is available to the public. The biggest perk of Gemini is that it has Google Search at its core and has the same feel as Google products. Therefore, if you are an avid Google user, Gemini might be the best AI chatbot for you.\nWhat is Apple's involvement with OpenAI?\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference in June 2024, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will integrate ChatGPT with Siri. With the user's permission, Siri can request ChatGPT for help if Siri deems a task is better suited for ChatGPT. This feature has not yet been released to users."

      "text": "What Google's antitrust loss means for you and the future of search\nIn a landmark decision, Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court ruled Google violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by stifling competition and arranging exclusive and restrictive contracts with other companies. As Mehta wrote in his decision, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" Well, that's plain enough.\nAlso: Google controls an illegal monopoly in internet search, US judge rules\nMehta found Google engaged in practices that prevented its rivals from competing fairly. He's got a point. By StatCounter's reckoning, Google owns the lion's share of the search market with 91%, followed by Bing with a paltry 3.86%. DuckDuckGo? It's trailing with a meager 0.62%.\nIn particular, Mehta criticized the company's contracts with Apple, Samsung, other smartphone companies, and Mozilla -- contracts that required them to use Google as the default search engine for their products. In particular, Google reportedly paid Apple $18 billion annually to secure its position as the default search engine on iOS devices. Other firms received over $8 billion a year to ensure that Google was their search engine of choice.\nGoogle, of course, denied that this was why its search engine was their pick. Google Global Affairs President Kent Walker replied, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\" Them's fightin' words!\nWhat will this mean for users? In the short run, nothing. Google has already announced that it will appeal the decision.\nWhat will it mean in the long run? Well, we'll see. Before this, the only technology lawsuit of this scale was the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit, US versus Microsoft. In theory, Microsoft lost that case. In practice, Netscape died, and for over a decade, Internet Explorer was the browser of choice. For all practical purposes, Microsoft was the winner.\nAlso: How to delete yourself from internet search results and hide your identity online\nIn addition, the court has yet to propose any specific remedies to put Google in its place. For example, the court might force Google to break up its business operations, restrict its ability to enter into exclusive agreements, or make users decide when they first use a browser whether they want Google or another search engine.\nOriginally, in the Microsoft case, Microsoft was supposed to be broken up, but that was later overruled. Other remedies were put in place but amounted to little.\nGoogle, in its case, may not be so lucky. Why? Because in this go-around Google is facing not just the courts and its old rivals Microsoft and Yahoo but a new generation of AI-driven search engines.\nAI-powered search engines, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing Copilot, and Perplexity, have been gaining traction. These engines use large language models (LLMs) to understand and respond to user queries more naturally and intuitively.\nAlso: 3 ways Google just supercharged your Chrome browser with AI - and they're surprisingly useful\nThis AI twist makes a big difference.\nBack in the late 1970s and early 1980s, my first business -- Researchers at Large -- was based on my ability to master the primitive search engines of the day, such as NASA RECON, DIALOG, and OCLC. Things got easier with AltaVista and, eventually, Google. Even now, though, using Google effectively requires mastery of search techniques.\nThe engines still aren't as good as I am, but they're getting much closer. There's a big enough difference from doing it yourself that I can see these chatbots giving Google a run for its money.\nOf course, Google has tried its own AI-enabled search improvements. However, its efforts, especially AI Overview, have failed so far.\nIn addition, unlike Microsoft, Google's main competitor, some experts have speculated that Google's AI-driven search might not just damage content creators but Google's own ad revenue. John Wihbey, associate professor of media innovation and technology at Northeastern University, thinks \"Google might be cannibalizing their own revenue stream.\"\nStasia research expert Tiago Bianchi agrees, writing that, \"Errors performed by Bard during its release made Google lose around 100 billion US dollars in market value, despite other tools committing similar inaccuracies. Later, sresults on Google's AI Overviews echoed the embarrassment.\"\nAlso: How to turn on Private DNS Mode on Android - and what it can do for you\nIf this analysis is correct, AI-driven search may not be to Google's advantage. However, its competitors -- which aren't wedded to an ad business model -- might be perfectly happy to offer AI-based search.\nBianchi warns, though, that AI-driven search has yet to prove it can steal significant market share from Google. \"Despite over a quarter of surveyed US adults trying and sustaining reasons for using AI-powered search tools across all generations, the majority remains unimpressed or skeptical about AI-tailored results. With little changes in the market share of big search companies, the trend sees more optimism among marketers, who strongly believe in the effectiveness of chat-based search advertising and reflect the enormous investments in the sector.\"\nHe's not alone. Chris Rodgers, CEO of the SEO firm CSP, told me, \"Yesterday's ruling could help Open AI down the line if Google's appeals are unsuccessful. However, it is expected to be a long, drawn-out process. Google could end up seeing a loss of search-market share if they are removed as the default search engine on mobile devices; however, as long as it's the search engine of choice for the majority of consumers, Google will remain the dominant search engine, even if OpenAI or other AI search-engines erode search-market share.\"\nAlso: Your Google Search results are about to look very different. Here are 4 reasons why\nStill, just as the Microsoft case judgment had the potential to change the web browser and PC market, this decision might change the search engine market. Certainly, the combination of AI search, a legal battle, and Google potentially losing its automatic position on iPhones and Android phones may change how we search.\nStay tuned. There's more to come."

      "text": "5 great Chrome browser alternatives that put your privacy first\nIn this age of constant digital malice, it's beyond the point where everyone should be thinking \"security first.\" All it takes is one momentary lapse of reason, and a bad actor has your information.\nYou don't want that.\nNor do you want third parties to collect your data.\nWith that in mind, Chrome should be considered a problem because it has a constant target on its back and is known to be one of the biggest offenders of data collection, profiling, and fingerprinting.\nAlso: How I made Perplexity AI the default search engine in my browser (and why you should too)\nWhat do you do?\nFortunately, there are plenty of Chrome-based alternatives that take security up a notch or two.\nLet me offer you a few suggestions.\n1. Brave Browser\nBrave is one of the most secure Chrome-based browsers on the market. It was created by the creator of JavaScript and is fairly locked down by default. Not only does Brave not store user information, but it also includes built-in blockers for ads, trackers, scripts, fingerprinting, and third-party storage. On top of all the blockers, Brave also includes built-in access to the Tor network and a user-friendly VPN. Oh, did I mention it includes a dedicated, private search engine (Brave Engine), global HTTPS encryption, and a built-in cryptocurrency wallet (which can be disabled)?\nFor those who fear Brave would be too different from Chrome, fear not. Anyone who has used any sort of web browser will feel right at home with Brave. Brave is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS.\nAlso: The best secure browsers for privacy\nBest for: Brave is best for those who want all of their browser security baked in (without having to configure a thing) and depend on a VPN for added security.\n2. Ungoogled Chromium Browser\nUngoogled Chromium Browser is exactly what it sounds like\u2026 a Chrome browser without everything in Chrome that could compromise your privacy or depend on pretty much any Google service. Ungoogled Chromium Browser removes all background requests from any Google service. The developers have also removed all code that is specific to Google web services and disabled all features that \"inhibit control and transparency.\"\nFinally, the developers of Ungoogled Chromium Browser have stripped all binaries from the source code and replaced them with user-provided alternatives. Ungoogled Chromium Browser is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.\nAlso: For anonymous browsing, these extensions are the next best thing to Tor\nBest for: Those who like the Chrome UI but not the insecurity of Google's browser.\n3. Mullvad Browser\nThere are two reasons Mullvad Browser gets included here: Mullvad VPN and that it was created in conjunction with The Tor Project. Mullvad defaults to privacy mode, uses letterboxing to prevent fingerprinting, disables JavaScript by default, defaults to privacy-focused search engines (the default being Mullvad Leta), allows users to quickly create new identities (to prevent activity from being linked to the user), uses First Party Isolation to retain cookies in a separate container, and includes uBlock Origin and NoScript out of the box. Mullvad is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.\nAlso: My 5 favorite web browsers - and what each is ideal for\nBest for: Especially good for those who depend on Mullvad VPN. Otherwise, if you like the Chrome UI but need serious security, this might be the one.\n4. Opera\nOpera has been my default web browser for a very long time. Although Opera's security features are pretty straightforward, there's a free VPN built into the browser that is as simple to use as it gets. Open Settings, search for VPN, and enable the feature. You can also enable the VPN to connect when starting the browser and manage VPN bypass rules. The Opera VPN connects to servers around the world, so speeds can vary.\nOpera also includes built-in blockers for ads and tracking, both of which allow you to add exceptions, in case you need to use sites that are negatively impacted when ad or tracker blocking is enabled. Opera is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS. On top of the VPN, Opera also has the best tab management on the market.\nAlso: How Opera's new Air browser helped me to keep calm and surf on\nBest for: Those who want to use a VPN and also require better tab management than any browser on the market.\n5. Vivaldi\nVivaldi is one of the most customizable browsers on the market. Open Settings, and you'll be overwhelmed with options. Because of that, I tend to suggest this browser for power users. Aside from the vast array of configurations, Vivaldi allows you to get pretty granular with tracking prevention, including ad blocking from abusive sites and hyperlink audit trafficking. You can also enable/disable phishing and malware protection, DNS to help resolve navigation errors, and form autofill assistance.\nOf course, Vivaldi also includes tracker and ad-blocking features and allows you to select from None, Block Trackers, and Block Trackers and Ads. Finally, Vivaldi includes a few extra features that are security-adjacent, such as the ability to hide typed history in address and search fields, browsing history save expiration, and website permission granting for several features (autoplay, geolocation, camera, mic, etc.). Vivaldi is free to use and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS.\nAlso: 5 browser extension rules to live by to keep your system safe\nBest for: Power users who want control over nearly every aspect of web browsing."

      "text": "Perplexity is the AI tool Gemini wishes it could be\nI'm an Android user and have been since version 1.5 of the OS. Over the past year or so, Google has switched its default assistant to its powerful AI solution, Gemini. For a while, I used Gemini on Android to get answers to my questions. I even made use of Gemini Live (which is quite impressive).\nBut recently, I've been defaulting to a different AI service, Perplexity. I've installed the Perplexity app on Android, Linux, and MacOS, and set it as the default search engine in my web browser. Although I prefer using local AI (such as the Ollama/Msty combination), there are times when I need more or something faster than a local AI can deliver. On top of that, my locally installed AI doesn't have access to real-time data, so it can't tell me what's in the news today.\nBut why Perplexity over Gemini?\nAlso: How I made Perplexity AI the default search engine in my browser (and why you should too)\nFor starters, you can't switch from Gemini to Perplexity as the Android default digital assistant, and I doubt that will ever be possible. You can, however, use Perplexity on your phone, desktop, and laptop as the default AI tool.\nLet me explain why you might want to do that.\n1. AI as search engine\nFor me, this is the biggest reason to switch to Perplexity. I've been using AI as a search engine for some time now. Why? The main reason is I find Google far less effective than it once was. When I'm doing research, I need answers fast and would rather not have to wade through sponsored sites or sites that contain so many ads that they render my browser unusable.\nOne thing about Gemini is that you can certainly head to the Gemini website and use it, but you can't set it as the default search engine in your web browser. On the other hand, you can do this with Perplexity, and that, for me, is a deal-maker.\n2. Better, more accurate responses\nAfter comparing both Gemini and Perplexity for a few weeks, I've found Perplexity not only gives better answers (with more description and context) but the answers are also more accurate. I've found Gemini to produce subtle inaccuracies fairly regularly, but I have yet to find fault in a Perplexity response. That's not to say they aren't there, but they've not been nearly as obvious as what I generally found with Gemini. I'm not saying that Gemini is always or often wrong, but in the comparison, Gemini delivered less accurate responses overall. On top of all this, the response detail in Perplexity is much higher than Gemini.\n3. Better problem solving\nOne issue I've had with Gemini is that when you ask it to help you solve something, it tends to respond with simple bullet points. Yes, such lists make the responses easy to read, but they lack the depth of knowledge I require. That's just me. Most people prefer quick bullet points so they can quickly scan them and be on their way. I want context. I want to know why a step is taken instead of just the step.\n4. Follow up\nOne of my favorite features of Perplexity is the \"Ask follow-up\" option. I can ask it a question, and once it gives me an answer, I can type a follow-up question to continue the discussion. This feature makes it very easy to dig deeper and deeper into a subject. Those rabbit holes have often led me to some really fascinating information.\nAlso: This app makes using Ollama local AI on MacOS devices so easy\nThis was made especially obvious when I was doing research for my latest novel. I asked about escape velocity, and it mentioned the speed of light. I then asked a follow-up question about the speed of light that wound up inspiring an important plot point. You could spend hours diving deeper and deeper into a subject with Perplexity.\n5. References\nBoth AI tools add references to responses. The biggest difference is that Perplexity lists those sources at the top of their responses and, generally speaking, offers considerably more sources than Gemini. Gemini lists sources after the response is complete, and nearly every time, it didn't list as many sources as Perplexity.\nThe other nice thing about Perplexity is that it cites the sources in line. Hover over a citation, and a pop-up appears with the source link and a brief section of the text used. Gemini does this with small drop-downs for citations, but when you click the drop-down, you only get the source link and not the snippet.\nAlso: How to turn Ollama from a terminal tool into a browser-based AI with this free extension\nThe only caveat to using Perplexity over Gemini is that Gemini's integration with other services is extensive, whereas Perplexity's is limited. Even with that knock against Perplexity, I will continue to use it over Gemini\u2026 even on Android."

      "text": "Perplexity has been asked to testify in the Google DOJ case. Our core points: 1. Google should not be broken up. Chrome should remain within and continue to be run by Google. Google deserves a lot of credit for open-sourcing Chromium, which powers Microsoft's Edge and will also power Perplexity's Comet. Chrome has become the dominant browser due to incredible execution quality at the scale of billions of users. 2. Android should become more open to consumer choice. There shouldn't be a tight coupling to the default apps set by Google, and the permission for OEMs to have the Play Store and Maps. Consumers should have the choice to pick who they want as a default search and default voice assistant, and OEMs should be able to offer consumers this choice without having to be blocked by Google on the ability to have the Play Store and other Google apps (Maps, YouTube). The DOJ is pushing for Chrome to be divested from Google. We don't believe anyone else can run a browser at that scale without a hit on quality, nor the business model to be able to serve that many users profitably by keeping the browser free. Chromium is open source, and others can build using that. Evidence: Microsoft Edge and Perplexity's upcoming Comet browser. The thing that is particularly frustrating about Google to us is how hard it is to change anything on Android. OEMs can only use a Google-approved version of Android, if they want to have core Google apps like PlayStore, Maps, etc. And \"Google-approved\" means keeping Google as the default search and Google/Gemini as the default voice assistants. OEMs feel threatened about any changes here even outside the defaults, because the magnitude of revenue sharing offered to them by Google to preserve the status quo even when better alternatives are available. Eg: Perplexity's Android Assistant is regarded as superior to Gemini. The remedy that is right in our opinion is not a breakup of Google; but rather offering consumers the choice to pick their defaults on Android without feeling the risk of a loss in revenue. That's what we will be proposing. Read more here: https://lnkd.in/gbSnHZut\nFor a minute there I thought we were going to have an AI bot provide the testimony.\nInsightful, changes were due\nGoogle controls what people see. They are completely biased. They have and continue to hide information that doesn\u2019t fit the mainstream narrative. They have outright lied about information, just like Facebook, Twitter & the mainstream media, yet no one is ever held accountable and nothing is ever done about it.\nTypically Open source versions of the internal software lag behind the production version by a lot. Many for profit companies claim to opensource for virtue signalling and to create a positive perception of themselves.\nThat's a really interesting position to take. It'll be fascinating to see how the DOJ reacts to the \"choice, not breakup\" idea.\nWas quite surprised to see the only other assistant offered by my pixel phone was perplexity. But least I can say is that I'm impressed! Google assistant or Gemini can barely set an alarm clock, but perplexity seems to be capable of so much more!

      "text": "Coding with AI? My top 5 tips for vetting its output - and staying out of trouble\nOur story begins, as many stories do, with a man and his AI. The man, like many men, is a bit of a geek and a bit of a programmer. He also needs a haircut.\nThe AI is the culmination of thousands of years of human advancement, all put to the service of making the man's life a little easier. The man, of course, is me. I'm that guy.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nUnfortunately, while AI can be incredibly brilliant, it also has a propensity to lie, mislead, and make shockingly stupid mistakes. It is the stupid part that we will be discussing in this article.\nAnecdotal evidence does have value. My reports on how I've solved some problems quickly with AI are real. The programs I used AI to write with are still in use. I have used AI to help speed up aspects of my programming flow, especially when I focus on the sweet spots where I'm less productive and the AI is quite knowledgeable, like writing functions that call publicly published APIs.\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for (plus three I'm considering)\nYou know how we got here. Generative AI burst onto the scene at the cusp of 2023 and has been blasting its way into knowledge work ever since.\nOne area, as the narrative goes, where AI truly shines is its ability to write code and help manage IT systems. Those claims are not untrue. I have shown, several times, how AI has solved coding and systems engineering problems I have personally experienced.\nAI coding in the real world: What science reveals\nNew tools always come with big promises. But do they deliver in real-world settings?\nMost of my reporting on programming effectiveness has been based on personal anecdotal evidence: my own programming experiences using AI. But I'm one guy. I have limited time to devote to programming and, like every programmer, I have certain areas where I spend most of my coding time.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nRecently, though, a nonprofit research organization called METR (Model Evaluation & Threat Research) did a more thorough analysis of AI coding productivity.\nTheir methodology seems sound. They worked with 16 experienced open-source developers who have actively contributed to large, popular repositories. The METR analysts provided those developers with 246 issues from the repositories that needed fixing. The coders were given about half the issues where they had to work on their own, and about half where they could use an AI for help.\nThe results were striking and unexpected. While the developers themselves estimated that AI assistance increased their productivity by an average of 24%, METR's analytics showed instead that AI assistance slowed them down by an average of 19%.\nThat's a bit of a head-scratcher. METR put together a list of factors that might explain the slowdown, including over-optimism about AI usefulness, high-developer familiarity with their repositories (and less AI knowledge), the complexity of large repositories, lack of AI reliability, and an ongoing problem where the AI refuses to use \"important tacit knowledge or context.\"\nAlso: How AI coding agents could destroy open-source software\nI would suggest that two other factors might have limited effectiveness:\nChoice of problem: The developers were told which issues they had to use AI help on and which issues they couldn't. My experience suggests knowledgeable developers must choose where to use AI based on the problem that needs to be solved. In my case, for example, getting the AI to write a regular expression (something I don't like doing and I'm fairly crappy at) would save me a lot more time than getting the AI to modify unique code I've already written, work on regularly, and know inside and out.\nChoice of AI: According to the report, the developers used Cursor, an AI-centric fork of VS Code, which used Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet at the time. When I tested 3.5 Sonnet, the results were terrible, with Sonnet failing three out of four of my tests. Subsequently, my tests of Claude 4 Sonnet were considerably better. METR reported that developers rejected more than 65% of the code the AI generated. That's going to take time.\nThat time when ChatGPT suggested nuking my system\nMETRs results are interesting. AI is clearly a double-edged sword when it comes to coding help. But there's also no doubt that AI can provide considerable value to coders. If anything, I think this test once again proves the contention that AI is a great tool for experienced programmers, but a potential high-risk resource for newbies.\nAlso: Why I'm switching to VS Code. Hint: It's all about AI tool integration\nLet's look at a concrete example, one that could have cost me a lot of time and trouble if I followed ChatGPT's advice.\nI was setting up a Docker container on my home lab using Portainer (a tool that helps manage Docker containers). For some reason, Portainer would not enable the Deploy button to create the container.\nIt had been a long day, so I didn't see the obvious problem. Instead, I asked ChatGPT. I fed ChatGPT screenshots of the configuration, as well as my Docker configuration file.\nChatGPT recommended that I uninstall and reinstall Portainer. It also suggested I remove Docker from the Linux distro and use the package manager to reinstall it. These actions would have had the effect of killing all my containers.\nOf note, ChatGPT didn't recommend or ask if I had backups of the containers. It just gave me the command line sequences it recommended I cut and paste to delete and rebuild Portainer and Docker. It was a wildly destructive and irresponsible recommendation.\nThe irony is that ChatGPT never figured out why Portainer wouldn't let me deploy the new container, but I did. It turns out I never filled out the container's name field. That's it.\nAlso: What is AI vibe coding? It's all the rage but it's not for everyone - here's why\nBecause I'm fairly experienced, I hesitated when ChatGPT told me to nuke my installation. However, someone relying on the AI for advice could have potentially brought down an entire server for want of typing in a container name.\nOverconfident and underinformed AIs: A dangerous combo\nI've also experienced the AI going completely off the rails. I've experienced it giving advice that was not only completely useless, but also presented with the apparent confidence of an expert.\nAlso: Google's Jules AI coding agent built a new feature I could actually ship - while I made coffee\nIf you're going to use AI tools to support your development or IT work, these tips might keep you out of trouble:\n- If there's not much publicly available information, the AI can't help. But the AI will make stuff up based on what little it knows, without admitting that it is lacking experience.\n- Like my dog, once the AI gets fixated on one thing, it often refuses to look at alternatives. If the AI is stuck on one approach, don't make the mistake of believing that its polite recommendations about a new approach are real. It's still going down the same rabbit hole. Start a new session.\n- If you don't know a lot, don't rely on the AI. Keep up your learning. Experienced devs can tell the difference between what will work and what won't. But if you're trying to put all the coding on the back of the AI, you won't know when or where it goes wrong or how to fix it.\n- Coders often use specific tools for specific tasks. A website might be built using Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Flask, and Jinja. You choose each tool because you know what it does well. Choose your AI tools the same way. For example, I don't use AI for business logic, but I gain productivity using AI to write API calls and public knowledge, where it can save me a lot of time.\n- Test everything an AI produces. Everything. Line by individual line. The AI can save a ton of time, but it can also make enormous mistakes. Yes, taking the time and energy to test by hand can help prevent errors. If the AI offers to write unit tests, let it. But test the tests.\nBased on your experience level, here's how I recommend you think about AI assistance:\n- If you know nothing about a subject or skill: AI can help you pass as if you do, but it could be amazingly wrong, and you might not know.\n- If you're an expert in a subject or skill: AI can help, but it will piss you off. Your expertise gets used not only to separate the AI-stupid from the AI-useful, but to carefully craft a path where AI can actually help.\n- If you're in between: AI is a mixed bag. It could help you or get you in trouble. Don't delegate your skill-building to the AI because it could leave you behind.\nAlso: How I used ChatGPT to analyze, debug, and rewrite a broken plugin from scratch - in an hour\nGenerative AI can be an excellent helper for experienced developers and IT pros, especially when used for targeted, well-understood tasks. But its confidence can be deceptive and dangerous.\nAI can be useful, but always double-check its work.\nHave you used AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to help with your development or IT work? Did they speed things up, or nearly blow things up? Are you more confident or more cautious when using AI on critical systems? Have you found specific use cases where AI really shines, or where it fails hilariously? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

But shortly after OpenAI's ChatGPT was released, I asked it to write a WordPress plugin for my wife's e-commerce site. When it did, and the plugin worked, I was indeed surprised.\nThat was the beginning of my deep exploration into chatbots and AI-assisted programming. Since then, I've subjected 14 large language models (LLMs) to four real-world tests.\nAlso: Apple's secret sauce is exactly what AI is missing\nUnfortunately, not all chatbots can code alike. It's been a little over two years since that first test, and even now, four of the 13 LLMs I tested can't create working plugins.\nThe short version\nIn this article, I'll show you how each LLM performed against my tests. There are now five chatbots I recommend you use.\nTwo of them, ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity Pro, cost $20 per month each. The free versions of the same chatbots do well enough that you could probably get by without paying. Two other recommended products are from Google and Microsoft. Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 is free, but you're limited to so few queries that you really can't use it without paying.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nMicrosoft has several Copilot licenses, which can get pricey, but I used the free version with surprisingly good results. The final one, Claude 4 Sonnet, is the free version of Claude. Oddly enough, the free version beat the paid-for version, so we're not recommending Claude 4 Opus.\nBut the rest, whether free or paid, are not so great. I won't risk my programming projects with them or recommend that you do, until their performance improves.\nI've written lots about using AIs to help with programming. Unless it's a small, simple project like my wife's plugin, AIs can't write entire apps or programs. But they excel at writing a few lines and are not bad at fixing code.\nRather than repeat everything I've written, go ahead and read this article: How to use ChatGPT to write code.\nIf you want to understand my coding tests, why I've chosen them, and why they're relevant to this review of the 13 LLMs, read this article: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability.\nThe AI coding leaderboard\nLet's start with a comparative look at how the chatbots performed, as of this installment of our best-of roundup:\nNext, let's look at each chatbot individually. I'm back up to discussing 14 chatbots, because we're splitting out Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus as separate tests. GPT-4 is no longer included since OpenAI has sunsetted that LLM. Ready? Let's go.\n- Passed all tests\n- Solid coding results\n- Mac app\n- Hallucinations\n- No Windows app yet\n- Sometimes uncooperative\n- Price: $20/mo\n- LLM: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: Yes\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nChatGPT Plus with GPT-4o passed all my tests. One of my favorite features is the availability of a dedicated app. When I test web programming, I have my browser set on one thing, my IDE open, and the ChatGPT Mac app running on a separate screen.\nAlso: I put GPT-4o through my coding tests and it aced them - except for one weird result\nIn addition, Logitech's Prompt Builder, which can be activated with a mouse button, can be set up to utilize the upgraded GPT-4o and connect to your OpenAI account, allowing for a simple thumb tap to run a prompt, which is very convenient.\nThe only thing I didn't like was that one of my GPT-4o tests resulted in a dual-choice answer, and one of those answers was wrong. I'd rather it just gave me the correct answer. Even so, a quick test confirmed which answer would work. However, that issue was a bit annoying.\n- Multiple LLMs\n- Search criteria displayed\n- Good sourcing\n- Email-only login\n- No desktop app\n- Price: $20/mo\n- LLM: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Sonar Large, Claude 3 Opus, Llama 3.1 405B\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nI seriously considered listing Perplexity Pro as the best overall AI chatbot for coding, but one failing kept it out of the top slot: how you log in. Perplexity doesn't use a username/password or passkey and doesn't have multi-factor authentication. All the tool does is email you a login PIN. The AI doesn't have a separate desktop app, as ChatGPT does for Macs.\nWhat sets Perplexity apart from other tools is that it can run multiple LLMs. While you can't set an LLM for a given session, you can easily go into the settings and choose the active model.\nAlso: Can Perplexity Pro help you code? It aced my programming tests - thanks to GPT-4\nFor programming, you'll probably want to stick to GPT-4o, because that model aced all our tests. But it might be interesting to cross-check your code across the different LLMs. For example, if you have GPT-4o write some regular expression code, you might consider switching to a different LLM to see what that model thinks of the generated code.\nAs we'll see below, most LLMs are unreliable, so don't take the results as gospel. However, you can use the results to check your original code. It's sort of like an AI-driven code review.\nJust don't forget to switch back to GPT-4o.\n- Price: Free for limited use, then token-based pricing\n- LLM: Gemini Pro 2.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nThe last time I looked at Gemini, it failed miserably. Not quite as bad as Copilot at the time, but bad. Gemini Pro 2.5, however, has performed quite admirably. My only real issue with it is access. I found myself cut off from the free version after only running two of the four tests.\nAlso: Gemini Pro 2.5 is a stunningly capable coding assistant - and a big threat to ChatGPT\nI waited a day and then ran the third test, and got cut off again. Finally, on the third day, I ran my fourth test. Obviously, you can't do any real programming if you can only ask one or two questions before being shut down. So, if you sign up with Gemini Pro 2.5, be aware that Google charges by tokens (basically, the amount of AI you use). That can make it quite difficult to predict your expenses.\n- Price: Free for basic Copilot, or fees for other Copilot licenses\n- LLM: Undisclosed\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nIn all my previous analyses of Microsoft Copilot, the results were the worst of the LLMs. Copilot got nothing right. It was astonishing how bad it was. But I said then that, \"The one positive thing is that Microsoft always learns from its mistakes. So, I'll check back later and see if this result improves.\"\nAlso: I retested Microsoft Copilot's AI coding skills in 2025 and now it's got serious game\nAnd boy, did it ever. This time out, Microsoft passed all four of my tests. Even better, it did this with the free version of Copilot. Yes, Microsoft has many paid programs for Copilot, but if you want to give it the AI spin, point yourself to Copilot and use it.\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: Claude 4\n- Desktop browser interface: No\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nThis is one of those times when AI implementations can be real head-scratchers. In our previous tests, Claude 4 Sonnet finished at the bottom of the barrel, failing all four of our tests. This time, however, Sonnet passed every test. So, what's the head-scratcher? Opus, the Claude 4 model, which is a fee-paid version, did not do as well: it failed half the tests.\nAlso: Anthropic's free Claude 4 Sonnet aced my coding tests - but its paid Opus model somehow didn't\nSo, yes. The free version worked like a champ. And the one you're paying anywhere from $20 to $250 a month for, depending on the plan? Well, that one failed half of the tests. Go figure.\n- Different LLM than ChatGPT\n- Good descriptions\n- Free access\n- Only available in browser mode\n- Free access likely only temporary\n- Price: Free (for now)\n- LLM: Grok-1\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nI have to say, Grok surprised me. I guess I didn't have high hopes for an LLM that appeared tacked on to the social network formerly known as Twitter. However, X is now owned by Elon Musk, and two of Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have towering AI capabilities.\nIt's unclear how much Tesla and SpaceX AI DNA is in Grok, but we can assume there will likely be more work. As of now, Grok is the only LLM not based on OpenAI LLMs that made it into the recommended list.\nAlso: X's Grok did surprisingly well in my AI coding tests\nGrok did make one mistake, but it was a relatively minor one that a slightly more comprehensive prompt could easily remedy. Yes, it failed the test. But by passing the others and even doing an almost perfect job on the one it passed, Grok earned itself a spot as a contender.\nStay tuned. This is an AI to watch.\n- Free\n- Passed most tests\n- Prompt throttling\n- Could cut you off in the middle of whatever you're working on\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: Yes\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4 in GPT-3.5 mode\nChatGPT is available to anyone for free. While both the Plus and free versions support GPT-4o, which passed all my programming tests, the free app has limitations.\nOpenAI treats free ChatGPT users as if they're in the cheap seats. If traffic is high or the servers are busy, the free version of ChatGPT will only make GPT-3.5 available to free users. The tool will only allow you a certain number of queries before it downgrades or shuts you off.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my favorite trick to debug what it generates\nI've had several occasions when the free version of ChatGPT effectively told me I'd asked too many questions.\nChatGPT is a great tool, as long as you don't mind it shutting down. Even GPT-3.5 did better on the tests than all the other chatbots, and the test it failed was for a fairly obscure programming tool produced by a lone programmer in Australia.\nSo, if budget is important to you and you can wait when you're cut off, then use ChatGPT for free.\n- Free\n- Passed most tests\n- Range of research tools\n- Limited to GPT-3.5\n- Throttles prompt results\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nI'm threading a pretty fine needle here, but because Perplexity AI's free version is based on GPT-3.5, the test results were measurably better than the other AI chatbots.\nAlso: 5 reasons why I prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\nFrom a programming perspective, that's pretty much the whole story. However, from a research and organization perspective, my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols prefers Perplexity over the other AIs.\nHe likes how Perplexity provides more complete sources for research questions, cites its sources, organizes the replies, and offers questions for further searches.\nSo, if you're programming, but also working on other research, consider the free version of Perplexity.\n- Free\n- Open source\n- Efficient resource utilization\n- Weak general knowledge\n- Small ecosystem\n- Limited integrations\n- Price: Free for chatbot, fees for API\n- LLM: DeepSeek MoE\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nWhile DeepSeek R1 is the new reasoning hotness from China that has all the pundits punditing, the real power right now (at least according to our tests) is DeepSeek V3. This chatbot passed almost all of our coding tests, doing as well as the (now mostly discontinued) ChatGPT 3.5.\nAlso: I tested DeepSeek's R1 and V3 coding skills - and we're not all doomed (yet)\nWhere DeepSeek V3 fell was in its knowledge of somewhat more obscure programming environments. Still, it beat Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, and Meta's Meta AI, which is quite an accomplishment. We'll be keeping a close watch on each DeepSeek model, so stay tuned.\nChatbots to avoid for programming help\nI tested 13 LLMs, and nine passed most of my tests this time around. The other chatbots, including a few pitched as great for programming, only passed one of my tests.\nAlso: The five biggest mistakes people make when prompting an AI\nI'm mentioning them here because people will ask, and I did test them thoroughly. Some of these bots are fine for other work, so I'll point you to their general reviews if you're curious about their functionality.\nDeepSeek R1\nUnlike DeepSeek V3, the advanced reasoning version, DeepSeek R1, did not showcase its reasoning capabilities in our programming tests. Unusually, the new failure area was one that's not all that hard, even for a basic AI -- the regular expression code for our string function test.\nAlso: Tech prophet Mary Meeker just dropped a massive report on AI trends - here's your TL;DR\nBut that's why we are running these real-world tests. It's never clear where an AI will hallucinate or just plain fail, and before you go believing all the hype about DeepSeek R1 taking the crown away from ChatGPT, run some programming tests. So far, while I'm impressed with the much-reduced resource utilization and the open-source nature of the product, its coding quality output is inconsistent.\nGitHub Copilot\nGitHub's Copilot integrates quite seamlessly with VS Code. The AI makes asking for coding help quick and productive, especially when working in context. That's why it's so disappointing that the code the AI outputs is often very wrong.\nAlso: I put GitHub Copilot's AI to the test - and it just might be terrible at writing code\nI can't, in good conscience, recommend you use the GitHub Copilot extensions for VS Code. I'm concerned that the temptation will be too great to insert blocks of code without sufficient testing -- and that GitHub Copilot's produced code is not ready for production use. Try again next year.\nClaude 4 Opus\nIn a completely baffling turn of events, the paid-for version of the Claude 4 model, Opus, failed half of my tests. What makes this result baffling is that the free version, Claude 4 Sonnet, passed them all. I don't know what to say apart from AI can be weird.\nAlso: Anthropic's free Claude 4 Sonnet aced my coding tests - but its paid Opus model somehow didn't\nMeta AI\nMeta AI is Facebook's general-purpose AI. As you can see above, it failed three of our four tests.\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024 - and how I plan to use it in 2025\nThe AI generated a nice user interface, but with zero functionality. It also found my annoying bug, which is a fairly serious challenge. Given the specific knowledge required to find the bug, I was surprised that the AI choked on a simple regular expression challenge. But it did.\nMeta Code Llama\nMeta Code Llama is Facebook's AI explicitly designed for coding help. It's something you can download and install on your server. I tested the AI running on a Hugging Face AI instance.\nAlso: Can Meta AI code? I tested it against Llama, Gemini, and ChatGPT - it wasn't even close\nWeirdly, even though both Meta AI and Meta Code Llama choked on three of four of my tests, they choked on different problems. AIs can't be counted on to give the same answer twice, but this result was a surprise. We'll see if that changes over time.\nBut I like [insert name here]. Does this mean I have to use a different chatbot?\nProbably not. I've limited my tests to day-to-day programming tasks. None of the bots has been asked to talk like a pirate, write prose, or draw a picture. In the same way we use different productivity tools to accomplish specific tasks, feel free to choose the AI that helps you complete the task at hand.\nThe only issue is if you're on a budget and are paying for a pro version. Then, find the AI that does most of what you want, so you don't have to pay for too many AI add-ons.\nIt's only a matter of time\nThe results of my tests were pretty surprising, especially given the significant improvements by Microsoft and Google. However, this area of innovation is improving at warp speed, so we'll be back with updated tests and results over time. Stay tuned.\nHave you used any of these AI chatbots for programming?

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nHow hard is it in 2025 -- just three years after generative AI captured the global spotlight -- to fight back against AI-generated plagiarism?\nAlso: Anthropic's AI agent can now automate Canva, Asana, Figma and more - here's how it works\nThis is a completely updated version of my January 2023 article on AI content detectors. When I first tested these detectors, the best result was 66% correct from one of three available checkers. My most recent set of tests, in February 2025, used up to 10 checkers -- and three of them had perfect scores. This time, just a couple of months later, five detectors boasted perfect scores.\nWhat I'm testing for and how I'm doing it\nBefore I go on, though, let's discuss plagiarism and how it relates to our problem. Merriam-Webster defines \"plagiarize\" as \"to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own; use (another's production) without crediting the source.\"\nThis definition fits AI-created content well. While someone using an AI tool like Notion AI or ChatGPT isn't stealing content, if that person doesn't credit the words as coming from an AI and claims them as their own, it still meets the dictionary definition of plagiarism.\nAlso: The dead giveaway that ChatGPT wrote your content - and how to work around it\nTo test the AI detectors, I'm using five blocks of text. Two were written by me and three were written by ChatGPT. To test a content detector, I feed each block to the detector separately and record the result. If the detector is correct, I consider the test passed; if it's wrong, I consider it failed.\nWhen a detector provides a percentage, I treat anything above 70% as a strong probability -- whether in favor of human-written or AI-written content -- and consider that the detector's answer. If you want to test a content detector yourself using the same text blocks, you can pull them from this document.\nThe overall results\nTo evaluate AI detectors, I reran my five-test series across 10 detectors. In other words, I cut and pasted 50 individual tests (I had a lot of coffee).\nDetectors I tested include BrandWell, Copyleaks, GPT-2 Output Detector, GPTZero, Grammarly, Monica, Originality.ai, QuillBot, Undetectable.ai, Writer.com, and ZeroGPT.\nAlso: How I personalized my ChatGPT conversations - why it's a game changer\nFor this update, I added Copyleaks and Monica. I dropped Writefull from my tests because it discontinued its GPT detector. Content Guardian requested inclusion, but I didn't hear back in time for testing accounts.\nThis table shows overall results. As you can see, five detectors correctly identified human and AI text in all tests.\nI tried to ascertain whether there was a tangible pattern of improvement over time, so I constructed a chart comparing the five-test set over time. So far, I've run this series six times, but there's no strong trend. I did increase the number of detectors tested and swapped out a few, but the only consistent result is that Test 5 was reliably identified as human across detectors and dates.\nI'll continue to test over time, and hopefully I'll see reliability trend consistently upward.\nWhile there have been some perfect scores, I don't recommend relying solely on these tools to validate human-written content. As shown, writing from non-native speakers often gets rated as generated by an AI.\nEven though my hand-crafted content has mostly been rated human-written this round, one detector (GPTZero) declared itself too uncertain to judge, and another (Copyleaks) declared it AI-written. The results are wildly inconsistent across systems.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives\nBottom line: I would advocate caution before relying on the results of any -- or all -- of these tools.\nHow each AI content detector performed\nNow, let's look at each individual testing tool, listed alphabetically.\nBrandWell AI Content Detection (Accuracy 40%)\nThis tool was originally produced by an AI content generation firm, Content at Scale. It later migrated to BrandWell.ai, a new name for an AI-centric marketing services company.\nAlso: AI-generated images are a legal mess - and still a very human process\nUnfortunately, its accuracy was low. The tool was unable to tell if the AI-generated content in Test 2 was human or AI, as shown in this screenshot:\nCopyleaks (Accuracy 80%)\nI find it amusing that Copyleaks declares itself \"the most accurate AI detector with over 99% accuracy\" when more than half of tested detectors performed better. But marketing folks will be marketing folks -- superlatives are as hard for them to resist as barking at a squirrel (and the FedEx truck, and all the neighbor kids) is for my dog.\nAlso: 5 quick ways Apple's AI tools can fine-tune your writing on the fly\nThe company's primary offering is a plagiarism checker sold to educational institutions, publishers, and enterprises seeking to ensure content originality and uphold academic integrity.\nGPT-2 Output Detector (Accuracy 60%)\nThis tool was built using a machine-learning hub managed by New York-based AI company Hugging Face. While the company has received $40 million in funding to develop its natural language library, the GPT-2 detector appears to be a user-created tool using the Hugging Face Transformers library.\nGPTZero (Accuracy 80%)\nGPTZero has clearly been growing. When I first tested it, the site was bare-bones -- it wasn't even clear whether GPTZero was a company or just someone's passion project. Now, the company has a full team with a mission of \"protecting what's human.\" It offers AI validation tools and a plagiarism checker.\nAlso: The most popular AI tools of 2025 (and what that even means)\nUnfortunately, performance seems to have declined. In my last two runs, GPTZero correctly identified my text as human-generated. This time, it declared that same text as AI-generated.\nGrammarly (Accuracy 40%)\nGrammarly is well known for helping writers produce grammatically correct content -- that's not what I'm testing here. Grammarly can check for plagiarism and AI content. In the grammar checker, there's a Plagiarism and AI Text Check button in the lower-right corner:\nI'm not measuring plagiarism checker accuracy here, but even though Grammarly's AI-check accuracy was poor, the site correctly identified the test text as previously published.\nMonica (Accuracy 100%)\nMonica is a new entrant. This service offers an all-in-one AI assistant with a wide range of services. Users can choose from various large language models.\nAlso: 5 ways ChatGPT can help you write essays\nThe company calls Monica the \"Best AI Detector Online,\" but it looks like it runs content through other detectors including ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Copyleaks. Weirdly, both GPTZero and Copyleaks didn't perform well in my tests, but Monica -- and ZeroGPT -- did.\nWe're giving it 100% because it earned that rating, but I'll see how it stands up in future tests.\nOriginality.ai (Accuracy 100%)\nOriginality.ai is a commercial service that bills itself as an AI and plagiarism checker. The company sells usage credits: I used 30 credits for this article. They sell 2,000 credits for $12.95 per month. I pumped 1,400 words through the system and used just 1.5% of my monthly allocation.\nQuillBot (Accuracy 100%)\nThe last few times I tested QuillBot, results were wildly inconsistent -- multiple passes of the same text yielded wildly different scores. This time, however, it was rock solid and 100% correct. So I'm giving it the win. I'll check back in a few months to see if it holds onto this performance.\nUndetectable.ai (Accuracy 100%)\nUndetectable.ai's big claim is that it can \"humanize\" AI-generated text so detectors won't flag it. I haven't tested that feature -- it bothers me as a professional author and educator, because it seems like cheating.\nAlso: Why you should ignore 99% of AI tools - and which four I use every day\nHowever, the company also has an AI detector, which was very much on point.\nThe AI detector passed all five tests. Notice the indicators showing flags for other detectors. The company said, \"We developed multiple detector algorithms modeled after those major detectors to provide a federated and consensus-based approach. They do not directly feed into the listed models; rather, the models are each trained based on results they've generated. When it says those models flagged it, it's based on the algorithm we created and updated for those models.\"\nAlso: Only 8% of Americans would pay extra for AI, according to ZDNET-Aberdeen research\nI do have a question about the OpenAI flag, since OpenAI's content detector was discontinued in 2023 due to low accuracy. Even so, Undetectable.ai detected all five tests, earning a perfect 100%.\nWriter.com AI Content Detector (Accuracy 40%)\nWriter.com is a service that generates AI writing for corporate teams. Its AI Content Detector tool can scan for generated content. Unfortunately, its accuracy was low. It identified every text block as human-written, even though three of the six tests were written by ChatGPT.\nZeroGPT (Accuracy 100%)\nZeroGPT has matured since I last evaluated it. Then, no company name was listed, and the site was peppered with Google ads and lacked clear monetization. The service worked fairly well but seemed sketchy.\nAlso: Will AI destroy human creativity? No - and here's why\nThat sketchy feeling is gone. ZeroGPT now presents as a typical SaaS service, complete with pricing, company name, and contact information. Its accuracy increased as well: last time it was 80%; this time it scored 5 out of 5.\nIs it human, or is it AI?\nWhat about you? Have you tried AI content detectors like Copyleaks, Monica, or ZeroGPT? How accurate have they been in your experience? Have you used these tools to protect academic or editorial integrity? Have you encountered situations where human-written work was mistakenly flagged as AI? Are there detectors you trust more than others for evaluating originality?

      "text": "Trump's DoJ keeps pushing for Google to get rid of Chrome\nUnder President Donald Trump's second administration, there has been a notable shift in regulatory enforcement against tech businesses, with several high-profile cases being dropped or paused. For example, the Department of Justice has moved to dismiss a lawsuit against SpaceX that alleged hiring discrimination. In addition, the administration halted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforcement actions against Meta for improperly using Facebook users' financial data.\nGoogle, however, is another story. The DoJ reaffirmed its demand for Google to divest its Chrome web browser.\nAlso: 6 obscure browsers that are better than Chrome\nThis move is part of a broader strategy to address Google's alleged monopolistic practices in search and online advertising. The DoJ's latest filing, submitted to federal Judge Amit Mehta, maintains that Google must sell off Chrome to restore competition in the online search market.\nWhy? The DoJ explained, \"Google's anticompetitive conduct has denied users of a basic American value -- the ability to choose in the marketplace. Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public -- their right to choose among competing services. Google's illegal conduct has created an economic Goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that -- no matter what occurs -- Google always wins.\"\nSpecifically, the DoJ requires Google \"to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the Internet.\"\nIf I were a Google executive I'd be sweating right about now.\nThe DoJ's push for Chrome's divestiture springs from a landmark antitrust ruling last year, which found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly in online search. The DoJ found Google's control over Chrome unfairly suppresses competition by integrating it closely with Google's search engine. This integration allows Google to dominate the search market and manipulate its ad auction system, increasing advertisers' costs while boosting its revenue.\nIf Google is forced to sell Chrome, it could upend the browser market. Today, Chrome has no real competitors. All the other major browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, rely on Chrome's underlying open-source browser, Chromium,\nAlso: The best secure browsers for privacy in 2025: Expert tested\nThe sole significant exception is Mozilla's Firefox. However, Firefox relies on Google for its income. Moreover, Firefox's market share has continued to slide into irrelevance. Recent Mozilla management changes have also damaged Firefox's reputation for privacy.\nThe DoJ also demands that Google no longer make deals with Mozilla or other companies, such as Google paying Apple to use its search engine by default. However, Google argues, \"Browser companies like Apple and Mozilla should continue to have the freedom to do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users.\"\nAdditionally, Google claims that forcing it to give up Chrome would be overly aggressive and could harm consumers by disrupting integrated services and impacting innovation and security. Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels said in a statement, \"DOJ's sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court's decision, and would harm America's consumers, economy and national security.\"\nNeedless to say, Google has vowed to appeal the antitrust ruling and proposed alternative solutions to enhance partner flexibility without resorting to divestiture.\nAlso: Trump axes AI staff and research funding, and scientists are worried\nIn the meantime, Google, in conjunction with The Linux Foundation, Meta, Microsoft, and Opera, is working on \"Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers,\" an initiative to create more fully empowered Chromium-based web browsers. Such a browser, which would not be under Google's control, might prove to be a Chrome replacement the DoJ would find acceptable and still work well for Google's business. Stay tuned to see what happens next with this development.\nInterestingly, while continuing to demand Google get rid of Chrome, the DoJ has softened its stance on Google's AI investments. Unlike previous demands, the department now requires only prior notification for future AI-related investments, allowing Google to continue its advancements in AI while ensuring regulatory oversight. This is all in keeping with the Trump administration's pulling back from government AI regulation.\nThe case is set to proceed with hearings in April, where both the DoJ and Google will present their arguments on proposed remedies. A final ruling is expected this summer."

  "argos_summary": "Perplexity, an AI-driven search startup, has made a bold $34.5 billion unsolicited offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser, aiming to enhance its user acquisition and data collection capabilities. This move comes amid ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Google, with a federal judge suggesting that divesting Chrome could be a potential remedy. Perplexity's CEO argues that the acquisition would serve the public interest by placing Chrome under independent management, while experts debate the feasibility and implications of such a deal.",
