  "description": "Gov. JB Pritzker signs controversial law mandating mental health screenings in Illinois schools for grades three through 12, sparking debate over state overreach.",
  "content": "A new Illinois law requiring annual mental health screenings for public school students is drawing backlash from parents, policy experts and lawmakers who warn the policy may overstep boundaries and wrongly label children.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure on July 31, making Illinois the first state in the country to mandate mental health screenings for students in grades three through 12.\n\nThe law, set to take effect in the 2027\u20132028 school year, directs schools to provide self-conducted screenings each year using digital or paper forms. Parents will have the ability to opt their children out.\n\nSupporters say the initiative will help schools identify early signs of depression, anxiety or trauma \u2014 before they develop into crises. But critics argue the plan could create more problems than it solves.\n\n\"I want to be on-the-record and crystal clear. This is a disastrous policy that will do vastly more harm than good,\" Abigail Shrier, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote on X. \"Watch as tens of thousands of Illinois kids get shoved into the mental health funnel and convinced they are sick. Many or most of which will be false positives.\"\n\nKatherine Boyle, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also raised concerns about government overreach and what she called the \"mental health industrial complex.\"\n\n\"If a school nurse or a state-mandated mental health test tells you you\u2019re sick, you\u2019re going to believe them,\" Boyle wrote. \"This is why so many families are opting out of primary school completely \u2014 the overreach is astounding.\"\n\nIllinois education officials say the screenings will not be diagnostic and are designed to flag students who may benefit from further evaluation. The Illinois State Board of Education will develop the screening tools and guidelines by September 2026, and school districts will be responsible for implementing them.\n\n\"Mental health is essential to academic readiness and lifelong success,\" State Superintendent Tony Sanders said in a statement. \"Too often, we only recognize a student\u2019s distress when it becomes a crisis. With universal screening, we shift from reaction to prevention.\"\n\nDana Weiner, chief officer of the governor\u2019s Children\u2019s Behavioral Health Transformation Initiative, said the screenings will be optional for families and conducted privately.\n\nState Sen. Laura Fine, a Democrat and lead sponsor of the bill, said the effort aims to normalize mental health care for children and teens. \"The screenings will be designed to catch the early signs of anxiety, depression or trauma before it becomes a crisis or, in some cases, sometimes too late,\" she said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the state have also voiced opposition. Rep. Steve Reick (R\u2011Woodstock) warned the law could have unintended consequences for families dealing with insurance companies.\n\n\"Universal mental health screenings are going to get us nothing except possibly finding things, finding reasons for denial of coverage of insurance,\" Reick said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRep. Adam Niemerg (R\u2011Dieterich) called the law \"a very dangerous piece of legislation that removes parental rights.\"\n\n\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Pritzker's office for comment and has not yet received a reply.",

He will highlight statistics showing that violent crime has gone down under his stewardship.\nPritzker will reaffirm his intolerance for violent criminals \u2013 whether documented or undocumented \u2013 and note that Illinois law enables government employees to cooperate with federal immigration officers executing criminal warrants.\nHe is expected to say that federal officials are welcome to operate in Illinois but will make clear that Illinois will not divert limited resources when it is not in the best interest of the state. He will say that he wants residents to feel comfortable turning to local law enforcement for help.\nPritzker is also expected to invoke his own family\u2019s history, having fled to the U.S. to escape the Russian massacre of Jews in Ukraine.\nHe is expected to implore Congress to fix the nation\u2019s broken immigration system so that law-abiding immigrant families can have the same opportunity his family did.

      "text": "Oklahoma will be the first state to require teachers from liberal-leaning states to take a test to show they align with Oklahoma\u2019s curriculum standards.\nThe state\u2019s Superintendent, Ryan Walters, told Fox News Digital that next week he plans to release a new certification test for teachers moving into the state from blue states.\n\"We offered the largest signing bonuses for teachers in the country. If you're in the top 10 percent of teachers in the country, we give you $50,000 in Oklahoma. So we've seen teachers come from blue states, red states all over to come to Oklahoma. They especially are fleeing the teachers unions, the grip that they've had on them in these blue states,\" Walters said.\nWalters added that the state is working with conservative think tank PragerU on developing the test for teachers. The \"America First\" test will include basic questions about American history, civics, and \"common sense.\"\nOklahoma is thus far the only state that has worked with PragerU on this kind of project. Walters said that Oklahoma education officials have partnered with PragerU in the past, helping them develop standards for teaching history and putting an emphasis on American exceptionalism.\n\"We put the Bible back in our history standards,\" Walters said.\nThe superintendent mentioned Maine, California, and New York adopting standards and requirements that were antithetical to Oklahoma.\n\"One of the things that we wanted to do is, first of all, make sure that they're great teachers, right? And No. 2, make sure we're not getting these woke, indoctrinating social justice warriors in the classroom,\" Walters said.\nHe name-dropped California Gov. Gavin Newsom as one of the \"impetuses\" of the change, regarding the state's policy on gender ideology.\nThe California Department of Education requires instruction \"about gender, gender expression, gender identity and explore the harm of negative gender stereotypes.\" Schools must also \"teach about all sexual orientations and what being LGBTQ means.\"\n\"We're going to make sure that this isn't creeping into our schools. When we see Maine take the extraordinary steps to fight President Trump\u2026 Every county in Oklahoma voted for President Trump,\" Walters said.\nMaine has pushed back against President Donald Trump's executive orders requiring that schools teach that there are only two genders and that biological boys are prohibited from participating in female sports.\nEXCLUSIVE: RED STATE UPDATING EDUCATION STANDARDS TO ADDRESS RISE IN ANTISEMITISM IN SCHOOLS\n\"We have been closely following the implementation of teacher training and testing programs \u2014 such as the PRISM test imposed on educators in states like California \u2014 and we fully understand why superintendents of education, like Ryan Walters, feel compelled to protect their students from the extreme left-wing ideologies being promoted in schools through teachers who often do not even realize the damage caused,\" a spokesperson for PragerU told Fox News Digital.\n\"It is our honor to help reverse the damage caused by these trends by equipping educators with higher-quality resources and holding them accountable to do what is right for their students. While we do not mandate the use of any of our materials, we strongly encourage the adoption of our wholesome, patriotic content as a constructive alternative,\" the spokesperson added.\nWalters\u2019 colleagues have previously challenged the legal merit of his idea. When Walters said the test would not need the board's approval, his colleague Ryan Deatherage asked for legal documentation to prove it.\nBoard member Chris Van Denhende asked whether the tests were necessary, citing teaching contracts requiring educators to teach to Oklahoma standards anyway.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"He's been a puppet for the teachers union,\" Walters told Fox News Digital, referring to Van Denhende.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I've had to deal with people in our state that are just continuing to parrot the lies of the NEA [National Education Association]. And here's the reality. What do you mean? We're seeing it all over the place. We are seeing indoctrination on kids like never before,\" he added.\nFox News Digital reached out to Newsom and Van Denhende for comment."

  "argos_summary": "A new Illinois law mandating annual mental health screenings for public school students has sparked significant opposition from parents, lawmakers, and policy experts who argue it may infringe on parental rights and lead to mislabeling children. Signed by Governor J.B. Pritzker, the law requires screenings for students in grades three through 12 starting in the 2027-2028 school year, with parents able to opt out. Supporters believe it will help identify mental health issues early, while critics warn it could create unnecessary stigma and complications for families.",
