      "feedback": "High-signal upgrade plan: your framework correctly anchors horizon-agnostic drivers (policy regime, productivity, capital allocation) and ties Jackson Hole signaling to discount-rate dynamics, but it needs a tighter, regime-based map, explicit first-principles anchors, and disciplined quantification to reach world-class quality. Actionable edits: (1) replace the narrative with a formal regime map over a multi-year horizon: Regime A (growth/inflation converging to target with easing expectations), Regime B (sticky inflation and higher-for-longer real rates), Regime C (policy pivot driven by a hawkish Jackson Hole tone or dovish disinflation); define transition conditions using observable triggers supported by sources (e.g., Jackson Hole communications and September payrolls signals in 37UZC9X8I, and inflation/ labor data dynamics) and cite them after each regime statement. (2) embed invariant first-principles anchors: real-rate differentials from policy expectations, productivity/AI-led earnings durability, and a concise BoP/terms-of-trade framing as stylized constraints; note where data exist in sources and where you are imputing. (3) specify a granular causal chain: policy regime → path of real rates and discount rates → sector earnings power (auto cyclicality, AI beneficiaries) and debt service capacity → asset pricing (multiples, risk premia); link each link to a cited datapoint (e.g., Ford’s Q2 margin 4.3% and ROIC 10.1% and $1.3B EV loss from 22PL3Q360; Disney/J&J/WH Smith/Intel chips risk in H7Q52FKDH and TN66GHPAT; personal-loan APRs/terms from C3ODMIQKZ). (4) build a quantified base case with observable numbers from the sources rather than qualitative prose: e.g., base-case range for inflation signals from the Jackson Hole/ahead data, a rough proxy for rate-path given “high-for-longer” vs. easing themes; incorporate specific numbers where cited ( Ford up 17% YTD; Q2 EV loss $1.3B; J&J/North Carolina expansion with 100+ jobs from H7Q52FKDH; personal-loan APR ~11.57% from C3ODMIQKZ). (5) codify catalysts/invalidation: include discrete triggers (Jackson Hole hawkish/dovish readings; September payroll miss or beat; Intel-Chips Act funding outcomes) and a clear invalidation test (e.g., sustained inflation surprise of >X% for two consecutive data prints or a sharper-than-expected policy pivot). (6) tighten coverage and reconciliation: explicitly reconcile Ford’s bearish case with AI productivity upside, and contrast Donegal’s dividend-cycle signals with broader financials risk premia (TN66GHPAT); ensure every assertion draws a source ID and note any conflicts and how you adjudicate them. (7) sharpen structure and length: present a concise single-regime-to-base-case narrative with 4 watchpoints (policy signal, sector earnings, credit-costs, semiconductor policy risk), followed by a short risk–reward assessment and a confidence band; avoid adding non-supported macro narrativa. By applying these edits, you’ll achieve a clear, numbers-backed, multi-year causal chain with explicit regimes, triggers, and invalidation conditions anchored to the cited sources (37UZC9X8I; 22PL3Q360; C3ODMIQKZ; H7Q52FKDH; TN66GHPAT), and a base case, key risks, and watchlist that meet the SECTION FOCUS.",
