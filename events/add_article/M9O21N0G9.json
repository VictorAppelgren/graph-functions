      "summary": "Diesel engines have carved a niche in aviation by offering better fuel efficiency and Jet‑A compatibility, yet their heavier weight and lower power-to-weight ratio have limited mainstream adoption. Historical examples—from the 1928 Stinson SM‑1DX to modern models like the Diamond DA42 Twin Star and Tecnam P2010 TDI—illustrate the trade‑offs between endurance, cost, and performance. The article also contrasts diesel’s aviation advantages with its challenges in general automotive use, debunking common myths about maintenance, power, and fuel availability. Overall, diesel-powered aircraft represent a specialized but growing segment of the market, driven by fuel cost pressures and the quest for longer range.",
