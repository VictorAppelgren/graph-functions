  "content": "Can You Engine Swap An Ecoboost Mustang? What To Know Before Wrenching\n\nWhen Ford debuted the S550 platform on the Mustang in 2015, it represented a huge evolution in the model's history. Independent rear suspension was now standard, and the Ford's EcoBoost 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder became the Mustang's volume engine, especially once the base V6 was dropped from the lineup in 2018. For most drivers, the Mustang's EcoBoost engine delivers more than adequate power, with horsepower and torque numbers that rival many V8s of the '90s and 2000s. For enthusiasts seeking greater performance and that traditional V8 sound, however, the Mustang GT powered by Ford's 5.0-liter Coyote engine has remained the go-to choice. Naturally, some EcoBoost Mustang owners, or potential owners, may wonder if it's possible to swap the Coyote into their four-cylinder Mustang. Technically speaking, the answer is yes, you can. Yet practically speaking, the answer is no, you probably shouldn't, mostly because doing so would be a headache and pretty expensive.\n\nThe swap is costly and time-consuming When it comes to project cars, there's really nothing that's \"impossible\" with enough time and money. If you were to perform this swap, you would first need to get the Coyote engine, which costs anywhere from around $5,000 used to over $12,000 new. You'd also need to adjust several things that differ between the two models, including the engine control unit (ECU), wiring, plumbing, mounts, and exhaust. Then there's the transmission, suspension, and rear differential, which may also need to be adjusted to handle the extra power and torque. This would be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor just to replicate a Mustang GT, but all that effort doesn't really make sense. After all, the S550 Mustang is a modern car readily available on the used market, and you'd be better off just spending more upfront and buying the GT. Even if you already own the EcoBoost Mustang, you'd still probably be better off selling or trading in your EcoBoost and then upgrading to a GT. Looking through August 2025 CarMax listings as a ballpark guide, there's typically no more than a $10,000 difference in asking price between a used S550 Mustang GT and a Mustang EcoBoost with similar mileage. That's a pretty reasonable premium to get the Coyote engine, which is one of the best V8s of all time. Ultimately, it could even be cheaper than what you'd pay for parts alone if you went for the swap.\n\nYou're probably better off buying a stock Mustang GT Before doing this swap, you may also want to consider the overall value of your car. Let's assume you actually went through all the trouble of putting a Coyote in your EcoBoost Mustang and had a fully functional V8-swapped S550. Almost certainly, that homemade car would be worth substantially less than a stock Mustang GT. If you ever have to sell the car, you are unlikely to get back even a fraction of the money you spent on the parts, to say nothing of the wasted time and labor. Whether you are talking about a Mustang or most other modern vehicles, if there's a \"better\" version of the car offered from the factory, it's likely going to be easier, smarter, and cheaper to just go and buy that version, rather than trying to convert a base model. Keep in mind that the Mustang EcoBoost engine also has plenty of potential for more power without swapping if you want to add some upgrades. It's possible that EcoBoost Mustangs with high mileage or blown engines may become cheap enough in the future that it does make sense to pick one and do a V8 swap, especially for a skilled mechanic who could have some fun with the project. For now, however, it's best to simply go out and buy one of the many Mustang GTs that Ford already made if you want a late-model V8.",

      "text": "Why Ford's Coyote Engine Is One Of The Best V8s Of All Time\nWe live in an era of dwindling cylinder counts. V6 or straight-six engines are replacing V8s, and six-cylinder powerplants are being swapped with turbocharged four-cylinders. Despite the turmoil, Ford's Coyote V8 engine remains a vital part of the Blue Oval's lineup. Debuting in the 2011 Mustang GT and F-150, this one-two model combination demonstrated the versatility of the Coyote's sophisticated dual-overhead-cam (DOHC) configuration and the simplicity of a naturally aspirated air intake.\nThe Coyote's launch over a decade ago was well-timed. The resurrected Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger stole some of the Mustang's thunder with Chrysler's Hemi and General Motors' LS3 V8s. Ford sought to leapfrog the pushrod powerplants of its competitors with an advanced 5.0-liter engine that grew out of the company's existing Modular V8 technology. The Coyote's displacement is significant in its number and size. This allowed Ford to give its pony car a needed marketing twist: the return of the 5.0 badge, which brought to mind the 5.0 of the Fox Body Mustang days. However, that older Ford V8 was a pushrod or overhead valve (OHV) design.\nThis newest 5.0 revved higher and produced a broader power band thanks to the DOHC architecture. The 2011 Ford Mustang GT hits the streets, making 412 horsepower and 390 pound-feet of torque. In 1993, the last year of the Fox Body generation, the Mustang GT with the OHV engine could muster 205 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. The 4.6-liter V8, which was also in the Ford Modular family, was used before the Coyote in the Mustang GT. This SOHC engine topped out at 315 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque for 2010, its last year in the GT. SlashGear has a good primer on the differences between SOHC and DOHC engines.\nCoyote V8 redefined expectations\nThe Coyote's DOHC design set it apart from Chrysler's and GM's eight-cylinder offerings. Variable camshaft timing and four valves per cylinder gave the Coyote better airflow and higher-revving characteristics than pushrod V8s like GM's LS3. In stock form, the engine could rev past 7,000 rpm, unusual for an American V8 of its size and output.\nThe Coyote soon developed a reputation for its tuning potential. Add a turbocharger or two or a supercharger, and this Ford V8 can generate four figures of horsepower. In a 2020 article citing the aftermarket possibilities of the Coyote, Hot Rod magazine called 1,000 ponies \"The New Normal\" for this engine.\nThe focus on Coyote performance often overshadows its role in the Ford F-150. Yet, this V8 became part of the automaker's best-selling vehicle for the 2011 model year. It was a worthwhile addition, as the previous 5.4-liter Triton V-8 earned a reputation for the worst engine Ford ever put in a truck. Despite twin-turbo V6 options, the 2025 Ford F-150 soldiers on with a 5.0-liter Coyote V8 making 400 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque.\nThe Coyote V8 keeps the Mustang and Ford relevant\nThe Coyote has helped the Mustang earn survivor status as the Chevrolet Camaro bowed out last year, preceded by the seventh-generation Dodge Charger. The Charger returned in 2024 with EV and twin-turbo V6 power, but eight cylinders are absent under the hood. There are rumors that Dodge is working on reviving V8 Hemi power for the Charger. Until then, the Mustang retains V8 bragging rights.\nIt's also the least expensive new V8-powered vehicle you can buy in the U.S. The 2025 Mustang GT has a starting msrp, including destination charges, of $48,555. Arguably, the Coyote has also helped the Mustang become the world's most popular coupe, a fact that Ford CEO Jim Farley touted last year in an interview with Autocar. He also told the publication that the company will continue to make V8 engines \"as long as God and the politicians let us.\"\nOutside the Mustang and F-150 world, the Coyote is alive and well as a crate engine. Ford offers several versions for the racing, restomod, and customization crowds. A base 5.0-liter Coyote V8 crate engine makes 460 horsepower (20 horsepower less than the base 2025 Mustang GT) and costs $12,650 (before shipping). The automaker also offers a larger 5.2-liter version of the Coyote V8. It's a supercharged 720-horsepower beast, available as a $32,450 crate engine or under the hood of the F-150 Raptor R."

      "text": "This May Be One Of The Best Upgrades You Can Put On Your Ford Mustang's EcoBoost Engine\nIt's one of the must-know Mustang facts that the first Ford Mustang models arrived in 1964. Since launching, this nameplate has become one of the most recognizable the entire world over, beloved by sports and muscle car fans alike. A lot has changed since the first Mustangs first rolled off of the production line, but certain aspects still remain the same: it's still a rear-wheel-drive coupe, with an engine up-front, and a Ford badge adorning both ends. Furthermore, the Mustang is still heavily customizable \u2013a fact which has been keeping fans of the nameplate busy for decade after decade.\nWhile Whipple and Roush superchargers are common sights on modified V8-powered Mustangs, the EcoBoost-powered model is much newer on the scene, and so it has taken some time for new upgrades to establish themselves within the scene. However, tuning companies and owners alike have been busy addressing numerous weak points in the EcoBoost's engine bay, and the feedback provided has allowed us to highlight the best starting upgrades to install on the four-banger Mustang. Seemingly, most will agree that the best starting upgrade on for an EcoBoost model is to upgrade the factory intercooler, followed by installing a cold air intake.\nUpgrading the intercooler is the best starting place when modifying an EcoBoost Mustang\nWhen tuning any car, there are usually consequences for every new addition. For example, turbocharging a naturally aspirated car will likely introduce a heap of new power, which is great, although you may find that this means your brakes and suspension setup is all of a sudden inadequate for the power. Addressing weaknesses, therefore, is usually a great starting point, and this is certainly a true point with the EcoBoost Mustang.\nBoth users on Reddit and dedicated tuning companies have highlighted the intercooler as a known weak point on the EcoBoost Mustang, claiming that the small factory-fitted unit struggles with the heat created by the turbocharged engine. One owner points out that \"the OEM one is very undersized and you can run into heat soak issues quickly\", while multiple other enthusiasts on Reddit backed up this claim.\nYou may be wondering, can an upgraded intercooler increase my horsepower? The answer is yes, as installing a beefed-up intercooler isn't just a solid first upgrade for reliability, it can also benefit performance. One Reddit claimedthat an intercooler upgrade saw their power figures swell from 330 horses at the wheel to 355. Australian tuning house 'Mustang Motorsport' also recommended this as the best starting point, but also suggested adding a free-flowing exhaust system and cold-air intake too.\nThese popular upgrades will help release additional power from your EcoBoost Mustang\nSo we know that many consider an upgraded intercooler as the best starting point when tuning an EcoBoost-powered Ford Mustang, but there are a heap of additional modifications you can make to get more horsepower out of your car. Installing any of these following mods will help you to squeeze extra grunt out of the Mustang's inline-four. Companies which specialize in tuning Mustangs, such as Cobb and Roush, all offer similar solutions, such as upgrading the factory exhaust, fitting a cold-air intake, oil catch-can, and also installing a tweaked tune to your ECU. Not only do these upgrades work well on their own, but also when installed together. This is because each individual modification works to either raise the car's performance, or help to combat reliability issues, such as with the oil catch-can.\nOther notable upgrades include brake, suspension, and even cosmetic enhancements \u2014 and the world really is your oyster here. There is no shortage of cosmetic enhancements which can be made to either the S550 or S650 EcoBoost platform, which is no-doubt a huge part of why the EcoBoost Mustang is so popular with enthusiasts who love to personalize their cars. Wheels, lights, interior trim pieces, and even customized body panels are all available. While many may be tempted to start here, the advice from current owners and tuning companies is clear \u2014 start with an intercooler upgrade, and then delve into other modifications afterwards."

      "text": "Cars Powered By The Ford Coyote Engine\nIt all began in the 1980s when Ford wanted a new V8 engine that could compete with the growing pressures from Chevrolet and Dodge. Seven years and $4 billion later, Ford came up with a new modular single-overhead cam V8, which became the stepping stone for the Coyote engine. Ford developed the Coyote as a replacement for the Ford Windsor V8. Though its development started in 2010, it saw the light of day in 2011 when the Mustang GT and Ford F-150 became the first powered by the 5.0-liter DOHC Coyote V8 engine.\nWhy did Ford call it Coyote? It was a fitting tribute to legendary driver AJ Foyt, who drove the company's first four-valve V8 engine race car, nicknamed The Coyote, to a tremendous 25-victory run. Over the years, four generations of Coyote engines have been developed, and it is also sold as a crate engine that can be bought separately for classic car builds and restorations. While the Coyote V8 is considered a reliable and powerful engine, it still has its fair share of common problems. But with four generations out, Ford is not resting on its laurels with development, either.\nThe Ford Coyote engine is popular for third-party builds and restorations. A few notable models include the Ringbrothers Mercury Cougar, Icon Bronco BR, and several Velocity Restorations' modified classic vehicles. All thanks to the Coyote being a lightweight, compact, and powerful engine.\nFord Mustang GT S197 II (2011-14)\nThe Ford Mustang \u2013- famously known as an iconic pony car \u2013 was such a hit that the first-generation Ford Mustang recorded over 22,000 bookings on the first day. With a history spanning six decades, the Mustang has undergone uninterrupted production across several generations. However, the 2011 model Ford Mustang \u2014 a facelifted version of the fifth generation \u2014 is quite iconic in itself. It not only got a new front fascia (smaller grille) and redesigned headlights, but it was the first Ford car to be fitted with the 5.0-liter Coyote V8 engine that revolutionized Mustangs to follow.\nThe new Coyote engine delivered low-end torque and power, reaching a redline of 7,000 rpm, which ensured enough grunt to feel the Mustang's muscle. Interestingly, the Ford Mustang GT S197 II got two versions of the first-generation Coyote engine. The 2011-12 Mustang GT models' Coyote engine produced 412 hp at 6,500 rpm and 390 lb-ft of torque at 4,250 rpm, whereas the 2013-14 Mustang GT, equipped with the Coyote V8 (1.5 generation), produced 420 hp at 6,500 rpm, with the same torque output as the previous generation.\nThe increase in horsepower was all thanks to some minor tweaks, including the removal of oil squirters, phosphorus-coated pistons, Boss 302 piston rings, and improved calibration. The Coyote V8 5.0-liter Gen 1 engine powered the 2011-2014 Mustang GT Base and Premium models, as well as the special edition 2011-2014 Mustang GT/California Special.\nFord F-150 (2011-present)\nFord \u2013 also known as the Blue Oval \u2013 powered the F-150 with the V8 Coyote engine in the same year (2011) as the Mustang GT. Ford has been producing the F-150 for over 75 years, and it is one of the most sought-after pickup trucks in America. It was stocked with a V8 Coyote engine replacing the 5.4L and 4.6L V8 engine trims offered for several years. The Coyote engine inside the 12th-generation Ford F-150 was a bit different compared to the one inside the Ford Mustang GT.\nThe engine power was lower than that of the Mustang's Coyote. The Coyote engine inside the Ford F-150 produced 360 hp at 5,500 rpm with 380 lb-ft of torque at 4,250 rpm, compared to 412/420 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque. One of the main differences between the Mustang and the F-150's Coyote engine was that the truck's engine uses a special intake design allowing for better low-end torque, suitable for towing and heavy lifting. Shorter intake camshaft duration also helped with increased torque at low end on the F-150.\nThe Gen 1 Coyote engine was used from 2011 to 2014, Gen 2 from 2015 to 2017 (385 hp and 487 lb-ft of torque), Gen 3 from 2018 to 2023 (395 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque), and Gen 4 from 2024 and onwards (400 hp with 410 lb-ft of torque). The introduction of the powerful Coyote engine inside the 12th-generation F-150 was also one of the reasons we picked it as one of the best F-150 generations of all time.\nFord Mustang Boss 302 S197 (2012-2013)\nRecapturing the spirit of the original 1969 Boss 302 while continuing with the Mustang GT line, Ford launched the Mustang Boss 302. It was positioned above the GT and boasted a 5.0-liter V8 Coyote engine dubbed the Road Runner. The Boss 302 was manufactured from 2012 to 2013 and offered several upgrades over the GT, including improved suspension and aerodynamics. The interesting thing about this Ford Mustang Boss 302 was that it came with a naturally aspirated Coyote engine that produced 444 hp, up from the 412 hp offered by the GT.\nIt is touted to be the most powerful V8 engine ever put inside the Mustang. The increased power was partially due to improved CNC valves, a revised intake, and enhancements to the cylinder heads. Additionally, Ford tweaked the suspension and installed a bigger rear stabilizer bar, which differentiated it from the GT. The Boss 302 was carried over to 2013, the year in which the Mustang GT got an eight-horsepower boost, thanks to the Coyote (1.5 generation) engine.\nThere was also a limited-edition Laguna Seca Boss 302 specifically meant for tracks. It had no rear seats, a racing suspension, improved aerodynamics, and used a dedicated TracKey key (painted red) to switch between normal driving mode and race mode (via Motor Trend).\nFord Mustang S550 (2015-2023)\nAnother coincidence related to the Coyote engine and the Mustang was that after 2011, the 2015 Mustang S550 (sixth-generation Mustang) launched with the new 5.0-liter V8 Coyote Gen 2 engine. To expand its presence worldwide, Ford launched the Mustang S550 simultaneously in Michigan, Los Angeles, New York, Barcelona, Shanghai, and Sydney. The Mustang S550 was produced from 2015 to 2023, and it retained its muscle car DNA and turned into a beast of a car. At its core was the Coyote V8 5.0-liter engine with a new setup. Fun fact: To celebrate Mustang's 50th year in 2015, a special edition 1964 (a reference to the launch date of the first Mustang) was launched in Kona Blue and Wimbledon White.\nThe second-gen Coyote engine retained the DOHC and Ti-VCT (Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing) and introduced some traits of the Mustang Boss 302, such as large intake and exhaust valves, stiffer valve springs to better handle its redline, new and improved cylinder head castings, and redesigned pistons, among other changes.\nThe result of this change was that the Gen 2 Coyote V8 offered better performance in straight lines and around corners. The engine produced 435 hp at 6,500 rpm and 400 lb-ft of torque. The sixth-generation Mustang GT was also a part of the \"Need for Speed Rivals\" game in 2013 and the 2014 \"Need For Speed\" film. The Gen 3 Coyote was then used inside the 2018-2023 Mustang GT, producing a staggering 460 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque.\nFord Mustang S650 (2024-present)\nComing to the 2024 Mustang, dubbed the S650, Ford didn't hold back introducing new elements. The 2024 model got new interiors, a fresh upper grille design (which was inspired by the 1960s models), classic Mustang triple-bar tail lamps, and LED lights on the front. The GT was different from other trims, as it had a bigger front grille for better air intake along with new front vents, a brand-new front splitter, and a rear diffuser.\nThe most important thing was the new Gen 4 5.0-liter Coyote engine, which was also the most powerful naturally aspirated 5.0-liter engine ever on any GT. This new engine produced a staggering 480 hp and 415 lb-ft of torque with a redline of 7,500 rpm. Revised exhaust, dual air intake box, and dual-throttle bodies helped improve power and performance. The new tweaks to the engine ensured that there was minimal induction loss and better airflow through the vents.\nFord also included an Active Valve Performance Exhaust option for the Mustang GT, which boosted the horsepower and torque to 486 hp and 418 lb-ft, respectively. This engine was paired with the returning 10-speed automatic transmission, with a manual option carried over from the S550. The car offered fun and enough power to put a smile on your face and a dent in your pocket.\nTVR Griffith (2024)\nAfter producing a bunch of good cars, TVR filed for bankruptcy in 2006. The brand came back from the dead when it announced the launch of the Griffith in 2017. However, since then, the car has been just on paper but not in the flesh. TVR was expected to launch the Griffith last year, but there's no sign of it. Yes, the official website does say that if you'd like to order a new Griffith, you can make a \u00a35,000 (roughly $6,765) deposit and get in line, but there's no clarity on when you'd get the order.\nWhile there's no information on whether or not the TVR Griffith has entered production, it did make headlines for using the Ford Coyote 5.0-liter V8 engine. The engine is in its naturally aspirated form with a few tweaks by the guys at Cosworth. According to TVR, the engine comes with a custom clutch, flywheel, ECU, dry sump, and other tinkering. The company says that the Griffith, equipped with the Coyote engine, will achieve a 400 hp per ton power-to-weight ratio.\nTVR also claims that the Griffith is capable of accelerating from 0 to 62 mph in under 4 seconds and reaching a top speed of 200 mph (approximately 322 kph). While the short-lived TVR Sagaris is arguably the brand's best car, the Griffith's looks are also eye-catching. For now, we can only hope that things get back on track for the new TVR Griffith, and hopefully, we get to see or even test ride one.\nFord Mustang S650 Dark Horse (2024-present)\nAlongside the standard Ford Mustang GT S650 (seventh-generation) models, the company also launched a Dark Horse Mustang package. Apart from the dark interior and indigo blue stitching on the suede flat-bottomed steering wheel and across other elements such as seats, door panels, gear shifter, and center console, the Dark Horse Mustang also offered boosted performance. Compared to the 480 hp of the standard Coyote Mustang GT, the Ford Mustang Dark Horse edition produced 500 hp at 7,250 rpm and 418 lb-ft of torque.\nThis package includes piston rods taken from the Shelby GT500's 760 hp 5.2L Predator engine. The dual throttle bodies and intake, plus the front grille, help the Coyote breathe cool air more easily and boost performance. The Mustang Dark Horse edition also came equipped with an auxiliary engine oil cooler, a rear axle cooler, and a lightweight radiator with powerful fans for impressive track performance. It offered a 10-speed automatic and a Tremec six-speed manual transmission.\nSporty paddle shifters helped with faster shifting, and the drive mode button was easily accessible with the driver's thumb. While the Mustang GT was available as a coupe or convertible, the Dark Horse Mustang was only available as a hardtop coupe. Also, the standard Mustang GT was available in 12 colors, whereas the Dark Horse was offered only in Blue Ember. With so many differences between the Mustang GT and Dark Horse Mustang, the latter was the obvious choice for those looking for that extra grunt. The 2025 Mustang Dark Horse features a Gen 4 Coyote engine with new hood graphics, a 13.2-inch infotainment screen, and other upgrades.\nFord Mustang S550 Bullitt and Mach 1 (2019-2023)\nClassic muscle cars were not only about power; They were famous for who used them. The 1968 Ford Mustang GT is more iconic than most muscle cars because it was what Hollywood legend Steve McQueen drove in the movie \"Bullitt.\" The car was also involved in arguably the greatest car chase scene ever filmed. Ford produced the Bullitt Mustang as a promotional vehicle, which turned out to be so phenomenal that many might have forgotten about the movie, but not the car.\nFord brought back the iconic vehicle, or specifically the nameplate, with the fifth-generation Mustang. The 2019 model highlighted all aspects of the original Bullitt, featuring fastback styling, a honeycomb grille, a Bullitt emblem faux gas cap, quad-rear exhaust, no spoiler, and no pony emblem, among other homages to the 1968 Bullitt. It was equipped with the Gen 3 Coyote engine, which was engineered to produce 475 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque and topped out at 163 mph (roughly 262 kph).\nClosing out the fifth-generation Mustang was the Mach 1, launched in 2021, which got several components from the Shelby. Ford Authority considered it the \"most track-capable 5.0L Mustang\" they've ever built. The Mach 1 also got the same Gen 3 Coyote engine and the same engine performance as the Bullitt. However, later models cut off the performance by 10 hp, bringing it down, thanks to strict emission norms. A total of around 800,000 units of the S550 Mustangs were produced globally by Ford, also making it one of the popular generations of Mustangs.\nFord Falcon FPV Australian (2011-2016)\nThe Australian Ford Falcon FG-X was powered by the Ford Coyote engine outside the U.S. and Europe. It was equipped with the U.S.-developed Coyote 5.0-liter V8 engine, which replaced the 5.4-liter Boss engine due to emission norms. The Coyote supercharged engine, known as the Miami engine, inside the Australian Ford Falcon produced 335 kW of power and 570 Nm of torque, which is equivalent to 450 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. The Australian Ford Falcon FG-X was produced from 2014 to 2016, when Ford ceased production in the country.\nProDrive produced the Miami V8 engine through a $36 million program that ran in parallel with the development of the Ford Coyote engine. All components of the Miami engine were locally sourced and were assembled in FPV Australia's factory in Campbellfield, Victoria. The Ford Falcon FG-X (also known as the XR8) was available with either a six-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. Aside from this, the Falcon featured 19-inch alloy wheels, all-wheel Brembo disc brakes, leather interiors, an 8-inch infotainment system with voice command, radio, GPS, dual-zone climate control, and other standard features.\nHowever, before the FG-X received the Coyote engine, the FPV (Ford Performance Vehicle) division of Australia fitted the Coyote V8 inside the Falcon FG models. The Miami V8 engine was also found inside the FPV Falcon GT, with the Ford Falcon FG-X, the seventh-generation Falcon in Australia, being the last model to feature the Coyote-based engine."

      "text": "What Does 'S550' Mean On A Ford Mustang?\nS550 on the Ford Mustang is the designation of the platform on which the sixth generation is built. The S550 identifies this platform as a front-engine, rear-wheel drive platform used for the company's sports cars, of which the Mustang is the sole nameplate. The S550 platform underpins Mustang vehicles made from the 2015 model year through the 2023 model year.\nThe S550 platform brought several innovations to the Mustang. The most important was independent rear suspension, the first time this had been done in a mass-produced Mustang. Replacing the previous generation Mustang's live rear axle meant a greatly improved ride and better handling. In the front, the MacPherson strut suspension was also new. Another improvement over the previous generation was a 28% more rigid chassis. The changes extended to the convertible version, which received an improved top with more sound insulation, and a faster-operating top mechanism.\nThere were also power upgrades, to add to the ride and handling improvements. The S550 Mustang started out in 2015 with three engine options \u2014 a base 3.7-liter Duratec V6 with 300 horsepower, a new 2.3-liter Ecoboost inline four with 310 horsepower, and the Mustang GT with 435 horsepower, powered by Ford's Coyote engine. Power upgrades were made over the life of the S550 platform; the EcoBoost four received a torque boost, the Coyote V8 went up to 460 horsepower, while the V6 was discontinued altogether.\nWhat are some notable S550 Mustangs?\nThere were several notable models of the S550 Mustang released during its nine model-year run. One of the most special was the 2015-20 Shelby GT350 and GT350R, powered by naturally-aspirated, flat-plane V8 engine putting out 526 horsepower with a redline of 8250 rpm. A flat-plane crankshaft is typically found in engines made for exotic cars, or in racing applications, but this was Ford's first use of it in a production car.\nThe 2015-20 Shelby GT350 models also featured braking and handling enhancements, including cross-drilled brake discs with six-piston Brembo calipers at the front, a wider front track, super-responsive MagneRide shock absorbers, and stiffer 19-inch alloy wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires made specifically for the GT350.\nAnother fan favorite S550 Mustang was a new version of the Bullitt Mustang, a callback to the Mustang driven 50 years earlier by Steve McQueen in the movie \"Bullitt.\" The Bullitt Mustang was an enhanced Mustang GT, with an additional 20 horsepower from its Coyote V8, thanks to the intake manifold and performance exhaust used on the GT350.\nThe S550 Mustang was also the first Mustang to go global, with Ford's ponycar being shipped to Europe and China, as well as versions built with right-hand steering for markets like Japan, Australia, and the UK. The S550's EcoBoost four-cylinder engine was used as the base engine for Europe, where the high cost of fuel is a consideration."

  "argos_summary": "The article explains that while a Coyote V8 swap into an EcoBoost Mustang is technically feasible, the cost ($5\u201112k for the engine plus extensive ECU, wiring, mounting, transmission, and suspension modifications) and time required make it impractical; the resale value of a modified car would likely be lower than a stock GT. It recommends buying a used or new Mustang GT instead, noting the price premium is modest (~$10k) for the factory\u2011equipped V8. The piece also highlights that the EcoBoost platform can be upgraded with intercooler, intake, and exhaust mods for incremental gains, and provides background on the Coyote\u2019s performance pedigree and its use across Ford\u2019s lineup.",
