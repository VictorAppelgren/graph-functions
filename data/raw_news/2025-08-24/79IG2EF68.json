  "description": "Footy legend Brendan Fevola made his shocking prediction on Monday, telling his radio co-hosts, 'This will happen, take that to the bank.'",
  "content": "Footy legend Brendan Fevola has claimed controversial US rapper Snoop Dogg will be dumped as the headline AFL Grand Final entertainment act due to controversy around his songs and comments on women and gay people.\n\nThe rapper's selection to perform at the AFL's showpiece event has divided Aussies, with some saying that the league is abandoning its platform of respecting women by hiring Snoop.\n\nThe hip-hop icon has also made controversial comments about same-sex relationships last week as Adelaide star Izak Rankine was suspended for four matches for directing a homophobic slur at an opponent.\n\nFevola believes that the AFL will backflip and axe Snoop from his headlining gig.\n\n'On Snoop Dogg, I might have some goss about that,' Fevola told 101.9 The Fox\u2019s Fifi, Fev & Nick on Monday.\n\n'They're going to axe him.'\n\n'Because of his lyrics in his song and he talked about gay parents over the weekend.\n\n'I think he will get the a**e, and they are going to go for an Aussie artist to play at the MCG.\n\n'That will happen, take that to the bank. He will get the [arse], which he should.'\n\nGiven Snoop's huge profile, the move would be sure to make headlines outside Australia.\n\nLast week, Dillon defended the AFL's decision to pay Snoop a rumoured $2million to perform at the grand final.\n\n'We cannot vouch for every lyric in every song ever written or performed by any artist who has or will appear on our stage, Australian or international,' he said.\n\n'It's also important to remember that we have engaged Snoop Dogg in 2025 as the person he is today.\n\n'He has spoken publicly about his past, he has changed, and today he is a grandfather, philanthropist, he helps rehabilitate youth, and he's a global entertainer who has performed at both the Super Bowl and the Olympic closing ceremony to audiences of more than 100 million people.\n\n'In those environments, his performances were appropriate and well-received, and his performance this year at our grand final will be fitting for the best sporting event in the country.'\n\nHowever, Snoop proved Dillon wrong when he appeared on a podcast last Thursday.\n\nThe 53-year-old was discussing taking his grandson to see the kids' movie Lightyear, which features two female characters who kiss.\n\nSnoop Dogg said his grandson asked him, 'Papa Snoop, how she have a baby with a woman? She's a woman.'\n\nHe responded, 'Aw s**t, I didn't come here for this s**t, I just came here to watch the goddamn movie.\n\n'So that's like f**k me, I'm scared to go to the movies now, y'all throwing me in the middle of this s**t that I don't have an answer for ... it threw me for a loop.\n\n'These are kids ... [do] we have to show that at that age? They're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.'\n\nSnoop also said 'they putting it everywhere' as he began talking about the depiction of same-sex relationships in popular culture.\n\nSimple Google searches will bring up Snoop's past scandals around homophobia.\n\nIn 2014 he published then deleted an Instagram post with a photo of two men sharing a bed and the words 'go suck ya man n get off my line f**'.\n\nThree years later, the video for his song Moment I Feared saw him accused of open homophobia for attacking rapper Young Thug - who has often worn women's clothing - in a comedy skit that saw him interview a fictional rapper wearing high heels and carrying a pink handbag.\n\nCritics of the AFL's choice have also raised Snoop's long history of sexist and misogynistic lyrics and song titles.\n\nThe rapper's 1998 hit Doggz Gonna Get Ya features the same slur, 'f****t', that Rankine used.",

      "text": "- Hip-hop icon is due to perform at this year's grand final\nSnoop Dogg has made controversial comments on same-sex relationships just a day after AFL CEO Andrew Dillon said homophobic statements were in the rapper's past ahead of his performance at this year's grand final.\nThe hip-hop icon's take on gay unions came on the same day Adelaide star Izak Rankine was suspended for four matches after his team brought up Snoop's past comments on gay people in an attempt to get the ban reduced.\nSpeaking on the It's Giving podcast on Thursday, the 53-year-old was talking about the way black men are represented on TV shows, movies and in commercials when he told an anecdote about taking his grandson to see the Toy Story spin-off movie Lightyear.\nThe movie features two female characters who kiss.\nSnoop Dogg said his grandson asked him, 'Papa Snoop, how she have a baby with a woman? She's a woman.'\nHe responded, 'Aw s**t, I didn't come here for this s**t, I just came here to watch the goddamn movie.\nHip-hop icon Snoop Dogg (pictured) has gone on a controversial rant about same-sex relationships on the same day the AFL's homophobia crisis came to a head\nIzak Rankine (pictured) was given a four-match ban for hitting an opponent with an anti-gay slur during a match at around the same time Snoop made his remarks\nAFL CEO Andrew Dillon (pictured) also defended Snoop on Thursday, saying the rapper had 'changed' and the league chose him based on 'the person he is today'\n'So that's like f**k me, I'm scared to go to the movies now, y'all throwing me in the middle of this s**t that I don't have an answer for ... it threw me for a loop.\n'These are kids ... [do] we have to show that at that age? They're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.'\nSnoop also said 'they putting it everywhere' as he began talking about the depiction of same-sex relationships in popular culture.\nOn Thursday, Dillon defended the AFL's decision to pay Snoop a rumoured $2million to perform at the grand final.\n'We cannot vouch for every lyric in every song ever written or performed by any artist who has or will appear on our stage, Australian or international,' he said.\n'It's also important to remember that we have engaged Snoop Dogg in 2025 as the person he is today.\n'He has spoken publicly about his past, he has changed, and today he is a grandfather, philanthropist, he helps rehabilitate youth, and he's a global entertainer who has performed at both the Super Bowl and the Olympic closing ceremony to audiences of more than 100 million people.\n'In those environments, his performances were appropriate and well-received, and his performance this year at our grand final will be fitting for the best sporting event in the country.'\nThe music superstar blasted the depiction of same-sex relationships in movies during his appearance on the It's Giving podcast (pictured)\nSimple Google searches will bring up Snoop's past scandals around homophobia.\nIn 2014 he published then deleted an Instagram post with a photo of two men sharing a bed and the words 'go suck ya man n get off my line f**'.\nThree years later, the video for his song Moment I Feared saw him accused of open homophobia for attacking rapper Young Thug - who has often worn women's clothing - in a comedy skit that saw him interview a fictional rapper wearing high heels and carrying a pink handbag.\nCritics of the AFL's choice have also raised Snoop's long history of sexist and misogynistic lyrics and song titles.\nThe rapper's 1998 hit Doggz Gonna Get Ya features the same slur, 'f****t', that Rankine used.\nAdelaide were able to get Rankine's suspension reduced by one week, giving him a slim chance of playing in the grand final if the club makes it that far, but the Snoop tactic was not successful.\nInstead, the AFL revealed 'compelling medical submissions' about the effect of a season-ending ban on Rankine's mental were what changed the league's mind.\nThat decision left Hawthorn legend Jason Dunstall angry and bewildered.\n'I'm about as confused as I could possibly be,' Dunstall told Fox Footy.\n'I regard myself as at least a semi-intelligent man. I don't know how compelling medical evidence gets you from five weeks down to four, and if we're talking about mental health, by what metric, measurement scale are we saying that equates to one week?\n'I don't understand, I'm confused. Can someone explain it to me?'\nHe was joined by Collingwood great Tony Shaw, who wrote on X: 'The compelling medical advice taken into account on Rankine plea? Izak is feeling sad that he stuffed up badly, letting himself, teammates and club down. Well blow me down that deserves one week less? AFL incompetent, amateurish, laughable.'"
