India will temporarily suspend most cheap postal deliveries starting Monday.\n\nThe announcements follow Trump\u2019s move in late July to suspend what is known as a de minimis exemption that has historically allowed low-value packages to be spared from tariffs on shipments and allowed foreign companies to ship cheap products to the U.S. for free.\n\nTrump\u2019s order goes into effect Aug. 29, leading foreign postal service companies to pause shipments due partly to concerns about the time frame to process implications of the new policy on commerce, and saying they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before that date.\n\nThe de minimis exemption has traditionally allowed packages worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. tariff-free. Last year, over 1.3 billion packages were shipped to the U.S. under the exemption, accounting for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\n\nSeveral shipping companies, including DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said they are suspending shipments of impacted goods due to a lack of clarity on the new policy.\n\n\u201cKey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\u201d it said in a statement, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u2033Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,\u2033 it said in a statement.\n\nBefore expanding the policy through a decree last month, Trump initially confined suspension of the de minimis exemption to China when he first signed an executive order targeting the trade loophole in April, leading major companies such as Temu to halt shipments to the U.S.",

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Closes De Minimis Exemptions to Combat China\u2019s Role in America\u2019s Synthetic Opioid Crisis\nCLOSING LOOPHOLES IN THE TARIFF SYSTEM: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order eliminating duty-free de minimis treatment for low-value imports from China, a critical step in countering the ongoing health emergency posed by the illicit flow of synthetic opioids into the U.S.\n- Following the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s notification that adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue, President Trump is ending duty-free de minimis treatment for covered goods from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.\n- Imported goods sent through means other than the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption will be subject to all applicable duties, which shall be paid in accordance with applicable entry and payment procedures.\n- All relevant postal items containing goods that are sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the de minimis exemption are subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025). This is in lieu of any other duties, including those imposed by prior Orders.\n- Carriers transporting these postal items must report shipment details to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule.\n- CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.\n- The Secretary of Commerce will submit a report within 90 days assessing the Order\u2019s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau.\nCOMBATING CHINA\u2019S ROLE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS: President Trump is targeting deceptive shipping practices by Chinese-based shippers, many of whom hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the de minimis exemption.\n- On average, CBP processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.\n- The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.\n- Many PRC-based chemical companies hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate commerce, including through false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging.\n- While the U.S. previously offered a generous de minimis exemption, China enforces strict import restrictions and tightly limits de minimis exemptions, showing no similar leniency toward U.S. shipments.\n- Last fiscal year, CBP apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.\n- It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.\n- These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.\n- More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War.\nKEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: When voters overwhelmingly elected Donald J. Trump as President, they gave him a mandate to seal the border and stop the influx of deadly drugs. That is exactly what he is doing.\n- On the campaign trail, President Trump promised \u201cWe will not rest until we have ended the drug addiction crisis.\u201d\n- Upon returning to office, President Trump immediately took action to seal the border and crack down on drug trafficking.\n- President Trump implemented 20% tariffs on China to address the threat of the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, flowing from China into the United States."

      "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed optimism that Beijing will crack down on Chinese companies facilitating the illicit flow of fentanyl into the United States.\nOver the weekend, the U.S. held talks with China in Geneva, Switzerland, that centered on lifting President Donald Trump\u2019s steep tariffs on the country and addressing fentanyl trafficking. The U.S. temporarily slashed tariffs placed on China following the talks, while Bessent said Monday that the \u201cupside surprise\u201d for him after the meetings was the \u201clevel of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl crisis.\u201d\n\u201cFor the first time, the Chinese side understood the magnitude of what is happening in the U.S.,\u201d the secretary added.\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid driving overdose deaths across the U.S. Deaths in the country attributed to the drug have surged in the past decade, topping 71,000 a year in 2021, 2022, and 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Trump and Biden administrations have accused Beijing of failing to crack down on Chinese companies that manufacture precursors, or the chemicals used to make the fentanyl, and distributing them to criminal groups in Mexico and elsewhere that produce fentanyl and traffic it into the U.S.\nIn February, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on China in an effort to incentivize Beijing to take more aggressive action to end the fentanyl crisis. Despite the latest trade agreement announced over the weekend, the U.S.\u2019s 20% tariff on Chinese goods related to the country\u2019s role in the fentanyl trade remains in place, signaling pressure on Beijing to address the opioid crisis.\nDuring an interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Monday morning, Bessent said he expects to hold the next round of talks with China on the fentanyl crisis \u201cin the next few weeks.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a priority for President Trump and indeed the whole administration,\u201d Bessent said.\n\u201cI have a personal stake in this,\u201d Bessent continued. \u201cThere are two very close friends [who] lost children to this terrible scourge. Hundreds of thousands of Americans die every year. And I think that we saw here in Geneva the Chinese are now serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.\u201d\nThe meetings in Geneva were sparked by China\u2019s outreach to the White House over fentanyl, according to the Wall Street Journal. After Trump pummeled Beijing with up to 145% tariffs, China viewed sending a message that it would take a harsher stance on targeting fentanyl traffickers as an opening to bring the Trump administration to the negotiating table and walk back the tariffs.\nBessent said that during the Geneva talks, China sent a deputy minister for public safety, its \u201cfentanyl expert,\u201d to have a \u201cvery long and in-depth sidebar about how our two countries could work together\u201d to address illicit fentanyl trafficking.\nDuring remarks at the White House touting the new trade deal as \u201ca total reset,\u201d Trump said Monday that China has \u201cagreed they\u2019re going to stop that,\u201d referring to its role in fentanyl trafficking.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be rewarded by not having to pay \u2026 hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re going to curb it, they\u2019re going to stop it \u2014 and they weren\u2019t doing that for anybody else.\u201d\nTRUMP TEAM ANNOUNCES TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA AFTER \u2018PRODUCTIVE\u2019 TALKS IN GENEVA\nTrump plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cmaybe at the end of the week.\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Beijing agreed to \u201ccontinue seriously discussing the grave impact that Chinese-produced fentanyl is having\u201d on the U.S.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to hurt China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina was being hurt very badly. They were closing up factories. They were having a lot of unrest. \u2026 They were very happy to be able to do something with us, and the relationship is very, very good.\u201d"

      "text": "Temu, a popular China-based e-tailer, halted shipments to the United States after President Donald Trump ended a trade loophole exempting low-value goods from tariffs.\nTemu has historically benefited from a provision called the \u201cde minimis rule\u201d that exempted goods worth $800 or less from tariffs. The company\u2019s operating model allows it to work closely with Chinese suppliers to ship ultra-low-priced apparel, electronics, and other items directly from China to U.S. consumers.\nHowever, in April, Trump signed an executive order ending the exemption effective May 2. On Friday, Temu announced it would no longer ship products directly from Chinese factories to U.S. consumers. Instead, it will rely on domestic local sellers in the U.S. to distribute its products.\nThe U.S. version of Temu\u2019s website now only displays products warehoused domestically, identified as \u201clocal,\u201d while goods shipped from China are listed as out of stock.\nIn a statement to the Washington Examiner, Temu confirmed it is \u201ctransitioning to a local fulfillment model\u201d and \u201cactively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.\u201d\n\u201cAll sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers. \u2026 This shift is part of Temu\u2019s ongoing adjustments to improve service levels.\u201d\nThe de minimis rule exemption took effect in 2016, although similar loopholes have existed for nearly a century since Congress approved the policy in the 1930s.\nChinese companies such as Temu and Shein have historically taken advantage of the exemption to sell low-priced goods to U.S. consumers.\nCritics say there\u2019s evidence that the online marketplaces are guilty of human rights violations, using forced labor to churn out fast fashion goods. They worry Temu is conducting operations in the Xinjiang region of China that could be taking advantage of the Uyghur minority, an oppressed group many countries recognize as the target of genocide. Critics have also expressed concern about dangerous toxins in Temu\u2019s products, including elevated levels of lead, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and phthalates.\nThe Trump administration has focused primarily on the economic angle when dealing with companies such as Temu. The White House believes that cheap goods and low prices are not worth outsourcing jobs and companies to foreign countries.\nTrump said last month that the import duty exemption for parcels worth $800 or less amounted to \u201ca big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\u201d\nHis words come after Customs and Border Protection said it processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024, up from over 1 billion shipments the previous year.\nNow that the trade exemption has expired, Temu and Shein will be among the China-based companies subject to Trump\u2019s steep tariffs against Beijing. The president has placed duties of up to 145% on the country to push it to the negotiating table and draw up a new trade deal.\nThe U.S. is in talks with China to negotiate a deal the president hopes will correct trade practices he believes disadvantage U.S. workers and businesses.\nLOW-COST PACKAGES TO START FEELING THE WEIGHT OF TRUMP TARIFFS\n\u201cI think that over time we will see that the Chinese tariffs are unsustainable for China,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. \u201cRemember that we are the deficit country. They sell almost five times more goods to us than we sell to them, so the onus will be on them to take off these tariffs.\u201d\nWhile Temu has completely retired products shipped from China to the U.S. to avoid paying duties, Shein has yet to take such action. However, it has already raised its prices by large margins, with its top 100 products in the beauty and health category seeing an average increase of 51%, according to Bloomberg."

      "text": "Low-cost packages imported to the United States by China that were historically exempted from paying dues have been provided some relief from steep tariffs the Trump administration placed on Beijing.\nFor decades, Chinese companies have benefited from a U.S. provision called the \u201cde minimis rule\u201d that exempted goods worth $800 or less from any tariffs. That relief ended when President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April terminating the trade loophole, making massive China-based businesses such as Shein and Temu subject to a 120% tariff the White House had placed on Beijing.\nHowever, the Trump administration announced on Monday that the tariffs on small packages imported from China have been reduced to 54% due to a new trade deal Beijing made with Trump over the weekend.\nThe new policy takes effect on Wednesday, providing critical relief to companies such as Temu, which had halted all shipments to the U.S. after Trump ended the de minimis provision. Instead of paying a 120% tariff to import cheaper goods to the U.S., Chinese companies can now choose between paying a flat fee of $100 per package or paying the reduced 54% tariff. And the fee of $100 will not rise to $200 in June as planned.\nThe news comes after Washington and Beijing came to a temporary trade agreement over the weekend that Trump hailed as a \u201ctotal reset\u201d in relations between the two countries. The U.S. lowered tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%, while China cut its levies on U.S. products to 10% from 125%.\nSCOTT BESSENT OPTIMISTIC CHINA WILL BOOST RESPONSE TO FENTANYL TRADE: \u2018UPSIDE SURPRISE\u2019\nTrump said Monday he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cmaybe at the end of the week\u201d as the U.S. and Beijing look to hash out a permanent agreement during the 90-day pause in their trade war.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to hurt China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina was being hurt very badly.

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending the de\u2011minimis exemption for low\u2011value imports has prompted postal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the UK, and India to halt shipments to the United States, citing uncertainty over new tariff rules that will apply to goods worth $800 or less. The move follows Trump\u2019s broader trade strategy, which includes high tariffs on Chinese goods and a focus on curbing the illicit flow of synthetic opioids, and is part of a larger U.S.\u2013China trade negotiation that recently saw temporary tariff reductions. Major e\u2011retailers such as Temu and Shein have already stopped shipping directly from China, shifting to local fulfillment to avoid the new duties. The pause reflects global carriers\u2019 concerns about compliance, data reporting, and the timing of the policy\u2019s implementation, as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection prepares to enforce the new duty regime starting August 29. The policy also ties into Trump\u2019s broader efforts to address the opioid crisis by targeting Chinese companies involved in fentanyl precursor production. ",
