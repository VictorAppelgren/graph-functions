The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\nAI is eating the world\u2014and the machines behind it are ravenous.\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it\u2019s about to get worse.\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\u201cThe future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth\u2014collecting fees on every drop exported.\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026\nAs Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\nAI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\nThis company has its finger in every pie\u2014and Wall Street is just starting to notice.\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds\u2014without the sky-high valuation.\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.

      "text": "SmartRent, Inc. (NYSE:SMRT) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript August 7, 2025\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SmartRent quarter 2 2025 earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kelly Reisdorf, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKelly Reisdorf: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. My name is Kelly Reisdorf, Head of Investor Relations for SmartRent. I\u2019m joined today by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Martell; and Daryl Stemm, Chief Financial Officer. . Before the market opened today, we issued an earnings release and filed our 10-Q with the SEC, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Frank, I would like to remind everyone that the discussion today may contain certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Various factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such statements.\nThese factors are discussed in our SEC filings, including in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to provide updates regarding forward-looking statements made during this call, and we recommend that all investors review these reports thoroughly before taking a financial position in SmartRent. Also during today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, along with the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in today\u2019s earnings release. We would also like to highlight that the second quarter earnings presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank D. Martell: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2025 earnings call. Before we dive into the quarter, I want to start by saying how energized I am to be stepping into the CEO role at SmartRent. Over the past year, my service on the Board of the company has provided me with critical insights into both the company\u2019s foundational strengths as well as areas we need to address to fully realize our full potential. I believe I bring to SmartRent and all of our stakeholders a significant and long established track record of generating growth and profitability while successfully navigating challenging internal and external factors. From my point of view, SmartRent\u2019s opportunities for profitable growth and sustained market leadership are compelling.\nWe operate in a large expanding market with a purpose-driven, differentiated platform and a growing SaaS footprint. As a hardware-enabled SaaS company with meaningful scale, our foundation is domain expertise and close alignment with the needs of our customers, both property owners and operators. Our solutions are retrofit-friendly, integrate seamlessly with third-party hardware and property management systems and are designed to deliver measurable ROI. With roughly 850,000 units deployed, we believe that we have significant scale advantage and are increasingly poised to leverage that advantage through continued operational efficiency. The introduction of new and enhanced capabilities across such areas as IoT, data and analytics as well as the infusion of AI into our products and operations, SmartRent delivers strong value that our customers rely on.\nAs a result, we\u2019ve built sticky and long-term customer relationships. In a recent survey, 90% of property managers cited net operating income expansion as a key reason for continued investment in SmartRent. As a further proof point, our second quarter net customer revenue retention rate was 108%. We believe that our customers recognize the power of our deep domain expertise and strong platform. For these reasons and others, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to lead the category during the next phase of growth. Our continued leadership will be built on a relentless focus towards operational rigor and financial discipline as we continue innovation and close customer engagement. In this regard, I will focus my remaining remarks today on key actions the company has, is and will be taking to address our near-term challenges, namely resetting our cost structure, returning the company to profitability and accelerating top line growth.\nRegarding our cost productivity and reduction initiatives, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the team implemented cost actions resulting in more than $10 million in annualized savings. Over the past month, we expanded our cost reduction program by an additional $20 million. The majority of our cost reductions come primarily from workflow optimization, lower staffing levels and reduced third-party spending. The $30 million in cost reductions I just discussed should progressively benefit our financial results over the remaining months of this year. Given our expected revenue run rates over the balance of this year and the impact of the cost reduction program, we believe the company is on track to achieve adjusted EBITDA and cash flow neutrality on a run rate basis exiting 2025.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the company has a significant cash balance of $105 million. Achieving cash flow neutrality together with a disciplined push on working capital execution, which is expected to generate approximately $15 million of working capital from our balance sheet should result in us maintaining a significant cash balance. As we head into 2026. our cash reserves will allow us to continue to fund product innovation and further operating efficiencies, resulting in a strong base for long-term success. At the same time, we are resetting our cost structure. We have taken important steps towards accelerating top line growth rates as we approach 2026. As you may recall, about a year ago, the company announced a $10 million investment to accelerate product development, enhance deployment capabilities and strengthen our go-to-market team.\nWe are seeing these investments beginning to bear fruit. The rebuild of our sales organization is yielding increased customer engagement and product enhancements are gaining traction. In Q2, we recorded over 24,000 new units booked, our highest total in over a year. In addition, our SaaS revenues continue to grow, and we saw strong interest in new solutions and product enhancements like our energy dashboard and SMRT IQ, which are fueled by SmartRent\u2019s unique data advantage from having nearly 850,000 deployed units comprising over 3 million connected devices. As Daryl will discuss in a few minutes, our revenue growth profile has been negatively impacted over the past 1.5 years by a conscious decision to transition away from onetime bulk hardware deals, lacking alignment to customer implementation time lines.\nAs we enter 2026, we believe our reported growth rates will benefit from better alignment to customer buying cycles. This alignment should result in a shift towards more consistent, predictable and recurring revenue models. In closing, I want to thank the SmartRent team for their focus, resilience and commitment to execution. I believe in the company and that we are aggressively taking the right steps to realize its full potential. I look forward to sharing our continued progress in the quarters ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Daryl, who will take everyone through our quarterly financials for Q2.\nDaryl Stemm: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2025 results. I\u2019ll now walk through the financials and provide some additional context on how we\u2019re executing against our plan, managing the business with discipline and making targeted investments to drive long-term growth and operating efficiency. For the second quarter of 2025, total revenue was $38.3 million, down 7% sequentially from $41.4 million in the first quarter and down 21% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the decision to move away from bulk hardware sales, which Frank alluded to earlier. This approach is expected to result in more predictable revenue through better alignment with our customers\u2019 buying cycles.\nHardware revenue totaled $15.1 million in the second quarter, representing a 20% decrease sequentially and a 39% decline year-over-year, reflecting the decision to move away from bulk hardware sales, which I just discussed. Professional services revenue came in at $4.3 million, up 10% sequentially from $3.9 million in Q1 and down 26% from the same quarter prior year. The sequential growth reflects stronger sales organization execution, while the year-over-year comparison continues to reflect the broader slowdown in new unit deployments. Hosted services revenue reached $18.8 million, representing a 1% sequential growth and a 5% increase year-over-year. This category now makes up nearly half of our total revenue and continues to benefit from expanding platform usage, high retention and increasing demand for our software capabilities across our installed base.\nAs Frank and I both discussed, these results highlight the underlying transformation in our revenue mix as we move towards a more predictable recurring model that supports long-term margin expansion and financial stability. Importantly, SaaS revenue, which is a component of our hosted services revenue for the second quarter totaled $14.2 million and now comprises 37% of the company\u2019s total revenue, up from 34% in Q1 and 26% from the prior year quarter. Our annual recurring revenue reached $56.9 million, up 11% year-over-year. This growth reflects the continued expansion of our recurring revenue base and the successful execution of our strategy to drive higher-margin platform-led value. SaaS ARPU reached $5.66, which is up slightly from $5.63 year-over-year, while Units Booked SaaS ARPU rose to $8.21, up from $8.07 in the same quarter last year.\nThese improvements reflect disciplined pricing, enhanced value delivery and our ability to drive more revenue per booked unit as our platform capabilities expand. SaaS gross profit came in at $10 million, up 1% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year, resulting in a gross margin of roughly 70%. This continued strength underscores the efficiency and scalability of our software infrastructure and reinforces the core thesis behind our shift to a higher quality revenue mix. As of the end of Q2, SmartRent has approximately 850,000 units deployed, an increase of 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. This continued growth in our installed base reflects steady adoption across our customer portfolio. Importantly, the quality of our installed base remains strong.\nChurn is exceptionally low, less than 0.1% and net revenue retention continues to exceed 100%, supported by consistent customer engagement across the platform. These characteristics position us to drive increasingly predictable cash flows as we continue to execute against our financial and operational targets. We booked over 24,000 units in the quarter, representing our highest quarterly booking performance in more than a year and signaling early commercial traction following our go-to-market rebuild. Total gross profit in the quarter was $12.7 million compared to $17.3 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of lower hardware shipments and associated margin mix. By segment, hardware gross profit was $2.3 million, down from $8.4 million in the prior year, reflecting lower shipment volume and continued transition away from bulk hardware deals and changes in product mix.\nProfessional services gross loss improved to $1.9 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million in the prior year quarter, driven by operational efficiencies and improved unit economics. And finally, hosted services gross profit totaled $12.3 million, essentially in line with the prior year quarter. Gross margin in Q2 was 33%, down from 36% in the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of unfavorable changes in hardware product mix, partially offset by continued strong SaaS gross margins of 70% in the quarter. We continue to believe SaaS margins can expand over time with scale and further infrastructure optimization. Operating expenses were $24.4 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year. Q2 2025 included approximately $2 million of severance and legal expenses, which have no prior year counterpart.\nNet losses increased to $10.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower hardware sales, which were discussed previously. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $7.3 million, a year-over-year decline of $8.3 million. We ended the quarter with $105 million in cash, no debt and $75 million in undrawn credit, giving us a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to execute from a position of strength. During the quarter, we used a total of $20.6 million of cash. Cash use was primarily a result of $6 million from operating losses, net of noncash expenses, $8.5 million of accounts receivable growth, and we repurchased $3.7 million of our stock. As we\u2019ve discussed, one of our key short-term financial goals is to achieve a cash flow neutral run rate as we exit 2025.\nTo support that, we remain focused on driving operating efficiency while continuing to reinvest in our highest return areas of organic growth. During the second quarter, we continued to take aggressive actions to rightsize our cost base and invest in our future growth as well as our operational effectiveness. The majority of our targeted cost reductions have been actioned, and we believe they\u2019ll contribute to achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability and run rate cash neutrality exiting 2025. As I discussed earlier, we\u2019re taking actions to reduce our cash burn and to preserve a significant cash position as we head into 2026.

Our strategy is focused, our team is aligned, and we believe the foundation we\u2019re putting in place positions us for long-term value creation. Thank you for your continued support. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ryan Tomasello from KBW.\nQ&A Session\nFollow Stein Mart Inc (NASDAQ:SMRT)\nFollow Stein Mart Inc (NASDAQ:SMRT)\nRyan John Tomasello: In terms of the $20 million of incremental cost savings, I know you gave some color in your prepared remarks, but maybe a bit more detail on the sources of those savings. And from here, do you think there could be more room to extract some efficiencies beyond the cumulative $30 million? Or do you feel like you\u2019re done with the expense side of the P&L for the time being?\nFrank D. Martell: Ryan, it\u2019s Frank Martell. Yes, look, I think the 3 areas that I covered are that\u2019s where the predominant amount of the reductions are. A lot of it is the staffing reductions. and third-party spending. Those are the 2 principal areas. To answer your question regarding the future, I think there is plenty of productivity yet to come for the company as we work on the fundamental workflows and bring in some automation and some additional talent. So I do think there is continued efficiency as well as procurement and areas like procurement of hardware and that sort of thing. So there\u2019s more runway. And I think that the good news is we executed substantially all of the actions necessary to achieve the $30 million. We\u2019re already seeing benefit in the P&L. And I would expect, as I mentioned in my script that, that should be over the course of this year that we\u2019ll come out of this year with about $30 million substantially running through the P&L.\nRyan John Tomasello: And Frank, now that you\u2019ve had a few months as CEO, and I know you\u2019ve had some tenure on the Board as well, maybe just another opportunity to give us your holistic view as it stands today on how you intend to evolve and refine SmartRent\u2019s strategy going forward. Just generally, where you feel like some of the more attractive and low-hanging fruit opportunities are to reposition the business in order to drive growth from here?\nFrank D. Martell: Yes. So a couple of comments there. Number one is the team is great here. It\u2019s really dedicated, smart and creative. And I think from my point of view, that\u2019s the basic building ingredient needed to go forward. I think our customers, I\u2019ve been on a number of customer calls. And I think we\u2019ve got really good relationships despite all of the kind of the ups and downs in the last year or 2. So that\u2019s also, I think, something that is sticky. We have a huge installed base. I think there\u2019s room to grow that installed base as well. Our clients are all very positive about the company and what we contribute to their operation and their success. So from that point of view, our customers are sticking with us. And I think there\u2019s room in every account to grow.\nI think there\u2019s also new segments that we haven\u2019t played in that we\u2019re looking at. So I think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for growth that strikes me. I\u2019ve been in businesses where starting out with a very sticky customer and a scale advantage that we have, 850,000 deployments with 3 million connected devices is a great opportunity for us to expand. We\u2019re going to invest selectively in AI. I think from that \u2014 everybody is doing that, but we really have not done it to the degree that we should and could. So I think that\u2019s another area. And that offers us both, I think, internal efficiency and offers our customers more value. So there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to grow. It\u2019s just unfortunate that we\u2019ve had this whipsaw effect of these bulk hardware sales that now work through the system, and we\u2019re seeing the end of that, hopefully, as we get into fourth quarter.\nAnd so we\u2019ll just \u2014 without that, I think, as Daryl said, we\u2019ll have a more predictable revenue trajectory than we\u2019ve had in the last 1.5 years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Yi Fu Lee from Cantor Fitzgerald.\nYi Fu Lee: Welcome, Frank, to the seat. So like my question, Frank, is similar to Tom. Like I just want to get more clarity, color on your vision, your strategy in terms of like what is new from your current plan. I know you sit on the Board before, so you have experience with SmartRent versus the prior CEO. What is different that we should expect? And I also have more follow-up.\nFrank D. Martell: Yes. Look, I think from my point of view, I\u2019d like to have a SmartRent setup in every apartment in the country. I think we have that capability. so I\u2019d like SmartRent technology to be everywhere in the multifamily space. And I think we have a good jump on that with certainly the big players. I think we have a little work to do to make sure that the economics work for smaller installations, but I think that that\u2019s not going to be a major issue for us because the [ heritage ] of the company is starting with really the large players and building out a big scale. So I think from my point of view, strategically, we want to expand the company. We need to get more operating leverage, to be honest. So that\u2019s both on the hardware and the software side.\nAnd that\u2019s about everywhere from installation to operations, we have to make sure that 1 plus 1 equals 3. And so those are operational matters that I think we have a good line of sight into dealing with. And then look, I think there\u2019s a big game to play in AI. Everybody is struggling to get talent in the AI space, but customer engagement, operational effectiveness, planning and product are all going to benefit from AI. We have done some work there. We have a lot of data to put to work as well. So I think those are all great opportunities, very significant opportunities over the long run. And so the good news is we don\u2019t lack for opportunities. We just have to do it effectively and to make sure that it results in profitability, which is what Daryl mentioned when we talked about financial discipline and rigor around tracking and measuring our success.\nYi Fu Lee: That makes sense, Frank. And for me, the follow-up is like the SaaS revenue model adoption, obviously standing at 37% of total revenue. And obviously, Daryl, you can help out on this as well. I think it cuts to the financials as well. You mentioned by the end of this year, the hardware headwind will subside. Does that mean like 2026, we should see expansion? That\u2019s number one. And two, can you help us walk through the journey, like the transition journey in terms of getting customers to get to SaaS. I understand if it\u2019s a new customer, I presume you\u2019re going to want to sell SaaS. But if I\u2019m already an existing customer, how hard is it to get them to SaaS with the understanding, obviously, SaaS enjoys a higher margin, like you said, over 70% and there\u2019s more to go, right?\nFrank D. Martell: Yes. Let me \u2014 I\u2019ll hand it over to Daryl. I just want to mention on the revenue point, when you do bulk hardware sales, they\u2019re very large as a percentage of our revenue in some quarters. So when you eliminate that, those sales don\u2019t go away. They just have a different timing profile. So from my point of view, the lumpiness will dissipate and you\u2019ll have a more progressive growth profile. I\u2019m not saying every quarter necessarily will be growth, but you should see a growth profile. And in a business like this, we should see an acceleration of growth because we have a lot of virgin territory to go after in terms of customers and products. And I think from that point of view, it\u2019s a big space. And we have a big base already, but it could get much, much bigger. And I think that\u2019s \u2014 those are the fundamental drivers. But I\u2019ll let Daryl kind of cover the other matter just [indiscernible] for completeness.\nDaryl Stemm: Yes. Some additional thoughts on the SaaS revenue. For us, our primary driver of increased SaaS revenue is adding new units onto our platform. And the number of units that we currently have deployed is about 850,000 in total, and that represents about a 10% increase year-over-year. So number one, simply expanding the installed base is very important. The other is we\u2019ve been increasing and enhancing our product offering to deliver more value to our customers, and it\u2019s reflecting itself in a higher average SaaS ARPU. What\u2019s really important to note with regards to the ARPU metrics is that our existing deployed base is averaging about $5.66 per unit and the new bookings that will then become deployed units are averaging in excess of $8. So what that tells us is that we\u2019re offering an enhanced value, and we just want to make sure one of our objectives would be to continue to book SaaS at rates that are above our existing deployed SaaS rate.\nYi Fu Lee: Got it. Got it. And then, Daryl, let me end with one last question. I\u2019ll ask them both at the same time, it\u2019s more financial related. You mentioned adjusted EBITDA as well as free cash flow neutrality as you exit 4Q of this year. So does this mean that going forward, 2026 and beyond, should we expect either breakeven or above? That\u2019s number one. And then, Frank, on the product side, you mentioned about infusing AI into the product. Can you tease us a little bit more on what are the things that in your road map, technology road map that you want to build into the product? As Daryl mentioned, obviously, the new bookings are \u2014 you\u2019re enjoying over $8 in ARPU. So I just want to get a sense of the AI infusion.\nDaryl Stemm: Yes. First, let me answer your first part of the question. We believe that we\u2019re positioning ourselves to exit this year on a breakeven basis. We\u2019re not yet giving guidance, formal guidance. We do hope to provide that at some point in the not-too-distant future. But we\u2019re simply saying that we\u2019ve now aligned or planning on fully implementing a plan to align our cost with our existing revenue level. And then with continued discipline, financial discipline, we would anticipate positioning ourselves for profitable growth, leveraging our existing operating expenses and optimizing our operations further. But we\u2019re not yet formally instituting guidance to be clear.\nFrank D. Martell: Yes. And look, to answer your question on AI, but just to also mention the idea, we have $105 million of cash at the end of the second quarter. We want to keep that cash and invest it in the future. And I think that\u2019s the opportunity that we have and we\u2019re laser-focused on. And so \u2014 and eventually grow the balance because that will be the fuel for investment and realizing our fullest potential over the 3- to 5-year kind of planning horizon. In terms of AI, we are already in AI to a certain degree. I\u2019d say it\u2019s small at this point. We have a lot of data. And so the use of that data to help our clients make better decisions is an area, for example, that AI will play a role in. In addition, across our ability to \u2014 having our 850,000 units installed is a pretty large servicing effort as well.\nSo this helps us to be very efficient in responding to customer inquiries. And then eventually, it will help us to, I think, diagnose and detect risk elements, for example, leaks and other things. So there\u2019s a lot of application to AI here for both our workflow and for our customers\u2019 workflow, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to focus the next 12 to 18 months.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Frank Martell for closing remarks.\nFrank D. Martell: Okay. Thanks, operator. Look, in closing, I want to thank all of our talented employees and all of our stakeholders for your ongoing support. It\u2019s very meaningful. I think we\u2019ve laid out a clear plan at this point to drive for profitability in the coming quarters and to grow our business with property owners and operators at a more rapid pace as we get into 2026. We\u2019re going to remain laser-focused in the next couple of quarters on disciplined execution and market leadership, and that\u2019s the recipe for our long-term success. So thanks, everybody, and I look forward to reporting more on our progress in the coming quarters.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect."

Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future.

Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District.

Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play.

  "argos_summary": "Hayden Capital reported a 17.6% return in Q2\u202f2025, outperforming the S&P\u202f500 and MSCI World, and highlighted SmartRent (SMRT) as a notable pick. SmartRent posted a 54% one\u2011month gain but a 12.9% year\u2011to\u2011date decline, with Q2 revenue down 7% sequentially and 21% YoY to $38.3\u202fmillion. Hayden cautions that while SmartRent shows potential, AI\u2011focused stocks offer greater upside and lower downside risk, and the firm does not include SMRT in its top 30 hedge\u2011fund holdings.",
