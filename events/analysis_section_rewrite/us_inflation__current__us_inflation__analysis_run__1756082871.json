      "feedback": "Actionable upgrade (0–3 week horizon, world‑class quality): restructure the piece into a tight 0–3 week flow—start with immediate drivers (Powell’s signaling, FedCut odds at ~85% for September per CME FedWatch, tariff/news flow), then lay out near‑term catalysts (Nvidia earnings as a tech‑sector hinge; August jobs/inflation data) and the resulting positioning dynamics (risk‑on tilt if data confirm cooling inflation and weak payrolls; risk‑off if tariff volatility or AI momentum stalls) and end with what to monitor and how the market should react. Ground every claim in three anchor numbers from the sources: 17F49LURJ (85% odds of a 25bp September cut, up from 75%), LLN6N4H3Z (AC costs up about $1,500 on new refrigerant rules; replacement cost for a 15‑year old unit ~ $13k–$14k), and 218AGGUXB (Krugman warning on tariff/deportation drag vs AI investment as a potential offset; Intel stake controversy as a policy‑risk channel). Build a three‑scenario framework (base, upside, downside) with explicit catalysts and invalidation rules: base if Nvidia guides well and tariff uncertainty gradually subsides, upside if AI capex accelerates and policy signals remain credibly easing, downside if tariffs persist or AI momentum falters and inflation risks re‑assert; specify invalidation events (e.g., a material Nvidia miss or CPI/salaries surprise; Fed communication deviating from the market’s price). Strengthen the causal chain by clarifying the transmission: tariff/shock boosts inflation and potentially slows growth; AI investment acts as a productivity/policy offset; policy signals (Intel stake debate) add a tech‑capex risk premium. Quantify positioning signals: state the near‑term price/volatility implications tied to the 85% cut odds and Nvidia’s print, and keep cash/stock turnover contingent on those data points. Improve source balance and reconciliation: acknowledge Krugman’s stagflation risk versus the upside from AI investment and the policy‑risk channel (218AGGUXB) and present these as competing forces within a single probabilistic framework instead of a single‑narrative claim. Tighten citation usage so every key assertion rests on one of the three sources (17F49LURJ, 218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z) and prune extraneous sources. Finally, ensure concise formatting: a single, coherent paragraph that delivers the 0–3 week focus, followed by a short bullets‑style next‑steps list (data to watch: Nvidia print, August jobs/inflation, Fed communications; events: Intel stake reaction; policy signals: tariff updates). Suggested phraseology anchors: use the 85% figure verbatim for the near‑term odds, quote the $1,500 cost impact for cooling as a proxy for inflationary transmission, and flag the Nvidia earnings as the key profitability/weather vane for AI demand, with Krugman’s stagflation framing as the baseline risk constraint.
