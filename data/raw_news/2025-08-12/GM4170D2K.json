  "description": "Like all richie-rich types who were born on third base but think they hit a triple, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is convinced not only that he got his current gig on ...",
  "content": "Like all richie-rich types who were born on third base but think they hit a triple, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is convinced not only that he got his current gig on merit but also that he is a genuine medical expert, despite no training whatsoever. Only someone with that level of hubris could demand that a major medical journal retract a study because he doesn\u2019t like the outcome.\n\nEarlier this month, Kennedy called on the Annals of Internal Medicine to retract its publication of a large-scale Danish vaccine study. Kennedy is unhappy that the study found no link between aluminum in vaccines and increased health risks in children. Of course Kennedy is unhappy. That conspiracy theory is at the heart of his long-running anti-vaccine crusade.\n\nNever mind that the Danish study examined two decades\u2019 worth of data on 1.2 million children to conclude there is no evidence that aluminum in vaccines causes autoimmune, allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders in children. But Kennedy\u2019s vibes say that\u2019s wrong, so he penned a screed at TrialSite about how very wrong the study was. Kennedy played the hits, alleging that the \u201cpharma-funded mainstream media\u201d credulously reported the study conclusions and that the study itself was \u201ca propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d He claims the study is also bad because the Danish government owns a vaccine company and because there was no control group of unvaccinated children.\n\nThe response from the medical journal was a polite, but definite \u201clol, nope.\u201d The editor-in-chief of the Annals said she saw no reason to retract the study. The study\u2019s lead author wrote a post at TrialSite addressing Kennedy\u2019s critiques and pointing out things that are painfully obvious to actual scientists. For example, there was no control group because only 2% of Danish children are unvaccinated, which is too small to act as a control group.\n\nThe normal course of action when challenging a study design is to start by writing a letter to the editor of the publication where the study appeared. Those letters include scientific evidence and citations. But Kennedy didn\u2019t go that route, instead running to the safety of TrialSite. Because while TrialSite tries to look like an actual science publication, it\u2019s nothing more than a pseudoscience haven pushing vaccine conspiracies and routinely showering praise on Kennedy for his anti-science efforts, such as terminating mRNA vaccine research. If Kennedy wasn\u2019t the head of HHS, this would be nothing more than an \u201cold man yells at clouds\u201d sort of thing, but since he is, everyone has to pretend to take him seriously.\n\nKennedy\u2019s old anti-vax pals at Children\u2019s Health Defense are also mad about the study. These people are also just cranks yelling at clouds, but one of their own is now head of the HHS. Kennedy also installed former CHD colleagues on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices instead of actual scientists.\n\nUnlike in the United States public health sector, Kennedy has no real leverage here. The Danish government funded the study, and the lead author is a Danish epidemiologist. Kennedy can\u2019t threaten their funding because we didn\u2019t fund it. He can\u2019t threaten the institute where the author is employed, because it\u2019s in Denmark. All the usual methods the administration uses to attack science just aren\u2019t available in this situation.\n\nThe administration simply cannot stand that it can\u2019t exert authority over scientific journals, despite their best and stupidest efforts. Back when Donald Trump crony Ed Martin was the Interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., he wrote a threatening letter to a chest disease journal in Illinois, alleging that somehow they were committing fraud by being paid off by their advertisers to promote scientific positions.\n\nMartin also sent combative letters to the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and Obstetrics & Gynecology. Of course, the U.S. Attorney for D.C. has no authority over medical journals published in other states, but a lack of authority never stopped this administration.\n\nThere is one thing the Trump administration can do to attack scientific journals, but it is a pretty paltry one. It can terminate all government subscriptions, which is precisely what it did last month with Springer Nature. Now, federal employees can no longer easily access Nature, the flagship British publication that is the most-cited scientific research journal in the world, not to mention the other 3,000 journals in Springer\u2019s portfolio. Well, that\u2019s one way to make sure federal employees have no access to actual science.\n\nThis administration is doing its best to destroy public health and undermine science, but certain things remain untouchable\u2014like studies funded by other countries that appear in journals not controlled by the U.S. government. Perhaps Trump will try to solve this by slapping a 1,000% tariff on Denmark. That\u2019ll teach \u2018em.",

  "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called on the Annals of Internal Medicine (HHS) to retract its publication of a Danish vaccine study that found no link between aluminum in vaccines and increased health risks in children. This comes despite Kennedy's belief that he got his current position on merit and is a genuine medical expert, despite no formal training. The Danish study, which examined data on 1.2 million children, found there was no evidence that aluminum in vaccine causes autoimmune, allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but Kennedy believes this is wrong. He accuses the study's lead author of being a propaganda stunt by the pharmaceutical industry and claims the Danish government owns a vaccine company. However, Kennedy has limited influence over the study as it was funded by the government and its lead author is Danish epidemiologist. The administration cannot use these methods to attack scientific journals, as the Danish study was funded and the lead author's research was conducted without funding.",

      "text": "Medical journals hit with threatening letters from Justice Department\nJustice Department probes medical journals over partisanship\nThe letters began arriving at medical journals around the country over the last few weeks.\n\"It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications \u2026 are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates,\" wrote Edward R. Martin Jr., the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, in a letter to the journal CHEST.\nMartin then asks a series of questions \u2014 about misinformation, competing viewpoints and the influence of funders such as advertisers and the National Institutes of Health.\n\"The public has certain expectations and you have certain responsibilities,\" the letter adds. Martin asks for a response by May 2.\n\"We were surprised,\" says Dr. Eric Rubin, the editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, one of at least four journal editors to get a letter from Martin and probably the most prominent. \"Other journals had gotten letters before, so it wasn't a shock, but, still, a surprise.\"\nIn addition to Rubin's journal, Martin has sent letters to JAMA, which is published by the American Medical Association; Obstetrics & Gynecology, a journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; and CHEST, which is published by the American College of Chest Physicians. There may be others.\n\"We were concerned because there were questions that suggested that we may be biased in the research we report,\" Rubin says. \"We aren't. We have a very rigorous review process. We use outside experts. We have internal editors who are experts in their fields as well. And we spend a lot of time choosing the right articles to publish and trying to get the message right. We think we're an antidote for misinformation.\"\nRubin says the letter mentioned that the journal has tax-exempt status.\n\"It does feel like there's a threatening tone to the letter and it is trying to intimidate us,\" Rubin says.\nFirst Amendment protection may be no deterrent\nThe letters don't cite any specific examples of supposed bias or say what action Martin might take.\nBut others say the letters raise serious concerns.\n\"It's pretty unprecedented,\" says J.T. Morris, a lawyer at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group. He says the First Amendment protects medical journals.\n\"Who knows? We've seen this administration take all sorts of action that doesn't have a legal basis and it hasn't stopped them,\" Morris says. \"And so there's always a concern that the federal government and its officials like Ed Martin will step outside and abuse their authority and try to use the legal process and abuse the court system into compelling scientific journals and medical professionals and anybody else they disagree with into silence.\"\nScience depends on publication in journals\nMedical journals play a crucial role in vetting and disseminating scientific information, including which treatments and public health measures work, which don't and which ones might be dangerous or safe.\n\"It's an indication of the degree to which this administration will go to try to interfere with scientific research and the scientific community,\" says Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington. \"They'll do just about anything and tamper with science in any way that they think will be helpful.\"\nThe letters come as the Trump administration has been trying to influence what scientists can say in a variety of ways. The administration has stifled communication by federal scientists and slashed studies about misinformation, about how to talk about vaccines and about LGBTQ+ health issues.\nIt has been requiring scientists to scrub language in their grants and research deemed \"woke,\" including gender terminology.\n\"This is a set of policies attacking the scientific community, whether it's scientists in universities or in institutions like NIH, FDA, CDC or journals and their editors,\" says Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet, a leading British medical journal. The Lancet has not received one of the letters, Horton says, but published an editorial condemning the inquiries.\n\"This is a research ecosystem, and it is the working of that research ecosystem which has delivered these phenomenal breakthroughs over so many decades. And that is what's being attacked,\" Horton says.\nTrump administration has criticized journals\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya have both criticized medical journals. Kennedy has even threatened legal action against journals. Just before taking over at the NIH, Bhattacharya helped start a new journal aimed at providing an alternative to mainstream publications.\nNeither Martin nor the Department of Justice responded to NPR's requests for comment.\nBut some other people also assert that the dominant medical journals are biased.\n\"I share concerns with the U.S. attorney that American scientific groups and journals have become far too activist and far too left wing in recent years,\" says Judge Glock, who directs research at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.\nBut even Glock and others who share that view stop short of wanting the Justice Department to investigate medical journals.\n\"In general, the U.S. attorney shouldn't be concerning himself or herself with the position of these particular journals,\" Glock says. \"They should not ask for information, and they should not be trying to encourage them to publish different types of editorials or change their editorial practices based on what a U.S. attorney feels is appropriate.\"\nBut there is some support for how Martin is pressing the journals.\n\"They are absolutely biased, and we've seen that they've been captured by what I called a blob, which is a form of gatekeepers that are colluding with the Big Pharma and the public health agencies and academia and they all know each other,\" says Roger Severino of the Heritage Foundation, another conservative think tank. \"So, yes, there has been a lot of bias, and they should be finding the truth first and foremost. But instead they become just another special interest.\""

      "text": "The authors of a recent Danish study widely reported on by mainstream media claimed they found no link between the aluminum in vaccines and autism.\nHowever, corrected data added after the study\u2019s original July 15 publication date show the authors got it wrong \u2014 in fact, the data in the study of 1.2 million children clearly indicate a link between aluminum in vaccines and autism, according to scientists with Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) who reviewed the study and the corrected data.\nOn July 17, the Annals of Internal Medicine, which published the Danish study, added a disclaimer stating that it \u201cincluded an incorrect version of the Supplementary Material at the time of initial publication.\u201d\nThe updated materials are available with the link to the study at \u201cCorrection: Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood.\u201d\nCHD Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski broke the news of the buried autism link on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cGood Morning, CHD.\u201d Today, Jablonowski told The Defender:\n\u201cAccording to the corrected data, nearly 10 (9.7) of every 10,000 children who were vaccinated with a higher dose of aluminum (compared to a moderate dose) developed a neurodevelopmental disorder \u2014 mostly autism \u2014 between ages 2 and 5.\u201d\nOn Monday, The Defender reached out to lead author Anders Hviid, a professor and department head of epidemiology at the Statens Serum Institut, for comment on the allegation that the corrected data show a link between increased aluminum exposure and autism. In response, we received an automated email from Hviid stating that he was \u201cout-of-office for the summer,\u201d until Aug. 11.\nThe study\u2019s corresponding author, Niklas Worm Andersson, M.D, Ph.D., an epidemiology researcher at the Statens Serum Institut, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOn July 14 \u2014 a day before the study was published and three days before the journal issued a correction \u2014 Hviid told numerous media outlets that the study showed aluminum in vaccines does not cause autism.\nAs of press time today, the authors of the study had not revised their findings to concur with the corrected materials that contradict the findings they shared with media outlets.\nNBC News, which reported on the uncorrected version of the study on July 14, criticized U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for saying during a 2024 \u201cJoe Rogan Experience\u201d interview that the aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d\nLast month, Kennedy appointed new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) vaccine advisory committee. Last month, during the first meeting of the new members, they voted to remove thimerosal, a preservative that contains mercury, from vaccines. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it formalized the recommendation.\nReuters reported that Kennedy also considered asking the committee to examine vaccines that contain aluminum, but to date, the CDC has not announced any new recommendations related to aluminum.\nDanish researchers \u2018completely obfuscated what they really found\u2019\nAccording to the authors of the Danish study:\n\u201cThis nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines.\u201d\nHowever, after reviewing the corrected data, Brian Hooker, Ph.D., CHD\u2019s chief scientific officer, told The Defender the authors \u201ccompletely obfuscated what they really found \u2014 a statistically significant relationship between aluminum exposure and autism.\u201d\nThe buried link appears on Figure 11 (page 19) of the corrected supplemental materials.\nThe original version showed that children who received a large dose of aluminum were not at greater risk of getting a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including autism, than kids who received a small or moderate dose.\nYet the corrected version showed that kids who received a large dose had a statistically significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with autism or other \u201cpervasive\u201d developmental disorders compared to those who received a moderate dose of aluminum.\nJablonowski said he and Hooker determined that the results were statistically significant \u2014 meaning they couldn\u2019t be attributed to chance \u2014 by looking at the confidence intervals for each statistic.\nA confidence interval \u201cshows the range of values you expect the true estimate to fall between if you redo the study many times.\u201d\nThe corrected figure also showed that children who received a large dose of aluminum had a statistically significantly higher risk of Asperger\u2019s syndrome compared to kids who received a small dose of aluminum. However, kids in the large-dose group weren\u2019t at a higher risk of any other neurodevelopmental issues compared to kids who received a small dose.\nThe low-dose group included roughly only 42,000 children. That could make it difficult to detect a statistical signal, Jablonowski explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that we see a strong signal among the groups that had more participants but not among the group that had fewer participants,\u201d he said.\nThe moderate-dose group consisted of about 700,000 children, while there were about 460,000 children in the large-dose group.\nHow did authors make autism link disappear from original figure?\nThe original version of the study reported 2,961 fewer diagnoses of neurodevelopmental outcomes than the corrected version.\nIt appears the study authors \u201cdeleted the sicker kids,\u201d Jablonowski said. \u201cOr at least, just their diagnoses.\u201d\nThe study also included allergy and autoimmune diagnoses, but none of those statistics were missing. Only the number of neurodevelopmental diagnoses differed between the original results and the corrected ones.\nThat suggests the authors didn\u2019t make a random mistake, but intentionally fudged the number, Jablonowski said.\nIn hope of shedding light on what happened to the missing data, Jablonowski emailed the journal\u2019s editors on July 18, asking them to publicize the comments between themselves and the anonymous scientists who peer-reviewed the study.\nThe inconsistencies in the study are specifically in \u201cthe figures in the main manuscript and the figures in the supplemental material,\u201d Jablonowski wrote to the journal. \u201cI believe the nature of those inconsistencies may be understood by examining the reviewer comments and subsequent exchanges.\u201d\nThe journal editors have not responded.\n\u2018Glaring signs\u2019 Danish authors \u2018didn\u2019t practice good science\u2019\nThe authors have not released the study\u2019s raw data, citing Danish privacy law.\nThis frustrates independent scientists like Jablonowski, who said having access only to the data that the authors statistically adjusted makes it difficult to accurately critique the study, and impossible to replicate it.\nAndersson did not respond when The Defender asked if the authors could share a de-identified version of the data that wouldn\u2019t violate privacy law.\nJablonowski said:\n\u201cSo if the raw data can\u2019t be shared and Andersson is not going to reveal their unadjusted data, the appraisal of this paper is solely based on trust that the authors are practicing good science in good faith and they do not need to be scrutinized.\u201d\nBut there are \u201cglaring signs that the authors didn\u2019t practice good science,\u201d he said.\nThere were other inconsistencies between the original and corrected supplemental material. For instance, the corrected version shows different results in multiple places when tracking the prevalence of Asperger\u2019s syndrome among kids.\nThe authors may have been more inclined to produce results that favored vaccination, given that they work at the Statens Serum Institut, a government agency responsible for procuring and supplying vaccines for the national vaccination.\nHviid reported funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, which is directly linked to the pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.\n\u201cThe researchers are integrally involved in pushing vaccines and sweeping vaccine safety under the rug.\u201d\nOriginal study also riddled with flaws, critics say\nEven before the corrected materials were added to the study, Hooker and Jablonowski noted a host of flaws.\nFor instance, the authors failed to mention there were increased risks of certain diseases for kids vaccinated with aluminum-containing vaccines, compared with kids who received no aluminum-containing vaccines.\nBefore Hviid went on summer break, he told The Defender in an email that his team didn\u2019t include a control group of unvaccinated children who had no aluminum exposure because differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated children likely would have biased the results.\nInstead, the team opted to compare groups of vaccinated children who were exposed to different amounts of aluminum, Hviid said.\nYet the study reported results for 15,237 children who were either unvaccinated or vaccinated only with a shot that contains no aluminum, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The MMR vaccine used in Denmark has no aluminum, according to the authors.\nThat creates a cohort of children unvaccinated with an aluminum-containing shot, Jablonowski said.\nHooker and Jablonowski compared the outcomes of children who didn\u2019t receive an aluminum-containing vaccine with the outcomes of children who received aluminum-containing vaccines.\n\u201cKids who received an aluminum-containing vaccine were 26% more likely to have atopic dermatitis\u201d than kids who were unvaccinated or only got the MMR shot, Jablonowski said. Those kids were \u201c50% more likely to have allergic rhinoconjunctivitis \u2014 and these are really strong, statistically significant signals.\u201d\nJablonowski said the study authors might criticize the analysis he and Hooker conducted for failing to consider possible confounding factors.\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to redo the analysis and account for possible confounding factors, but I\u2019d need the authors to release sufficiently detailed data,\u201d Jablonowski said.\nThis article was funded by critical thinkers like you.\nThe Defender is 100% reader-supported. No corporate sponsors. No paywalls. Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won\u2019t write.\nCalls grow for journal to retract study\nThe findings in the corrected study still maintain the authors\u2019 claim that aluminum-containing vaccinations are not associated with all 50 of the negative health outcomes they analyzed.

      "text": "Injustice for All is a weekly series about how the Trump administration is trying to weaponize the justice system\u2014and the people who are fighting back.\nSuddenly, Donald Trump likes securities regulation, but only as it relates to people who don\u2019t like Trump.\nThe Trump administration has been feverishly weakening government oversight of financial fraud, including dismissing over a dozen cases about crypto scammers brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It\u2019s pretty clear that the general stance is that the administration will just let white-collar criminals go buck wild and rob people blind, because freedom.\nHowever, when it comes to Trump\u2019s pocketbook, Trump thinks the SEC should bring the hammer down.\nThe administration has already taken steps to limit oversight of Trump Media, the corruption machine in which the president of the United States is the largest shareholder. Trump also issued an executive order back in February saying the SEC is subject to his authority and not an independent regulator.\nBut Trump isn\u2019t content just to use the government to protect his private company from scrutiny. He also wants to use the government to go after private companies that are betting against his private company.\nTrump Media\u2019s stock price has been in free fall ever since its SEC filing earlier this month proposed allowing Trump\u2019s trust, which holds his shares, to sell about $2 billion worth of stock. It\u2019s not unusual, when a stock is tanking, for an investor to take a short position, basically betting the stock will continue to fall. A hedge fund disclosed that it has taken a $105 million short position against Trump Media, which the company claims is \u201cmarket manipulation\u201d and therefore illegal. Now, the president\u2019s company is asking the president\u2019s SEC nominee to investigate the hedge fund.\nCall it regulations for me, but not for thee.\nWhat\u2019s Trump running to the Supreme Court for this week?\nTrump\u2019s gotta get his weekly treats from the conservative wing of the Supreme Court or he gets withdrawal symptoms. This week, he\u2019s begging them just to let him dismantle the 14th Amendment\u2019s birthright citizenship protections, just a little bit, c\u2019mon.\nRelated | Trump vows to end birthright citizenship, Constitution be damned\nMultiple lower courts issued nationwide injunctions blocking Trump\u2019s unconstitutional executive order. Republicans have recently decided that those types of injunctions are unfair because they really should only be used to thwart Democratic presidents.\nTrump wants the Supreme Court to stay those nationwide injunctions. Instead, he proposes the injunctions should apply only to the individual plaintiffs and members of organizations that brought the lawsuits, as well as anyone who lives in a state that challenged the order. Everywhere else, proposes Trump, the Supreme Court should let him start stripping people of birthright citizenship protections while the litigation over his order continues.\nImagine a country where citizenship rights differ from state to state. Worse, imagine a country where some members of an organization live in a state that sued to protect birthright citizenship, but some do not.\nTrump is asking the entire country to live in an unworkable mess because he just cannot wait one minute longer to gut the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on May 15, and you can expect it to be a hot mess.\nWhat\u2019s happening with Kilmar Abrego Garcia now?\nHonestly, on any given day, it\u2019s tough to keep up. Right now, the apparent stance of the presidents of both the United States and El Salvador is that they are both powerless little creatures who cannot get Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2014the man the government has admitted it mistakenly deported\u2014back home. Trump is also pretending he has no involvement in the case, so he can\u2019t possibly answer questions about it.\nRelated | Bukele and Trump pretend they can\u2019t return wrongfully deported man\nNearly two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. The government fought that all the way up to the Supreme Court but lost.\nNow the case is back at the lower court, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t want to follow Xinis\u2019s order to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return, and it definitely does not want to follow her order granting Abrego Garcia\u2019s motion for expedited discovery.\nFollowing a now well-worn path, the government filed an emergency appeal, asking the Fourth Circuit to stay both orders, which would mean that it is not required to bring Abrego Garcia home and is not even required to answer questions about it.\nIt did not go well. In fact, the appellate court denied the request within a day.\nThe order, written by Reagan appointee Judge Harvey Wilkinson, who is not exactly a liberal scold, shows just how incredulous the court was about the government\u2019s argument that it could deport residents to foreign prisons with no due process. Wilkinson said that position \u201cshould be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\u201d\nThe ruling was so scathing that Rachel Maddow read highlights from it for five minutes straight on her show Thursday night.\nOutside the courtroom, the Trump administration is spinning lie after lie about Abrego Garcia, framing him into some sort of murderous gang kingpin, and vowing they\u2019ll never bring him home. It\u2019s unending and unbelievable.\nAt long last, contempt. Sort of. Maybe. Soon.\nThe Trump administration has made it exceedingly clear that it believes it doesn\u2019t have to follow lower court orders. It\u2019s well past the time for lower court judges to start treating this position with the contempt it deserves \u2026 literally. Finally, at least one judge is doing so.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that there is probable cause to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt because of their \u201cwillful disregard\u201d of his order to turn around planes ferrying hundreds of deportees to El Salvador. Boasberg\u2019s probable cause order details the opportunities he gave the administration to satisfactorily explain its actions and its utter failure to do so.\nThe government rarely faces civil or criminal contempt proceedings, but judges really have no choice but to start using the tools they would use against any other litigant. No other party can openly defy court orders, brag about it, and refuse to explain it in court.\nThe probable cause finding doesn\u2019t mean that Boasberg can try to toss Attorney General Pam Bondi, or whoever, in jail ASAP.\nFirst, the Trump administration gets a chance to \u201cpurge\u201d the contempt by complying with the judge\u2019s original order. Of course, there\u2019s no way to turn those planes back around now, but Boasberg suggested the administration could bring the deportees back to America and allow them to file habeas petitions challenging their detention. If the government doesn\u2019t do that, then Boasberg will require Trump officials to testify under oath about the decision not to turn the planes around.\nSurprising no one, the administration has already appealed to the Fourth Circuit, hyperventilating about how it\u2019s unconstitutional to order the executive branch to do anything, basically. However, there\u2019s nothing to appeal yet. Boasberg hasn\u2019t found anyone in contempt or referred anyone for prosecution.\nBut for this administration, the mere notion that laws might apply to them is too much to bear.\nWho is Ed Martin threatening this week?\nIt\u2019s always worth checking in on Interim D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin. He displays no interest in his actual job, but has proven very eager to use his position to dispense favors to Republicans and launch spurious investigations into others, regardless of whether he has jurisdiction.\nThis week\u2019s wild overreach came in the form of a pugnacious letter to CHEST, an Illinois-based medical journal covering chest diseases. You might wonder what authority a criminal prosecutor in D.C. has over a scientific publication 1,000 miles away.\nHowever, you\u2019ll still be wondering after you read Martin\u2019s letter: \u201cIt has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications like CHEST Joumal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates - that is, that they have a position for which they are advocating either due to advertisement (under postal code) or sponsorship (under relevant fraud regulations).\u201d\nThis sentence could only be written by someone confident they\u2019re the smartest guy in the room when actually they\u2019d lose a fight with a laundry hamper if it had a lid. It seems like Martin is saying that advertisers or sponsors are secretly paying off CHEST to adopt scientific positions and they could be prosecuted for it.\nIt bears mentioning, as always, that Martin has no jurisdiction outside the confines of D.C. and the only response to this letter should be to tell him that.\nWhat do they teach at Yale Law anyway?\nThough he now cosplays as a real salt-of-the-earth type, JD Vance went to Yale Law School, currently ranked No. 1 in the nation and an elite institution by any measure. That\u2019s why it\u2019s especially worrisome that the vice president seems to have no idea what due process is.\nIn a lengthy post on X, Vance whined about how the Trump administration can\u2019t possibly provide due process because Joe Biden let in too many undocumented people when he was president.\nThat statement, on its own, is bad enough, as it\u2019s an assertion that millions of people can be deported without any meaningful way to challenge their removal. But what\u2019s worse is Vance\u2019s very odd understanding of what due process means.\n\u201cTo say the administration must observe \u2018due process\u2019 is to beg the question: what process is due is a function of our resources, the public interest, the status of the accused, the proposed punishment, and so many other factors,\u201d Vance tweeted.\nWhat?\nWhether someone is owed due process is in no way related to whether the government has enough resources. It\u2019s also not related to the public interest, etc. There\u2019s no means test or balancing of equities or whatever it is Vance is nattering on about here. It\u2019s literally a thing guaranteed by both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Seriously, did he skip Con Law and just spend all that time writing his terrible book?\nCampaign Action"

      "text": "For a guy who insists he is totally not a conspiracy-minded anti-vaxxer, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. somehow can\u2019t stop himself from doing conspiracy-minded anti-vaxxer stuff. This time around, it\u2019s his surprise announcement that the United States will be pulling funds from Gavi, an organization that provides vaccines to children in lower-income countries. Wouldn\u2019t want to save poor children from easily preventable diseases now, would we?\nKennedy kept it real classy and announced this major policy change via a prerecorded video to be played for health officials attending Gavi\u2019s pledging summit, where the organization is seeking to raise $9 billion from countries and organizations to fund its efforts to reach 500 million children between 2026 and 2030. Definitely a cool and great time to pop off and say that America is not going to honor the $1.58 billion the Biden administration pledged for Gavi.\nWhy is Kennedy pulling money from an organization that has helped vaccinate over 1.1 billion children in 78 low-income countries, preventing over 18 million future deaths? Because Gavi has \u201cignored the science,\u201d of course. What science? Kennedy never really says. But here\u2019s his very scientific and astute statement about what Gavi has to do.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how to start taking vaccine safety seriously: Consider the best science available, even when the science contradicts established paradigms,\u201d he blabbered.\nThis is nothing but code for a demand that organizations entertain Kennedy\u2019s beliefs that somehow the \u201creal science\u201d about vaccines has been suppressed, particularly his belief that childhood vaccines cause autism. He has insisted that he would approve of a vaccine \u201cif the data is there\u201d and \u201cif you show me the data.\u201d\nRelated | RFK Jr. ousts entire CDC vaccine advisory committee\nThe data has long been available, and it shows that vaccines are rigorously tested and safe to administer. But Kennedy refuses to believe that, so he has to jeopardize efforts to protect children from dying due to easily preventable diseases.\nWhen Kennedy isn\u2019t busy pulling funding from international vaccine efforts, he\u2019s busy overseeing a flood of misinformation domestically. He fired every member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, replacing actual scientists with a raft of anti-vaxxers. On Tuesday, a report called \u201cThimerosal as a Vaccine Preservative\u201d appeared on the CDC website in advance of a Thursday presentation to ACIP by Lyn Redwood. Redwood is a former colleague of Kennedy\u2019s at Children\u2019s Health Defense, a rabidly anti-vax group. Thimerosal, a preservative, is a fixation for anti-vaxxers despite having been removed from all childhood vaccines since 2001, and evidence shows there is no harm from the low doses of thimerosal used in vaccines.\nRedwood\u2019s presentation cites a study titled \u201cLow-level neonatal thimerosal exposure: Long-term consequences in the brain\u201d by Robert Berman, published in 2008 in the journal Neurotoxicology. Except that Robert Berman himself says that it is not a study he published. He did co-author a piece with a similar name that appeared in a different journal, but that one doesn\u2019t support Redwood\u2019s conclusions either, with Berman saying, \u201cI do not endorse this misrepresentation of the research.\u201d\nPerhaps Redwood felt fine about making up studies because she saw the report Kennedy sent to Congress to justify his changes to COVID vaccine recommendations. Kennedy spent the pandemic writing anti-vax books and being a top spreader of misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. The problem for Kennedy is that the science doesn\u2019t support him, so the report cited a study under investigation for potential issues with methodology and conflicts of interest, as well as another that has never been peer-reviewed. The report also made claims that were directly refuted by the papers cited.\nKennedy has been an out and proud anti-vaxxer for years. His brain is filled with nothing but conspiracy theories and whale juice. So it\u2019s not surprising that he would thwart efforts to vaccinate children worldwide\u2014but it\u2019s still awful to see yet another way in which the United States is retreating from the global stage.\nRelated | Kennedy's HHS sent Congress 'junk science' to defend vaccine changes, experts say\nCampaign Action"
