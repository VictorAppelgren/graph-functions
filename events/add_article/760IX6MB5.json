      "summary": "Mike Vrabel expressed optimism after the New England Patriots' first joint practice in Minnesota, despite the offense struggling against the Vikings' defense. Quarterback Drake Maye showed composure, but the second practice revealed significant issues, particularly with the defense allowing quarterback J.J. McCarthy to excel. The Patriots' revamped defense, which was expected to be a strength, faltered, raising concerns about their consistency as the season approaches. Overall, while there are signs of potential, the team may face challenges early in the season as they work to improve their offensive line and overall cohesion.",
