  "title": "Mothers in Gaza stretch meager ingredients where they can, but say hunger persists",
  "description": "Before the war, Gaza\u2019s kitchens bustled with elaborate meals that touched on Palestinian traditions and culture",
  "content": "Sally Muzhed, 38, displaced from Deir al-Balah, holds a plate with eggplant, her only food for the day, amid severe food shortages in the Gaza Strip, in Deir al-Balah, Monday.\n\nA single bowl of eggplant stewed in watery tomato juice must sustain Sally Muzhed\u2019s family of six for the day. She calls it moussaka, but it\u2019s a pale echo of the fragrant, layered meat-and-vegetable dish that once filled Gaza\u2019s kitchens with its aroma.\n\nThe war has severed families from the means to farm or fish, and the little food that enters the besieged strip is often looted, hoarded and resold at exorbitant prices. So mothers like Muzhed have been forced into constant improvisation, reimagining Palestinian staples with the meager ingredients they can grab off trucks, from airdropped parcels or purchase at the market.\n\nIsrael implemented a total blockade on trucks entering the Gaza Strip in early March and began allowing aid back in May, although humanitarian organizations say the amount remains far from adequate.\n\nSome cooks have gotten inventive, but most say they\u2019re just desperate to break the dull repetition of the same few ingredients, if they can get them at all. Some families say they survive on stale, brittle pita, cans of beans eaten cold for lack of cooking gas, or whatever they can get on the days that they arrive early enough that meals remain available at charity kitchens.\n\n\u201cThe children remain hungry. Tomorrow we won\u2019t have any food to eat,\u201d Muzhed said from the tent where her family has been displaced in central Gaza\u2019s Deir al-Balah.\n\nOnce, her bowl would barely have fed one child. Now she ladles it out in spoonfuls, trying to stretch it. Her son asks why he can\u2019t have more.\n\nThe Muzhed family\u2019s struggle is being repeated across Gaza as the territory plunges deeper into what international experts have called \u201cthe worst-case scenario of famine.\u201d\n\nOn some days, mothers like Amani al-Nabahin manage to get mujaddara from charity kitchens. The dish, once flavored with caramelized onions and spices, is now stripped to its bare essentials of rice and lentils.\n\n\u201cNearly nine out of ten households resorted to extremely severe coping mechanisms to feed themselves, such as taking significant safety risks to obtain food, and scavenging from the garbage,\u201d the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said on July 29.\n\nGas for cooking is scarce, vegetables are costly and meat has all but vanished from the markets.\n\nFamilies in Gaza once dipped pieces of bread into dukkah, a condiment made of ground wheat and spices. But today, 78-year-old Alia Hanani is rationing bread by the bite, served once a day at noon, allowing each person to dip it in a wartime dukkah made of flour, lentils and bulgur.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no dinner or breakfast,\u201d the mother of eight said.\n\nSome people don\u2019t even have enough to improvise. All Rehab al-Kharoubi has for her and her seven children is a bowl of raw white beans.\n\n\u201cI had to beg for it,\u201d she said.\n\nFor some, it\u2019s even less. Kifah Qadih, displaced from Khuza\u2019a east of Khan Younis, couldn\u2019t get any food \u2014 the bowl in front of her has remained empty all day.\n\n\u201cToday there is no food. There is nothing.\u201d\n\nShurafa and Metz write for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "- Share via\n- Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson made their dream apartment even better with inexpensive DIY updates, thrifted goods and ample art.\n- Steps outside the Spanish fourplex, the couple has found community in the dog-friendly neighborhood. \u201cEveryone knows our dogs\u2019 names,\u201d says Babcock.\n- Babcock and Gibson decorated with treasures they found on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.\nWhen Natalie Babcock and Samuel Gibson found a listing for a sunny apartment in Beachwood Canyon five years ago, they immediately fell for the two bedroom\u2019s charming built-in bookshelves, faux fireplace, hardwood floors and formal dining room. Practical amenities such as an in-unit laundry and a garage, which are often elusive in Los Angeles rentals, didn\u2019t hurt.\nIn this series, we spotlight L.A. rentals with style. From perfect gallery walls to temporary decor hacks, these renters get creative, even in small spaces. And Angelenos need the inspiration: Most are renters.\nToday, however, the couple says they are most impressed by the sense of belonging they have found in the community just outside their 1928 Spanish fourplex. Here, where tourists and brides in wedding gowns often pose for photographs in the middle of the street in an effort to capture the Hollywood sign in the background, Babcock and Gibson have become part of a larger family. \u201cEveryone knows our dogs\u2019 names,\u201d says Babcock, a 35-year-old educator working in the adolescent mental health field. \u201cThere is a true community vibe in this neighborhood.\u201d\nAdds Gibson, a 38-year-old screenwriter and Spanish professor and tutor from London: \u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a place that felt like a neighborhood. We\u2019re in a message group with our neighbors. Sometimes our dog walks take forever because we stop every few minutes to say hello to someone.\u201d\nThe couple was living in a charming apartment in Los Feliz when Gibson had to return to England to care for his mother, who had pancreatic cancer. Compounding their distress, Babcock\u2019s father suffered a stroke, and Babcock moved in with her parents to help her sister, Eve, care for their father.\n\u201cIt was the worst year of our lives,\u201d Babcock recalls of that period. \u201cSam\u2019s mother died, and my father had a catastrophic stroke.\u201d\nTheir Los Feliz apartment was filled with bad memories, and they were excited by the prospect of creating happier memories in a new apartment.\nAfter scouring countless rentals online, the couple found a listing for the Hollywood apartment on Zillow, only to encounter what they now describe as \u201ca feeding frenzy\u201d when they arrived at the open house. The apartment, they say, was priced too low at $2,995 compared with similar units, and they were faced with fierce competition.\nSo they decided to do what many people do when trying to persuade sellers to choose them to buy their house. They wrote a letter about themselves, included photos and sent it to their potential new landlord.\n\u201cEve and I were in a panic because the apartment was so beautiful and we really wanted to live there,\u201d says Babcock. \u201cThe three of us were an unconventional group, though, and we hoped they might choose us.\u201d\nWhen they moved into the apartment in February 2020, they were thrilled, not realizing they would end up isolating there together during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThe apartment was a welcome reset,\u201d Babcock says, \u201cIt gave us plenty of time to nest and decorate.\u201d\nA year later, Eve moved out, and Gibson converted her bedroom into an art-filled office that now doubles as a guest room when family and friends visit. The key to a comfortable \u2014 and flexible \u2014 guest bed, they say, is a durable mattress topper from IKEA, which they store in the garage and carry into the apartment when they have overnight guests. \u201cBlow-up mattresses always deflate,\u201d Babcock says of their choice. \u201cThis is a better option.\u201d\nThe couple\u2019s taste is vibrant, and the colorful interiors reflect their sense of fun and love of design. They painted one wall in Samuel\u2019s office a dramatic Kelly green, which makes the white-trimmed windows and his extensive art collection pop. Behind their bed in their bedroom, they painted an accent wall a charcoal hue, which gives the bedroom a peaceful feel.\nDecorative tiles and sunshine illuminate the kitchen.\n\u201cPaint is your friend,\u201d Babcock says. \u201cBe bold in your color choices, and when it comes to DIY and landlords, ask for forgiveness, not permission.\u201d\nA glance around the apartment confirms not just their love of art but also the personal stories behind each piece: framed prints in the kitchen, black-and-white photographs in the dining room, large-scale oil paintings in the living room and hallway, and mixed-media pieces in the office, including works from local artists, EBay, Gibson\u2019s sister and even one found on the street.\nSkylights, vaulted ceilings and splashes of color make this ADU rental feel much larger than its 850 square feet.\nMixed in with the artwork is an abundance of lush houseplants, including Monstera deliciosa, a rubber tree and a ponytail palm, that is thriving thanks to the surplus of bright, indirect light that filters in through the large picture windows overlooking bustling Beachwood Drive.\n\u201cArt is one thing that I am always happy to spend money on,\u201d Gibson says.\nIn the bedroom, a charcoal-colored accent wall, vintage furnishings and art help to create an inviting retreat.\nLast year, Gibson painted the kitchen walls blue and installed peel-and-stick floor tiles from WallPops over the dated yellow linoleum flooring, providing an inexpensive, albeit temporary, update. (One package of a dozen 6.2 x 6.2-inch sheets costs $17.99.)\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the hardest project,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cbut you do have to measure each tile to the centimeter because the apartment has moved slightly over the years, presumably from earthquakes.\u201d\nBuilding a stunning ADU out of a two-car garage takes ingenuity, time and money. But for these architect-owners, there were also big gains to be had.\nThroughout the 1,200-square-foot apartment, the couple has decorated with vintage Midcentury furniture and thrifted furnishings and accessories sourced from Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something nice about scraping together designs,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle where you have to patch different styles together.\u201d\nIn the living room, the couple has furnished the space with an L-shaped Bensen sofa, which they purchased at a warehouse sale mentioned on Craigslist, comfortable yellow swivel chairs they picked up from the back of someone\u2019s car in downtown L.A. and a pair of leather loungers they found on Facebook Marketplace.\nTo accommodate their love of hosting formal dinner parties, they purchased a table that seats eight, which they found on Craigslist. \u201cWe found it in a grungy flat in Hollywood,\u201d Gibson says.\nLooking for an Eames lounge chair or a Danish modern credenza? Here\u2019s a list of the 18 best places to shop for Midcentury Modern furniture in L.A.\nAdmitting her husband \u201chas become the primary household chef,\u201d Babcock takes the lead when it comes to dinner parties and \u201cgoes all out.\u201d\n\u201cI grew up around the dining-room table,\u201d says Babcock, a Los Angeles native who was raised in West Los Angeles.\nIn the corner of their dining room, across from a thrifted wooden bar cart, they installed a stone cigar table inspired by their trip to Casa Luis Barrag\u00e1n in Mexico City. They purchased it from a designer who was living in a loft in downtown Los Angeles.\nUltimately, some of their rental\u2019s decor, such as having washable sofa covers, is influenced by their dogs Chili, whom they rescued as a puppy in 2020, and Peaches, their \u201cfoster fail,\u201d whom they adopted in 2023 after a neighbor pulled her from a shelter the day she was scheduled to be euthanized.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made great friends here,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cFrom our apartment, we can walk the dogs in every direction. We can walk to the Hollywood Reservoir in the Hollywood Hills, to the caves in Bronson Canyon, to the Sunset Ranch stables at the top of Beachwood Drive, or to Griffith Park, which is a two-hour loop.\u201d\nDo they ever dream of owning a home like other couples their age? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cBut I think we would truly never leave this apartment unless we could buy a house with a yard. It\u2019s like London, in that, having a yard is a luxury.\u201d\nBabcock agrees, admitting that small things such as an outdoor space for the dogs or a second bathroom would be nice.\nBut it would be a shame \u201cto buy a house that\u2019s not as nice as this,\u201d Gibson says.\nIn the meantime, they are happy in their Hollywood Hills home, which reflects their love of art and their deep affection for their sweet-natured four-legged friends and their neighborhood.\n\u201cWe joke that we will die here,\u201d Babcock adds, laughing."

      "text": "My boyfriend told me that he didn\u2019t want to get married again. Dealbreaker?\n- Share via\nWhat a jerk, I thought, after Clark yelled at me again to pull faster on the sailboat\u2019s lines to keep pace with the changes of the wind as we headed to open water from Marina del Rey. \u201cI\u2019m never going on another date with this guy again!\u201d\nBut what do I know about sailing? Although I grew up in the Great Lakes region, I\u2019d never sailed before and didn\u2019t realize there are no passengers on a sailboat \u2014 only crew. I\u2019d just moved to Los Angeles from Detroit after leaving a first-job stint in Switzerland. Both places were too cold for me, so no wonder L.A. was irresistible. Every January the nationally televised Rose Parade proved that even winters would reliably be 72 degrees and sunny.\nL.A. was the place where this Motown gal believed her dreams of new beginnings with happy endings could come true. I met Clark on Venice Beach. And, no, he wasn\u2019t a weightlifter, chainsaw juggler or a magician like the other familiar fixtures on the Venice boardwalk. When he emerged from the ocean surf with his boogie board under his arm and aimed his 1000-watt smile at me watching him from my towel on the sand, I mused, \u201cOh, yeah, these West Coast boys are alright.\u201d\nAfter life in New York, I returned to Los Angeles\u2019 dating scene as a solo poly queer. I found connection and intimacy with my date and her wife.\nOur first date after that meet-cute was an afternoon of sailing the next week. Before the rendezvous with Clark at the boathouse, I\u2019d treated myself to a manicure. Big mistake! I soon learned that it\u2019s impossible to tug on the \u201cropes\u201d of sails with just the tips of my fingers to vainly try to protect my fresh mani. Clark didn\u2019t appreciate the nails; he shouted maneuvering commands that clearly conveyed his priorities were solely pragmatic. After the debacle of our initial outing, Clark reactivated his charm, so I gave him another chance, and we dated again and again. A picnic and concert under the Hollywood Bowl stars. The Pantages Theatre for a Broadway show. Lobster dinner in Puerto Nuevo \u2014 a long drive to Mexico, but worth it.\nClark continued to captivate me with his wry observations about the world, his inclination to be a jokester and even the goofy gifts intended to show he was a romantic at heart. I\u2019m sorry to say that the six-pack Valentine\u2019s gift of engine oil for my hemorrhaging VW didn\u2019t quite make the cut. However, roses on my birthday, coinciding with the anniversary of our infamous sailing date and our exchanges of \u201cI love you,\u201d did endear him to me. Two years into our monogamous dating, I wondered where we were headed. I\u2019d never been in a steady relationship that lasted more than six months \u2014 until now.\nHe\u2019d been married before, for less than two years. And yet I was afraid to bring up the topic of marriage in case the answer precipitated one more casualty in my portfolio of failed romances.\nUntil one Sunday night.\nAfter spending another consecutive weekend with Clark at his place, I was dreading my usual return drive home over the Sepulveda Pass and into the Valley. Somehow the burning need to just know what his intentions might be gave me the courage to pop the question: \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever get married again?\u201d\nHis reply crushed me. \u201cYou know I was married once, but that didn\u2019t work out. It hurt to uncouple our lives from our dreams.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd now you are my special love. I couldn\u2019t be happier with our relationship, and everything is wonderful just as it is. But ... no, I don\u2019t want to marry again.\u201d\nThe guy I was seeing would vanish for weeks and then shower me with gifts. Should I stay with him for the Tiffany & Co. and Cartier jewelry? Or cut my losses and move on?\nI felt dizzy from the visceral ringing in my ears as all I heard over and over was \u201cno.\u201d I don\u2019t remember exactly what either of us said after that, but I was clear about what I wanted: I wanted to be married to him, my best friend. Not now, but someday I wanted to introduce him as more than the man I dated. I couldn\u2019t detach my dreams from the day-to-day connections we had already built. And if I\u2019d never be his wife, then it wasn\u2019t enough.\nIt was over for me.\nI drove mindlessly toward home. I replayed the breakup again and again as West Los Angeles retreated farther and farther away. Somehow I made it safely to the little bungalow I shared with Heather, my rescue cat. I hugged her close, thinking now she would see more of me on the weekends because Clark had been too allergic to cats to stay at my place. Reality hit, hard: He would no longer be part of my life.\nDetermined to put the weekend behind me, the next morning I prepared for another busy Monday of seeing patients. I walked briskly into the office, but the cheerful dentist I worked for took one look at my face with my eyes puffy from crying and asked, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\nSniffling, I shared how and why I had broken up with Clark. My boss shrugged and quoted an old saying: \u201cNo need to buy the cow when the milk is free.\u201d Gee, thanks for that.\nI was struck by my date\u2019s physique and dreamy blue eyes. He checked all the boxes. So why was I still suspicious?\nAs I was leaving for lunch at home, Dr. Happy Sayings bolted from his office and called out, \u201cYou can\u2019t go! Clark is coming over.\u201d\nBefore I could react, Clark was there, beckoning me outside. As he took me in his arms, my tears started anew. He begged me to stop crying and explained that he had never thought about marrying again until I surprised him by asking if he ever would.\nClark admitted that if being married was what it would take to spend the rest of his life with me, then yes \u2014 someday, yes, we would marry. That promise was enough for me, as another year passed without a wedding. When I was accepted into graduate school at UCLA, I retired as a dental hygienist and moved in with Clark. Heather moved in with an allergy-free Englishman in San Pedro, where she lived happily ever after. My happily ever after started soon enough.\nMy first year as an MBA student was a gold mine of entertainment as I regaled Clark with tales of the hookups between classmates. Later I joked that he couldn\u2019t slip an engagement ring onto my finger fast enough. I also teased him that he had waited until he was certain I landed a good job post-graduation before setting the wedding date. We decided to forgo traditional nuptials in favor of a civil ceremony, splurging instead on an extended celebratory trip in Europe.\nI went to my favorite Hollywood bar to have a cocktail and read my Eve Babitz book. Then I looked across the bar and saw him.\nThat summer my memories of the frosty winter when I\u2019d worked in Switzerland faded with Clark by my side. Everywhere felt warm with bonhomie as the locals wished us an Ausgezeichnete Hochzeitsreise, or Excellent Honeymoon.\nFrom an outdoor terrace in a lakeside Alpine village, we watched catamarans and windsurfers lean into the wind and fly across the water below. Clark held me close and asked if I\u2019d like to go sailing. I just grinned and answered, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. ... Everything is wonderful, just as it is.\u201d\nThe author, who lives in Culver City, is still married to the erstwhile sailor, but she now sculls at UCLA\u2019s Marina Aquatics Center.
