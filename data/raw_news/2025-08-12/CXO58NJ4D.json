  "content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 A federal grand jury has indicted one of Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang leaders and a U.S. citizen accused of conspiring with him to violate U.S. sanctions and fund gang activities in the troubled Caribbean country, the U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday.\n\nJimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, best known as \u201cBarbecue,\u201d is a leader of a gang federation called Viv Ansanm that the U.S. designated as a foreign terrorist organization in May.\n\nCh\u00e9rizier lives in Haiti, and the U.S. is offering up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction.\n\nChris Landberg, a senior U.S. State Department official, said Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s \u201creign of terror and mass violence against Haiti must end.\u201d\n\nBut Jake Johnston, author of \u201cAid State\u201d and international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, questioned the government's reason for offering a bounty.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who is giving international media interviews regularly. I don\u2019t think the issue is being able to find him,\" Johnston said, adding that the indictment doesn't represent a threat to Ch\u00e9rizier since he lives in Haiti. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how it\u2019ll have much of an effect.\"\n\nCh\u00e9rizier is a former elite police officer who was fired in December 2018 and was later accused of organizing large-scale massacres in the slums of Grand Ravine in 2017, in La Saline in 2018 and in Bel-Air in 2019. More than 100 people were killed in the massacres, which Ch\u00e9rizier has denied organizing.\n\n\u201cHaiti is a hotspot right now \u2026 there is incredible violence going on there,\u201d U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Tuesday, calling La Saline killings \u201cnotorious because (Ch\u00e9rizier) both planned and participated\u201d in the slaughter.\n\nIn June 2020, Ch\u00e9rizier created the \u201c G9 Family and Allies,\u201d an alliance that grew from nine gangs in lower Delmas and the Cite Soleil and La Saline slums to include more than a dozen gangs, according to a U.N. Security Council report.\n\nThe alliance was blamed for the killings of some 145 people in Cite Soleil and the rape of multiple women.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department issued civil sanctions against Ch\u00e9rizier and others accused of being involved in the massacres.\n\nThe G-9 alliance later became part of the Viv Ansanm gang federation created in September 2023 that saw the merging of Haiti\u2019s two biggest gangs that were once bitter enemies: G-9 and G- P\u00e8p.\n\nSince then, the federation has taken control of 90% of Port-au-Prince. It launched multiple attacks on key government infrastructure in February 2024 and raided Haiti\u2019s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. It also forced Haiti\u2019s main international airport to close for nearly three months.\n\nThe surge in violence led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was locked out of his country while on an official visit to Kenya.\n\nThe gang federation continues to attack once peaceful communities in Port-au-Prince, and it is accused of helping gangs in Haiti\u2019s central region.\n\nAlso indicted is Bazile Richardson, whom officials say is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Haiti who grew up with Ch\u00e9rizier and lives in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n\nBoth are accused of leading a \u201cwide-ranging conspiracy\u201d by directly soliciting money transfers from members of the Haitian diaspora to raise funds for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s gang activities in Haiti, according to the indictment. It stated that the money was used to pay the salaries of gang members and buy weapons from illegal dealers in Haiti. Most of the firearms are smuggled in from the U.S. since Haiti does not produce weapons.\n\nAccording to the indictment, there are two other unnamed co-conspirators from Haiti who live in New York and Massachusetts, and five others who live in Haiti.\n\nCh\u00e9rizier could not be immediately reached for comment. It was not immediately clear if Richardson had an attorney.\n\nThe indictment noted that Ch\u00e9rizier and Richardson have acknowledged the sanctions against Ch\u00e9rizier, adding that the alleged conspiracy began around December 2020 and continued through January of this year.\n\nOne voice memo that an unidentified co-conspirator in Haiti allegedly sent to Richardson stated: \u201cIf I have backup, we will take the power, and you will be able to come back to your country. You will need to serve in the new government.\u201d\n\nRichardson forwarded the alleged memo to Ch\u00e9rizier in June 2022, nearly a year after former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was killed at his private residence.\n\nAnother person identified only as a Haitian co-conspirator allegedly sent a voice memo to Richardson saying, \u201cwe want to start a revolution in Haiti and are trying to collect funds.\u201d Part of the plan was to have 1,000 individuals give $20 each or 1 million Haitians abroad give $1 each, as well as collect money from 1,000 people for each of Haiti\u2019s 10 regions, according to the indictment.\n\n\u201cWith this money, they can buy pick-up trucks, weapons, ammunition, clothing to include T-shirts, boots and hats. We want to change everything in Haiti,\u201d according to one alleged voice memo.\n\nIn June 2021, Ch\u00e9rizier held a press conference announcing the start of a revolution.\n\nThe indictment comes as gang violence continues to surge in Haiti\u2019s capital and beyond, with gunmen kidnapping an Irish missionary and seven other people, including a 3-year-old, from an orphanage earlier this month.\n\nThe office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the indictment.\n\nJohnston said the broader strategy in the fight against gangs remains unclear.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s sort of an escalatory framework happening both in Haiti and the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere does that actually go?\u201d\n\nDarren Cox, acting assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division, said the bureau\u2019s Miami office is leading the effort to apprehend Ch\u00e9rizier.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is focused more than ever on crushing violent crime,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThere is no safe haven for them, or the people like them.\u201d",
