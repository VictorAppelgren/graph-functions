      "title": "Obama Applauds Newsom's California Redistricting Plan As 'Responsible' As Texas GOP Pushes New Maps",
      "summary": "Former President Barack Obama publicly backed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to temporarily redraw congressional maps in response to Texas Republicans, who are urged by President Trump to add five GOP‑friendly seats. Obama said the plan would be enacted only if Republican states followed suit and highlighted the Democratic National Redistricting Committee’s $2 million fundraiser that supports litigation against partisan maps. The California blueprint could shift the state’s delegation from 43 to 48 seats, while Democrats prepare legal challenges to similar GOP‑drawn maps in other states. The move reflects a broader national battle over mid‑decade redistricting that could shape control of the U.S. House in 2026.",
