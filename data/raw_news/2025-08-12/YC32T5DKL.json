  "description": "\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business. On today's show, Former US Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, shares his thoughts on President Trump\u2019s shift in strategy as the President tries to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to put an end to the Ukraine Russia War. Democratic State Representative Chris Turner discusses Texas democratic state legislators leaving the state to delay the Texas GOP's redistricting map plans. Seth Harris, Former US Acting Labor Secretary under the Obama Administration, voices his thoughts on President Trump firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, stating there was zero chance the jobs numbers could have been rigged.

  "content": "> > THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. > > FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON, DC STUDIOS TO OUR TV AND RADIO AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE, WELCOME TO \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" ALONGSIDE KAILEY LEINZ, I'M JOE MATHIEU. KAILEY: TONIGHT A SHAKEUP AT THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND RESIGNATION FROM THE FED. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING HE WILL ANNOUNCE A NEW FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR AND A NEW DATA STATISTICIAN IN THE COMING DAYS. THE LIST OF LIKELY PICKS FOR THAT SOON TO BE VACANT FED GOVERNOR'S ROLE IN HOW THE SENATE COULD COMPLICATE MATTERS FOR HIM. KAILEY: PLUS DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATORS FLEE THE STATE TO BLOCK REDISTRICTING EFFORTS AND NOW FACE THE THREAT OF ARREST. > > WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE MAKING GREAT SACRIFICES TO RESIST THE POWER GRAB THAT'S BEING PERPETRATED BY DONALD TRUMP BY GOVERNOR ABBOTT AND BY TEXAS REPUBLICANS. > > REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO REWRITE THESE RULES TO GET THEMSELVES AN ADVANTAGE, THEN THEY ARE LEAVING US NO CHOICE. WE MUST DO THE SAME. KAILEY: THE DEVELOPING USE HAS BECOME ON THE AIR WERE TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. JOE: AND AFTER PRESENT FROM THREATENED ACTION AGAINST VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE'S ANNOUNCED HIGHER TARIFFS ON INDIA AND THE CLOCK TICKS DOWN TO THE PRESIDENT'S FRIDAY DEADLINE. WHAT WE CAN EXPECT WHEN PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY STEVE WITKOFF HEADS TO MOSCOW THIS WEEK. THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN THIS EVENING WITH THE PRESIDENT THREATENING HIGH TARIFFS ON INDIA. POSTING, INDIA'S NOT ONLY BUYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, THEY ARE THEN FOR MUCH OF THE OIL PURCHASED SELLING IT ON THE OPEN MARKET FOR BIG PROFITS. THEY DON'T CARE HOW MANY PEOPLE IN UKRAINE ARE BEING KILLED. KAILEY: THAT ANNOUNCEMENT COMING INTO THE FRIDAY DEADLINE HE'S GIVEN TO THE KREMLIN WITH NO SIGNS OF CONCESSIONS FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. JOINING US FOR MORE IS JENNIFER WELCH OF BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS, WHO COVERS GEOECONOMICS SPECIFICALLY FOR US. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE NOT ONLY RUSSIA'S BEHAVIOR BUT INDIA'S BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIAN ENERGY. MY QUESTION IS, WILL IT ELICIT THE RESPONSE THE PRESIDENT WANTS? > > IT COULD ALSO BE A THIRD OPTION WHICH IS JUST CREATING LEVERAGE IN TRADE TALKS, WHAT WE SEE FROM NEW DELHI'S INITIAL RESPONSE IS IT IS NOT WORKING IN TERMS OF GETTING INDIA TO BACK OFF. INDIA HAS INDICATED IT WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD STRONG AND FOCUS ON BY INDIA AS A RESPONSE TO DE-RISKING THE UNITED STATES. STILL, WE DO THINK INDIA IS INTERESTED IN A TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN THEY PUT TOGETHER A DEAL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP APPROVES OF? JOE: HOW SERIOUSLY SHOULD WE TAKE THIS POST WHEN THERE IS NOT EVEN A NUMBER IN THEIR? WERE NOT SURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DONALD TRUMP COULD BE RIPPING. > > THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE ARE SECONDARY SANCTIONS ARE TARIFFS AROUND RUSSIAN WHETHER HE WILL ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT THREAT, GIVEN THE IMMENSE ECONOMIC IMPACT, NOT JUST ON INDIA BUT CHINA, WHICH IS A FAR BIGGER PURCHASER OF RUSSIAN ENERGY AND RUSSIAN PRODUCTS IN GENERAL AND FAR MORE CRITICAL TO RUSSIA'S WAR MACHINE. JOE: THANK YOU SO MUCH, JENNIFER WELCH LIVE FROM WASHINGTON. WE TORTURED KIRK VOGLER -- WE TURN TO KIRK VOGLER, A FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO DURING THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M WONDERING THOUGHTS ON THE RHETORIC WE ARE HEARING, PRESIDENT TRUMP INVOKING THE RUSSIAN WAR MACHINE, SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON THEN WHO WE WERE HEARING FROM ONLY WEEKS AGO AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU BUY THIS APPROACH, DO YOU TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD? > > EVERYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES HIS TACTICAL AND IT'S ALL AND IT TRYING TO GET NOW SHE WAS HOPING TO OFFER SWEET DEALS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. PUTIN TURNED HIM DOWN REPEATEDLY AND HAS CONTINUED KILLING PEOPLE IN UKRAINE. SO NOW HE'S TRYING THE OPPOSITE APPROACH AND IS RATCHETING UP THE TOUGH TALK, THE RHETORIC ABOUT THE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES, THE TARIFFS, SANCTIONS AND SO FORTH. HE IS SEEING WHETHER THAT KIND OF PRESSURE WILL WORK ON PUTIN. HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK IT WILL AND I THINK WITKOFF IS GOING TO FIND THAT PUTIN IS GOING TO TRY TO PREVARICATE, TRY TO FIND LITTLE THINGS HE CAN OFFER TO DRAG THINGS OUT, BUT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL. AS FOR THE SERIOUSNESS OF THESE TARIFFS OR SANCTIONS, WE WILL SEE IT WHEN WE SEE IT. I THINK TRUMP IS SERIOUS THIS TIME BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ACCOMMODATION OF FACTORS, SANCTIONS, PERHAPS TARIFFS ON INDIA, CHINA, AND SO FORTH, BUT ALSO HE CONTINUED STRAIN ON MILITARY SUPPORT TO UKRAINE. HE'S ALREADY ARRANGED WITH THE NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL. KAILEY: AS YOU MENTIONED, WE SPOKE WITH THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO COME AMBASSADOR WHITAKER, ON THE EARLY EDITION OF BALANCE OF POWER, TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE JUST OUTLINING, THE U.S. PROVIDING OR WEAPONS THROUGH NATO COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MAKE IN THESE PURCHASES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT, COUPLED WITH SANCTIONS DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE KREMLIN. THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD US. > > THERE'S NO RESOLUTION ON THE BATTLEFIELD, A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION IS ONLY WAY. THINK SECONDARY SANCTIONS AND TARIFFS AGAINST THOSE THAT ARE PAYING FOR THIS WAR, LIKE CHINA, INDIA, AND BRAZIL, BY BUYING THE OIL THAT RUSSIA IS PRODUCING, IS AN OBVIOUS NEXT STEP TO TRY TO BRING THIS WAR TO AN END. RUSSIA IS VERY GOOD AT AVOIDING SANCTIONS AND EVADING THESE THINGS, BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO REALLY HIT THEM WHERE IT COUNTS, AS THE REVENUE SOURCE WHICH IS THE SALE OF OIL TO THESE COUNTRIES. KAILEY: I WONDER IF YOU SURE THAT OPTIMISM ABOUT HITTING THEM WHERE IT COUNTS. IS THAT HITTING PUTIN HARD ENOUGH WHEN YOU JUST SAID YOU'RE NOT SURE THESE PRESSURES ARE ENOUGH TO SWAY HIM. > > I THINK WE HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IS IT -- ENOUGH IS ENOUGH UNTIL IT IS. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS TRYING TO TARGET, AS HE SAID, THE REVENUE FLOWING INTO THE KREMLIN BUDGET WHICH IS FUNDING HIS ABILITY TO KEEP THE WAR GOING. INDIA IS A SUBSTANTIAL BUYER OF RUSSIAN OIL AND ITS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, MAKING A PROFIT OFF IT, BUT A LOT OF THAT INITIAL PURCHASE GOES RIGHT INTO THE KREMLIN STATE BUDGET. SO THIS IS WORTH GOING AFTER. THEN WE HAD TO KEEP LAYERING ON TOP OF THAT. WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TARIFFS WHICH HIT THE COUNTRY, I WOULD GO AFTER THE PARTICULARLY ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS DOING THE BUSINESS DEALS, THE BANKS, THE PURCHASERS OF THE OIL AND GAS, ANYONE WORKING WITH THE VESSELS AND PORTS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO TARGETED SANCTIONS AS WELL TO MAKE THOSE PEOPLE NOT WANT SHOULD DO IT. AS IS OFTEN UNDERESTIMATED, GETTING NATO INVOLVED IN HELPING ACQUIRE AND DISTRIBUTE WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION TO UKRAINE IS SIGNIFICANT. FOR THREE YEARS, PRESIDENT BIDEN KEPT NATO OUT OF THIS, HE DELIVER LEE WANTED TO AVOID HELPING UKRAINE OUT OF FEAR OF ESCALATION. DONALD TRUMP IS JUST NOW PUT THAT ON THE TABLE AND I THINK THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP ON THE MILITARY SIDE WITH NATO IS TO HELP UKRAINE DEVELOP A STRONGER, INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM TO TRY TO NEUTER THE EFFECTS OF RUSSIA'S NIGHTLY ATTACKS. JOE: WITH ALL THAT SAID, WE'VE GOT A DEADLINE AT THE END OF THIS WEEK AS WE HAVE ALREADY INVOKED, JUST VLADIMIR PUTIN CARE? WILL HE CHANGE HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE NEXT FIVE DAYS? > > HE WILL OFFER SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE GOOD, BUT IT REALLY MEANS NOTHING. IT COULD BE A PHONE CALL WITH HIM AND TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY ALL ONLINE, OR IT MIGHT BE THAT HE WILL DROP ONE OF HIS CONDITIONS BEFORE ENDING THE WAR . OR HE WILL OFFER TO SEND ANOTHER DELEGATION TO ISTANBUL TO MEET WITH UKRAINIANS, BUT NOTHING IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THOSE THINGS, IT'S JUST STALLING FOR TIME. KAILEY: SO AS WE CONSIDER TIME, WITH THE ADDITIONAL WEAPONS BEING PROVIDED THROUGH NATO AS A MIDDLEMAN THAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING WITH RUSSIA'S WAR MACHINE IS RIGHT NOW, WITH THE SANCTIONS ARE SACRED TARIFFS GOING INTO EFFECT, WHO HAS THE STRONGER HAND RIGHT NOW IF THEY WERE TO COME TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AT SOME POINT, WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE? > > BOTH OF THEM ARE HAVING THE -- DIFFICULTIES WITH RUSSIA. THEY ARE TAKING A LOT OF LOSSES IN MANPOWER AND HAVING TROUBLE REPLACING THEM. THEY KEEP TURNING TO NORTH KOREA , THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE REPLACING ALL THE MILITARY HARDWARE THEY ARE LOSING. PUTIN IS IN WORSE SHAPE THEN HE WANTS IT TO APPEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, UKRAINE HAS A SMALLER POPULATION. THAT TAKEN A LOT OF LOSSES AS WELL AND THEY CONTINUE TO RELY ON OUTSIDE SUPPORT WHICH OBVIOUSLY RUSSIA IS NOT GETTING THAT MUCH OF, BUT UKRAINE IS GETTING A LOT OF OUTSIDE SUPPORT. AT THE END OF THE DAY IS UKRAINE IS A COUNTRY, AS A PEOPLE, AS A NATIONAL IDENTITY, UKRAINE IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO GIVE UP, THEY ARE DEFENDING WHO THEY ARE. JOE: IS THERE ANYTHING BEYOND THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE WEAPONS THAT THE U.S. CAN DO RIGHT NOW MILITARILY TO HELP UKRAINE? WE GOT A COUPLE OF NUCLEAR SUBMARINES THE PRESIDENT TOLD US HAVE BEEN HEADED TO THAT REGION OR SOME REGION AROUND RUSSIA, IN RUSSIAN WATERS. DO WE DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN ISRAEL, FOR INSTANCE, AND PLAYED DEFENSIVE ROLE IN INTERCEPTING MISSILES AT ARE HEAD TO CIVILIAN NEIGHBORHOODS IN UKRAINE? > > THAT IS ONE THING THAT WE COULD DO, AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE AMERICAN MILITARY ACTION TO STOP THE RUSSIANS. WE CAN TASK THIS TO NATO, LET NETO WORK WITH UKRAINE TO DEVELOP A MULTILAYERED AND MUCH MORE STRATEGIC AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE HAVE A HODGEPODGE OF WEAPONS FROM ALL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THIS COULD BE MUCH BETTER INTEGRATED. WE COULD BE GIVING THE UKRAINIANS MUCH LONGER RANGE, PRECISION GUIDED MUNITIONS SO THEY CAN TAKE OUT AIRFIELDS, AIRCRAFT, AMMUNITION DEPOTS, FUEL DEPOTS, GO AFTER ALL THE MILITARY SUPPORT THAT IS ENABLING THESE RUSSIAN RAIDS, AND AS YOU INDICATE, WE COULD BE SUPPORTING UKRAINE OR THEIR DEFENSE FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY POLAND AND ROMANIA WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING IN UKRAINE, ALL OF THAT TRYING TO HELP CIVILIANS. ONE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION IS, WE USED TO HAVE ON THE BOOKS LEND LEASE LEGISLATION, WHERE UKRAINE COULD BORROW MONEY FROM THE UNITED STATES AND BY OUR WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION THAT EXPIRED IN 2023, BUT WE SHOULD PUT THAT BACK IN THE MIX AS WELL AS A SIGNAL TO PUTIN THAT THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THIS CAME FROM. KAILEY: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. A RENEWED WAVE OF GET BUYING LIFTED STOCKS TODAY THANKS TO SOME POLYP -- SOLID EARNINGS REPORTS AND CONFIDENCE THE FED WILL CUT RATES SOONER THAN LATER. ROMAINE BOSTICK JOINS US LIVE FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. ROMAINE: QUITE A TURNAROUND FROM WHAT WE SAW IN FRIDAY, ALL THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE JOBS REPORT AND A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESIGNATION OF THE FED GOVERNOR. ALL OF THAT APPARENTLY IN THE BACK MIRROR THERE, THE S & P 500 UP 1.5% ON THE DAY, A SIMILAR STORY FOR THE OTHER MAJOR INDICES INCLUDING THE NASDAQ AND THE RUSSELL 2000. THIS GETS INTO THE IDEA OF WHAT IS MOVING THE MARKET HIGHER. TECH WAS ON TOP ONCE AGAIN, SIX OF THE SEVEN NAMES POSTING GAINS ON THE DAY. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GAINS IN THIS MARKET, YOU WILL LOOK FOR THE CASH FLOW STORIES. WE GOT A TASTE OF THAT IN THE POST-MARKET TODAY WITH PALANTIR. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE AI TRADE AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT NVIDIA WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THE BEST-PERFORMING STOCK THIS YEAR SINCE CHATGTP WAS INTRODUCED BACK IN 2022 IS NOT NVIDIA, IT'S PALANTIR. IT'S UP MORE THAN 2000% SINCE CHATGTP WAS INTRODUCED AND A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE IDEA THAT NOT ONLY IS PALANTIR A BIG AI PLAY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BIG GOVERNMENT PLAY, A COMPANY THAT HAS CLOSE TIES TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WITH A LOT OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANY RIGHT NOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE US BEING ONE OF THE HUGE -- ONE WITH A HUGE MOAT AROUND IT. DESPITE THE HIGH STOCK PRICE AND HIGH MULTIPLES, SOME INVESTORS ARE BETTING THAT 2000% RUN CAN CONTINUE DEEP INTO 2026. JOE: AN INCREDIBLE STORY, DESCRIBING THE ASTONISHING AI IMPACT ON BUSINESS. ROMAINE BOSTICK AT WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WILL ANNOUNCE A NEW FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR AND NEW JOB STATUS STATUS TO IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, FOLLOWING THE RESIGNATION BARRING WE TALKED ABOUT ON FRIDAY. FIRST, THE NEW THREAT FROM TEXAS GOVERNOR ABBOTT TO ARREST THE TEXAS DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO FLED THE STATE TO BLOCK REPUBLICANS FROM REDRAWING CONGRESSIONAL MAPS. WE WILL BE JOINED BY ONE OF THOSE LAWMAKERS, STATE REPRESENTATIVE CHRIS TURNER. HE IS NEXT ON \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. > > THE TOOL THEY ARE USING IS A RACIST GERRYMANDERED MAP. A MAP THAT SEEKS TO USE RACIAL LINES TO DIVIDE HARD-WORKING COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SPENT DECADES BUILDING UP THEIR POWER AND STRENGTHENING THEIR VOICES. AND GOVERNOR ABBOTT IS DOING THIS IN SUBMISSION TO DONALD TRUMP. JOE: THAT WAS TEXAS STATE REPRESENTATIVE GENE WU WHO ALONG WITH OTHER DEMOCRATIC STATE LEGISLATORS FLED TO ILLINOIS WHERE THEY WERE GREETED BY GOVERNOR JB PRITZKER. OTHERS WENT TO NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS IN AN EFFORT TO BREAK THE CORE NECESSARY FOR TEXAS IS THE PUBLIC AND MAJORITY TO FINALIZE NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAPS THAT COULD WIPE OUT AS MANY AS FIVE DEMOCRATIC SEATS. TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT HAS THREATENED TO REMOVE THE ABSENT DEMOCRATS NOW FROM OFFICE, GIVING LAWMAKERS UNTIL 3:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME TODAY TO BE BACK IN THE LEGISLATURE OR FACE THAT CONSEQUENCE. NOW HE IS ALSO THREATENING ARRESTING THOSE DEMOCRATS OUTRIGHT. JOINING US WITH THE LATEST FROM A DALLAS BUREAU IS OUR TEXAS BUREAU CHIEF. THIS DEVELOPMENT IS SOMETHING WE'VE DISCUSSED, NOW THAT IT'S IN PLACE, HOW WOULD THIS HAPPEN, WOULD HE EXPEDITE LAWMAKERS FROM STATES LIKE ILLINOIS? > > YES, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU ARREST THEM? GOVERNOR ABBOTT HAS SAID THAT DPS NOW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO GO OUT AND ARREST THEM. DPS IS TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GET TO OTHER STATES? YOU GOT DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW IN ILLINOIS COME IN NEW YORK, IN BOSTON. THE QUESTION IS, HOW WOULD THEY GO INTO ALL THOSE STATES? GOVERNOR PRITZKER'S SPECIFICALLY SAID LAST NIGHT AT A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH DEMOCRATS THAT HE WOULD PROTECT AND DO EVERYTHING HE COULD, THAT HE WAS WELCOMING THEM TO THEIR STATE, SO THAT WILL CERTAINLY DEPEND ON HOW THESE GOVERNORS REACT BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO WATCH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. KAILEY: OUR TEXAS BUREAU CHIEF, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MOMENTS AGO TEXAS STATE HOUSE SPEAKER DUSTIN BURROUGHS ISSUED THIS MORNING TO HIS DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WHO FLED THE STATE. > > TO THOSE WHO ARE ABSENT, RETURN NOW. SHOW THE COURAGE TO FACE THE ISSUES YOU WERE ELECTED TO SAUL, COME BACK AND FULFILL YOUR DUTY, BECAUSE HIS HOUSE WILL NOT SIT QUIETLY WHILE YOU OBSTRUCT THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS ARE WATCHING AND SO IS THE NATION. IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD, YOU SHOULD KNOW THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. JOE: JOINING US NOW, DEMOCRATIC TEXAS STATE REPRESENTED CHRIS TURNER, ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO LEFT THE STATE. FORMER TEXAS HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIR WHO WAS PART OF THE 2021 TEXAS DEMOCRATS STATE WALKOUT. WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME IN EFFECTING OUTCOMES? I REALIZE YOU'RE TRYING TO SHINE A LOT ON WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN TEXAS BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS AFTER FIVE WEEKS IN 2021, DEMOCRATS ENDED UP TRICKLING BACK INTO THE STATE AND THE PROCESS CONTINUED. IS THAT HOW THIS ENDS AS WELL? > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. LOOK, A QUORUM BREAK IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MEASURE TO TAKE. QUORUM BREAKS DO NOT GENERALLY ALTER THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE LEGISLATION, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, WE HAVE MADE THE COLLECTIVE DECISION THAT IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO DELAY THIS PROCESS AND USE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO RAISE AWARENESS AROUND THE COUNTRY, COAST-TO-COAST, ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO IN TEXAS. THEY ARE TRYING TO INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST I NORDEA VOTERS IN TEXAS BY TEARING APART MAJORITY AND MINORITY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, ALSO YOU CAN HAVE MORE POWER AND EVADE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCES. THAT IS WRONG, AND WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND FIGHT IT. KAILEY: IS IT ALSO WRONG FOR OTHER BLUE STATES, NOT NECESSARILY THE ONE WHERE YOU ARE NOW, BUT NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, TO PURSUE SIMILAR ACTION IN RESPONSE? DO TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT IN THIS SCENARIO? > > THE WRONG HERE IS THE FACT THAT IN TEXAS, THE WAY THEY ARE GOING ABOUT THIS IS TO INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BLACK, HISPANIC, AND ASIAN TEXANS BY DESTROYING THEIR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION IN VIOLATION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. I'M CONFIDENT THAT, IN HISTORY SHOWS THAT MAPS IN THE STATE YOU MENTION, CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, OR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 AREA THE QUESTION IS, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO FOLLOW THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, IN TEXAS REPUBLICANS ARE NOT DOING THAT, AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE AND THAT IS WHAT MATTERS MOST. JOE: I SUSPECT YOU'VE HEARD THE HEADLINES FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HERE, GREG ABBOTT HAS ORDERED THE REST OF DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO LEFT THE STATE, INCLUDING YOURSELF, SAYING TEXAS HOUSE DEMOCRATS ABANDONED THEIR DUTY TO TEXANS. IS THIS WORTH GOING TO JAIL OVER? > > I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO JAIL. THE PROCESS ACTUALLY IS TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM IN THE HOUSE. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HAS THE RIGHT TO ISSUE A CALL ON THE HOUSE AND ISSUE CIVIL ARREST WARRANTS. THAT'S WHAT HE HAS DONE THIS AFTERNOON, IT IS A CIVIL ARREST WARRANT, NOT A CRIMINAL ONE. THEY WOULD TAKE ME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, NOT TO JAIL. THAT'S THE REASON I'M NOT IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY OUTSIDE THE STATE OF TEXAS. THAT'S WHY MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE LEFT THE STATE OF TEXAS. AS FOR THE GOVERNORS BLUSTER AND RHETORIC, THINK HE'S JUST TRYING TO SHOW ALL FOUR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. KAILEY: SO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE NOT IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW. I ASSUME INTENTION IS TO REMAIN OUTSIDE OF TEXAS UNTIL THIS SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION IS OVER. BUT NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP THE GOVERNOR FROM JUST CALLING ANOTHER ONE. WHAT IS THE PLAN AFTER THIS? CAN YOU DO THIS IN PERPETUITY? > > NO ONE IS SUGGESTING THAT WE WOULD. OF COURSE I FULLY EXPECT THE GOVERNOR TO CALL ANOTHER SPECIAL SESSION, THAT IS HIS PREROGATIVE AS GOVERNOR. I EXPECT ULTIMATELY THIS FIGHT WILL BE DECIDED IN THE COURTS BECAUSE AS I SAY, THE MAPS THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965. BUT WE WANT TO USE THIS FIGHT AND ELEVATE THIS FIGHT IN A WAY THAT JUST THE INTENTION OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO, THE LINKS HE IS GOING TO TO SEIZE MORE POWER SO HE CAN EVADE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. JOE: SOME HAVE ASKED IF GOVERNOR PRITZKER IN ILLINOIS WHO IS HOSTING A GOOD NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS FROM TEXAS, MY CONSIDER PAYING A $500 DAILY FIND THAT APPARENTLY COMES WITH BREAKING THE QUORUM. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT? > > NO, WE HAVE NOT ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO DO THAT. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE FINES, I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT WHENEVER, IF IT COMES TO THAT. BUT NO, HE IS NOT, AND I WOULD NOT ACCEPT THAT. KAILEY: WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US HERE, DEMOCRATIC STATE REPRESENTATIVE CHRIS TURNER. AS WE CONSIDER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TEXAS, GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL OF NEW YORK SAID SHE INTENDS TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, TALKING ABOUT REDRAWING THE MAPS. I WONDER IF IT'S A DIFFERENCE THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE IS GOING TO EMBRACE. JOE: GREAT QUESTION. I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE POINT COME THIS IS WHY THEY FANNED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU'VE GOT CHICAGO, ALBANY, AND BOSTON WERE DEMOCRATS OR MEETING. KAILEY: CANNOT CALIFORNIA YET EVEN KNOW GOVERNOR NEWSOM IS MAKING A SIMILAR SUGGESTION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S OWN MAPS. COMING UP STILL AHEAD, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TEASING HIS NEW TIMELINE FOR NAMING A NEW FED GOVERNOR FOLLOWING THE RESIGNATION. WE WILL BRING YOU THAT NEXT ON \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. \u266a PRES. TRUMP: I'LL BE ANNOUNCING SOMEBODY FOR THE FILLING OF THE PERSON THAT LEFT, I THINK A BIDEN APPOINTMENT, AND SHE LEFT EARLY, WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING A NEW STATISTICIAN SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR DAYS. WE HAD NO CONFIDENCE, THE NUMBERS WERE RIDICULOUS. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST YESTERDAY SAYING HE WILL ANNOUNCE A NEW FED GOVERNOR IN THE COMING DAYS FOLLOWING THE RESIGNATION, BUT WHAT EXACTLY WILL THE PROCESS LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN THE SENATE COMPLICATE MATTERS? MICHAEL, WE TOUCHED ON THIS WHEN IT WAS BREAKING ON FRIDAY. NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT KIND OF HOOPS WITH THE PRESIDENT NEED TO JUMP THROUGH HERE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH LAWMAKERS MIGHT NOT SIGN OFF ON A SO-CALLED LOYALIST? > > IT'S VERY, GUIDED SITUATION FOR THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE STRATEGICALLY HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER HE NEEDS TO FILL THE SEAT WITH THE PERSON HE WANTS TO BECOME CHAIRMAN WHEN JAY POWELL LEAVES OFFICE NEXT MAY, IF HE DOES NOT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POWELL STAYS ON AS A GOVERNOR AND HE HAS NO OTHER SEAT TO FILL. SO THERE ARE SOME INTRIGUING OPTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE COULD NAME WHOEVER HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE CHAIR AND THEN PRESUMING THEY ARE CONFIRMED, THEY WOULD SORTA BE A CHAIR AND WAITING IN THE MARKETS WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHO TO LISTEN TO COME THIS PERSON ARE POWELL UNTIL POWELL IS NO LONGER THE CHAIR. IS A SHADOW THING THAT SCOTT BESSENT HAS TALKED ABOUT. OR THE PRESIDENT COULD APPOINT SOMEONE AND SAM GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ON A CHAIR LATER, TAKING A CHANCE THAT POWELL WILL RESIGN. IF HE DOESN'T RESIGN, HE CAN SAM GOING TO MAKE A DECISION LATER AND PICK FROM EITHER THE PERSON I JUST NOMINATED OR MAYBE CHRIS MULLER ARE VICKI BOWMAN WHO WERE THE TWO FED GOVERNORS APPOINTED BY TRUMP EARLIER, AND SORT OF MAKE IT LIKE THE APPRENTICE, SITUATION WHERE HE CAN TELL TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE YOU ARE FIRED, AND ONE OF THEM GETS THE JOB. KAILEY: SO OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE LONGER-TERM CONSIDERATIONS THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE BUT IN THE MORE IMMEDIATE TERM, IS THIS LIKELY TO HAVE ANY REAL BEARING ON THE FEDS NEXT RATE DECISION IN SEPTEMBER? > > NONE AT ALL. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF THE SEAT WAS FILLED BY THEN. WHOEVER IT IS IS GOING TO HAVE TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK WE KNOW THAT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY CAN GO THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. I SUPPOSE ABOUT BE EASIER FOR SOMEONE LIKE KEVIN WARSH WHO HAD BEEN A FED GOVERNOR READY WILL HAVE TO UPDATE EVERYTHING. HE'S AN INVESTOR AND HE WILL HAVE A LOT OF HOLDINGS HE WILL HAVE TO DISPOSE. SCOTT BESSENT I SUPPOSE COULD GET FROM FIRM VERY QUICKLY BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE HE WOULD WANT -- IF HE WOULD WANT THE JOB THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD APPOINT HIM. YOU START FROM BEHIND IN THAT CASE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS AND GO TO THE FLOOR. WHEN THE SENATE COMES BACK, THEY WILL HAVE THE BUDGET TO DEAL WITH. RIGHT NOW THERE'S TALK OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND THAT WOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER FILLING A FED SEAT. SO I THINK AT THIS POINT ARE GOING TO GET TO SEPTEMBER AND'S GOING TO BE ONE VOTE SHORT AS IT WAS THIS LAST TIME AND IT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ON WHAT THE FED DOES. KAILEY: BLOOMBERG'S MICHAEL MCKEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. OBVIOUSLY PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE SELECTING A NEW BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS CHIEF TO REPLACE THE ONE HE FIRED LAST WEEK AFTER WEEK JOBS DATA AND REVISIONS THAT HE SUGGESTED WITHOUT EVIDENCE WERE RIGGED. JOINING US IS SET HARRIS, SENIOR FELLOW AT THE BURN CENTER FOR SOCIAL CHANGE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY AND WAS ALSO A TOP LABOR POLICY ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT BIDEN. WELCOME BACK. IF WE COULD JUST FIRST VICTIM IN THE CONCEPT OF RIGGING. IS IT POSSIBLE TO RIG? ? BLS DATA I ASKED THAT NOT JUST LOOKING BACK AT THE SUGGESTION THAT MAYBE THE DATA WILL NOT BE RELIABLE IF PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN APPOINT A LOYALIST TO THE BLS. > > NO ONE PERSON AT BLS COULD POSSIBLY DO IT, ESPECIALLY THE COMMISSIONER IS NOT THE PERSON WHO PUTS TOGETHER THE STATISTICS. THIS IS NOT HER SITTING ON THE COMPUTER ON HER OWN, WRITING UP A REPORT AND THEN SENDING IT TO THE PUBLIC. THIS IS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SURVEY COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE OTHER THING IS THE CULTURE OF BLS GUARANTEES THAT IF ANYBODY TRIED TO RIG THE NUMBERS , YOU WOULD HAVE DOZENS OR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE POINTING THE FINGER AND WHISTLEBLOWING. SO THERE IS ZERO CHANCE THAT THESE NUMBERS WERE RIGGED. THEY WERE AN HONEST REFLECTION OF A LABOR MARKET THAT IS SLOWING DOWN DRAMATICALLY UNDER THE TRUMP ECONOMIC POLICY. JOE: WE UNDERSTAND ONLY 42% OF THE RESPONDENTS GOT BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT IN TIME SO WHEN THEY HAD A FLOOD OF LATE REPLIES, REVISIONS WERE ADDED. KEVIN HASSETT, WHOSE NAME IS ON A VERY SHORT LIST TO BE THE NEXT FED CHAIR, HAS BEEN ON TELEVISION SAYING THAT THOSE REVISIONS EQUAL THE HARD EVIDENCE THAT THIS WAS RIGGED. WOULD YOU TRUST THE FED CHAIR WHO SAYS THAT ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT? > > I ALREADY DON'T TRUST KEVIN HASSETT, AND THAT ARGUMENT IS PREPOSTEROUS. WE HAD ONE MONTH OF REVISIONS THAT WERE ESPECIALLY LARGE AND WE USUALLY DON'T SEE THAT KIND OF NUMBER. THE OTHER REVISIONS OF THE OTHER TWO MONTHS THAT WERE REVISED WERE NOT THAT BIG. THERE WERE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SEEN IN THE PAST. WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE LATE REPLIES TO THE SURVEYS THAT BLS RUNS, WE HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS AND STATISTICAL IMPUTATIONS THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS DOES. IT'S ALL ORDINARY BUSINESS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A LABOR MARKET WITH 170 MILLION AMERICANS, AND ADJUSTMENT OF 100,000 IS LESS THAN .1%. IF WE COULD ALL BE 99% ACCURATE, WE WOULD NEED THE BLS STANDARD. KAILEY: WE CONSIDER THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA GOING FORWARD, THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS AT MARKETS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME FACE AND ECONOMIC DATA PUT OUT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS. SHOULD THEY STILL HAD THE FAITH REGARDLESS OF WHO THE NEXT BLS COMMISSIONER IS? > > I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHO THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS TO BE THE NEXT BLS COMMISSIONER. EVEN THOUGH AT ANY GIVEN TIME THE COMMISSIONER CAN CHANGE THE RESULTS IN A MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT SITUATION REPORT, OVER TIME YOU CAN MAKE A SERIES OF STRATEGIC DECISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME. SO I THINK THERE IS REAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN, AND WHOEVER IS NOMINATED TO THAT JOB IS ALREADY UNDER CLOUD BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS BLS COMMISSIONER. SHE DID NOT RIGGED THE NUMBERS. HE SAID THAT TO JUSTIFY FIRING HER, WHEN HE COULD'VE JUST FIRED HER. THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THAT FALSE ACCUSATION AGAINST HER. HE DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WORKING PEOPLE, THEY KNOW IF THERE ARE JOBS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THEY KNOW IF THEIR WAGES OR PRICES ARE GOING OUT. THEY KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AROUND TARIFFS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THAT IS A PROBLEM. FIRING THE BLS COMMISSIONER ACCOMPLISHED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW PUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR STATISTICAL SYSTEM AT RISK. JOE: YOU THINK WE WOULD BE DOWN 1000 POINTS BUT THE MARKET IS ON A TEAR, STOCKS ARE UP, WHERE IS THE DISCONNECT HERE? REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY THERE'S A LOT OF FUDGING GOING ON HERE. > > I DON'T MAKE MY JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS GOOD OR BAD POLICY OR GOOD OR BAD DECISION BASED ON HOW MARKETS RESPOND. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM LONG-TERM WITH THE FIRING OF THE BLS COMMISSIONER, WE WILL SEE THAT EVOLVE. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTS, WHETHER THERE IS WHISTLEBLOWING THAT GOES ON INSIDE BLS. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT PERSON TALKS ABOUT THEIR JOB. IF THEY TRULY ARE INDEPENDENT, WHICH THE BLS COMMISSIONER IS SUPPOSED TO BE, THEN I THINK THE MARKETS WOULD BE RIGHT ON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT, BUT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMINGLY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTS, THEY ONLY DO HIS BIDDING AND THEY DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE, BEING ETHICAL, THEN I THINK THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO BE CONCERNED. KAILEY: OF COURSE THE FEDERAL NOT BE DOING PRESIDENT TRUMP BIDDING. HE'S BEEN PUSHING FOR LOWER INTEREST RATES AND THE FED HAS NOT DONE IT. DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A POINT THAT PERHAPS THE FED SHOULD HAVE ACTED SOONER VERSUS WAITING FOR LATER? > > IT'S A VERY INTERESTING ARGUMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT NUMBERS THAT WILL HELP HIM ACCOMPLISH HIS POLICY GOAL AT THE FED WHICH IS TO GET THE FED TO MOVE ON INTEREST RATES. THE ODDS OF AN INCREASE -- OF A SLASHING OF INTEREST RATES HAVE GONE UP, MAYBE 25 BASIS POINT CUT, MAYBE A 50 BASIS POINT CUT, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE LEANING VERY FAR FORWARD. THE PROBLEM THE FED HAS AS WE SAW INFLATION TAKE UP AND THE LABOR MARKET SLOWED DOWN. THERE IS A REAL RISK OF STAGFLATION HERE. THEY ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO MOVE VERY, VERY CAUTIOUSLY. CAUTION AND DONALD TRUMP DON'T BELONG TOGETHER IN A SENTENCE. JOE: AND THE IMPACT OF CONTINUED MASS DEPORTATIONS, LET'S SAY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR FROM NOW, WHAT DO MONTHLY JOBS NUMBERS LOOK LIKE? SOME TELL US WE COULD BE DOWN TO A TRICKLE > > . I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE DISASTER ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THE TARIFFS AND THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF THESE DEPORTATIONS ON COMMUNITIES AND WORKPLACES ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. PEOPLE ARE PETRIFIED, JUSTIFIABLY SO. WE HAVE MASKED, UNIDENTIFIED ICE AGENTS GOING INTO WORKPLACES AND ROUNDING UP PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES, SOME OF THEM MANY DECADES, WORKING RESPONSIBLY, PAYING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES AND THEIR INCOME TAXES, CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY, AND THEY ARE BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT JUST MORALLY WRONG BUT IT IS VERY, VERY BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SIGN THAT EITHER OF THESE TWO DEEPLY TROUBLING ECONOMIC POLICIES, THE TERROR OF CONFUSION THE PRESIDENT IS CAUSING, NOT TO MENTION THE ACTUAL EFFECTS OF THE TARIFFS ON PRICES AND OTHER THINGS BUT THE DEPORTATIONS ARE JUST GOING TO KILL US. OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH DEPENDS ON HAVING MORE PEOPLE, NOT FEWER. THE PRESIDENT IS THROWING GOOD QUALITY WORKERS OUT OF THE COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE BROWN SKIN. KAILEY: IT IS THREE DAYS FROM NOW THAT WE'RE SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO START COLLECTING THE HIGHER LEVEES PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY. WHEN IS THAT START TO MORE MATERIALLY HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE HIRING AND FIRING DECISIONS THAT BUSINESSES ARE FACING? > > IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS EXTREME HARD TO PREDICT. HE PUTS THE TARIFFS ON, HE TAKES THE TARIFFS UP EVERY HE MAKES IT 50%, HE MAKES IT 10%. HE SAYS HE STRIKES A DEAL AND WE NEVER SEE THE CONTENT OF THE DEAL. BUSINESSES DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOUND DECISION IS. CAPITALISM DEPENDS ON TRANSPARENCY AND CERTAINTY. WE HAVE NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESIDENT'S TARIFF POLICIES. ONCE ITERIS BEGIN TO BITE, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE LABOR MARKET, WHICH IS EMPLOYERS ARE NOT LAYING OFF NUMBERS IN LARGE NUMBERS. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE. WE WILL THEN SEE EMPLOYERS BEGIN TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THE DECREASED OUTPUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. THEY WILL HAVE HIGHER INPUT COSTS, THAT MEANS THEY MAY HAVE TO LAY SOME PEOPLE OFF. LOOKING AT THE WEEKLY INITIAL UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBER WHICH IS SOMETHING OF A PROXY FOR LAYOFFS IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT INDICATOR FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE LABOR MARKET. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE STAYING STILL, HOPING ALL THIS WILL PASS, BUT ONCE I START MAKING DECISIONS THAT WILL BE AN INDICATOR THEY'RE MAKING THE DECISION TO LAY PEOPLE OFF. JOE: WE WILL STAY IN TOUCH ON THIS, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. SENIOR FELLOW AT THE BURN CENTER FOR SOCIAL CHANGE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS ON THE CONTROVERSIAL AMERICAN EAGLE AD THAT SENT SHARE SOARING TODAY. WE WILL BRING YOU THE DETAILS AND TURN BACK TO THE CONVERSATION ON THE TEXAS DEMOCRATS WHO FLED THE STATE TRYING TO BLOCK -- BLOCK THEIR REPUBLICANS PLAN REDISTRICTING. OUR PANEL WILL BE HERE NEXT, ON \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. KAILEY: THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. ALONGSIDE JOE MATHIEU, I AM KAILEY LEINZ. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE REDISTRICTING OUT OF TEXAS WHEN WE CONVENE OUR POLITICAL PANEL IN JUST A MOMENT. TESLA APPROVED AN INTERIM STOCK AWARD WORTH ABOUT $30 BILLION TO CEO ELON MUSK AND WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A GOOD-FAITH PAYMENT. THE NEW AGREEMENT INCLUDES ABOUT 96 MILLION SHARES OF TESLA, AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THE TOP JOB FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. SAYING USING MUSK WOULD MEAN NOT ONLY THE LOSS OF HIS TALENTS BUT HIS ABILITY FOR HIRING AND RETAINING TALENT ADD TESLA. JOE: BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT BOLSONARO HAS BEEN ORDERED TO BE PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST. THE COURT SAID HE DISOBEYED A BAN ON USING SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE STANDING TRIAL FOR AN ALLEGED COUP ATTEMPT IN 2023. HE WILL BE ORDER TO WEAR AND ANKLE MONITOR KAILEY: KAILEY:. CORNELL AND NORTHWESTERN COULD BE THE NEXT UNIVERSITIES TO FINALIZE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S SUSPECTED RESEARCH FUNDS OF ILLEGAL SCHOOLS. THEY TOOK STEPS TO ADDRESS MAJOR BUDGET SHORTFALLS EARLIER THIS YEAR. THEY ARE JUST TWO OF A SLEW OF DIVERSITIES RUSHING TO CUT DEALS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE FALL SEMESTER APPROACHES. IT HAS LED TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT AND LAYOFFS. JOE: AMERICAN EAGLE STOCKS SURGING AS MUCH AS 16% IN HIS BIGGEST INTRADAY GAIN SINCE MAY AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S CONTROVERSY WILL SYDNEY SWEENEY AND CAMPAIGN, TRUMP USING HIS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TRUE SOCIAL TO CALL THE SWEENEY ADD THE HOTTEST AD OUT THERE, ADDING WITHOUT EVIDENCE AT THE COMPANIES JEANS WERE, QUOTE, FLYING OFF THE SHELVES. JOINING US WITH REACTION TO THIS STORY ARC RICK DAVIS ALONGSIDE A SENIOR DEMOCRACY FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF THE PRINCE -- PRESIDENCY AND CONGRESS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. IT REALLY HAD THE PRESIDENT'S ATTENTION TODAY. THE STOCK REACTION WAS PRETTY REMARKABLE HERE. SOME OF THE NEWS THAT TOOK PLACE ON FRIDAY, WITH ONE OUSTER AND ONE RESIGNATION THAT HAS LEFT PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH TWO BIG SEATS TO FILL. A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE MARKETS AS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING WITH SETH HARRIS, SHOWING A LOT OF FORGIVENESS AT THIS MOMENT. ARE THE DEMOCRATS MAKING TOO BIG? ? OF A DEAL OUT OF THIS > > I DON'T THINK SO. IT'S ASTONISHING THAT HE HAS TIME FOR SYDNEY SWEENEY AND HER JEANS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS MAKING TOO BIG OF A DEAL OUT OF THIS. THIS IS A STATISTICIAN WHO WAS FIRED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID ANYTHING IN TERMS OF POLITICKING. IT IS DEVASTATING TO THINK THAT IN THE NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE, WE COULD BE LIVING IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE CANNOT TRUST NUMBERS. HOW DO YOU MAKE PUBLIC POLICY IF THAT IS THE CASE? HE HAS OPENED UP OR PUT US DOWN A RABBIT'S WHOLE AND IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRESIDENT COULD JUSTIFY ANY OF THIS. IT IS ALSO TERRIBLY DISTRESSING TO THINK THAT BUREAUCRATS AND STATISTICIANS ARE BEING TREATED THIS WAY AND ROBBING US OF OUR ABILITY TO TRUST IN NUMBERS. KAILEY: WE CONSIDER THAT SHE WAS CONFIRMED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE U.S. SENATE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT POINTS US TO THE FACT THAT SHE AND THE NEW GOVERNOR WILL NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT HAD TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY GETTING HIS NOMINEES TO THE PROCESS, BUT KNOWING WE ARE UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THREAT IN SEPTEMBER, HOW QUICKLY DO YOU EXPECT THESE PROCESSES WILL BEGIN AND COULD THERE BE SOME CONCERN? JOE: THERE HAD BEEN A PROBLEM GETTING DONALD TRUMP'S APPOINTEES THROUGH THE SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. THAT WAS A BIG FIGHT THAT JUST ENDED ON FRIDAY, AND NOW REPUBLICANS IN THE LEADERSHIP ARE TALKING ABOUT COMING BACK AND PULLING A NUCLEAR OPTION, CHANGING THE RULE ON CONFIRMATIONS TO ALLOW THEM TO GO THROUGH WITH ONLY 51 VOTES, WHICH GIVES THEM CARTE BLACN, YOU HAVE CONFIRMATIONS PLAYING OUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU NOW HAVE TWO HIGH-PROFILE CONFIRMATION TO ADD TO THAT PILE THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PROCESSED. IT IS BUBBLING UP, YOU CAN FEEL THE TENSION IN WASHINGTON, WHETHER IT'S REPUBLICANS FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER ON THE EPSTEIN SITUATION, BACKED UP WORK BEING DONE ON CONFIRMATIONS AND THE BUDGET, POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN, AND NOW THIS NEW ACTIVITY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AROUND THE IN THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. THIS IS ALL REPUBLICANS DOING THINGS TO REPUBLICANS. THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN CLASSIC BATTLE IN THE SUMMERTIME BETWEEN THE PARTIES. I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO BE DONE, WHETHER OR NOT THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL STEP OUT AND START TO DRIVE THE TRAIN LIKE THEY DID AFTER INAUGURAL DAY, ON THE SWEENEY THING, IS THAT DNA I HAVE ASKED MY QUESTION. IT'S ON FULL DISPLAY IN TAXES AS WE GET TO THE REDISTRICTING STORY OF -- STORY TODAY. TEXAS GOVERNOR ABBOTT DISCUSSED THE ONGOING PLANS AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE CRITICISM HE'S HEARING AS HE SEEKS FIVE ADDITIONAL REPUBLICAN SEATS. LET'S LISTEN. > > FIRST, IT IS NOT DONE FOR RACIAL REASONS. THE RACIAL OUTCOME IS THIS. THE DISTRICT LINES WILL SOLIDIFY, THE HOUSTON AREA WILL ADD FOUR NEW HISPANIC DISTRICTS. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE RACIAL MINORITY DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. JOE: 57 DEMOCRATS BAILED ON TEXAS, THEY BROKE FORUMS, SO THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS WOULD BE STOPPED, REALIZING THAT IT IS SOME POINT THEY NEED TO COME HOME AND THE GOVERNOR WILL PROBABLY SCHEDULE ANOTHER SESSION. BUT NOW HE IS ORDERING THEIR ARREST, HOW DOES THIS END? > > IN THE END, DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO RETURN, BUT THEIR REALITY IS THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS TO DO THIS. THE CYNICAL WAY IN WHICH GOVERNORS TALKING ABOUT THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ADDRESSING ISSUES OF DISTRICTS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS AND OTHERS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CONCERNED THAT THE GOP WILL LOSE THE HOUSE IN 2028, AND HE SAID FIND ME FIVE MORE SEATS OR VOTES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON. NOW DEMOCRATIC STATES LIKE NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS ARE THREATENING TO DO THE SAME THING AND WE WILL BE IN A PERIOD OF JUST CONSTANT REDISTRICTING. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO IS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE, NOT TO MENTION YOUR ROBBING THE ABILITY FOR CHOICE BETWEEN A FULL THROATED REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. > > TO MAKE THE POINT THAT GERRYMANDERING IS WRONG, AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE YOUR GOVERNORS SAYING WE WILL DO THE SAME THING, DO THEY KIND OF COUNTERACT EACH OTHER? > > IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED, BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATS IN TEXAS BECAUSE THEY'LL TRY TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. GERRYMANDERING IS POLITICAL. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DO IT. COURTS TEND TO GET INVOLVED AND MAKE IT WORSE RATHER THAN AT HER. IS THERE A COMMISSION THAT SHOULD DRAW THE LINES OR SHOULD POLITICAL PEOPLE DRAW THEM? THAT IS A COUNTRY WE LIVE IN. IT SHOULD NOT SHOCK ANYBODY THAT WITH THIS CLOSE A CONGRESS, THE STATES WILL NOT DO EXACTLY -- THE REALITY IS WHAT TEXAS HAS EMBARKED UPON IS A DANGEROUS PLAN. I'VE BEEN THROUGH AT LEAST FIVE REDISTRICTING'S. THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT LIKE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO. YOU TAKE 10 DISTRICTS THAT ARE SOLID REPUBLICAN AND MAKE FIVE NEW ONES THAT ARE SORT OF MARGINAL REPUBLICANS, BUT THOSE OTHER 10 NOW ARE MARGINAL REPUBLICANS. ALL OF A SUDDEN IN A CLOSE ELECTION, THAT'S ONE THING, BUT IN A BLOWOUT YEAR WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO CARRY, YOU COULD WIPE OUT THAT WHOLE GROUP. KAILEY: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING. JOE: THANKS FOR JOINING US ON BALANCE OF POWER. WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.",
