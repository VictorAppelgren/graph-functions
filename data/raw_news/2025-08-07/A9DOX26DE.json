  "description": "For decades, women fought for workplace equality\u2014now some young women are out-earning men, revealing shifts in education and workforce dynamics.",
  "content": "For decades, women have struggled for equality in the workforce. While the gender pay gap still persists, some young women are increasingly out-earning their male peers.\n\nThis trend highlights a shift driven by factors such as higher educational attainment and evolving societal norms regarding family planning and career priorities.\n\nAn examination of these factors provides insight into changing workforce dynamics and what lies ahead for women's earnings and financial security.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to women increasingly out-earning men in certain contexts. Overall, this trend is the result of a variety of structural and economic shifts that are reshaping earning potential for women.\n\n\"The most significant factors driving women\u2019s increasing earnings relative to men can be grouped into two main categories: structural demographic shifts and economic opportunity expansion,\" says Guyesha Blackshear, economist and host of \"The Junior Economist\" podcast.\n\n\"Together, these categories create a compound effect where years of systemic barriers are being dismantled and translated into real economic results.\"\n\nWomen Are Waiting To Get Married and Have Children\n\nIn previous generations, women often married and had children at a much earlier age, which typically led to career interruptions during years that were critical for advancement and long-term earning potential. However, since 1950, the median age for a woman\u2019s first marriage has steadily increased.\n\n\"With the median American woman now marrying at 29 and the average having her first child at 28, career interruptions are shifting later or disappearing entirely, which opens the door to sustained income growth,\" Blackshear explained.\n\nGeography is also increasingly shaping the trajectory of women\u2019s earnings. That's especially so for those living in major metropolitan areas that offer access to higher-paying jobs and provide more career opportunities.\n\nAnd, in these urban hubs, women are leveraging both traditional career paths and entrepreneurial opportunities to boost their earning power. \"These shifts are reinforced by geography, where location plays a fundamental role in young women\u2019s earning potential,\" Blackshear stated.\n\n\"When young women live in major metropolitan areas like Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco, they tend to out-earn men by an average of up to 2%, and in some high-income regions that edge widens to 5\u201320%.\"\n\nWhen it comes to women taking on the role of small business owners, numbers have increased. This is particularly true for digital platforms like TikTok, Pinterest, Etsy, and Substack.\n\nOne of the clearest drivers of this shift is educational attainment. For decades, women between 25 and 34 have surpassed men in college enrollment and completion across all racial and ethnic groups. As a result, women are entering the workforce better credentialed and increasingly landing secure, high-paying positions in future-proof industries.\n\n\"On the education side, 47% of U.S. women ages 25-34 now hold a bachelor\u2019s degree versus 37% of men, giving women a clear credential premium,\" Blackshear explained.\n\nMen don't enroll in college or complete it at lower rates for several reasons, but affordability and familial obligations have been noted as major obstacles, with 39% of all men not completing college due to cost.\n\nMore than one-third of men also simply don't have a desire to enroll, while 26% deem a degree unnecessary for the job or career they want.\n\n\n\nMore Women Are Participating In The Labor Market\n\nOver the years, men's labor market participation has steadily dropped, specifically among those aged 25 to 54. As of July 2025, participation was at 67.6%, an almost 20% decrease since 1950.\n\nResearchers have pointed to a combination of factors: some men are being pushed out due to issues like the mismatch of their skills with today's job market, while others are being pulled away by education or caregiving duties.\n\nDisability and mental health struggles have also been identified as potential barriers to stable employment for men. Factors like underdiagnoses, social expectations around masculinity, and reduced use of healthcare can all contribute to unmet mental health needs that can impact job performance.\n\nAdditionally, women have entered the workforce in greater numbers, though they remain concentrated in different types of jobs than men. Plus, women are more likely to work in healthcare, education, and service-oriented roles, which are industries experiencing significant growth.\n\nMen, however, work in construction, manufacturing, and technical trades, which aren't growing as quickly.\n\nLegal Changes Have Made It Easier For Women To Get Ahead\n\nPublic policy also plays an important role in supporting a woman's ability to remain in the workforce and, therefore, earn more over their lifetime.\n\nFor example, paid family leave helps women stay in the workforce during key career years. When paid leave is not an option, that can decrease the mother's employment participation, with some women having to reduce hours or completely drop out of the workforce.\n\nAdditionally, pay transparency laws and regulations have been adopted in states like California, Colorado, New Jersey, and New York. These laws can help women negotiate more effectively, as they enable women to compare their salaries to those paid for comparable positions.\n\n\"The overall pattern shows that when policies reduce the chance of career interruptions, women are able to hold onto momentum and keep rising. However, the durability of these gains depends heavily on maintaining favorable policy environments,\" Blackshear explained. \"The real shift, however, will be cultural: we\u2019ll increasingly see family and workplace norms adapt around women's economic centrality as an operating reality.\"\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to recognize that this trend may not be immune to economic downturns.\n\nBlackshear notes that this trend could be threatened by emerging risks like AI overtaking female-dominated jobs, rollbacks of supportive state and federal policies, sharp inflation in childcare costs, and macroeconomic shocks that could weaken demand for service labor.\n\n\"These could all moderate or reverse the trajectory in the next two to four years,\" she said.\n\nFuture generations of women may out-earn men\u2014not because the fight for gender equality has been won, but because they may be navigating a world that increasingly values the paths women are choosing.\n\nAs things gradually shift in their favor, women have been able to secure more stable, long-term earnings, financial growth, and success than ever before. The prospects for that continue to look bright.",

      "text": "The gender wage gap is the disparity in incomes between men and women for doing the same work. Also known as the gender pay gap, it has narrowed since the 1960s but remains significant. Closing the gap has become an important focus for governments, nonprofit organizations, and businesses. This article focuses on the gender wage gap in the U.S., its long history as a political issue, and where it stands today.\nKey Takeaways\n- The gender wage gap refers to pay disparities between men and women doing the same work. There is also a racial wage gap.\n- Congress didn't take major action to address the gender wage gap until the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, although the \"Equal Pay for Equal Work\" movement dates back to the 1860s.\n- The gender wage gap has generally narrowed over the years, but in 2023, women earned less than 83 cents for every dollar that men earned, a 1.5% drop from the 84 cents they earned vs. men in 2022.\nEarly History of the Wage Gap\nThough the gender wage gap probably dates to the beginnings of civilization, it emerged as a political issue in the U.S. in the 1860s under the rallying cry of \"Equal Pay for Equal Work.\"\nAmong the movement's most vigorous advocates were women's rights activists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who made a case for bridging the wage gap in their newspaper, The Revolution, and other works.\nWomen eventually won the right to vote in the U.S. with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920. Nevertheless, the wage gap persisted.\nThe 1940s: A Failed Attempt to Bridge the Gap\nWinifred Claire Stanley, a Republican member of Congress from New York, introduced a bill in 1944 titled \"Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex.\" It would have amended the list of unfair labor practices in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 to include discriminating \"against any employee, in the rate of compensation paid, on account of sex.\" Stanley's bill never made it through Congress.\nFast Fact\nOther wage gaps exist in the pay disparities between White workers and Black and Latino/Latina workers, along with the pay of workers in the U.S. and those in other countries.\nThe 1960s: Major Strides for Equal Pay and Civil Rights\nThe next major attempt to address the inequity on a national level came two decades later, with the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. It prohibited employers from paying male and female workers different wages for \"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\" However, it also allowed for several exceptions, including pay structures based on seniority or merit.\nIn signing the bill into law, then-President John F. Kennedy said that paying men and women different wages for the same work was an \"unconscionable practice\" and cited a statistic that \"the average woman worker earns only 60% of the average wage for men.\"\nA year later, in 1964, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act also addressed the wage gap, broadening the law to make compensation decisions based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin unlawful. As with the Equal Pay Act, there were multiple exceptions, again including seniority- and merit-based wage programs.\nThe 1970s and 1980s: A Call for Comparable Worth\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the concept of comparable worth (or pay equity) entered the national conversation. Its proponents called attention to wage gaps among workers in jobs that, while not identical, could be considered similar in terms of skills, responsibility, and value to the overall enterprise. Often, they argued, those gaps were a legacy of past discrimination.\n\"Many women and people of color are still segregated into a small number of jobs such as clerical, service workers, nurses, and teachers,\" the advocacy group National Committee on Pay Equity explains. \"These jobs have historically been undervalued and continue to be underpaid to a large extent because of the gender and race of the people who hold them.\"\nEleanor Holmes Norton, chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during the Carter administration, singled out comparable worth as \"the issue of the 1980s.\" But the Reagan administration, which followed, disagreed. Then-President Ronald Reagan reportedly called it \"Mickey Mouse, a cockamamie idea...[that] would destroy the basis of free enterprise.\" Pay equity and comparable worth made little progress on the federal level but did become law in several states.\nThe 2000s: Win Some, Lose Some\nThere were no major changes in the laws around payment by gender in the 1990s. Although the gender wage gap continued to shrink, it did not close.\nA 2007 U.S. Supreme Court case, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., led to the next major federal law. Lilly Ledbetter sued her employer under the Civil Rights Act, alleging that it underpaid her for 19 years. A jury awarded her more than $3.5 million, but the company appealed, arguing that she failed to file her suit within 180 days of when the discrimination first occurred, as prescribed by law. An appeals court reversed the original decision, and the Supreme Court also ruled against Ledbetter in a 5 to 4 vote.\nDissenting justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested it was now a matter for Congress to take up, which the legislative branch soon did. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which passed in 2009, expanded the period for filing a discrimination claim, making it easier for other women to sue employers they believed discriminated against them. It was the first piece of legislation signed into law by then-President Barack Obama just nine days after his inauguration.\nThe Paycheck Fairness Act was another major legislative proposal addressing the wage gap, first introduced in 2009. Among other things, it called for greater enforcement of antidiscrimination laws and increased penalties for violators. The Paycheck Fairness Act initially passed the U.S. House but failed in the U.S. Senate. It has been reintroduced several times since then, including in 2021 when it again passed the House.\nImportant\nFinancial inequality among the genders is reflected in numerous ways aside from the wage gap. For example, when a company sells products aimed at women for more than comparable products for men, it is informally called a pink tax. And the \"tampon tax\" is an actual sales tax that many states impose on feminine hygiene products.\nThe Mid- to Late 2000s and 2020s\nDespite progress on the legislative front over the past 100 years, the wage gap has been slow to narrow. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women working full-time in 1960 earned about 60 cents for every dollar earned by men\u2014the number cited by President Kennedy in signing the Equal Pay Act.\nThough the numbers gradually inched up over the next 30 years, they didn't reach 70 cents until 1990. Women earned less than 83 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2023, the most recent year for which data are available. This represents a drop of a 1.5% from the 84 cents women earned vs. men in 2022. This is shown in the graphs below from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThe top graph shows how the female-to-male earnings ratio is at 82.7%. The bottom graph illustrates the annual earnings of male and female full-time workers. Women earn about $11,500 less on average than their male counterparts.\nFull-time earnings for women have increased at a faster rate since 2000. Full-time female workers earned a median income of $45,800 per year in 2000 compared to $55,240 in 2023. Meanwhile, full-time male workers earned a median income of $62,1200 in 2000, rising to $66,790 in 2023.\nMore Women Working Full-Time\nConsiderably more women now work full-time. The table below shows a 26.7% increase in full-time female workers since 2000, more than 10 percentage points higher than the increase for men.\nMoving from part-time to full-time work also means that more women may now be eligible for employee benefits, such as health insurance coverage and retirement plans.\n| Increase in Male and Female Full-Time Workers From 2000 to 2023 | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 2000 | 2023 | Change | % Increase | |\n| Male (thousands) | 59,600 | 68,470 | +8,870 | 14.9% |\n| Female (thousands) | 41,720 | 52,850 | +11,130 | 26.7% |\nEqual Pay Day\nEqual Pay Day was established in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity. It was created to highlight the differences in pay between men and women and, more important, how \"far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year.\"\nOn Equal Pay Day 2023, which fell on March 14, 2023, the Biden Administration announced steps to close the gender wage gap and to provide women with access to better jobs. The announcement was made after the president signed an executive order to close the wage gap. The order included:\n- Providing access to better-paying construction jobs\n- Supporting efforts for equal pay in different states through pay transparency legislation\n- Boosting pay equity among federal contractors\nIn signing the order, President Biden also encouraged private companies to follow suit.\nEqual Pay Day 2024 occurred on March 12, 2024, and the National Committee on Pay Equity has set March 25 for Equal Pay Day 2025, denoting slippage in the gender gap.\nThe Gender Wage Gap by Race\nThe gender wage gap also varies significantly by race. According to 2023 data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Hispanic women earned just 57.8 cents for every dollar earned by White non-Hispanic men, while Black women earned 66.5 cents, White non-Hispanic women earned 79.6 cents, and Asian women earned 94.2 cents.\n134\nThe number of years it will take, based on current data, for the global gender wage gap to close.\nThe Gender Wage Gap by Age\nIn recent years, young women between the ages of 25 and 34 who are in the early years of their working lives have managed to narrow the gap with men, according to the Pew Research Center. Since 2007 their earnings have been about 90 cents or even more to the dollar compared to men of the same age.\nBut the wage gap subsequently widens as those women age. For example, women who were age 25 to 34 in 2010 were making 92% of what a man the same age made. Yet, in 2022, when they were 37 to 46 years old, they were making only 84% of men the same age. And as women continue to age, the gap keeps widening\u2014a pattern that the Pew Research Center notes \"has not changed in at least four decades.\"\nWhy Do Women Get Paid Less Than Men?\nAlthough a multitude of reasons contribute to why women are often paid less than men, some of the main contributors include discrimination, differences in the fields that women often work in, education levels, and differences in years of experience.\nWhich Occupations Have the Highest Gender Wage Gap?\nJobs in which the gender wage gap is higher than others include finance managers, retail sales, education and childcare administrators, and administrative assistants.\nWhich Industries Have the Smallest Gender Wage Gap?\nIndustries in which women earn comparable salaries to their male counterparts include tutors, personal care and service workers, interior designers, and dietitians and nutritionists.\nThe Bottom Line\nIncome inequality on the basis of gender has lessened over time, but significant progress has stalled over the past two decades. Women are still often underpaid in comparison to men, and there are more levels of inequality within the wage gap when it comes to race and type of occupation. Closing it remains unfinished business in making the United States a more equitable nation."

      "text": "Between diapers, daycare, extracurricular activities, college tuition, and more, having children is often seen as a financial drain. However, a new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) suggests a surprising twist: having kids could actually increase your lifetime wealth by more than 23%.\nThe reason? Your desire to leave behind a legacy for your children can nudge you to earn and save more over your career. Beyond saving for retirement, which tends to be a top financial priority, having kids leads parents to make intentional financial decisions that prioritize long-term security for themselves and their children.\nKey Takeaways\n- Parents may accumulate approximately 23% more money over their lifetimes compared to people without kids.\n- Bequest motives, or the desire to provide for children after death, lead many parents to work harder, save more, and make long-term financial decisions beyond just retirement planning.\n- While children bring added financial pressure, they may also encourage people to take a more strategic approach to earning, saving, and spending.\nHaving Kids Can Lead to Higher Earnings\nThere's no denying that kids are expensive. Food, clothes, education, and healthcare for another person (or multiple people!) can reduce your income.\nIn fact, the costs go beyond direct expenses, as many parents, especially women, temporarily reduce their working hours or leave the workforce entirely to care for their children during early childhood years. This lowers short-term earnings and can even affect earning potential in the long run.\nDespite the financial burden of raising a child, there can be a benefit: having kids can motivate people to earn and save more.\nIn the NBER paper, economists explored how bequest motives\u2014which refers to the desire for individuals to leave behind an inheritance to their children\u2014affect how much people work. According to the study, the absence of these bequest motives can diminish aggregate wealth by over 23%.\n\"Bequest motives, medical expenses, and wage risk each account for substantial shares of aggregate wealth, with bequest motives alone responsible for 23.8%,\" the authors wrote.\nThis indicates that the responsibility of caring for children inspires parents to increase their earnings (and lifetime wealth) and plan more strategically for the future.\nYour earnings are a key part of building wealth, but that's only one piece of the puzzle. When parents are motivated by bequest motives, they approach their finances differently from someone without children.\nRelated Stories\nIn addition to seeking opportunities to earn more over their lifetime, they are strategic about how they save, spend, and look at money overall. Rather than simply focusing on their retirement, these individuals adopt strategies that prioritize long-term wealth accumulation\nFor some, this could be a combination of securing that higher-paying job, developing a household budget, automating savings, and delaying retirement to squeeze more earnings from those later career years.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile raising children is expensive and adds pressure, as the research shows, the desire to leave something behind for their heirs motivates parents to work harder and increase their earnings.\nBut trying to maximize your earnings and wealth is only piece of the puzzle. When parents are motivated by bequest motives, they approach their finances differently from someone without children. Parents may be more strategic about how they save, spend, and look at money overall. Rather than simply focusing on their retirement, these individuals adopt strategies that prioritize long-term wealth accumulation\nFor some, this could mean trying to secure a higher-paying job, developing a household budget, automating savings, and delaying retirement to leave the workforce with a larger nest egg."

      "text": "With its abilities to answer questions, perform research, generate content, and perform other human-like tasks, fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could threaten some jobs and industries aren't unfounded. But similar to past technological revolutions, AI isn\u2019t likely to cause widespread job losses, and could eventually help stimulate the labor market, a report from Wells Fargo Economics concluded.\nKey Takeaways\n- A Well Fargo Economics report found that past technological revolutions, like the Internet adoption of the 1990s, helped contribute to higher employment trends.\n- Studies show that AI can perform part of some jobs, perhaps all of a few, but also that new technology often creates jobs that previously hadn't been imagined.\n- Slow labor-force growth in the U.S. means that AI could help meet the increasing need for more workers.\nAcknowledging that some industries and occupations could indeed be rendered obsolete by AI, the four-part report showed that past technological revolutions failed to cause the widespread labor-market disruptions that some feared.\nLooking at the Internet revolution of the 1990s, the report noted that in the period between business-cycle peaks in July 1990 and March 2001, payrolls grew an average of 1.8% a year, adding about 23 million jobs.\n\u201cHistory is rife with examples of groups that have opposed technological change due to fears of widespread job losses,\u201d Wells Fargo Chief Economist Jay Bryson and others wrote in the analysis. \u201cTime and again, however, aggregate levels of employment and income have risen in the aftermath of the introduction of the new technology.\u201d\nAI Poses Threat to Some \u2018White-Collar\u2019 Jobs, but Labor Market Proves Resilient\nStudies of how much work could be accomplished by generative AI vary. The Wells Fargo report cited a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania with OpenAI and OpenResearch, which determined that 80% of workers could have at least 10% of their tasks done with generative AI, and 19% of workers could have 50% or more of their job covered by AI.\nAnother look from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that the share of time spent on work tasks that could be automated through AI or other technology amounted to 60% to 70%.\n\"White-collar\" jobs are likely to face the most exposure to the technology, the report noted. Case in point, one study found that some jobs most threatened by AI include telemarketers, political scientists, mediators, judges, psychologists, and postsecondary teachers in foreign languages, history, and law. The least threatened: cement masons, roofers and welders.\nSo far, predictions about the impacts of automation haven\u2019t panned out. Wells Fargo pointed to a 2013 paper from Oxford University that forecast 47% of U.S. employment was at risk to automation over the next decade or two that failed to foresee the current labor market where the unemployment rate of 3.5% has hovered around record lows.\nSlower Adoption of Technology Can Preserve Jobs\nAnother trend that\u2019s likely to help preserve the labor market is that while technological development can happen quickly, widespread adoption can take more time, allowing transitions in the workforce to happen more gradually. With AI, factors as varied as government regulation to hardware costs to labor union strikes could help slow uptake of the technology enough to give the labor market time to transition.\nThe report also noted that technology like AI might help to fill the gap that a slowdown in the growth of the labor force has created. Estimates show that the U.S. labor force is expected to grow by 0.5% a year from 2023 to 2033, about half the pace of the past 30 years.\nThe structural slowdown in the labor supply, which includes weak growth of the working-age population and smaller gains in labor-force participation, means that more workers will be needed and, in some cases, workers will need to do more, all of which could be accomplished by AI.\nMost likely, the report said, AI would create jobs as others are replaced, noting that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 60% of the job roles performed in 2018 hadn't yet been created in 1940.\n\u201cMaking the widespread displacement of jobs the base case risks us joining a long historical record of commentators who have rung the alarm bell about surging unemployment due to new inventions that seemed unbelievable to the humans of the time,\u201d it said."

      "text": "What Is the Labor Force Participation Rate?\nThe labor force participation rate is an estimate of an economy\u2019s active workforce. The U.S. government's labor force participation rate formula is the number of people ages 16 and older who are employed or actively seeking employment, divided by the total non-institutionalized, civilian working-age population.\nAs of December 2024, the U.S. labor force participation rate was 62.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which publishes the figures monthly.\nKey Takeaways\n- The labor force participation rate indicates the percentage of working-age people who are employed or are actively seeking work.\n- In conjunction with the unemployment numbers, it offers some perspective into the state of the economy.\n- Social, demographic, and economic trends cause the rate to fluctuate from month to month.\n- Global labor force participation has shown a steady decline since 1990.\nUnderstanding the Labor Force Participation Rate\nThe labor force participation rate is an important metric to use when analyzing employment and unemployment data because it measures the number of people who are actively job-hunting as well as those who are currently employed.\nIt includes all other people aged 16 or older and compares the proportion of those who are working or seeking work outside the home to those who are neither working nor seeking work outside the home. It omits institutionalized people, such as individuals in prisons, nursing homes, mental health facilities, and members of the military.\nThe labor force participation rate is considered to be somewhat more reliable than the unemployment rate because it accounts for people who have given up looking for work. The unemployment numbers do not take into account those who have given up looking for work.\nSome economists argue that the labor force participation rate and unemployment data should be considered together to better understand an economy\u2019s real employment status.\nLabor Force Participation Rate Formula\nThe formula for labor force participation is:\nCivilian Non-Institutional Population(Number Employed+Number Seeking Work)\u00d7100\nThis applies to all members of the population at age 16 or older.\nFactors That Affect the Participation Rate\nLabor force participation is affected by numerous social, economic, and demographic factors. As these factors change, labor force participation goes up or down. These changes can happen quickly or slowly. They might have a short-term impact on labor force participation, or they might create long-term change.\nEconomic Factors\nShort- and long-term economic trends influence the labor force participation rate. In the long run, industrialization and the accumulation of wealth can have an impact.\nIndustrialization tends to increase participation by creating employment opportunities. High levels of accumulated wealth can reduce participation because wealthier people simply have less need to work for a living.\nIn the short term, business cycles and unemployment rates influence the participation rate. During an economic recession, the labor force participation rate tends to fall because many laid-off workers become discouraged and give up looking for jobs. Economic policies such as heavy labor market regulation and generous social benefit programs may tend to decrease labor force participation.\nSocial Factors\nSocial expectations and changes to those expectations affect who is available to participate in the workforce. As different groups are expected to work or not, the labor force participation rate will go up or down.\nFor example, if married men are considered responsible for supporting their families, while married women are encouraged to stay home, women will stop working once married or after having children, which lowers the labor force participation rate. If the expectation is that both parents should be able to work, some parents of either gender will opt to stay in the workforce.\nEducational expectations impact the labor force participation rate. If more young people learn a trade or a family business as they are growing up and skip college, adults start entering the workforce between the ages of 17 and 19.\nIn countries or demographic groups where a college degree is regarded as a necessity, more young adults will continue their education after high school. Labor force participation will go down because they won't join the workforce until their early or mid-twenties.\nDemographic Factors\nChanges in the working-age population from generation to generation influence labor force participation. As large age cohorts reach retirement age, the labor force participation rate can fall.\nFor example, the retirement of a steady stream of baby boomers has reduced labor force participation. Baby boomers are one of the largest demographic blocks in the population. Since generations after the baby boomers are smaller, they will not be replaced by as many active, younger workers when they retire.\nTrends in the Participation Rate\nThe labor force participation rate changes based on economic, social, and demographic trends over the long term. It rose steadily through the second half of the 20th century, peaking at 67.3% in April 2000. As the Great Recession hit in 2008, the participation rate entered several years of steep decline, stabilizing at around 63% by 2013.\nFrom 2013 on, the monthly figures held steady in the vicinity of 63%, however, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the labor force participation rate fell dramatically, dropping from 63.3% to 60.1% in the first half of the year. The low point of 60.1% was in April 2020, after which the rate began to increase slowly. As of December 2024, it sits at 62.5%.\nThe trend in the women\u2019s labor force participation rate largely parallels the long-term trends for the overall population. The women\u2019s labor force participation rate nearly doubled from 32% to 60% in the 50 years from 1948 to 1998. This rate dropped to 54.6% in April 2020 from 57.9% in February 2020. As of December 2024, it sits at 57.4%.\nFast Fact\nThe U.S. labor force participation rate of 62.5% in December 2024 included 57.4% participation for women and 67.9% participation for men.\nWhy the Labor Participation Rate Has Declined\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, the share of prime-working-age people (25 to 54 years old) in the labor force peaked at 72% in 1995 and has declined since then. This roughly corresponds to some of the declining trends in labor force participation in the 21st century. There are reasons for this decline.\n- The Great Recession: During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, unemployment rose from 5% to 10%. In the decade that followed, the labor market recovered. However, many workers who had left the workforce never returned to full-time work, even when jobs became available. Though overall unemployment returned to pre-recession levels, rates of long-term unemployment increased as workers who had lost jobs stayed out of the labor force for longer periods.\n- COVID-19: There was a sharp drop in labor participation in early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the U.S. economy. Many were unable or unwilling to remain in face-to-face jobs, while others left their jobs to take care of family members at home. Due to caregiving expectations, women left the workforce at higher rates than men.\n- Retirement: Baby boomers are no longer the largest segment of the population, having been surpassed by millennials, but they are still a significant factor. From 2007 to 2014, up to half the decline in labor force participation was a result of the workforce aging, according to the Council of Economic Advisors.\n- College: An increase in college attendance reduces labor force participation. College enrollment increased steadily from 1999 to 2011, from 14.85% to 21.01%. It then started to decrease and continued to do so through 2022 when enrollment was 18.58%. The estimated 2024 enrollment number increases to 19.25%. It is expected that enrollment will gradually increase going forward, with enrollment estimated at 19.57% in 2025 and 20.23% in 2031.\nImportant\nThe national unemployment rate in the United States was 4.1% in December 2024.\nGlobal Labor Force Participation\nGlobal labor force participation has shown a steady decline since 1990. According to the World Bank, the global labor force participation rate stood at 61% as of 2023, down from 62% in 2010 and 65% in 1991. It dropped to a low of 59% in 2020 during the pandemic and has steadily been increasing since, reaching 61% as of 2023, the same level as before the pandemic in 2019.\nThe following table highlights the countries with the highest and lowest labor force participation rates as of 2023 (latest data available):\n| Countries With the Highest and Lowest Labor Force Participation Rates (2023) | |||\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Country (Highest) | Rate | Country (Lowest) | Rate |\n| Qatar | 89% | Djibouti | 32% |\n| Madagascar | 85% | Yemen | 33% |\n| Solomon Islands | 84% | Somalia | 34% |\n| United Arab Emirates | 83% | Afghanistan | 37% |\n| Tanzania | 81% | Syria | 39% |\n| Ethiopia | 80% | Jordan | 39% |\n| Mozambique | 79% | Nepal | 40% |\n| Burundi | 79% | Mauritania | 41% |\n| Eritrea | 78% | Tajikistan | 41% |\n| Liberia | 77% | Iraq | 41% |\nWhat Does the Labor Force Participation Rate Formula Measure?\nThe labor force participation rate measures a country\u2019s active workforce of people 16 and older. It includes people who have stopped looking for work but still want to work. The official unemployment rate does not count those discouraged workers.\nWhat Affects the Labor Force Participation Rate?\nThree major factors influence the rate: economic, demographic, and social. For instance, the recent retirement of baby boomers in great numbers has pushed the rate down, while the introduction of large numbers of women into the workforce in the second half of the 20th century increased the rate. In April 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic struck the U.S., the rate went down by more than 3% compared to the beginning of that year.\nHow Does the U.S. Labor Force Participation Rate Compare With Those of Other Countries?\nAccording to the World Bank's most recent data from 2023, the U.S. falls in the middle of the pack at 62% and ahead of the world rate of 61%. The highest rate was held by Qatar, at 89%, and the lowest by Djibouti, at 32%.\nHow Is the Labor Force Participation Rate Measured?\nThe labor force participation rate is based on a monthly household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This survey asks respondents about their age and whether they are employed or looking for work. On that basis, the government estimates the labor force participation rate.\nWhy Is the Labor Force Participation Rate Declining?\nThe participation rate has steadily declined since the late 1990s, largely due to the retirement of baby boomers and other significant demographic changes. In 2020, there was a sharp drop in labor participation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered many businesses and forced many people to temporarily leave the workforce.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe unemployment rate is more closely watched but it is best understood when viewed in conjunction with the labor force participation rate.\nThat's because the labor force participation rate counts those discouraged workers, people who are willing and able to work but have given up looking for a job. Neither of these numbers exists in a vacuum. Many social, economic, and demographic factors cause the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate to fluctuate over time.\n- The Unemployment Rate Affects Everybody\n- How Inflation and Unemployment Are Related\n- Minimum Wage and Unemployment\n- Cost of Unemployment to the Economy\n- Okun's Law\n- Policies to Decrease Cyclical Unemployment\n- Inflation and Unemployment Correlation\n- Downside of Low Unemployment\n- Frictional vs. Structural Unemployment\n- Structural and Cyclical Unemployment"

      "text": "When the economy heads toward a recession, it's natural for investors to worry about falling stock prices and the impact on their portfolios. At the same time, you may hear reports of dropping housing starts, increased jobless claims, and shrinking economic output. But what do house building and shrinking output have to do with your portfolio? And, aside from all of these risks, how does a recession affect you as an investor?\nAs you'll see in this article, these symptoms are part of a larger picture, which determines the strength of the economy and indicates whether we are in a period of recession or expansion. To understand the state of the economy at a given time and how this affects the stock market, we need to start with the business cycle. Generally, the business cycle is made up of four different periods of activity, each of which can last for months or years.\nKey Takeaways\n- In order to understand the state of the economy and how recessions impact investors, we need to start with the business cycle.\n- The business cycle refers to the fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over a period.\n- At the peak of the business cycle, the economy is healthy and growing; stock prices for companies often reach all-time highs.\n- During the recession phase of the business cycle, income and employment decline; stock prices fall as companies struggle to sustain profitability.\n- A sign that the economy has entered the trough phase of the business cycle is when stock prices increase after a significant decline.\nStage 1: Peak\nAt its peak, the economy is running at full steam. Employment is at or near maximum levels, real gross domestic product (GDP) is growing at a healthy rate, and incomes are rising. All this positive economic activity is reflected in stock prices, with share prices for many companies and industries rising to all-time highs. To show their gratitude to shareholders for their continued support and investment, companies may increase dividend payouts.\nLess encouragingly, prices tend to be rising due to inflation. Even so, most businesses, workers, and investors are enjoying the boom times.\nStage 2: Recession\nThe adage \"what goes up must come down\" applies perfectly here. After experiencing a great deal of growth and success, income and employment begin to decline due to any number of causes. It could be an external event that triggers the downturn, such as an invasion or a supply shock, a sudden correction in overheated asset prices, or a drop in consumer spending due to inflation, which in turn can lead firms to lay off employees.\nDuring a recession, stock prices typically plummet. The markets can be volatile with share prices experiencing wild swings. Investors react quickly to any hint of news\u2014either good or bad\u2014and the flight to safety can cause some investors to pull their money out of the stock market entirely.\nBecause the wages companies pay workers and the prices they charge consumers are \"inelastic,\" or initially resistant to change, cutting payrolls is a common response. Rising unemployment pushes consumer spending down even further, setting off a vicious cycle of economic contraction. A recession is generally defined as two or more consecutive quarters of a decline in real GDP. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines a recession as any period of \"significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months\" and uses a variety of factors including GDP, employment, retail sales, and industrial production to make that determination.\nStage 3: Trough\nThe trough is the part of the business cycle when output and employment bottom out before they begin to rise again. At this point, spending and investment have cooled down significantly, pushing down prices and wages.\nTroughs can be challenging to pinpoint while they are happening, but they are recognizable in hindsight. Troughs are the point where business activity moves from contraction to recovery. A sign that the trough has occurred\u2014or is about to occur\u2014is when stock prices begin to rally after a significant decline. This rebalancing of the economy makes new purchases attractive to consumers and new investments\u2014in labor and assets\u2014attractive to firms.\nStage 4: Recovery and Expansion\nDuring a recovery or \"expansion,\" the economy begins to grow again. As consumers spend more, firms increase their production, leading them to hire more workers. Competition for labor emerges, pushing up wages and putting more money in the pockets of workers and consumers. That allows firms to charge more for products, sparking inflation that starts low and slow but may eventually bring growth to a halt and start the cycle over again if it rises too high. Over the long-term, however, most economies tend to grow, with each peak reaching a higher high than the last.\nHow Does the Business Cycle Impact Investors?\nUnderstanding the business cycle doesn't matter much unless it improves portfolio returns. What's an investor to do during a recession? The answer depends on your situation and what type of investor you are.\nFirst, remember that a bear market does not mean there's no way to make money. Some investors take advantage of falling markets by short selling stocks, meaning they make money when share prices fall and lose money when they rise. Only sophisticated investors should use this technique, however, due to its unique pitfalls. The most important of these is that losses from short selling are theoretically unlimited since there is no obvious limit to how far a stock's value can rise.\nAnother breed of investor treats a recession like a sale at the local department store. This technique, known as value investing, looks at a declining share price as a bargain waiting to be scooped up. Betting that better times will eventually return to the economy, value investors take advantage of bear markets to pick up high-quality companies on the cheap.\nThere is yet another type of investor who barely flinches during a recession. A follower of the long-term, buy-and-hold strategy knows that short-term problems will barely be a blip on the chart over a 20- to 30-year horizon.\nAnother Approach for Investors\nOf course, few of us have the luxury of looking decades down the line, or the iron stomach required to do nothing in the face of huge paper losses. Value investing is not for everyone either, as it requires extensive research, while short-selling requires even tougher discipline than buying and holding. The key is to understand your situation and pick a style that works for you.\nFor example, if you are close to retirement, the long-term approach definitely is not for you. Instead of living at the whim of the stock market, consider diversifying into other assets such as treasury securities, money market funds, and certificates of deposit (CDs).\nHow Do Recessions Affect Investors?\nTypically during the early part of a recession, the stock market has negative returns. This is often because of the negative sentiment around poor or lackluster corporate earnings. But the stock market will often recover before the recession is over.\nShould you avoid Investing During Recessions?\nNot necessarily. Recessions do not last forever. And during the early stages of recessions when sentiment is especially negative, that might be a good time to buy securities that are on sale. But since it is impossible to tell ahead of time when markets have bottomed, be prepared for prices to move lower.\nDo Any Sectors Perform Well During Recessions?\nSectors that produce goods and services that people cannot do without tend to withstand recessions better than others.\nThe Bottom Line: The Business Cycle Isn't Perfect\nThe business cycle model is, of course, oversimplified. Economies sometimes experience double-dip recessions, for example, in which another recession follows a short recovery. Nor do all economies enjoy a positive long-term growth path. The relationships among spending, prices, wages, and production described above are also too simple. Governments often have a large influence at all stages of the cycle. Excessive taxation, regulation, or money-printing can spark a recession, while fiscal and monetary stimulus can turn a shrinking economy around when the supposedly natural tendency to rebalance fails to materialize.\nReading the headlines during a recession can convince you the sky is falling. But understanding the business cycle can help you realize that downturns are a normal part of a functioning economy. When the economy begins to show signs of a recession, it's important to develop a strategy for dealing with risks based on your financial situation."

      "text": "Although the 1993 federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons, that leave doesn't come with pay. That lack of income can make it difficult for many employees to take off the time they need, whether it's for the birth or adoption of a child or a medical crisis.\nIn a 2017 report (the most recent available), the Pew Research Center found that 40% of workers who took family leave reported that they took less time off than they needed or wanted to. That's where the concept of paid family and medical leave (PFML) comes in. However, in the United States, paid family and medical leave policies are enacted and the state level. These laws vary in how they work and what situations they cover.\nKey Takeaways\n- Thirteen states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) and the District of Columbia have enacted PFML laws.\n- Of the states that have PFML policies currently on the books, those in nine states and D.C. are presently in effect.\n- A new PFML policy went into effect in Colorado on Jan. 1, 2024.\n- Policies are scheduled to take effect in Delaware and Minnesota on Jan. 1, 2026, in Maine on May 1, 2026, and in Maryland on July 1, 2026.\nNational Paid Family Medical Leave in the U.S.\nAs of 2023, the United States is one of only six countries in the world that doesn't offer a nationwide paid family leave policy, and one of the few that doesn't offer any kind of national paid family or caregiving leave. President Biden's proposed American Families Plan included a proposal for paid family leave, which would have filled that gap. But all of its provisions were cut from the Inflation Reduction Act, which became law in 2022.\nA small but growing number of states (plus the District of Columbia) have stepped in to fill the gap. In 2016, just four states had PFML policies on the books. Today, that number has more than tripled\u2014to 13 out of 50\u2014though laws in four of those states won't go into effect until 2026.\nThe specifics of PFML policies can vary significantly from state to state. What follows is an examination of each, specifying what (and whom) they cover, how long they last, and how much of a worker's salary they are intended to replace. First, though, learn the basics of family and medical leave, and how state laws differ from the federal Family Medical Leave Act.\nThe Need for Family and Medical Leave\nFamily and medical leave can have powerful, positive effects that we have known about for at least a decade. A 2014 study from the Institute for Women's Policy Research found that a sufficient period of maternal leave can prevent depression and stress in mothers, increase the likelihood that infants will receive well-baby care, and even lower the rate of mortality for infants and young children. Paternal leave can significantly reduce familial stress and encourage father-child bonding.\nPaid leave also helps with child development, and it can help patch up some of the holes in America's social safety net. However, 44% of individuals don't have the option to take unpaid leave.\nDifficulties in Taking Family or Medical Leave\nAccording to a December 2022 Urban League survey, 15% of workers without paid family and medical leave didn't get needed healthcare in the previous 12 months because of difficulty in taking time off compared to 9% who had access to paid leave. The reasons: They couldn't afford to take unpaid time off and/or they were afraid they would lose their jobs.\nForty-four percent of individuals are not covered by the FMLA. Of those not covered, nearly 2.7 million individuals\u2014at some point in the year\u2014need to take leave but don't for fear of losing their jobs. Of women without paid leave, 30% end up leaving their jobs after giving birth.\nIt's also not uncommon to have a short-term disability; it happens to around 5% of working Americans on average each year. The consequences of this can be severe.\nWhat Is Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML)?\nThe U.S. Department of Labor defines PFML as paid time away from work due to circumstances that require a longer-term period of absence than the employer's regular sick days policies offer. It has two basic components:\n- Paid family leave allows workers to take time off in order to care for ill family members or a new child. It's also known as \"family caregiver leave\" and \"family leave insurance.\"\n- Paid medical leave is for taking time off for one's own serious illness or injury. It's also known as \"temporary disability insurance\" and \"short-term disability.\"\nCurrently, nine states plus the District of Columbia offer PFML, and four more have laws on the books that will take effect in 2026. The specifics of how both policies work can vary significantly by state, though they typically function by providing a weekly \"benefit payment\" that's a percentage of the worker's usual income during their leave.\nAlso, it's important to remember that though paid family leave does provide time off to care for a newborn, it doesn't always pertain to the pregnancy itself. This period falls under pregnancy leave, which is usually a combination of a worker's sick days, vacation days, holiday time, personal days, short-term disability coverage, and unpaid family leave time. In addition, paid medical leave doesn't cover the minor, temporary illnesses that \"sick days\" are traditionally used for, such as a bad cold or a bout of the flu.\nAs part of their paid family leave policies, four states also offer what's known as \"safe leave.\" Occasionally referred to as \"safe time,\" it refers to absence from work to address certain medical and non-medical needs that arise from situations such as domestic violence, harassment, stalking, or sexual assault.\nPFML vs. Other Leave\nPFML isn't the only type of time off from work. There are a number of other programs, some of which sound confusingly alike. It's important to be able to tell them apart and see which applies when time off is needed.\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 provides up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. The FMLA covers private-sector employers who have 50 or more employees, public agencies, and private or public elementary/secondary schools. Additionally, the FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 26 work weeks of leave in a \"single 12-month period\" to care for a covered military service member with a serious injury or illness.\nYes, it sounds a lot like PFML. The big difference is that the FMLA's leave is unpaid time off. Mandated\u2014but on your own dime.\nAlso, under the FMLA, employers are required to maintain workers\u2019 group health insurance under the same terms and conditions as if an employee had not taken leave and to give employees their jobs back at the end of their leave. Note that five of the states that have PFML policies offer the latter protection, and two offer it exclusively for family leave.\nPaid Sick Leave\nPFML shouldn't be confused with paid sick leave, which requires employers in certain states, cities, counties, and towns to provide paid leave for short-term health needs and preventive care.\nEighteen states have paid sick leave laws: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.\nFast Fact\nPennsylvania does not have a statewide paid sick leave policy, but three localities within the state do: Allegheny County, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.\nCovered Contracts\nState and municipal paid sick leave laws shouldn't be confused with an executive order signed by President Obama in 2015\u2014officially known as Paid Sick Leave, Executive Order 13706\u2014which requires companies with federal government \"covered contracts\" to provide paid sick leave to employees. Granted, both policies are otherwise fairly similar. For instance, both allow employees to earn paid sick leave hours in exchange for a certain amount of hours worked, and both offer job protection.\nPFML State-by-State Breakdown\nBelow is our analysis of the policies offered by each of the nine states (plus the District of Columbia) that offer PFML. Of the states that have PFML policies currently on the books, all nine are active as of January 2025.\nCalifornia\n- Status: Active\n- Percentage of Wages: 70-90% of a worker's average weekly wage\n- Maximum Weekly Benefit: Currently $1,681 (approximately 100% of the statewide average weekly wage)\n- Length of Benefits: Up to 52 weeks of medical leave for any period of disability and up to eight weeks of family leave in a 12-month period (California doesn't specify a cumulative limit)\n- Unpaid Waiting Period: One week (medical leave only)\nCalifornia offers both disability insurance (DI) and paid family leave (PFL). DI can be used for a serious off-the-job illness or injury. PFL can be used for bonding with a child within one year of their birth, foster placement, or adoption; caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or addressing certain military family needs.\nThese policies automatically apply to employees already covered by California unemployment insurance law, excluding most public-sector workers. Public-sector employers can opt into coverage, but this may require a negotiated agreement with an authorized bargaining unit. Domestic workers will be subject to a low minimum payment requirement.\nTo qualify, workers must have earned at least $300 (which may be income combined from more than one employer) during a base period of the first four of the five most recently completed quarters. Earlier quarters may be included if the worker was unemployed during at least part of the base period.\nCovered family members include the worker's child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse/registered domestic partner, or a parent of their spouse/registered domestic partner.

The base period is the first four of the five most recently completed quarters.\nCovered family members include the worker's child, parent, grandparent, spouse/registered domestic partner, or a parent of their spouse/registered domestic partner. Workers aren't entitled to have their job back at the end of their medical leave, though they are in the case of family leave.\nWashington\n- Status: Active\n- Percentage of Wages: 90% of a worker's average weekly wage (up to an amount equal to 50% of the statewide average weekly wage) and 50% of a worker's average weekly wage (above an amount equal to 50% of the statewide average weekly wage)\n- Maximum Weekly Benefit: Currently $1,542 (90% of the statewide average weekly wage)\n- Length of Benefits: Up to a maximum of 16 weeks in a 52-week period (up to 12 weeks each of medical leave and family leave); workers with certain pregnancy/childbirth-related health needs may receive up to two additional weeks of benefits\n- Unpaid Waiting Period: One week (medical and family leave, excluding bonding leave)\nPaid family leave in Washington can be used for bonding with a child within one year of their birth, foster care placement, or adoption; caring for a family member with a serious health condition; addressing certain military family needs; or following the death of a child in certain circumstances. Paid medical leave in Washington can be used for a worker's own serious health condition.\nThese policies automatically apply to all employees in the state of Washington. To qualify, workers must have worked for at least 820 hours (which may be hours combined from more than one employer) during a qualifying period of the first four of the five most recently completed quarters or the four most recently completed quarters.\nCovered family members include the worker's child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, child's spouse or domestic partner, spouse/registered domestic partner, or a parent-in-law or parent of their spouse/registered domestic partner. Workers are entitled to have their job back at the end of their medical leave, but only if they meet specific eligibility requirements similar to those of the FMLA.\nWhich States Offer Paid Family and Medical Leave?\nThe United States is one of only a handful of countries that do not offer paid family and medical leave (PFML) at the national level. In the absence of a federal law providing PFML, nine states (and the District of Columbia) now have it for their residents: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. In addition, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota have PFML laws that will go into effect in 2026.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Family Leave and Medical Leave?\nFamily leave, sometimes also known as \"family caregiver leave\" and \"family leave insurance,\" lets workers take time off to care for ill family members, bond with a new child, and, in some states, for what's known as \"safe leave,\" or \"safe time.\" This last is an absence from work to address needs that arise from domestic violence, harassment, stalking, or sexual assault.\nBy contrast, medical leave involves taking time off for your own serious illness or injury. It's also known as \"temporary disability insurance\" and \"short-term disability.\"\nWhat Does the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Provide for Workers?\nThe FMLA, signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected family and medical leave. The law covers private-sector employers who have 50 or more employees, public agencies, and private or public elementary/secondary schools. Also, eligible employees can take up to 26 work weeks of leave in one 12-month period to care for a covered military service member who has a serious injury or illness.\nThe Bottom Line\nUnlike the vast majority of nations, the U.S. does not provide paid family and medical leave to its workers. The Family and Medical Leave Act only provides unpaid time off. Since there is no federal legislation, a handful of states have passed their own PFML laws. Typically, they provide a weekly benefit that is a percentage of a worker's usual income during their leave. But otherwise, these policies vary significantly from state to state."

      "text": "Many traditional gender roles have disappeared but one gender-based distinction remains: the wage gap. Women earned about 84 cents in 2023 for every dollar men earned as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe Investopedia and REAL SIMPLE 2024 Her Money Mindset survey found that 54% of women surveyed said they were struggling to cover at least one monthly expense and 44% said they had just $250 or less after covering bills each month. Sixty percent of women had never asked for a raise and fewer than one in four women who had talked with their friends about money were transparent about how much they earned.\nWomen can take control of their incomes, however, and they can support other women who are doing the same. Individual actions can build barrier-busting wealth.\nKey Takeaways\n- The wage gap refers to the disparity in earnings between men and women in the workplace.\n- Societal factors play a significant role in perpetuating the wage gap.\n- Negotiation skills are crucial for women to achieve fair compensation and benefits.\n- Skills development and education can help bridge the wage gap.\n- Pay equity depends on improving workplace policies and practices.\nUnderstanding the Gender Wage Gap\nThe gender wage gap is the difference between what men and women earn. The most common way to analyze and express the gap is to measure the difference in median earnings of women versus men.\nCongress and state governments have passed several laws to address the gap. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits employers from paying men and women different wages for performing similar duties under similar conditions. The gender pay gap persists despite these efforts.\nWomen earned 71 cents for every dollar earned by men in the United States in 2023, according to a 2025 report released by the National Women's Law Center. The difference varies widely by region, however. California and Vermont have the smallest gaps where women earn 85 cents or more for every dollar earned by men. Women in Louisiana and Utah lag far behind, earning 71 and 73 cents respectively.\nSocietal Factors\nSociety has come a long way in treating men and women fairly but biases take generations to entirely disappear and women still face numerous challenges.\nGender Discrimination\nWomen generally have to work harder to gain equal recognition and women who advocate for more compensation or better treatment are often cast as troublesome or unaccommodating.\nRacial Discrimination\nThe wage gap is worse for many women of color than it is for White women. Black and Latina women earn median weekly pay of $978 and $844 respectively as of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to racial wage gap data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This compared with median weekly earnings of $1,094 for white women and $1,321 for white men.\nMotherhood\nHaving a baby also has a significant impact on a woman\u2019s earnings. Research from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that the gender pay gap within a couple doubles between two years before a child\u2019s birth and one year after. The wage gap continues to grow until the child is 10 years old, representing a massive loss of income over the mother\u2019s career.\nOccupational Segregation\nUnequal compensation for equal work is a core issue but access to equal work is also a primary driver. The National Partnership for Women and Families found that women made up 63.6% of the workforce in the 20 lowest-paying jobs in 2023 compared to only 30% of the workforce in the 20 highest-paying jobs.\nUnpaid Family Care\nWomen are more likely than men to take career breaks to care for aging or sick family members. Long breaks in employment can raise questions with prospective employers or cause women to lag behind industry trends and new skills, further depressing wages.\nImpact of Workplace Policies\nMany federal and state laws prohibit discrimination in pay but certain workplace conditions persist to prevent the gender wage gap from shrinking.\nSalary History\nSome states prohibit employers from asking prospective employees about their salary history and research has found that this ban has helped narrow the wage gap. Many companies work around this by asking applicants for pay expectations, however. This can lead to a perpetuation of women being underpaid if they don\u2019t feel comfortable asking for a higher salary.\nPay Transparency\nThe historical secrecy of salaries and its taboo nature as a topic of discussion have frequently left women in the dark about how large the gender wage gap is. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that pay transparency laws reduced the gap by 20% to 40%.\nIndividual vs. Group Salary Negotiations\nData also shows that women fare better with collectively negotiated compensation. Women in unions earn an average of 89.6% of their male counterparts\u2019 wages compared to non-unionized women earning 82% of their male counterparts\u2019 wages.\nImportant\nThe gender wage gap doesn\u2019t just lead to a smaller paycheck for women every two weeks. It has lifelong consequences. Female workers amass less wealth than their male counterparts and have less financial stability as they earn less during any given period.\nTalk About What You Earn\nReducing the gender wage gap is a complex problem but there are some ways in which women can help themselves and each other to reach wage parity with men.\nThe Investopedia and REAL SIMPLE 2024 Her Money Mindset survey found that only 15% of the women who talk about money with their friends will mention if they're asking for a raise or promotion and only 24% discuss how much they earn.\nDiscussing raises and salaries can be very beneficial for all parties involved and it can be a powerful tool. You can learn a lot by comparing notes: how often and how much people are negotiating in raises, what sort of salary and bonus structures are out there, and whether you're making less than market standards.\nFast Fact\nThirty-one percent of women who took the Her Money Mindset survey said they think it's important for women to talk to their friends about money.\nThe hardest part may be breaking the ice but you can bring up the issue by casually incorporating a financial topic into a conversation to get a pulse for how your friends feel. It also can be helpful to set ground rules such as agreeing to confidentiality.\nNegotiate Higher Compensation\nThe 2024 Her Money Mindset survey found that 60% of women have never asked for a raise and 69% have never requested a promotion. Women with higher household income levels were more likely to have asked for a raise or promotion.\n\u201cI don't think people realize the impact that the gender wealth gap can have on our lifetime earnings,\u201d says Gloria Carcia Cisneros, a certified financial planner and wealth manager at Lourd Murray. \u201cWhen you start with a lower base salary, it means that for all the subsequent pay increases, you are getting less than someone who is getting the same percentage increase but has negotiated higher pay from the beginning.\u201d\nShe also notes that companies expect candidates to negotiate. \u201cThe earlier the better. Make sure you start negotiating in your 20s and 30s to take advantage of the exponential growth.\u201d\nFast Fact\nInvestopedia and REAL SIMPLE's survey found that 30% of women in the millennial generation and younger have a goal to get a raise and/or promotion in the next three years.\nOne negotiating tip from Michelle Kruger, certified financial planner and senior financial planner at Gratus Capital, is using benefits as a tool for negotiating salary. \u201cBring cost differences like an increased health insurance premium or a lower 401(k) match to your potential new employer\u2019s attention,\u201d Kruger says. \u201cCalculate the value of the lost benefits to you and ask for a commensurate increase in the offer.\u201d\nConsider these key strategies when asking for a raise:\n- Prepare in advance: Collect data for comparable jobs at your company and in your industry. Plan the key points you want to make and be ready for pushback.\n- Be assertive: Treat your boss with respect but ensure that it\u2019s mutual and advocate for yourself.\n- Practice: Ask a friend to roleplay your boss and rehearse your talking points. Make sure they throw you some curveball questions.\n- Negotiate: Bosses often have budget constraints that limit how flexible they can be. Push for your desired salary but be ready to make concessions elsewhere such as additional paid time off or other benefits.\n- Time your request: Set yourself up for success by asking for a raise when it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll get a positive reaction. You'll face more resistance if your company just went through a round of layoffs or the economy is trending down.\nEnhance Your Skills and Education\nThe next step is to bolster what you can do at work by enhancing your skills or seeking further education. Learning new skills can help break down occupational segregation in many cases.\nOffice managers and executive assistants are often women, many of whom have extensive business experience and a wide range of abilities. They end up pigeonholed in administrative jobs, however, limiting their earning potential. They can advance their careers and shrink the wage gap by developing specialized skills in accounting, human resources, or project management.\nWomen have a range of options for building their skills and resumes:\n- Professional certifications: Professional certifications offer a concrete way to increase earning potential by demonstrating specific skills and qualifications to prospective employers.\n- Company-sponsored development: Many companies cover some or all of the costs of professional development courses. Everyone benefits because employees learn more skills and employers gain access to those skills.\n- Returning to school: Going back to college might seem daunting but ongoing education can fit any schedule with the proliferation of online learning. Finishing a degree or getting a new one can open up opportunities to earn more.\nBuild Wealth by Investing\nSetting money aside for investments can be hard when you\u2019re juggling multiple financial goals or just trying to make ends meet. Investing helps women close the wage gap in several ways, however.\nIt allows women more freedom to make career choices as they amass more wealth. Women can explore more lucrative opportunities and advance professionally when they're not tied to a job just to keep bills paid,\nMany types of investments don\u2019t just grow over time. They also generate income. Passive income can supplement wages from employment and increase overall wealth whether it\u2019s dividends from stocks or rent earned from real estate.\nA high-yield savings account can be a good option if you're just starting out. You\u2019ll see compounding gains from interest as time goes on. The money is FDIC-insured so there\u2019s no risk of loss. And it\u2019s easy to access if an emergency comes up and you need the funds. You can diversify into other investments as time goes on:\n- Index funds spread your money across groups of different stocks, insulating you from the risk of one company hurting your portfolio.\n- Individual stocks can perform well but require more research and active management.\n- Bonds are a relatively stable investment but they have smaller payoffs and take time to mature.\n- Crypto has the potential for large gains but the lack of regulation introduces significant risk.\n- Real estate often has a high cost of entry but it generates income over time.\nTip\nFinancial advisors generally recommend a diverse portfolio based on the investor\u2019s age. Younger investors can afford more risk. Older investors tend to move toward more stable choices like bonds.\nSupport Women in Leadership\nWomen made up 46.9% of the American workforce in 2024 but they remain underrepresented in the upper echelons of business. Only 10.6% of CEOs and 30.4% of board members at Fortune 500 companies are female. Breaking through the glass ceiling isn\u2019t easy, but it has an immense payoff.\nElise Awwad serves as DeVry University's president and CEO. She started her career with the company as an admissions advisor. Awwad says that while working her way up in the company, \u201cI recognized the need to support other women in the workplace...The male-dominated culture is still prevalent in many tech companies and can make women feel like they don\u2019t belong.\u201d\nShe established EDGE (Empowerment, Diversity, Growth, and Excellence) in 2019, a network of leadership scholars and professionals who promote the enhanced career experience and advancement of women in leadership roles at DeVry and in the broader community. She also spearheaded DeVry\u2019s Women+Tech Scholars program, created to \u201cempower women through mentorship, job search resources, credentialing, and scholarships, encouraging them to take the first step toward a tech-focused career.\u201d\nDebbie Sanders, COO of Visory Health, also notes the importance of advocacy and support for career advancement. \u201cLook for a mentor and look for positions and jobs where you feel supported and will be respected and compensated for the great ideas and hard work you put forth,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cGetting places in your career usually means not only do you need to excel at what you do but also have someone in an executive position to support you as internal politics increase.\u201d\nWhat Countries Have the Highest Gender Wage Gap?\nNot every country provides reliable wage data but Korea had the highest gender pay gap at 31.2% in 2022. The only other country above 25% was Israel at 25.4%, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nWhich Countries Have the Lowest Gender Wage Gap?\nBelgium\u2019s gender wage gap of 1.2% was the smallest in the world in 2022 based on the same OECD data. It's joined by four other countries under 5%: Costa Rica at 1.4%, Colombia at 1.9%, Bulgaria at 2.5%, and Norway at 4.5%.\nHow Has the Gender Pay Gap Changed Over Time?\nWomen made significant gains in the later part of the 20th century. Pew Research found that women\u2019s earnings relative to men\u2019s rose from 65% to 80% between 1982 and 2002. The gap remained relatively stable, hovering between 80% and 85%, over the next 20 years, however.\nResearchers haven't found evidence of any single factor causing the stagnation.\nThe Bottom Line\nThere\u2019s no quick solution to closing the gender wage gap and much of the struggle unfortunately involves deeply rooted cultural biases. Every woman has to advocate for herself by negotiating higher pay and building personal wealth. Women can fight collectively to empower their peers in leadership and lift each other up.\nSystemic change takes years but we can build a workforce where our daughters and granddaughters receive equal pay with our sons and grandsons through continued efforts for equality."

Once you\u2019ve maxed out the Roth IRA, turn to taxable accounts next.\u201d\nRelated Stories\nDon\u2019t Touch Your Investments\nGive your retirement savings 40-plus years to compound and grow. Here\u2019s why.\n\u201cIf a standard four-year athlete contributed $10,000 a year from age 18 to 22 and then never contributed again, at age 65, they\u2019d have accumulated over $1.3 million assuming an 8% rate of return,\u201d said Easton Price, a CFP at Prosperity Wealth Planning. \u201cNot too bad for getting $40,000 invested over four years when you\u2019re in college.\u201d\nConsider a Solo 401(k)\nUnder the new settlement, athletes are considered contractors for the university instead of employees\u2014though this status may change in the future as the Trump administration has requested clarification on this matter.\nTherefore, in the meantime, athletes may consider opening up a 401(k) for themselves.\n\u201cIf [you're] a contractor, then you have self-employment income and you can potentially open up a Solo 401(k), allowing you to reduce your tax bill but also save a lot of money,\u201d said Alex Caswell, a CFP and founder of Wealth Script Advisors.\nThe Bottom Line\nCurrent and former Division I players who expect to get paid due to the recent settlement\u2014which allows colleges to share revenue with athletes\u2014have a tremendous opportunity to slam-dunk their retirement savings.

Despite the persistent gender pay gap, which saw women earning about 83 cents for every dollar men earned in 2023, young women aged 25-34 are closing this gap, earning nearly equal to their male counterparts. Structural changes in the workforce, including legal reforms and shifts in labor market participation, are contributing to this evolving economic landscape for women.",
