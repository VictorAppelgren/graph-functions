  "description": "The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters says it's eliminating more than 500 employees.",
  "content": "Kari Lake, acting chief executive of Voice of America\u2019s oversight agency, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland in February.\n\nThe agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters is eliminating more than 500 employees, the Trump administration has announced, a move that could ratchet up a months-long legal challenge over the news outlets\u2019 fate.\n\nKari Lake, acting chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, VOA\u2019s oversight agency, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday, one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director.\n\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the Trump administration had failed to show how it was complying with his orders to restore VOA\u2019s operations. His order Monday gave the administration \u201cone final opportunity, short of a contempt trial,\u201d to demonstrate its compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by Sept. 15.\n\nOn Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be \u201cplainly contrary to law,\u201d according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by President Reagan.\n\nLake posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees. She said the agency \u201cwill continue to fulfill its statutory mission after this RIF \u2014 and will likely improve its ability to function.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America\u2019s voice is heard abroad where it matters most,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA group of agency employees who sued to block VOA\u2019s elimination said Lake\u2019s move would give their colleagues 30 days until their pay and benefits end.\n\n\u201cWe find Lake\u2019s continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any evidence of that.\u201d\n\nIn June, layoff notices were sent to more than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective Aug. 31.\n\nThe administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to send RIF notices to 486 employees of Voice of America and 46 other agency employees but intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said the global media agency had 137 \u201cactive employees\u201d and 62 other employees on administrative leave, while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others on administrative leave.\n\nLake\u2019s agency also oversees Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations designed to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism.\n\nKunzelman writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "- Share via\nSEOUL \u2014 In many parts of the world, convenience stores are the shops of last resort: cigarettes, sodas and laundry detergent. But in South Korea, you might find single malt whiskies, $800 French wines, 24K gold bars, shampoo and conditioner refill stations, televisions or a dine-in instant noodle bar with more than 200 varieties of ramyon.\nA customer might be able to pick up a package, wash and dry their clothes, or sign up for a new debit card.\nThe stores are best known for their numerous feats of \u201cinstant-izing\u201d food, a process in which nearly every conceivable dish is turned into a packaged meal: spaghetti, Japanese udon, fried rice that you squeeze out of a tube. These have turned convenience stores into a $25-billion industry in South Korea and those food products are churned out at a staggering pace: up to 70 new food items hit the shelves each week, effectively offering a live feed of South Korean tastes.\n\u201cIn South Korea\u2019s food retail market, you go extinct if you\u2019re not quick to change,\u201d says Chae Da-in, who says her obsession with convenience stores is decades old. \u201cIt\u2019s all about being diverse and fast.\u201d\nKnown in the national media and on social media as a \u201cconvenience store critic,\u201d Chae is the author of three books on the world of convenience store foods, which has led to TV appearances and newspaper interviews.\nEvery Friday, she tours a handful of convenience stores near her home to keep up with what\u2019s new. Over the last two decades, she estimates she has consumed at least 800 varieties of convenience store samgak gimbap \u2014 rice wrapped in dried seaweed and a grab-and-go staple.\nLee Hee Chul, 21, from Incheon, South Korea, cools down his ramyon in a DIY cone made from the ramyon bowl cover at a CU convenience store in a popular tourist area in Myeongdong.\nShoppers prepare their dinner at one of the self-serve machines in the dining area at a CU ramyon convenience store.\nIn recent years, Chae has watched her obsession go global. Much like South Korean movies, TV shows and music, South Korean convenience stores have become a cultural sensation.\nSpecific locations, such as the store that appeared in Netflix\u2019s hit series \u201cSquid Game,\u201d have made the news. On TikTok and YouTube, mukbang \u2014 videos of people eating \u2014 of South Korean convenience store foods have gathered millions of views.\n\u201cGiant cheese sausage,\u201d announces one reviewer in a TikTok video series titled \u201cONLY Eating Food from a Korean Convenience Store.\u201d The meal also includes blue lemonade that comes in a plastic pouch, a \u201c3XL\u201d spicy tuna mayo samgak gimbap and a carbonara-flavored Buldak (\u201cfire chicken\u201d) noodle cup.\nSouth Korean convenience stores are now expanding into nearby countries such as Mongolia or Malaysia. CU, one of the country\u2019s leading operators with more than 600 stores in Asia, is set to open its first U.S. location in Hawaii later this year.\n\u201cThe percentage of the Asian population in Hawaii is six times that of the mainland U.S., making it a place where there is a high level of familiarity and positive attitudes toward Korean culture,\u201d said Lim Hyung-geun, the head of overseas operations at BGF Retail, CU\u2019s parent company.\n\u201cOn top of that, we\u2019re seeing the sustained popularity of Korean culture, such as a Korean food boom among American teenagers and young people in their 20s and 30s, which we believe will be a big boost for CU\u2019s future expansion.\u201d\nLim calls CU\u2019s overseas locations \u201c\u2018miniature South Koreas\u2019 where people can experience the products that have become popular with the K-wave.\n\u201cBut as is the case here, K-convenience stores aren\u2019t just a place to experience South Korean culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also restaurants, cafes and a general amenity.\u201d\nIn other words, everything stores that are everywhere and open all the time.\n***\nLike many things South Korea has embraced and spun off into something novel, convenience stores are an import to the country. The first such store was American \u2014 the Southland Ice Co., which was founded in Texas in 1927 and changed its name to 7-Eleven in 1946. The first of the 7-Elevens opened for business in Seoul in the 1980s.\nToday, South Korea is the convenience store capital of the world. Like the bodegas of New York, they have become part of the fabric of contemporary urban life, multifunctional spaces that can be restaurants or coffee shops or bars with microwaves and outdoor seating. Chae calls them the \u201coasis of the streets.\u201d\n\u201cPeople hang out in convenience stores,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve become a social place.\u201d\nPart of what makes them such a force in the country is their sheer numbers.\nThere are around 55,000 convenience stores in South Korea \u2014 a country the size of Indiana \u2014 amounting to one convenience store for every 940 people. In Seoul, where their numbers have quadrupled in the last 15 years, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s one on every corner.\nMuch of this has to do with the fact that roughly one in every four workers in South Korea is self-employed, a high number relative to other developed countries. For those in this mom-and-pop economy, which includes older workers pushed into early retirement or others who have been boxed out of the traditional labor market, convenience stores offer the most accessible form of entrepreneurship.\n\u201cCompared to the hundreds of thousands it would cost to open another business, the main draw of convenience stores is that you can open one with starting capital as little as 20 million won [$14,000],\u201d said Oh Sang-bong, the head of social policy research at the Korean Labor Institute. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not easy. There are a lot of cautionary tales. But there are success stories, too.\u201d\n***\nThis profusion has made the convenience store business one of the most fast-paced and competitive in the country \u2014 one that moves in lockstep with boom-and-bust social media attention spans.\nHit products generate the kind of buzz you might see only for a limited-edition sneaker or the latest iPhone, necessitating preorders or, when inventories inevitably dry up, leading to scalping.\nBut the lows are abrupt. When it was first released last year, CU\u2019s \u201cDubai-style chocolate\u201d \u2014 an in-house take on the global TikTok food trend \u2014 commanded lines outside of stores and sold out in a day. Four months later, sales had dropped to a sixth of what they were.\n\u201cThe lifespan of products is now incredibly short because social media fads come and go so quickly,\u201d said Kim, a merchandiser for a leading convenience store franchise who asked to be identified only by his surname because he is not authorized to speak to the media.\n\u201cIn the past when the market wasn\u2019t so saturated, revenue would naturally rise as everyone opened more stores. But now there are so many stores, and then you\u2019re competing not just with other convenience stores but with e-commerce platforms, coffee shops, restaurants \u2014 everybody who\u2019s following the same trend.\u201d\nMost of Kim\u2019s job involves scrolling through social media platforms such as TikTok, looking for the next hot-ticket item, such as a distant food trend that shows signs of making landfall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s like trying to find the eye of a needle over and over again,\u201c he said. \u201cIf you miss something big and a competitor releases it first? Then you\u2019re getting chewed out by your boss.\u201d\nWine for sale at a 7-Eleven convenience store. Snacks display K-pop idols. This vending machine dispenses gold bars. Prepared foods and side dishes at a convenience store.. Stores sell ready-to-eat foods such as sausages, fishcakes, chicken and sweet treats like bread, jelly and desserts.\nKwon Sung-jun is a chef who specializes in Italian cuisine and the winner of \u201cCulinary Class Wars,\u201d a hit reality cooking competition released by Netflix last year. He has a ritual of stopping by a convenience store every night after work \u2014 even if he doesn\u2019t have anything to buy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful for staying abreast of any trends in the culinary world,\u201d he said, and his routine proved to be pivotal in winning the $223,000 prize for \u201cCulinary Class Wars.\u201d\nIn one stage of the competition, contestants were tasked with cooking a dish using ingredients sourced from a true-to-life replica of a convenience store on set. Kwon, 30, handily won with a chestnut tiramisu whipped together from chestnuts, milk, coffee and a package of biscuits.\n\u201cI came up with the idea in 30 seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I had a mental list of what convenience stores have, I also planned substitute options for each of the key ingredients like chestnut, cream and so on.\u201d\nSince winning the competition, he has avoided convenience stores; just two weeks after that episode aired, CU released a mass-produced version of his tiramisu, with Kwon\u2019s face on the packaging.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to see those photos of myself,\u201d he said.\n***\nAll of this makes running a convenience store no easy feat, says Kim Hye-ryeon, the 52-year-old owner of a GS25 in Seoul\u2019s Hongdae district.\nBecause franchisees are responsible for picking out their own inventory from the company catalog, which is updated three times a week, running a successful convenience store is less about the labor of stocking shelves and cashing out customers than keeping up with the frenetic cycle of food trends.\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a popular item, the owners who are a step ahead buy up all the stock so sometimes I can\u2019t get any for my store,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to know what\u2019s popular with young people at all times.\u201d\nIn recent years, as South Korea\u2019s cultural footprint has expanded, the assignment has gotten even more complicated. Streets that were once quiet are now popular thoroughfares for tourists staying in the guesthouses and Airbnbs that have opened in the area. Global tastes must be accounted for, too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a noticeable increase since the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, it was mostly Chinese or Japanese tourists, but now it\u2019s from all over, especially Americans and Europeans.\u201d\nFrom behind the counter, she has been keeping mental notes of what this international consumer base is buying, noting, for example, how her Muslim customers carefully study the labels to check whether the item is halal.\n\u201cMost of the tourists come looking for products related to Korean movies or TV shows like dalgona [a traditional Korean candy] because they saw it on \u2018Squid Game,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey also really like ice creams, especially bingsu [Korean shaved ice].\u201d"

      "text": "Chicago mayor defies Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown plan for the city\n- Share via\nThe mayor of Chicago struck back Saturday against what he called the \u201cout-of-control\u201d Trump administration\u2019s plan to surge federal officers into the nation\u2019s third-largest city, which could take place within days.\nThe Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order signed by Mayor Brandon Johnson.\nJohnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents \u201camidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.\u201d\nWhen asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably \u201ctaking orders,\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t take orders from the federal government.\u201d\nJohnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since President Trump launched his crackdown.\nThe federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\nThe officials described the immigration crackdown as part of a larger effort to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, as it did earlier this year in Los Angeles.\nOn Saturday, Trump commented about Chicago crime and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on his social media site: \u201cSix people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn\u2019t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we\u2019re coming! MAGA. President DJT\u201d\nUnlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, D.C., the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, the officials said.\nChicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country\u2019s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.\nJohnson\u2019s order builds on the city\u2019s longtime stance, saying neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and demanding Trump stand down on those plans.\nThe mayor had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing the president of \u201cbehaving outside the bounds of the Constitution\u201d and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.\n\u201cHe is reckless and out of control,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest threat to our democracy that we\u2019ve experienced in the history of our country.\u201d\nIn response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was about \u201ccracking down on crime.\u201d\n\u201cIf these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.\nCritics have noted that Trump, while espousing a tough-on-crime push, is the only felon ever to occupy the White House.\nBeck writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 unaccompanied migrant children, senator says\n- Share via\n- Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called on the government to halt the deportation plans.\n- The removals would violate the Office of Refugee Resettlement\u2019s long-established practice of protecting such children, Wyden said.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. without their parents, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and the Central American country said it was ready to take them in.\nThe removals would violate the Office of Refugee Resettlement\u2019s \u201cchild welfare mandate and this country\u2019s long-established obligation to these children,\u201d Wyden told Angie Salazar, acting director of the office within the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for migrant children who arrive in the U.S. alone.\n\u201cThis move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,\u201d the Democratic senator wrote, asking for the deportation plans to be terminated.\nUndocumented parents are preparing for the worst in response to the L.A. immigration raids. Bracing for potential deportation, they\u2019re making emergency care plans for their kids.\nIt is another step in the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to surge officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.\nGuatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Mart\u00ednez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived unaccompanied to the United States and are being held in U.S. facilities.\nGuatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could age out of the facilities for children and be sent to adult detention centers, he said. The exact number of children to be returned remains in flux, but they are currently discussing a little over 600. He said no date has been set yet for their return.\nThat would be almost double what Guatemala previously agreed to. The head of the country\u2019s immigration service said last month that the government was looking to repatriate 341 unaccompanied minors who were being held in U.S. facilities.\nA federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration\u2019s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the United States.\n\u201cThe idea is to bring them back before they reach 18 years old so that they are not taken to an adult detention center,\u201d Guatemala Immigration Institute Director Danilo Rivera said at the time. He said it would be done at Guatemala\u2019s expense and would be a form of voluntary return.\nThe plan was announced by President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, who said then that the government had a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.\nThe White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest move, which was first reported by CNN.\nQuoting unidentified whistleblowers, Wyden\u2019s letter said children who do not have a parent or legal guardian as a sponsor or who don\u2019t have an asylum case already underway \u201cwill be forcibly removed from the country.\u201d\nThe idea of repatriating such a large number of children to their home country also raised concerns with activists who work with children navigating the immigration process.\n\u201cWe are outraged by the Trump administration\u2019s renewed assault on the rights of immigrant children,\u201d said Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \u201cWe are not fooled by their attempt to mask these efforts as mere \u2018repatriations.\u2019 This is yet another calculated attempt to sever what little due process remains in the immigration system.\u201d\nSantana, Seitz and Gonzalez write for the Associated Press. Gonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas. AP writers Sonia P\u00e9rez D. in Guatemala City and Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis contributed to this report."
