  "description": "Russia Signals Pipeline Deal as Xi, Putin Deepen Ties",
  "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and Indian PM Narendra modi presenting a united front at China's annual security summit. Joining us now is Bloomberg's Minmin Low. Welcome to the program. Just walk us through what's been happening over the past day or so. Yeah. Today Putin and he had a meeting and it was one that came with a lot of breakthroughs because the big deal that was signed was between Gazprom, which is Russia's state owned company, and China agreeing to build this power of Siberia to pipeline, which would help to divert a lot of the gas pipeline sales to Europe, Europe to China instead. And that would help the company recoup about 30% of those gas pipeline that was diverted that was that used to be sold to Europe, to China. So a very important breakthrough because this was something that has been under discussion for many, many years. Presidency and China had been reluctant to sign onto the deal because they didn't see it as urgent to continue to step up gas purchases from Russia. They didn't want to over rely on Russia as well. And this deal coming as President Trump has been threatening more tariffs on China if it continues to buy Russian oil. Interestingly, we see the same thing with Modi as well. Modi's, India's largest state owned company, oil company, saying it will continue to buy every single drop of Russian oil available as long as it remains economical. Really a slap in the face for President Trump and perhaps showing that Trump's additional tariffs to punish India is in some ways backfiring.",

The agreement, long debated, comes amid U.S. tariff threats against China for buying Russian oil and India\u2019s commitment to purchase Russian oil as long as it remains economical. The deal signals deepening ties between Xi, Putin, and Modi, potentially undermining U.S. efforts to curb Russian energy influence.",
