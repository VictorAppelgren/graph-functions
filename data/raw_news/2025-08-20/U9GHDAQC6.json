  "description": "As promised, a new Gemini-powered assistant will replace Google Assistant in the coming weeks and months.",
  "content": "We already knew that Google Assistant was soon to be replaced by a \u201cnew experience powered by Gemini.\u201d Now we know what that new experience will be called, and when it\u2019s arriving.\n\nGemini for Home is the name of the new Gemini-powered voice assistant for Google smart speakers and displays, including the current Nest Audio, Nest Mini, Nest Hub, and Nest Hub Max.\n\n\u201cEarly access\u201d to Gemini for Home kicks off in October, Google announced in a blog post Wednesday, with both free and paid versions available. Google didn\u2019t say how much the paid version of Gemini for Home will cost.\n\nGoogle had already been experimenting with Gemini on its Nest speakers over the past several months. It\u2019s not clear if the just-announced Gemini for Home is an iteration of that effort or an entirely new assistant, but whatever it is, it\u2019s coming soon.\n\nAmong Gemini for Home\u2019s broad capabilities are many of the same features we\u2019ve seen in Alexa+, Amazon\u2019s own take on an advanced AI-powered assistant for the home.\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to ask Gemini for Home (you\u2019ll still use the \u201cHey Google\u201d wake word) to \u201cplay the song-of-the-year winner from 1990\u201d or \u201cplay that song from this year\u2019s summer blockbuster about race cars,\u201d and the assistant should be able to suss out which track you\u2019re thinking about, Google says\u2014same as what Alexa+ can do (or should do, anyway).\n\nGemini for Home will also be able to decipher more complex smart home commands, such as \u201cdim the lights, and set the temp to 72 degrees,\u201d as well as manage calendars, lists, and timers from natural-language voice prompts (\u201cadd the ingredients to make an authentic Italian lasagna to my shopping list\u201d).\n\nBesides smart home commands, you\u2019ll also be able to launch chats with Gemini via Google Live, which promises \u201cnatural back-and-forth discussion\u201d without the need of saying \u201cHey Google\u201d over and over. For example, you\u2019ll be able to ask for help with a recipe, troubleshoot a busted dishwasher, or request a bedtime story for a youngster.\n\nAgain, this should all sound familiar to anyone who\u2019s been following Amazon\u2019s Alexa+, which has been very slowly rolling out over the past several months.\n\nLike Google for Home soon will be, Alexa+ is currently in an early access period, and it allows for more back-and-forth discussion, more natural-language smart home commands (\u201cAlexa, make it brighter in here\u201d), help finding obscure music tracks, and providing assistance in the kitchen.\n\nAlexa+ is free during its early preview, but will eventually cost $20 a month, while Prime members will get Alexa+ included with their various Prime benefits. The \u201cclassic\u201d Alexa will remain completely free, Amazon has said.\n\nAgain, Google has yet to say how much the paid version of Google at Home will cost, or how it will differ from the free version.\n\nThis news story is part of TechHive\u2019s in-depth coverage of the best smart speakers.",

      "text": "The writing was already on the wall, but now it\u2019s official: The Google Assistant era is over.\nIn a blog post Friday, Google announced plans for Google Assistant\u2019s final phase-out, starting on mobile and continuing with tablets, cars, and mobile-connected devices such as headphones and tablets. Finally, Google Assistant will be going away on Nest smart speakers and displays as well as on Google TV devices.\nGoogle Assistant\u2019s replacement will, of course, be Gemini, Google\u2019s entry in the generative AI race. Gemini itself will become the new assistant on Google mobile devices such as phones and tablets, while a \u201cnew experience powered by Gemini\u201d is coming to smart speakers and displays.\nThe hand-off will occur \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Google said, with Google Assistant to get yanked from mobile devices and app stores \u201clater this year.\u201d Meanwhile, Google Assistant will \u201ccontinue to operate\u201d on Nest speakers and displays as well as Google TV devices until the new Gemini-powered \u201cexperience\u201d arrives, Google added.\nGemini is already well on its way to taking the place of Google Assistant on Google\u2019s mobile lineup, where it\u2019s become the de facto voice assistant, although vestiges of Google Assistant still remain.\nGemini\u2019s arrival on Google\u2019s lineup of smart devices has been more tentative. Last November, an extension to the Gemini app gave the LLM direct if limited control of Google Home-connected smart devices for the first time. Originally available only in Google\u2019s public preview program, the extension has since gone into wide release.\nBy December, Gemini began making its way onto Google\u2019s Nest speakers, namely the Nest Audio and Nest Mini, starting once again with Google\u2019s public preview program, and only for those subscribed to a paid Nest Aware plan. As of now, access to Gemini on Nest speakers remains quite limited, meaning the vast majority of us Nest device users are still chatting with Google Assistant.\nFirst introduced alongside the very first Google Home speaker, Google Assistant originally made its debut in 2016, a couple of years after Alexa arrived five years after Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant. Google Assistant eventually landed on most of Google\u2019s prime devices, including phones, tablets, watches, and\u2014of course\u2014smart speakers.\nBut with the explosive growth of generative AI and the arrival of Google\u2019s Gemini, Google Assistant\u2019s role in Google\u2019s product line quickly receded. Soon, it was no longer of whether Google Assistant would go away, but when.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is upgrading Alexa with Alexa+, an all-new version of Alexa powered by a blend of LLMs. Alexa+, which will be free for Prime subscribers and $19.99 a month for everyone else, is slated to make its debut later this month. The \u201cclassic\u201d Alexa will stick around, and it will remain free.\nThen there\u2019s Apple, which had a rough week after news broke that Siri\u2019s big AI-makeover has been delayed."

      "text": "\u201cAlexa,\u201d I asked the Echo display in my kitchen, \u201cwhat was that song from The Hills? You know, that MTV show? Can you play it on the Echo Show in the office?\u201d\nThe old Alexa wouldn\u2019t have had a prayer of answering such a poorly worded query. (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know that,\u201d would have been the likely reply.) But the new Alexa+, now packing AI-enhanced smarts, handled it easily.\n\u201cPlaying \u2018Unwritten\u2019 by Natasha Bedingfield,\u201d Alexa said after a beat of thought\u2014and yes, right answer! Let the MTV nostalgia trip begin.\nWell, almost\u2014instead of \u201cUnwritten,\u201d Alexa teed up Natasha Bedingfield\u2019s \u201cStrip Me,\u201d and it did so on Deezer rather than Apple Music, which is my default music streamer on Alexa.\n\u201cUh, wrong one,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you play that tune from The Hills on Apple Music?\u201d Another beat, and this time, success: sure enough, there was the familiar theme from a show I wasted too many hours watching.\nNo, the new Alexa isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s still pretty dang good, and a fair bit better than I was expecting. In fact, Alexa+\u2019s Natasha Bedingfield mishap was one of the few I experienced during my short time with the new, AI-enhanced voice assistant.\nStill in an invite-only \u201cearly access\u201d preview and free for everyone (it will eventually be free for Prime members and $19.99 a month for everyone else), Alexa+ turns out to be much more capable and intelligent than before, controlling my smart home devices, queuing up music, fielding my weather questions, and generally doing my bidding with only a handful of flubbed responses.\nI received my Alexa+ invite barely a day ago, and the revamped assistant is still essentially in beta, so what follows isn\u2019t a formal review; instead, it\u2019s a smattering of hands-on impressions gleaned from several hours of testing.\nMany of Alexa+\u2019s promised features and integrations still aren\u2019t ready for prime time; for example, you can\u2019t order groceries with your voice or takeout from Grubhub, nor can you schedule spa visits or jump to a favorite scene on a Fire TV. There are also several third-party skills that don\u2019t work with Alexa+ yet.\nThat said, you can call an Uber with Alexa+ (I haven\u2019t tried that yet), as well as make dinner reservations that don\u2019t require a credit card (Amazon is working on that credit card issue, I\u2019m told). Alexa+ is also surprisingly adept at taking charge of smart home devices, despite her still-shaky support for skills.\n\u201cAlexa,\u201d I said, \u201cthe lounge carpet downstairs is dirty. Can you clean it?\u201d Boom! Here comes my Roomba, dutifully vacuuming up the designated rug. \u201cActually, you can send it back to its charging station,\u201d I added, and the Roomba stopped and made a beeline back to its charging dock.\nHow about smart lights? \u201cAlexa, can you make it darker in here,\u201d I asked, directing my question to the Echo Dot in my office. Bum-bum! With a simple pair of tones, Alexa+ dimmed the lights in my office, without my having to specify the room. \u201cAlexa, turn the filament bulb in the office on,\u201d I added, and Alexa+ did, all without reprimanding me for not calling it the \u201cHue filament bulb,\u201d as it\u2019s listed in the Alexa app. Finally, \u201cAlexa, make it brighter in here\u201d put the office lights back on their originally brightness setting. Nice.\nBen Patterson/Foundry\nNext, I tried some random questions. \u201cCan you give me a rundown of key plays in the last Yankees game,\u201d I asked. The answer? \u201cThe Cubs won 4-1, with key plays including Shota Imanaga\u2019s seven-inning performance striking out Aaron Judge twice. Dansby Swanson hit a two-run homer in the 6th, and Seiya Suzuki scored from second on an infield hit in the 7th.\u201d How did the Yankees do overall in that game? \u201cThe Yankees struggled overall in their last game against the Cubs. They managed only two hits and three baserunners, resulting in a 4-1 loss.\u201d You can say that again.\nWhile Alexa+ may have flubbed its attempt to play the correct Natasha Benningfield song earlier, I was impressed that it fished out the right track name from my mangled query, and I was also able to move tunes from one Echo speaker to another with ease: \u201cAlexa, moves the kitchen tunes to the office,\u201d or \u201cAdd the kitchen music to the bedroom.\u201d No problems there.\nWhat about the weather\u2014or better yet, what should I be wearing on this sweltering day in Brooklyn? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be warm and humid today in Brooklyn, with temperatures in the mid- to upper-80s. For comfort, wear light, breathable clothing like a t-shirt and shorts. Don\u2019t forget sunscreen and a hat to protect from the sun,\u201d Alexa wisely told me.\nThings got a little rockier when I asked Alexa to plan a night out for my wife and me. Asked what concerts are happening in New York tonight (Alexa+ has a Ticketmaster integration), Alexa said it couldn\u2019t find anything. I asked again (\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s not anything at all,\u201d) and Alexa did find a Gin Blossoms concert in nearby Huntington, NY\u2014a bit of a hike from Brooklyn, but OK.\nHow about dinner reservations before the concert? Alexa suggested Peter Lugar\u2019s at 5:30, followed by an Uber ride to the show, but I pointed out that the hour-plus drive to Huntington for the 7:30 pm curtain wouldn\u2019t leave us much time to eat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, that dinner window is tighter than a pair of hipster jeans,\u201d Alexa joked. (Don\u2019t quit your day job, Alexa.) \u201cLet\u2019s adjust the plan. How about dinner at 5 PM, then Uber to Huntington by 6:15 PM? That gives you 45 minutes to eat and still arrive by 7 PM for the 7:30 PM concert.\u201d Still a pretty tight window, but fine.\nI didn\u2019t actually book anything during my short Alexa+ test, but I certainly could have, given Alexa+\u2019s integrations with Open Table, Ticketmaster, and Uber. Indeed, that\u2019s one of the big promises Amazon has made about Alexa+: that it will\u2013eventually\u2013be able to help plan your evenings or trips, as well as book them, all via voice commands.\nI wrapped up the day\u2019s testing with something in the kitchen. \u201cAlexa, I need a quick recipe for vinaigrette dressing. Can you whip one up for me? Give me the steps one at a time\u2014oh, and I don\u2019t have red wine vinegar, but I do have mustard, olive oil, and balsamic.\u201d And just as I asked, Alexa doled out the instructions, one step at a time: \u201cIn a small bowl, add 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar\u2026.\u201d\nI should note that I performed most of my Alexa+ testing on an Echo Show 8 display, but it also worked on a fifth-generation Echo Dot, the second-generation Echo Show 5, an Echo Show with Clock, and even my Echo Frames, meaning I could chat with Alexa+ while cruising around the house or even out in the world.\nSo, overall? What I\u2019ve seen and heard so far, I\u2019ve liked\u2014so much so, that I might actually start using my Echo devices regularly again.\nBut will Alexa+ deliver on Amazon\u2019s lofty promises of an AI agent who can act on your behalf? And will Alexa+ actually be worth paying for? That all remains to be seen.\nThis story is part of TechHive\u2019s in-depth coverage of the best smart speakers."

      "text": "Gemini for Home: Your household\u2019s new, more helpful assistant\nHome is where we connect with family, manage daily routines and unwind. Nearly a decade ago the Google Assistant pioneered the role of a helpful voice in the home, introducing millions to the convenience of managing simple tasks and getting quick answers, hands-free. Now, we\u2019re introducing an all-new voice assistant for the next generation of help at home: Gemini for Home.\nGemini has already transformed expectations of what an AI assistant is capable of on our mobile devices. It provides direct access to Google's most advanced AI \u2014 ready to brainstorm, problem-solve and create alongside you for virtually any topic imaginable. Gemini for Home is built on the same powerful AI models, with unique capabilities designed for the home. It offers reliable, hands-free help and can manage complex tasks across all of your home devices, assisting every member of your household, as well as visitors and guests.\nGemini for Home: An all-new, more powerful assistant\nGemini for Home uses the advanced reasoning, inference and search capabilities of our most capable models, making it both more powerful and easier to use than Google Assistant. You still say \u201cHey Google\u201d to get started, but your interactions will feel fundamentally new. Gemini will understand the context and get it done, and we\u2019re replacing rigid commands so you can use more nuanced or complex requests, too.\nHere are a few ways Gemini for Home is better at assisting with daily tasks:\n- Discover and play media: Ask Gemini to \u201cplay the song of the year winner from 1990\u201d or \u201cplay that song from this year's summer blockbuster about race cars\u201d and it will help you find and play what you\u2019re looking for from across multiple streaming platforms.\n- Access more powerful smart home controls: Conveniently issue multiple commands at once to control your home. \u201cDim the lights, and set the temp to 72 degrees.\u201d Gemini can also reason through complex commands, so you can say things like \u201cturn off the lights everywhere except my bedroom.\u201d\n- Coordinate your home and family life: Improved natural language support for calendar creation, list creation and timers means you can keep everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 on track. Try \u201cadd the ingredients to make an authentic Italian lasagna to my shopping list\u201d or \u201cset a timer for perfectly blanched broccoli.\u201d You can also ask Gemini to create a calendar event for the season premiere of your favorite show, and it will show up in your Google calendar.\n- Ask about anything: With Gemini at the core, you quickly get answers tailored to your specific needs on an endless number of topics. You can ask \u201chow can I keep raccoons out of my backyard at night?\u201d or \u201cgiven weather, crowds and hotel prices, what\u2019s the best time of year to visit the Greek islands?\u201d\nGemini Live: Expert advice in your home\nGemini Live is now coming to your home. With its intuitive conversational capabilities, it\u2019s easy to get detailed, personalized and expert help with whatever you\u2019re working on. Kick off a Gemini Live conversation with \u201cHey Google, let\u2019s chat\u201d and from that point on, have a natural back-and-forth discussion (no more \u201cHey Google\u201d required). Explore new concepts, learn a skill, brainstorm ideas or get personalized advice. You can also interrupt responses to refine or redirect the discussion, so you get the specific information you\u2019re looking for quickly.\n- Get help in the kitchen: Gemini Live provides better help for more complex cooking challenges, like \u201cI have spinach, eggs, cream cheese and smoked salmon in the fridge. Help me make a delicious meal.\u201d Gemini Live offers suggestions for florentine eggs, a frittata and pasta, along with directions on how to make them. Ask for tips as you continue to cook, like \u201chow do I know the pan is hot enough?\u201d or \u201chow do I ensure my eggs are fluffy?\u201d\n- Explore topics in-depth: Explore, understand and ask follow up questions about complex topics with Gemini\u2019s help: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about buying a new car\u2026\u201d. Or get in-depth information, specific to your needs: \u201cHelp me come up with a nutrition plan for the week leading up to my first marathon.\u201d\n- Request personalized troubleshooting: Combined with the power of Google Search, Gemini Live can provide in-the-moment help with challenges. \u201cMy dishwasher isn\u2019t draining. Can you walk me through some simple troubleshooting steps to see if I can fix it on my own?\u201d\n- Ask for a creative collaborator: Gemini\u2019s generative AI capabilities make it the perfect creative partner for any moment: \u201cLet\u2019s create a bedtime story for my 6 year old daughter.\u201d Personalize it for you \u201cthe main character is a scientist, who is also a princess, and loves corn!\u201d Brainstorm together \u201cour protagonist needs a furry side-kick. Give me some options.\u201d\nOver time, Gemini for Home will replace Google Assistant on existing speakers and displays, with free and paid versions. We will begin early access in October and share more details soon."

      "text": "A smart speaker makes for an easy first step into smart home technology. Before you kit out your house with thousands of dollars of lighting and security upgrades, you can familiarize yourself with voice-assistant technology while enjoying music, podcasts, and news in a hands-free home environment.\nHere are our top picks in several categories. If you want information about smart speakers in addition to our top recommendations, scroll down the page to read our in-depth buyers\u2019 guide.\nAmazon Echo Spot (2024) \u2013 Best smart speaker for most people\nPros\n- Ultrasonic motion detection can trigger Alexa routines\n- Bright, easy-to-read display\n- Can be used as a home intercom (with other Echo speakers)\nCons\n- No camera\n- Can\u2019t stream video, photos, or security camera feeds\n- Not great for music listening\nWho should buy the Amazon Echo Spot (2024)?\nAlexa is the most popular voice assistant, and the 2024 edition of the Echo Pop is the best value in Amazon\u2019s smart speaker lineup. While it\u2019s not a true smart display, it is equipped with a touchscreen that can display the time, date, weather conditions, and other information. It can also show album art while streaming music (not that we recommend this speaker for that task). It\u2019s also the smartest alarm clock you could hope for, capable of controlling your entire smart home.\nDue to its great range of features and affordability, the Amazon Echo Spot is an excellent all-around option for most people. Its versatility makes it the perfect nightstand accessory or even a full-featured smart home controller.\nAmazon Echo Spot (2024): Further considerations\nThere are less-expensive Echo smart speakers in Amazon\u2019s stable, so if this is a bit out of your budget you may prefer to opt for one of those models. Alternatively, you\u2019ll be well rewarded for spending a little more to step up to the 2024 edition of the Echo Pop if you can afford it.\nThe relatively poor audio quality when playing music means that it isn\u2019t the best model for audiophiles.\nRead our full Amazon Echo Spot (2024) review\nGoogle Nest Mini \u2013 Best smart speaker for most people, runner-up\nPros\n- Improved sound quality\n- Google Assistant rarely gets stumped\n- Works great with other Nest devices\nCons\n- Capacitive buttons are easy to miss\n- Sound quality still isn\u2019t that great\n- No cable management to go with the new mounting hole\nWho should buy the Google Nest Mini?\nGoogle Nest Mini smart speaker is capable, easy to use, and whip-smart thanks to Google Assistant. The affordability of the Nest Mini not only makes it a great option for those on a budget but it also means that you can buy more than one to place around your house if you\u2019re so inclined.\nThe Google Nest Mini has an attractively low profile. In addition to supporting all Google apps, the speaker gives a user voice control for YouTube Music, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, iHeart Radio, Deezer, and SiriusXM. Android users who depend on Google Assistant on their smartphones will appreciate being able to use the same commands with the Nest Mini.\nGoogle Nest Mini: Further considerations\nThis small yet clever smart speaker is extremely affordable at just $49, which makes adding one (or another one, or yet another one) to your home a realistic prospect.\nThe sound quality isn\u2019t much to write home about, though, and while Google Assistant offers better answers to general questions, Amazon\u2019s Alexa devices are more suitable for full smart-home control.\nRead our full Google Nest Mini review\nApple HomePod mini \u2013 Best smart speaker in the Apple HomeKit ecosystem\nPros\n- Impressive audio quality for its size\n- Easy setup\n- Temperature and humidity sensor was recently added, along with sound recognition for smoke alarms\nCons\n- No physical mic mute control\n- Supports third-party music services, but only a few are on board\n- Still pricey\nWho should buy the Apple HomePod mini?\nApple has significantly polished the smart home experience for users who own devices that support its HomeKit ecosystem. The Apple HomePod mini offers the best audio quality in the small smart speaker category, a feature that goes a long way to justifying its higher price when compared to the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Nest Mini.\nThe Apple HomePod mini offers native support for Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Deezer, making it a solid choice for audio playback, especially when creating a stereo pair with a second HomePod mini. AirPlay 2 support allows you to stream Spotify, Tidal or Qobuz from another Apple device. Apple users who have invested in HomeKit-compatible smart home devices will appreciate the HomePod mini\u2019s ability to control their home setup.\nApple HomePod mini: Further considerations\nAs is the case with all Apple products, it\u2019s pricey. You\u2019ll likely want to have additional Apple products or be an Apple-devotee to justify this over offerings from Google or Amazon. However, the sound quality is impressive and some nifty extra features help it stand out.\nAs for the larger HomePod (2nd Gen), that Apple shipped in 2023, we think it\u2019s still too expensive for what it has to offer.\nRead our full Apple HomePod Mini review\nAmazon Echo Dot (5th gen) \u2013 Best budget-priced smart speaker\nPros\n- A very inexpensive voice-powered smart home controller\n- Very good audio reproduction\n- Pretty industrial design\nCons\n- Still not recommended for critical music listening\n- Google Nest Mini offers tighter integration with Android smartphones\nWho should buy the Amazon Echo Dot (5th gen)?\nThe Amazon Echo Dot (5th gen) offers all the same features as our top pick, minus the display, at a lower price. This makes it the perfect option for those on a budget or those looking to put multiple Alexa-compatible speakers around the home\u2014the savings can add up when deploying speakers in locations where you don\u2019t care about seeing the time or temperature.\nUsers who are looking for a cheap smart-home controller will also find that the Echo Dot is the most affordable, worthwhile option.\nAmazon Echo Dot (5th gen): Further considerations\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid smart speaker at the lowest possible price, the Amazon Echo Dot (5th gen) lists for $15 less than the Amazon Echo Dot (5th gen) with clock. However, if you prefer to have a screen included than opting for our top pick, the Echo Spot, is the best option.\nJust like the Spot however, the Echo Dot leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to listening to music. Also, Android smartphone users may want to check out the Google Nest Mini which provides better integration with Android devices.\nSonos Era 100 \u2013 Best smart speaker for music\nPros\n- Honest, full bodied, stress-free sound\n- Unusually well carved bass, natural-sounding mids, and whistle-clean highs\n- A great smart speaker with either Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice\nCons\n- No support for Google Assistant\n- You might need two to fill your listening space\n- Lacks the channel preset buttons found on some competing speakers\nWho should buy the Sonos Era 100?\nMusic lovers will want to note that the Sonos Era 100 delivers spectacular audio with a very small footprint, and the speaker supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.\nOne Sonos Era 100 speaker offers outstanding sound, but invest in a pair and you\u2019ll get outstanding stereo sound at a significantly lower cost than the B&W Zeppelin. If you want to create a multi-room audio setup, Sonos delivers an unparalleled experience. The platform that popularized seamless home audio has yet to be matched.\nSonos Era 100: Further considerations\nAlong with the speaker, you get access to the manufacturer\u2019s own Sonos Voice digital assistant but can use Amazon Alexa if you prefer. Like all Sonos speakers, you can control playback with the company\u2019s outstanding mobile app.\nAlso, while the Era 100 packs a punch, it\u2019s really only meant for smaller spaces. If you have a larger room, you may want to consider purchasing multiple to fill the space.\nRead our full Sonos Era 100 review\nSonos Era 300 \u2013 Best smart speaker for spatial audio\nPros\n- Dramatic, embracing, and exotic sound from a shockingly small package\n- A great smart speaker with Amazon Alexa and Sonos Voice\n- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity\nCons\n- Doesn\u2019t support Google Assistant\n- Trueplay Advanced Tuning depends on an iOS device; cross-platform Quick Tune isn\u2019t as effective\nWho should buy the Sonos Era 300?\nSonos adds support for Dolby Atmos surround sound for users who want a more immersive experience. It still delivers the same excellent smart speaker experience as the Sonos Era 100 and similarly outstanding two-channel sound in a stereo pair. The difference lies in the intended uses: The Sonos Era 300 is better suited as an entertainment speaker for TV, movies, and games. Users who need a smart speaker for these purposes should look no further.\nMovie lovers can also use the Sonos Era 300 as surround speakers with a Sonos soundbar.\nSonos Era 300: Further considerations\nTo appreciate the Sonos Era 300\u2019s immersive audio, you\u2019ll need to subscribe to a streaming service that supports Dolby Atmos. Apple Music, Amazon Music HD, and Tidal subscribers will be able to enjoy these speakers, but Spotify users may want to opt for the less-expensive Sonos Era 100.\nRead our full Sonos Era 300 review\nAmazon Echo Studio \u2013 Best smart speaker for spatial audio, runner-up\nPros\n- Great audio performance for the money\n- Supports 3D audio (Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio)\n- Can be paired with Amazon\u2019s inexpensive subwoofer and/or a second Studio for stereo\nCons\n- Lack of Z-Wave support weakens its abilities as a smart home hub\n- You must subscribe to Amazon Music to get 3D audio\n- Speaker enclosure is insufficiently isolated from the surface it\u2019s placed on\nWho should buy the Amazon Echo Studio?\nThe Amazon Echo Studio speaker offers excellent spatial audio support for Amazon Music HD and sounds even better with a second speaker for a stereo pair. The speaker can do double duty as a Zigbee smart home hub. Two can be paired for stereo, and if you crave deep bass, you can add Amazon\u2019s beefy Echo Sub to the mix (actually, you can add an Echo Sub to many Amazon Echo models).\nUsers who prefer Amazon\u2019s Alexa or have already bought in and need a higher-quality speaker option will find that the Echo Studio is a great option.\nAmazon Echo Studio: Further considerations\nAmazon has limited immersive audio support to its Amazon Music HD service, so you\u2019ll need to have a full commitment to the Amazon ecosystem to take advantage of the Echo Studio. Amazon Music HD competes with Tidal, Qobuz, and Apple Music on the top tier of music streaming services (and costs less!), so the service is worth a look if you\u2019re already an Alexa user and want a higher-quality speaker option.\nRead our full Amazon Echo Studio review\nSonos Move 2 \u2013 Best-sounding portable smart speaker\nPros\n- Excellent audio performance\u2014in stereo!\n- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity\u2014simultaneously!\n- Incredibly long battery life\nCons\n- Still no support for hi-res Bluetooth codecs\n- Still best described as luggable\n- $50 more expensive than the already pricey original\nWho should buy the Sonos Move 2?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a speaker to use in the backyard or something you can pack in the car for a trip to a vacation spot, then the superior audio quality makes the luggable Sonos Move 2 worth the upgrade over the truly portable Sonos Roam. If you use Apple Music, Amazon Music, or Deezer to stream your tunes, you\u2019ll appreciate the ability to use those services with either Alexa or Sonos Voice Control.\nSonos Move 2: Further considerations\nThe Sonos Move 2 offers true stereo audio and exceptional battery life, but that comes at a cost. The speaker weighs more than 6 pounds and won\u2019t really fit into a small bag. That said, the impressive sound stage and support for simultaneous Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections make this heavy speaker worth the extra effort.\nRead our full Sonos Move 2 review\nJBL Authentics 300 \u2013 Best-sounding portable smart speaker, runner-up\nPros\n- Works interchangeably with Alexa and Google Assistant\n- Makes a large and lively sonic impression\n- Stand-out styling\nCons\n- Placement is critical for best sound performance\n- Heavier than rival Wi-Fi portables\n- JBL hasn\u2019t published an IP code for protection from the elements\nWho should buy the JBL Authentics 300?\nWe dig the JBL Authentics 300\u2019s retro design aesthetic as much as we appreciate its dynamic, toasty-warm musicality. But the factor that sets it apart from other smart speakers is its ability to respond to both the \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey Google\u201d wake words interchangeably.\nAnyone who loves JBL\u2019s characteristic \u201cWest Coast sound\u201d will feel right at home with the JBL Authentics 300. The same goes for smart home dwellers who don\u2019t want to choose between the Alexa and Google Assistant ecosystems.\nJBL Authentics 300: Further considerations\nIn our testing we found that sound performance is more dependent on proper placement within a room than some other smart speakers\u2014the soft dome tweeters have less reach and stamina when placed incorrectly.\nAdditionally, JBL hasn\u2019t published an IP rating for the Authentics 300 so don\u2019t even think about leaving this portable outside in the rain.\nRead our full JBL Authentics 300 review\nSonos Roam \u2013 Most convenient portable smart speaker\nPros\n- Exceptional sound for its size\n- Auto Trueplay now works over Bluetooth\n- Small and light, with a waterproof design\nCons\n- Slow wireless charging (at least with third-party chargers)\n- Sound Swap doesn\u2019t work across Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and AirPlay 2 modes\nWho should buy the Sonos Roam?\nA portable speaker should be, you know, portable. The Sonos Roam is the perfect size to stuff in a backpack while delivering the excellent audio experience you\u2019ll get from the company\u2019s larger speakers. Users who need a speaker on-the-go will appreciate its portability and light weight. It\u2019s also waterproof so you can bring it camping or out to the pool without worrying about any accidental water incidents.\nSonos Roam: Further considerations\nThere\u2019s a lot of competition in the portable speaker category, with plenty of excellent options priced less than $100. It\u2019s the smart speaker features that justify the extra cash for a Sonos Roam. If you\u2019ve integrated voice assistants into your daily routine and regularly ask Alexa for intel, you\u2019ll appreciate being able to take that convenience with you (connect it to a mobile hot spot if you\u2019re out of Wi-Fi range).\nRead our full Sonos Roam review\nAmazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) \u2013 Best smart display\nPros\n- Display can automatically rotate so it\u2019s always facing you\n- Significant improvements in display brightness and image quality\n- Very good audio performance\nCons\n- You might find the tracking feature to be creepy (it can be disabled)\n- Wi-Fi and Zigbee radios onboard, but there\u2019s no Z-Wave or Thread support\n- Needs at least 5 inches of clearance all the way around if it\u2019s to fully rotate\nWho should buy the Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen)?\nThe Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) doesn\u2019t offer a best-in-class audio, video, or smart hub experience, but all of those features are good and no other device does as good a job of providing an all-in-one Alexa experience.\nThe Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) adds a screen and cameras to the smart speaker experience. If you\u2019re using it for video calls, it\u2019s 10.1-inch display can track your movement and rotate so that it always faces you as you move around a room. The audio output is excellent, and there\u2019s an integrated Zigbee smart home hub.\nAmazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen): Further considerations\nIf you want an even bigger display, consider the Echo Show 15, but read our Echo Show 15 review to understand why we didn\u2019t pick that model in this category.\nAlso, if you already have the previous 2nd-gen model then an upgrade might not be needed\u2014unless you feel that improved display quality is something you can\u2019t live without.\nRead our full Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen) review\nGoogle Nest Hub Max \u2013 Best smart display, runner-up\nPros\n- Impressive audio quality\n- Excels as a digital photo frame\n- Built-in Nest camera\nCons\n- No physical camera shutter\n- No analog audio output\n- Google Assistant\u2019s smart home compatibility still lags Alexa\nWho should buy the Google Nest Hub Max?\nAndroid users know that Google Assistant has been closing the gap with Alexa, and it\u2019s now a formidable competitor to Amazon\u2019s smart assistant. The Google Next Hub Max offers surprisingly robust sound. Its smart home capabilities don\u2019t quite match what\u2019s on offer with the Echo Show 10, but it\u2019s perfect for homes that are using Nest thermostats and security cameras. In fact, the Next Hub Max even does double duty as a Nest camera.\nGoogle Nest Hub Max: Further considerations\nIf you\u2019re a committed YouTube user, the Google Nest Hub Max offers an integrated app and the best viewing experience (Amazon Echo Show users must use the Silk browser to access YouTube).\nUltimately, whether you choose the Echo Show or Google Nest Hub Max is going to come down to which ecosystem you prefer. We prefer Alexa for smart home control features, but Google Assistant isn\u2019t too far behind and can already offer better question-and-answer style responses.\nRead our full Google Nest Hub Max review\nOther smart speakers we like\nWhile we believe that the smart speakers above are the best that money can buy, if none of those tick all of your boxes, there are a few other products that might: The Brane X smart speaker is an expensive, but powerful smart speaker that provides excellent audio quality and decent portability. The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 is a sleek and well made soundbar that brings Dolby Atmos sound and nifty smart features such as streaming options and integrated voice control from Alexa or Google Assistant.\nHow we test smart speakers\nMost of the testing happens at moderate volume in home environments, but we\u2019re also checking to see if the speaker distorts at higher volumes. The most important features are clarity and how natural the instruments sound. Especially with smaller speakers, we want to find out how much bass the speaker can deliver.\nEqually important for wireless speakers is how easily they can connect with an audio source and how stable that connection is during music playback. We also look at any smartphone app designed to work with the speaker. For smart speakers, we evaluate how well the speaker processes voice commands. A large part of the performance depends on the capabilities of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple\u2019s Siri.\nWhy you should trust PCWorld for smart speaker reviews and buying advice\nHere at PCWorld we\u2019ve been testing smart home devices and services for decades. As reviewers and users of smart home hardware, we put every product through its paces using rigorous benchmarking and hands-on evaluation. We\u2019d never recommend something we wouldn\u2019t want for ourselves.\nWho curated this article?\nMichael Brown is TechHive\u2019s lead editor, with 30+ years of experience covering smart homes, home networking, and home audio/home theater. He holds a BA in Multimedia Journalism, authored the book Desktop Video Production, and was awarded Best Online Review by the Computer Press Association. Michael built a smart home in 2007 and used it as a real-world product-testing lab. Now living in the Pacific Northwest, he is converting his 1890 Victorian bungalow into a modern smart home.\nHow to choose a smart speaker\nMichael Brown/Foundry\nSpeaker quality\nWhile smart speakers come with a lot of fancy functions and tools, at the end of the day they are still speakers and you should expect good audio quality. Cheaper models such as the Nest Mini and Echo dot aren\u2019t going to play audiophile-level music with deep bass notes and rich sounds, but they will still give you decent enough sound to listen to in small areas. Larger rooms will require more robust speakers, or you can opt for alternative options such as a smart sound bar to pair with your smart speakers.\nPlatform compatibility\nIn a perfect world, smart speakers and smart displays would be interoperable. Unfortunately, as it stands, once you commit to one platform, you\u2019ll want to stick with it. There is one exception to this rule: The new JBL Authentics series of smart speakers can handle Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands interchangeably.\nThat said, if you\u2019re wedded to YouTube Music, streaming music from your account to an Amazon Echo is not perfectly seamless (the same goes for streaming music from Amazon Music Unlimited to a Google Home speakers). There are also some other major coexistence exceptions: Google blocks YouTube from appearing on the Echo Show devices, for instance (although you can get there using a web browser on an Echo Show). And Apple\u2019s HomePod speakers are more or less locked to Apple Music. While there\u2019s a recent workaround for Spotify, and you can use AirPlay to stream music from other services\u2014provided both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\u2013stumbling blocks like that shouldn\u2019t exist.\nBottom line on this point: If you plan to mix and match third-party products with your smart speaker or display, do a little research to make sure they\u2019ll work together.\nVoice command capabilities\nDigital assistants\u2013including Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri\u2013are mostly cloud-based software that understands natural language voice commands to perform tasks and fetch information for you. As smart speakers have become more sophisticated, some of that processing has moved down to the chips inside smart speakers and displays.\nYou\u2019ll want to make sure that your smart speaker digital assistant can understand and complete tasks such as stream music, control your TV or other smart home devices, retrieve news and other information, manage your schedule, help with tasks such as cooking, and being able to contact friends and family.\nExtra features\nWhile smart speakers are usually just that, speakers, they sometimes come with other useful features. The main one here is a smart display. While it will add to the price of your smart speaker system, a smart display can provide a wealth of extra capabilities and controls that just a speaker can\u2019t. Smart displays can allow you to do everything from stream video content to make video calls to view recipes online. Some, such as the Amazon Echo Show even have motion tracking capabilities that allow it to rotate and follow you as you move around the room\u2014whether that is seen as cool or a tad dystopian is up to you.\nFAQ\nWhat is the best smart speaker?\nThe Amazon Echo Spot (2024) is our pick for the best smart speaker. It provides the best value in Amazon\u2019s lineup of smart speakers, comes with a handy touchscreen display, and is capable of controlling your entire smart home setup.\nWhat is the best cheap smart speaker?\nThe Amazon Echo Dot (5th gen) is our pick for best budget smart speaker.

These include: streaming music over Wi-Fi, control your TV, play games, retrieve news and weather forecasts, set appointments, serve as an alarm clock, maintain to-do lists, set timers, recite recipes, make and receive phone calls, send messages, and more.\nThey can also act as a smart home controller giving you the ability to adjust your smart thermostat, manage your smart sprinkler controller, close your garage door, lock your smart deadbolt, arm your home security system, and stream video from your home security camera (models with displays).

They can tell you the weather, set alarms and timers, give you updates on the news, and much, much more.
