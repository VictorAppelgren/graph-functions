  "description": "A new study from Stanford University and MIT is shedding light on whether adopting generative artificial intelligence (AI) is worthwhile for accountants",
  "content": "Accountants using gen AI handled 55% more clients per week and logged 21% more billable hours, according to a Stanford-MIT study.\n\nA new study from Stanford University and MIT is shedding light on whether adopting generative artificial intelligence (AI) is worthwhile for accountants at small- to medium-sized companies. The short answer: Yes.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nIn a survey of 277 accountants and proprietary data from 79 small- and mid-sized firms, the researchers found that gen AI makes users more productive and lets them finish tasks faster \u2014 time they use to meet with clients.\n\nBut there are fears as well: The top concern is accuracy, security of the data and also job loss if the AI ends up replacing accountants.\n\nThe most striking finding: Accountants using AI handled 55% more clients per week than those who did not use it. They also worked 8.5 percentage points less in data entry and transaction coding tasks, which amounts to 3.5 hours saved per week.\n\nIn a sign that they didn\u2019t use the extra time for idle activities, AI-using accountants also logged 21% more billable hours. This shows that they were engaged in activities that boost revenue.\n\nIn practice, this meant accountants could spend more time advising clients, addressing complex issues and reviewing work for accuracy.\n\n\u201cAI is augmenting accountants\u2019 capacity by taking over low-level tasks and allowing them to focus more on advisory and analytical work,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nAccording to a PYMNTS Intelligence report, CFOs are gaining confidence about using AI to optimize financial processes. Accounts receivable is a particularly promising target for AI investment, with 55% of CFOs in middle-market companies willing to spend on solutions that would automate invoice approval and payment.\n\nSee here: CFOs Eye Accounts Receivable as New Direction for AI Investments\n\nIn the study, the authors used gen AI for lower-level accounting tasks such as data entry, categorizing transactions and preliminary information processing. They used software provided by an AI accounting firm whose system can \u201cunderstand\u201d receipts, invoices, bank statements and other similar inputs.\n\nThe technology\u2019s benefits extended beyond time savings. AI adoption was linked to a 12% increase in granularity in the general ledger \u2014 the number of unique accounts used to classify transactions \u2014 resulting in richer and more informative financial statements.\n\nIt also sped up reporting cycles. On average, AI-using accountants closed their monthly books 7.5 days faster than non-users. They finalize monthly financial statements within two weeks after the end of the month, while non-users take at least a week longer. For many small- and mid-sized businesses, that speed can mean earlier detection of cash flow issues, faster tax preparation and more timely reporting to investors or lenders.\n\nThese improvements did not hurt quality of the work, according to the study. In fact, the data suggested quality improved.\n\nThe AI system used by the partner firms provided \u201cconfidence scores\u201d indicating how certain it was about a transaction classification. Experienced accountants were more likely to intervene when confidence scores were low to catch potential errors. By contrast, less experienced accountants sometimes accepted AI outputs even when the system was uncertain, which could allow mistakes to slip through.\n\nThe authors concluded: \u201cAI augments, rather than replaces, human judgement.\u201d\n\nAI in Accounting Services May Level Playing Field for Small Businesses",

      "text": "CFOs are gaining confidence about using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize financial processes. Source-to-pay processes (S2P), which include both accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR), are areas of particular interest. Nearly two-thirds of CFOs (63%) experienced delays in the S2P cycle over the past year. Many identified payment execution and authorization as pain points. AI tools could seize this opportunity to streamline these processes and reduce delays.\nAR is a particularly promising target for AI investment because CFOs would pay for improved AR functions. Notably, 55% of CFOs representing middle-market businesses would be willing to pay 3% of the invoice amount to accept payments using a solution that automates invoice approval and payment. This readiness to invest more than the current 2% market average for AR technology highlights CFOs\u2019 commitment to these improvements.\nAI Investment Grows Despite ROI Concerns\nMore CFOs have set aside their lingering skepticism about AI\u2019s ROI aside and are pushing forward implementing the technology. Budgets are also growing. CFOs expect an average GenAI investment increase of nearly 10% next year, building on an existing average of $3.16 million. While middle-market firms reporting a very positive return on investment (ROI) for AI are increasing their investments by 19%, those with marginal ROI anticipate just a 6.2% increase. However, even this more modest uptick reflects a deepening commitment to integrating AI across operations. For many CFOs, this has meant focusing AI investments on medium-impact tasks like automating workflow management and generating financial reports.\nRecent trends suggest that executives\u2019 commitment to integrating GenAI deepens as they gain familiarity with the technology. PYMNTS Intelligence data analysis finds that in June, 78% of middle-market CFOs planned for bigger GenAI budgets next year. This represents a 47% increase from the share of CFOs who already anticipated greater GenAI investment only a few months earlier. While 82% of CFOs who mostly use GenAI for medium-impact tasks expect an increase in their budget, even more than the corresponding 77% of CFOs who use GenAI primarily for high-impact tasks.\nMiddle-market CFOs were 86% more likely to report that GenAI is important for financial reporting in June than in March. Overall, they believe it reduces friction and optimizes efficiency.\nThe momentum behind AI investment now outpaces ROI concerns for many CFOs. In March, 53% expressed a somewhat positive ROI and 80% a very or somewhat positive ROI. By June, 65% were reporting a somewhat positive ROI and 78% a very or somewhat positive ROI.\nAs CFOs continue to navigate an uncertain economic environment, they\u2019re likely to expand their investment in AI. These technologies can deliver tangible operational benefits, even if the financial ROI is not immediately clear, spurring adoption. On this front, smaller firms have started to lead the way.\nThe Case for Leveraging AI in Accounts Receivable\nAI technologies initially developed for AP are now being adapted to enhance AR processes. These adaptations are delivering some promising outcomes. For instance, Sage\u2019s global expansion of its AP automation product has demonstrated that AI can reduce processing times and costs. But these same efficiencies can also be realized in accounts receivable.\nWhile AI\u2019s importance can vary among CFOs, those using more source-to-pay systems generally believe the technology is more critical. For example, only 17% of CFOs with just one S2P system view AI as extremely or very important. On the other hand, 38% of those with two to four and another 38% with five to six systems see AI as extremely or very important. This more-than-doubling suggests that the challenges associated with managing multiple S2P systems drives the perceived need for AI.\nIn turn, this could indicate that there is a kind of natural ceiling for AI adoption in the near term. CFOs with simpler S2P systems to tackle AP processes may not yet recognize AI\u2019s full potential in also optimizing AR.\nAutomating invoice and payment approval processes \u2014 whether for payables or receivables \u2014 can improve cash flows and reduce financial friction. Currently, more than one-third of middle-market firms already leverage AI for at least half of their AP processes. These firms are 47% less likely to report high levels of uncertainty in their operations. This reduction in uncertainty is crucial for middle-market firms, as they often operate with tighter margins and higher sensitivity to cash flow disruptions than their enterprise counterparts.\nHow Much Firms are Willing to Invest in Accounts Receivable Solutions\nMiddle-market firms are often particularly attuned to the benefits of AI in AR contexts. PYMNTS Intelligence data reveals that 55% of these firms are willing to pay a 3% fee for solutions that automate invoice approvals and payments.\nMiddle-market firms process about 1,500 invoices monthly, meaning even small payment solution fees can significantly impact operations. For example, a 3% fee on a $1 million invoice costs a CFO\u2019s firm $30,000. At scale, with, say, 1,500 invoices at $1 million each, that cost rises proportionally to $45 million.\nMoreover, the average middle-market firm loses 3.1% of its revenue, about $14 million, due to payment collection uncertainties. Smaller middle-market firms face a higher impact, losing 3.3% (or $6 million) of their revenue. For middle-market CFOs, investments in AI-driven accounts receivable solutions reflect the need to reduce uncertainty and combat revenue losses.\nAI tools are cutting middle-market firms\u2019 costs \u2014 and their success highlights the growing demand for solutions that quickly win. These wins chiefly come in the form of efficiency and cost reduction.\nAdditionally, firms with higher levels of AI-driven automation experience significantly lower levels of uncertainty. They also report greater satisfaction with the technology\u2019s impact on financial workflows. This correlation, which links AI adoption to reduced operational uncertainty, can powerfully incentivize middle-market firms to continue investing. As these firms further seek to reduce inefficiencies, their investment focus on AR solutions that leverage AI will likely intensify.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the consumer trends driving innovation in consumer finance, digital payments and financial inclusion.

      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is leveling the playing field in accounting services, giving small and medium-sized business (SMB) owners access to robust tools once reserved for large enterprises.\nTraditional client accounting services \u2014 which include labor-intensive, often manual tasks like bookkeeping, payroll and financial reporting \u2014 are being modernized by automation and data analytics. For example, Intuit on Tuesday (July 22) debuted AI agents in its Enterprise Suite that can handle routine accounting tasks, among other things.\n\u201cAI will amplify the value of accounting services for SMBs,\u201d said Ariege Misherghi, senior vice president and general manager of accounts payable, accounts receivable and accountant channel at Bill.\n\u201cOnce routine tasks like data extraction and invoice processing are automated, accountants will be freed up to focus on higher value advisory work that only humans can provide: applying judgement, guiding SMBs through complex financial decisions and delivering strategic insights,\u201d Misherghi told PYMNTS.\nFor SMBs, AI is leveling the playing field, Misherghi said. In Bill\u2019s survey of 1,000 SMB executives, 67% said AI would improve financial forecasting and planning, while 65% said it would help with cost management.\nBut only 21% are using AI tools to manage accounting and financial operations, according to a separate small business survey from Verizon.\nLisa Huang, senior vice president of product management at Xero, said many accounting systems remain manual even as external pressures mount for the industry.\n\u201cThe accounting and bookkeeping industry is at a turning point,\u201d Huang told PYMNTS. \u201cMany professionals are overworked and under-resourced, facing increasing client demand and rising pressure from evolving regulatory and compliance requirements.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time, the profession is undergoing a generational shift, with more practitioners exiting the workforce than entering it, creating a looming talent shortage,\u201d Huang said. \u201cDespite all this, the systems many accountants rely on remain heavily manual, reducing their capacity to offer high-value advisory services and strategic guidance to clients.\u201d\nSee also: Panel: Small Businesses Want Control, Automation Gives It to Them\nNot Just About Automation\nBen Alarie, CEO of Blue J, a generative AI tax research platform, said smaller firms have long been at a disadvantage in accounting services.\n\u201cHistorically, accounting practices and SMBs have been underserved by legacy tax research tools, which have been costly, complex and ultimately misaligned with the realities of SMB workflows,\u201d Alarie told PYMNTS. \u201cGenerative AI, especially purpose-built platforms, flip this dynamic.\u201d\nGenerative AI gives practitioners instant access to clear, citation-backed answers, \u201cdramatically reducing manual research time and levelling the playing field for firms that can\u2019t afford large research teams,\u201d Alarie said. The result is \u201chigher-quality work with fewer resources.\u201d\nMore specifically, \u201cAI can transform accounting for SMBs by automating rote manual tasks, surfacing actionable real-time financial insights like \u2018you\u2019re spending double on subscriptions last quarter,\u2019 and monitoring systems for out-of-pattern spending,\u201d Jonathan Bailey, CTO of B2B payments firm Extend, told PYMNTS.\nBut it\u2019s not just about automation. With the advent of agents, \u201cAI will continue to enable more personalized experiences, more automation of complicated or tedious workflows, more insights and intelligence and \u2014 importantly \u2014 greater security and compliance,\u201d Bailey said.\nKevin Akeroyd, CEO of tax compliance software provider Sovos, told PYMNTS that AI is also shifting accounting \u201cfrom a reactive process to a more proactive one for SMBs.\u201d Instead of chasing down discrepancies or filing reports after deadlines, SMBs can use AI to spot issues early and make faster decisions.\nWhat\u2019s more is \u201cyou no longer need a technical team to ask complex questions or spot issues,\u201d Akeroyd said.\nTwo things are essential for proper harnessing of AI in accounting services: \u201cclean data and trusted software,\u201d Fergal Glynn, CMO and AI security advocate at Mindgard, told PYMNTS.\n\u201cThe modern platforms offer transparency \u2014 they show their work and allow you to verify important details. With the right setup and a human eye on critical decisions, AI becomes not just a tool, but a trusted partner in running a leaner, smarter business,\u201d Glynn said.\nRead more:\nAccounting Firms Aim Higher as AI Handles the Heavy Lifting\nAlphabet-Backed Pennylane Raises $82 Million to Expand Accounting Platform Across Europe\nDigits Debuts AI Accounting Tool and Welcomes Xero Co-Founder\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "\u201cThe tool is exactly what we\u2019re looking for, which is taking the human element out of the transactional process,\u201d Mills told PYMNTS. By letting algorithms post invoices and reconcile ledgers, Pinion expects to free staff accountants to spend more time interpreting results and advising clients.\nEarly returns have impressed one hard-to-please constituency: home builders and construction contractors. Preparing loan-draw packages for banks \u201chas historically been a paper-driven bane for everyone involved,\u201d Mills said.\nAdaptive\u2019s workflow plugs into field apps and the firm\u2019s cloud ledger, generating digital loan documents that borrower and lender can review in real time. The shift, he added, \u201cis a door-opener\u201d when pitching new clients and has begun to shorten approval cycles.\nAccounting firms have long worried that AI still needs too much human oversight to be reliable, especially in regulated services. Mills conceded the learning curve is steep. \u201cThe hurdle is education \u2014 unwinding work habits and conveying the benefit,\u201d he said. But he argues that machine efficiency outweighs the adjustment costs, citing Adaptive\u2019s ability to deliver \u201cbetter, faster, more reliable information at lower cost.\u201d\nNext on Pinion\u2019s roadmap is automated, industry-specific reporting that turns raw data into customizable dashboards. Perfecting that loop, Mills said, would leave advisers to \u201cinterpret, explain and plan,\u201d moving them further up the value chain even as software handles the grunt work.\nPinion\u2019s early experience comes as Adaptive this week rolled out what it calls its next-generation platform for construction accounting, a segment the company estimates includes nearly 100,000 U.S. contractors with combined revenue of about $850 billion.\nThe privately held firm says its latest release was built with input from design partners including CliftonLarsonAllen and Pinion and is aimed squarely at helping accounting practices scale construction services without adding staff.\nUnlike generic AI tools that attempt to automate bookkeeping across industries, Adaptive\u2019s software is designed around construction\u2019s idiosyncrasies like job-cost coding, draw management and the maze of lien waivers and insurance certificates that accompany each project.\n\u201cAccounting firms know construction is a growth opportunity, but the manual processes have put a ceiling on how many clients they can serve,\u201d Adaptive Chief Executive Matt Calvano said. The new version, he added, \u201cremoves that ceiling\u201d by standardizing workflows firms typically build from scratch for each client.\nThe vendor\u2019s pitch comes at a moment when many midtier and regional firms are reevaluating their service mix. Tight labor markets and rising audit-quality expectations have pushed practices toward recurring, advisory-heavy offerings. Automating the labor-intensive portions of bookkeeping, practitioners say, is a prerequisite for that shift.\n\u201cOur partnership with Adaptive has enabled us to deliver exceptionally fast and meaningful outcomes for our construction clients,\u201d Pinion principal Lisa Baalman said, citing quicker turnaround on financial statements and improved visibility into cash flow.\nAdaptive\u2019s software integrates with QuickBooks, major U.S. banks and project-management systems such as Procore. Once connected, it reads invoices, assigns costs to jobs and cost codes, and routes payment applications through a web portal. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and expense tracking modules feed real-time work-in-progress reports, while a compliance module monitors insurance expirations and lien waivers.\nImplementation, according to the company, requires two or three remote training sessions and comes with a white-label option so firms can present the portal under their own brand. Adaptive also offers daily webinars and live-chat support \u2014 features that help smaller firms lacking dedicated IT staff.\nStill, accountants caution that no amount of automation eliminates professional responsibility. Construction bookkeeping is notoriously detail-oriented; a misclassified cost can cascade into flawed revenue recognition. Regulators have also begun to scrutinize how firms validate AI outputs, raising the prospect of new guidance on documentation and internal controls.\nAdaptive\u2019s approach \u2014 pairing automation with firm-level onboarding and support \u2014 may mitigate some of those concerns. Yet the broader question is how quickly accounting practices can adapt their own processes and billing models. Mills expects a period of dual-running systems before staff and clients fully trust the software. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling it out in phases,\u201d he said. \u201cAccuracy has to be proven over time.\u201d\nFor firms willing to take the plunge, the payoff could be significant. Automating data entry and reconciliation typically cuts per-client servicing hours by 25% to 40%, according to estimates from consultancy CPA.com. That capacity can be redeployed to higher-margin advisory work \u2014 forecasting, tax planning or securing financing \u2014 services construction companies often lack in-house.\nPinion, for its part, is content to let the market develop while it measures internal results. \u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate labor savings and data accuracy over the next quarter,\u201d Mills said. If the numbers hold, he expects to migrate the majority of the firm\u2019s construction clients to the platform by year-end."
