      "feedback": "The critique should be tighter and more decision‑useful: the current draft ambitiously covers a multi‑year regime framework but overfits 3 horizons and dense prose into a format that exceeds the 4–6 sentence executive brief; rewrite as a crisp, 4–6 sentence house view with (a) one base‑case assertion (Regime A persists with a 15% tariff envelope, non‑binding negotiation risk) and (b) 1–2 explicit near‑term catalysts, (c) 3–4 watch‑items, and (d) clear implications for valuation/capital allocation, all anchored to the listed source IDs; drop any uncited or non‑ID numbers (e.g., Citi’s 60–70% pass‑through) and replace with quantified signals drawn from the sources (e.g., 15% tariff, 90‑day US–China pause, 50% Indian tariff proposal, July tariff receipts ≈ $21B, Goodyear’s tariff pass‑through guidance) with citations RHFWI02JT, RHXDOHQQX, DGG6HXUFZ, DNG58CC09, AJTHKYXQ3, OFY11YO0I, WLXM1819K, QRX2HD4X0, 2SJORBV6H, S15934PBQ, as applicable; ensure every assertion maps to an ID. (i) Wire the causal chain explicitly: policy action → tariff/margin pass‑through → pricing, margins, and inventory discipline → capex/geography implications; (ii) articulate a concrete 3–5 sentence base‑case plus 2 explicit alt paths (e.g., faster CRA/REINS progress lifting capex upside; faster tariff escalations dampening margins) with probability weights, and tie to Regime A/B mechanics; (iii) consolidate near‑term triggers as a watch‑list rather than narrative bullets ( DOJ enforcement action dated around 31 July 2025; UK DCTS milestones for early 2026; 90‑day pause expiry; CRA/REINS developments; EU auto‑relief timing; Sri Lanka/UK apparel shifts ); (iv) strengthen first‑principles grounding by a one‑sentence invariants box (real‑rate differentials, terms of trade, BoP) tied to the regime dynamic; (v) ensure balanced coverage of critical sources (e.g., Adyen cross‑border signal via QRX2HD4X0; Japan steel/input channels via 2SJORBV6H; Sri Lanka apparel via WLXM1819K; Goodyear tariff costs via AJTHKYXQ3) and reconcile any conflicts by stating the probability/risk posture; finally deliver the revised brief as a single 4–6 sentence executive paragraph with an explicit watch‑list and a base‑case/alt‑case framing anchored entirely to the SOURCE IDs.",
