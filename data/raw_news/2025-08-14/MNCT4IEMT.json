  "description": "Are you waiting for the right deal to get a foldable phone? The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is at a record-low price!",
  "content": "Foldable phones are fascinating, and I love how they have transformed smartphone interaction in recent years. What I don\u2019t love is how expensive they usually are, though. That said, good deals come from time to time, and today we have one of the best offers we\u2019ve seen in a while. The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is $600 off, bringing the cost down to a record-low price of $1,199. Buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for just $1,199 ($600 off)\n\nThis offer is available directly from Amazon. It\u2019s only available in the Obsidian color version. The Porcelain model seems to be out of stock everywhere.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google's most impressive foldable to date, offering a 6.3-inch exterior display, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. When you're ready for more, unfold to access the 8-inch interior display. Solid cameras, a decent battery, and top-notch software support round out this monster of a device.\n\nWe know paying $1,199 for a phone isn\u2019t exactly cheap, but it is definitely a fantastic deal when the retail price is a whopping $1,799! This is one of the most expensive mainstream smartphones out there, and today\u2019s price is an all-time low one. This means the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold has never been this cheap!\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is definitely among the best foldable phones out there. Its only real competitor is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (and maybe the Fold 6). It offers an outstanding general experience. For starters, the unit comes with a powerful Google Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM. That\u2019s plenty of processing and multitasking power, and you won\u2019t have to worry about performance.\n\nYou\u2019ll be glad it comes with more RAM than usual, too, as the large internal screen lends itself to plenty of multitasking. It\u2019s an 8-inch LTPO OLED panel with a sharp 2,152 x 2,076 resolution. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate, so videos and games will look gorgeous, and navigating through the UI will be buttery smooth.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need that much screen real estate for quick tasks, messages, or calling someone, you can also use the external 6.3-inch screen, which looks and feels much more like a traditional smartphone display.\n\nThe design and construction are very similar to that of the standard Pixel 9 series, save for the folding mechanism, of course. It\u2019s made of an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2. There is one main difference in the build quality, though. This phone comes with an IPX8 rating, which means it\u2019s protected against liquids, but not dust and other solids. That said, it is common for foldable phones to underperform in this area.\n\nDuring our testing, we found that the battery can last a full day despite its smaller 4,650mAh capacity. And if you worry about longevity, you\u2019ll be glad to know this phone will stay relevant for a long time, as it launched with a seven-year update promise. This upgrade commitment is among the best in the industry, and it is only matched by Samsung.\n\nWe do wish the camera and charging speeds were better, especially at this price range, but these are still decent. Engineering a foldable phone can\u2019t be easy, so some sacrifices had to be made.\n\nThere has never been a better time to get a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so take advantage of this offer while it\u2019s still around. Remember, record-low price discounts don\u2019t tend to last long!",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nHere are the phone update policies from every major Android manufacturer\nApril 15, 2025\nIf you have an Android smartphone, you likely want it to last as long as possible, especially if you\u2019ve spent upwards of $1,000 on a flagship model. You probably have a case to protect it physically, but what about the software inside the phone? How can you keep that safe? This is where phone updates come into play \u2014 an integral aspect of keeping your phone working its best long after you buy it.\nUnfortunately, the company that created your phone plays a major part in how frequently you see updates, not to mention for how long. In this guide, we\u2019re going to give you all the info you need on phone updates as well as what you can expect from the major manufacturers.\nPhone updates: What are they, and where do they come from?\nIn the Android world, there are two types of smartphone updates. There are major upgrades to a new version of Android that usually land once a year. The more frequent type is a security patch, which lands on a monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly basis. For the sake of clarity, we\u2019re going to refer to the former as upgrades and the latter as patches.\n- Upgrades \u2014 This is when your phone jumps from one Android version to another. For example, if your device has Android 13 and gets an update that takes it to Android 14, that\u2019s an upgrade. These usually come once a year and represent a major shift in the functionality and sometimes even the overall look of your phone\u2019s software.\n- Patches \u2014 These are smaller and more frequent. The main reason these land is to enhance the security of your phone. Sometimes they also include new features, although this will heavily depend on your phone\u2019s manufacturer.\nWhich smartphone manufacturer do you trust the most for software updates?\nGoogle \u2014 which owns and maintains the Android operating system \u2014 is responsible for creating and issuing both upgrades and patches. This is why Google\u2019s Pixel phones usually see upgrades and patches first. For phones not manufactured by Google, upgrades and patches need to go through the manufacturer first so it can modify code to accommodate specific products. In most cases, this slows down distribution. Likewise, carriers and chipset vendors may also delay rollouts for a variety of reasons.\nUltimately, how frequently your phone receives updates depends on how seriously your phone\u2019s manufacturer takes them. Simply put, some Android manufacturers place more importance on updates than others. Below, you\u2019ll see how much of a difference there can be!\nApple\n- Apple\u2019s stated commitment is five years of software support, but that\u2019s only the minimum. In reality, the company usually offers at least six years of support for all its phones, even those in the budget SE line.\nObviously, Apple is not an Android manufacturer, but it\u2019s helpful to have it on this list for the sake of comparison. Only recently did we find out what Apple\u2019s stated commitment is for iPhone software updates: five years. That would be five years of iOS upgrades and security patches.\nHowever, Apple exceeds this commitment nearly all the time. Most iPhones \u2014 from the most expensive Pro Max model to the cheapest SE model \u2014 get at least six years of support. The five-year commitment is just as low as Apple would ever go, but we doubt it would ever shelve an iPhone at the five-year mark.\nYou\u2019ll find, as you continue this article, that this commitment puts the majority of Android OEMs to shame.\nASUS\n- ASUS typically offers two upgrades and at least two years of security patches for its lineup.\nTypically, ASUS doesn\u2019t release a significant number of phones each year. One would assume this would mean the company would have a stellar phone update policy since it only needs to focus on a handful of devices. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not really the case.\nThe company promised at least two major upgrades for ASUS\u2019 most recent flagships in the Zenfone and ROG Phone ranges. ASUS also said its most recent phones would receive security updates for four years, with the ZenFone 12 Ultra extending this by a year. This is much better than its previous commitment, which was just two years of security patches. Unfortunately, some ASUS phones still stick to that policy.\nTwo Android upgrades and two years of patches represent Google\u2019s recommended minimum for after-purchase support. In other words, ASUS is only making the minimum promise for most of its devices.\nASUS\u2019 delivery of timely updates has also been mixed over the years. With the Zenfone 8, for example, ASUS pushed the Android 12 update in early January 2022, roughly three months after the stable launch. Previously, it pushed Android 11 to the Zenfone 7 series in April 2021 \u2014 roughly eight months after the stable launch of the operating system. This shows ASUS is getting faster, which is good, but its commitment could be stronger.\n- Google set a new benchmark with the Pixel 8 series, committing to seven upgrades and seven years of security patches. Most of its lineup promises three upgrades and five years of security patches. Everything before the Pixel 6 series, however, only receives three years of patches.\nFrom 2016 to mid-2021, Google had a phone update policy for Pixels that was not too bad: three years of upgrades and patches. This was better than most other companies, and Google\u2019s consistency was very impressive. Pixel phones are almost always the first to see the newest upgrade, and patches land at the beginning of each month like clockwork.\nGoogle is one of the best companies when it comes to keeping its phones up-to-date and safe.\nIn 2021, with the launch of the Google Pixel 6 series, the company augmented its policy. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series will see three upgrades and five years of patches. Unfortunately, Pixels launched before the Pixel 6 series will stick with the former policy. But Google didn\u2019t stop there. With the launch of the Pixel 8 series, though, Google set a new high watermark for Android phone support. The smartphone duo will see seven upgrades, with seven years of security updates. The company has since extended this policy to the mid-range Pixel 8a, making it the best-supported phone under $500. The newer Pixel 9a shares this promise.\nGoogle also has a great website that details exactly when its devices will stop receiving upgrades and patches. Without a doubt, Google helps set the bar for phone updates in the world of Android.\nHMD Global / Nokia\n- HMD Global typically offers two upgrades and two or three years of security patches for Nokia-branded phones.\nHMD Global manufactures smartphones with Nokia branding. Nokia phones come with a version of Android that is very close to stock. Originally, this helped HMD keep its phones up-to-date quickly and consistently because it didn\u2019t need to change much when Google pushed out the core update.\nHowever, HMD has fallen off the wagon over the past few years. A combination of an increasingly complex portfolio, as well as small profit margins for its budget-priced devices, likely contributed to this. At this point, HMD doesn\u2019t have a stated comprehensive phone update policy.\nThankfully, the company recently posted a page on its website to help people determine how long their phones will receive patches. A 2023 phone like the G22, for example, will receive three years of security updates through April 2026. Based on the website, many devices will receive security updates for a minimum of two years, with some devices seeing security updates for up to three years.\nThat\u2019s pretty par for the course, but HMD\u2019s track record with respect to upgrades isn\u2019t as good. Most of its older phones saw Android 11 after considerable delays, for example.\nHONOR\n- In most cases, HONOR commits to two upgrades and two years of security patches. However, recent HONOR Magic Pro models get special treatment with three upgrade commitments and five years of patches. The company extends this to seven years with the Magic 7 Pro.\nHONOR used to be a subsidiary of HUAWEI. Shortly after the HUAWEI ban took effect, HUAWEI sold HONOR to an independent firm, making HONOR its own brand without any ties to its former parent. Since then, it has only launched a handful of phones.\nSince that all happened, HONOR has committed to the standard phone update policy for most of its phones: two years of upgrades and patches. Even its 2022 flagship \u2014 the HONOR Magic 4 Pro \u2014 stuck with this promise, despite its high price. Thankfully, the two most recent HONOR flagships \u2014 the Magic 5 Pro and Magic 6 Pro \u2014 upped the ante to three upgrades and five years of patches.\nNotably, the company has promised seven years of Android upgrades and security patches starting with the Magic 7 Pro. Hopefully, all future phones from HONOR will see the same update commitment. Time will tell.\nHUAWEI\n- HUAWEI has no firm commitment to the rollout of upgrades and patches to its recent phones. Instead, it takes things on a case-by-case basis.\nDue to the HUAWEI ban, HUAWEI uses two different operating systems on its phones. Harmony OS (which is an Android fork) appears on phones in its native China. Meanwhile, regular Android (with its EMUI skin) appears on global devices. We\u2019ll be focused on the Android versions of HUAWEI\u2019s catalog here.\nRegardless of the operating system onboard, HUAWEI is unable to use Google services on its devices and doesn\u2019t seem to have access to the most recent versions of Android either.\nHUAWEI's smartphone business is in a shambles, making updates unreliable.\nCase in point, 2022\u2019s HUAWEI Mate 50 Pro flagship still has no schedule for getting Android 13, although HUAWEI does commit to two Android upgrades coming at some point. The Pura 70 Ultra from 2024 launched with Android 12, though, so it might just be that anything beyond that version isn\u2019t coming.\nMaking matters worse, HUAWEI can\u2019t even commit to a concrete promise of how long it will update its phones. In the case of the P50 Pro from 2022, it told us this: \u201cUpdates will be provided and maintained regularly throughout the full lifecycle of the product.\u201d That could mean anything, really.\nLikewise, the company also told us this at one point in an email:\nPrivacy protection and security have always been HUAWEI\u2019s top priority, and HUAWEI has been innovating to protect users\u2019 privacy and security. We rigorously adhere to foundational principles for data privacy during the entire product design and development process. We continuously provide security updates to our users, when necessary, and will continue to offer them timely technical support.\nOnce again, that could mean anything.\nThe bottom line here is that if phone updates are important to you, you should beware of HUAWEI devices.\nMotorola\n- Motorola flagships generally receive two software upgrades and two (or sometimes three) years of patches. The company\u2019s budget phones usually see just one upgrade and two years of patches. Currently, only one phone offers five years of coverage.\nMotorola has a problematic past when it comes to phone updates. When it launched the premium Motorola Edge series in 2020, for example, it promised just one Android upgrade and two years of patches. After public outcry (including from Android Authority), it amended its promise to two upgrades and two years of patches.\nIncredibly, the same thing happened again the following year with the Edge 20 series. The end result was the same: two years of upgrades and patches.\nIn 2022, it finally learned its lesson. It publicly promised to deliver two upgrades and three years of bi-monthly patches to the Motorola Edge 30 series. In 2023, it upped the ante again, offering three upgrades and four years of patches for the Motorola Edge Plus (2023).\nIn 2024, it finally offered five upgrades and five years of patches with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, a mid-range phone available in Europe and India. As of 2025, the ThinkPhone 25 and Moto G75 have since been placed on that list, too.\nHowever, Motorola stops short of offering good commitments like that to all its phones. Motorola\u2019s budget phones often see the original promise of one upgrade and two years of patches. Thankfully, Motorola makes it easy for users to know what they should expect with updates using a web-based tool. If you\u2019re a Motorola phone owner (or thinking of becoming one), a quick visit to that web page would be a good idea.\nNothing\n- Most Nothing-branded phone has an update commitment of three upgrades and four years of patches. However, the Phone 3a series will receive six years of security patches with three upgrades.\nNothing is the youngest smartphone brand on this list, but its update commitment already matches many players. So far, the three Nothing phones we\u2019ve seen \u2014 Phone 1, Phone 2, and Phone 2a \u2014 have the same update commitment, which is three Android upgrades and four years of patches.\nCurrently, the Nothing Phone 3a series is the only device line in the company\u2019s umbrella that\u2019ll receive six years of patches and three Android upgrades.\nNothing\u2019s speed with these updates has been pretty good. All Nothing phones are already on Android 14 and there some have already received Android 15, suggesting a timely rollout of Google\u2019s latest OS version.\nAs time goes on, Nothing could extend these commitments, considering Google and Samsung have extended theirs. However, Nothing\u2019s relative size could prevent it from offering too much of a commitment, so time will tell there.\nOnePlus\n- The OnePlus 13 gets four upgrades and six years of patches. Older flagships receive up to four upgrades and up to five years of patches. Mid-rangers in the Nord series get two upgrades and three years of patches. Budget Nord N models get one upgrade and two years of patches.\nOnePlus breaks down its support criteria based on the class of device at hand. The differences are notable. In brief, the more money you spend, the more support you\u2019ll receive.\nFor example, the OnePlus 13 line will receive four upgrades and six years of security patches while the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Open will all see four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 10 Pro, OnePlus 9 series, etc., will receive three years of upgrades and a fourth year of security updates.\nHowever, when you step down to the mid-range Nord series, you\u2019ll see two years of Android updates and a third year of security updates. Finally, when you step down again to the budget-tier Nord N series \u2014 including devices like the Nord N30 and Nord N300 \u2014 you\u2019ll only get one upgrade and two years of security patches.\nUnfortunately, OnePlus\u2019 reliability in disseminating those updates has been up and down over the years. The company has become well-known for launching half-baked Android upgrades with sometimes devastating bugs. It also isn\u2019t incredibly consistent with the rollouts of its patches. Still, as long as you stick to flagship-tier products from the brand, you should be happy.\nOPPO\n- The Find X8 will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches. Most other OPPO flagships from 2023 and forward will receive four upgrades and five years of patches. Pre-2023 flagships will receive three upgrades and four years of patches. Mid-rangers get two upgrades and four years of patches. Budget models get one upgrade and three years of patches. Select ultra-budget models will see no upgrades.\nOPPO and OnePlus are essentially the same company, with both organizations using the same staff, the same R&D, and even the same code base for their respective Android skins. As such, it should be unsurprising to hear that OPPO\u2019s promises for phone updates are similar to those of OnePlus: the more you spend, the more you get.\nAt the top end, OPPO\u2019s flagships in its Find series launched in 2025 and beyond will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches, with older models receiving four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, older flagships \u2014 including the Find X5 series \u2014 will see three upgrades and four years of security patches.\nUnlike its slabby siblings, the foldable OPPO Find N5 will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nThe mid-range OPPO F, K, Reno, and Find Lite/Neo series will see two upgrades and four years of patches. Finally, some of the budget OPPO A series phones will see one Android upgrade and three years of patches. Note that we say \u201csome\u201d there, meaning there could be OPPO A phones with zero upgrades.\nWhile OPPO\u2019s commitments to its budget phones are quite sad, it is nice to see the company lay it all out in public. At least with OPPO, you know what you\u2019re going to get.\nPOCO\n- POCO generally offers no firm commitment to upgrades and patches, instead issuing information on a phone-by-phone basis. Most of its phones see two years of overall support, including two upgrades. However, more recent models are offering a little more. The F7 Ultra, for instance, promises four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nPOCO has improved its update policy in recent years, but only for a handful of its devices. The F7 Ultra, for instance, will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches, meeting many other companies in this particular boat.\nHowever, good luck finding details for any of its older devices. When asked, offered only a brief statement about its plans to support its smartphones over time. \u201cCurrently, the Android updates and security patches cycles of our devices are in accordance with our agreements with Google and comply with corresponding policies.\u201d\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, POCO is passing the buck. Google has no set rule on how long manufacturers must issue phone updates, nor how regularly they should come. Google\u2019s suggested schedule is a minimum of two years, but the company hasn\u2019t done anything to enforce this.\nPOCO has historically given wishy-washy answers to our requests for formal commitments to software support.\nIn other words, POCO does not make any overall promises for its phones. To its credit, it has historically delivered two upgrades to most of its devices. It might take longer than we would like, but it does happen.\nDuring our review of the POCO F5 Pro, the company committed to two years of upgrades and three years of patches. The Poco X6 series, launched in January 2024, offers three upgrades and four years of patches. So the company is getting better slowly but surely.\nThe bottom line here is that you should approach any POCO purchases under the assumption that your device will get the bare minimum of software support.\nrealme\n- realme phones usually come with two upgrades and three years of patches, although newer phones are seeing better promises.\nIn 2022 and earlier, realme stuck to its original promise when it comes to phone updates. Despite its sister brands OPPO and OnePlus upping the ante for flagship phones, realme stuck with the suggested minimum:\n\u201cI think we are still sticking to\u2026two years of [upgrades] and the regular security patch updates for three years,\u201d realme CEO Madhav Sheth told us in an interview.\nHowever, realme is making changes. In March 2022, the company announced that the realme GT 2 and realme GT 2 Pro would see three upgrades and four years of patches. Unfortunately, the company didn\u2019t explicitly state if this was its new universal policy going forward or just a special consideration for these phones. Until we hear differently, assume a realme phone comes with just two upgrades.\nAs of 2025, the GT7 Pro offers four years of upgrades, so the company is slowly improving its policy outlook.\nRedmi\n- Most Redmi phones get one or two upgrades, but the company\u2019s newest phones are seeing increases to that commitment.\nXiaomi sub-brand Redmi makes a whole lot of mid-range and budget phones. As with realme, it should be unsurprising to learn that a company known for very cheap devices doesn\u2019t put too much credence into keeping those phones updated.\nIn the past, it has committed to providing monthly and/or quarterly security updates to a wide range of Redmi-branded phones. The list includes most of the Redmi 7, 8, and 9 families. Unfortunately, the company has made no specific commitments to upgrades and usually supplies two or even just one before shelving the device.\nHowever, in 2022, the company did start being better. Some of its devices saw commitments rise to two or even three years of upgrades. There isn\u2019t much rhyme or reason to which phones do or don\u2019t get this promise, though. With 2024\u2019s launch of the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus, the company is committing to three upgrades and four years of patches for this particular model.\nOne should go into buying a Redmi phone with the knowledge that it is very unlikely you\u2019ll see more than two upgrades during its lifespan.\nSamsung\n- The majority of recent Samsung phones will see four upgrades and five years of patches. Some older phones will see three upgrades and three years of patches. Phones in the Galaxy S24 series are due for seven years of both upgrades and patches. The Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, A26 5G, and A16 5G will receive six upgrades and six years of security patches.\nFor years now, Samsung has been the top dog when it comes to global smartphone sales, so naturally, it\u2019s also one of the OEMs with the best support promise for its flagships and mid-range phones. It was briefly knocked off its throne by Google with the Pixel 8 series, but if you\u2019re buying a Galaxy S24, Samsung is promising to match Google\u2019s seven-year commitment. We\u2019re expecting that to apply to other models in the future, and it has already with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6.\nNotably, Samsung also announced the Galaxy A16 5G, which surprisingly offers six years of Android upgrades and security patches. It has since been joined by the And, starting with the Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, and A26 5G.\nOnly Google's Pixel 8 series features a better update promise than most Samsung phones.\nOutside of the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung otherwise trumps every OEM except Google, with four years of upgrades and five years of security patches for all its previous phones. That means a Galaxy S23 \u2014 which first shipped with Android 13 \u2014 will see Android 15, Android 16, and even Android 17.\nAs mentioned, Samsung doesn\u2019t lock its promise to premium flagships. The mid-range Galaxy A54 5G gets the same commitment, for example.\nSome phones get a less extensive promise of three years of upgrades and patches. However, when you consider that that\u2019s a better promise than most companies make for even their premium flagships, you start to see just how good Samsung is at this.\nFor a full rundown of all Samsung devices and how long they\u2019ll see updates, consult our guide.\nSony\n- The majority of Sony phones come with two upgrades and two years of patches. Newer flagships, though, do come with better policies.\nIn the world of Android, Sony makes some of the most expensive non-foldable phones. One would think that with the phones costing so much money, Sony\u2019s promises for phone updates would be quite extensive. However, one would be wrong to think that.\nThe Sony Xperia 1 V \u2014 one of its recent flagships \u2014 has no stated update commitment. Before that, the Xperia 1 IV saw two years of upgrades and three years of patches. Going back to even older flagships, the commitment gets worse and weaker. Thankfully, Sony addressed the rot, giving the Xperia VI three upgrades and four years of security patches. That pales in comparison to many, many mid-range phones from the likes of Samsung and Google, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nRemember that these phones start at a price of at least $1,300. Also, Sony\u2019s phone roster is incredibly small. It\u2019s bizarre that the company can\u2019t even match Samsung\u2019s commitments to its older and budget-level phones.\nHopefully, Sony will eventually up its game here. Until then, buyers who appreciate fast and long-lasting updates should steer clear.\nTCL\n- TCL changes its commitments depending on the phone\u2019s price. However, you shouldn\u2019t expect anything more than two years of support, with some devices only seeing one upgrade in that time.\nTCL says its software update policies typically depend on each individual device. \u201cThere are numerous factors that need to be considered for each device, such as carrier requirements, certifications, chipset software support, and regional needs,\u201d said TCL via email.\nThis open-ended policy makes for a wid variety of commitments. For example, the TCL 40 XE 5G from 2023 has a two-year commitment for patches but no commitment for upgrades, meaning it will never get beyond Android 13. Other devices get one upgrade commitment, with only a select few getting two.\nIn other words, you shouldn\u2019t expect more than two upgrades for a TCL phone. That applies even if you buy one of its most expensive devices. Meanwhile, if you get something more budget-oriented, you should expect just one upgrade \u2014 if that.\nvivo\n- vivo has no firm software support commitment for the majority of its phones. The only exception is the latest vivo X series, but even then, there are a whole lot of caveats.\nIn 2021, vivo made a decent commitment to its newer flagship phones, saying it would deliver three years of upgrades and patches for \u201cselect models\u201d in the vivo X series. We see this commitment still to this day, with the X80 Pro getting a formal commitment to that effect. However, that only applies to devices launched after July 2021 and only applies to select markets.\nDevices that don\u2019t fall under this policy will \u201ccontinue to receive regular Android security updates\u201d for an unknown period of time. Unfortunately, vivo has not yet amended this policy, despite detailed promises from sister brands OPPO and OnePlus.\nNotably, vivo has committed to three upgrades and four years of patches with its X100 Pro, and has bettered this with the X200 Pro. The new phone will see four upgrades and five years of security patches.\nThankfully, vivo does offer a tool that allows you to see what to expect as far as phone updates for any particular model.\nXiaomi\n- Xiaomi has a stated policy of two years of security patches for its phones. However, it has no stated policy for upgrades. It does make exceptions for its premium phones, with older flagships seeing three upgrades and four years of patches. The Xiaomi 15, however, will receive four years of OS updates and six years of patches.\nXiaomi\u2019s stated minimum for phone updates across all its lines is as follows: \u201cWe release monthly and quarterly security patch updates on Xiaomi devices for at least two years after product listing in the marketplace. Monthly and quarterly security updates will include Android security patches released by Google, as well as patches for Xiaomi-specific issues.\u201d\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t bring any clarity to Xiaomi\u2019s policy toward upgrades. As with some other vendors on this list, Xiaomi approaches each line on its own to determine its commitment. For example, the company does promise three upgrades and four years of security patches for its flagship Xiaomi 13 lines. The Xiaomi 14 gets a year extra on both OS upgrades and security patches. The Xiaomi 15 kicks this up to four upgrades and six years of security patches. Phones outside of these lines, however, won\u2019t see that extensive of a commitment \u2014 if the company issues a commitment at all.\nZTE\n- Most ZTE phones will see one Android upgrade and the company makes no commitment towards patches.\nA relatively small player on the global stage, ZTE is very vague about its update plans. \u201cZTE has plans to provide major system updates (one update) on flagship products, but the update time depends on the release time of Google\u2019s commercial version,\u201d said the company via email. This doesn\u2019t make us feel too confident about the longevity of its phones.\nIn the case of the ZTE Axon 40 Ultra from 2022, the company didn\u2019t even make a commitment at all, refusing to comment on the matter.\nIn other words, ZTE might be the weakest company on this list when it comes to software support.\nPhone updates: A summary of the industry\nIf you read through this whole list, you\u2019ll notice that only a handful of companies take software updates seriously. Samsung is the leader when it comes to issuing phone updates for a significant period of time on a consistent and frequent basis. Meanwhile, Google sits in a comfortable second place slot. These two companies are neck-and-neck, though.\nOther than those two companies, however, it\u2019s a mixed bag. OnePlus, OPPO, and Xiaomi offer very good update policies, but only for their premium flagships. Motorola is showing a positive trend, even if many of its devices still fall short of its rivals. Mid-rangers and budget models see much weaker promises. Even huge brands like Sony, ASUS, realme, vivo, and TCL can\u2019t meet the bar set by Samsung\u2019s budget lines.\nDoes a company's track record with software updates influence your purchasing decision with new phones?\nThen you have companies like ZTE. More often than not, they simply refuse to make any promises at all. Looking from the top down, you can really see how the Android phone industry is incredibly fragmented when it comes to a standard policy of updates.\nOne thing we haven\u2019t mentioned yet is how Apple treats phone updates. Apple actually trumps most Android brands by offering six years (or more) of upgrades for iPhones. We\u2019d definitely like to see this as a standard across the Android world, too.\nThis would be a universally good thing. It would allow Android users to have the same level of after-purchase support as iOS users, for one. It would also set an example for other Android OEMs and, hopefully, push the idea that weak update commitments are simply not acceptable anymore.\nPhone updates are important and should be treated as such. Someday, we hope this whole list is filled with robust promises from all companies.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nWaterproof tech: Everything you need to know about IP and ATM ratings\nMarch 7, 2025\nWaterproof tech has become a big trend in recent years. But how do you know how protected your device is? Most devices use either an IP or ATM ratings. Let\u2019s start by talking about what an IP rating is. Most high-end smartphones these days have an IP68 rating. These include the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Apple iPhone 16 series, and Google Pixel 9 series. Some can even go up to IP69, but that is rare. What does all of this even mean, though? Let\u2019s dig into it.\nWhat is an IP rating?\nYou probably know that IP ratings have something to do with protection from water and dust, but if you are reading this, that may be as far as your understanding goes.\nAn IP rating tells you the level of protection a device offers against solids and liquids. The International Electrotechnical Commission sets these standards. The \u201cIP\u201d stands for Ingress Protection (or International Protection) and is followed by two numbers. The first number indicates the level of protection against solid particles (dust, dirt, etc.) and ranges from one to six. The second number tells you how much water a device can handle without suffering damage, and it goes from one to nine \u2014 the higher the number, the better the protection against liquids. Check out the chart below for detailed info on what each number means:\n| Level | Solids (first number) | Liquids (second number) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Level 1 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 50mm (example: hands). | Liquids (second number) Protected against vertically falling drops of water. |\n| Level 2 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 12mm (example: fingers). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 3 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm (example: tools and wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 4 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 1mm (example: small wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against water sprayed from all directions. |\n| Level 5 | Solids (first number) Dust protected \u2014 limited ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 6 | Solids (first number) Dust-tight \u2014 no ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against powerful jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 7 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of immersion in water \u2014 between 15 cm (5.9 inches) and 1 meter (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 8 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water under pressure. Usually 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of immersion for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 9 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against high pressure and temperature water jets. The device needs to survive 30 seconds of 14-16 liters directed at the phone from multiple angles, at an 80-degree Celsius temperature. |\nAs you can tell by the chart above, a handset with an IP67 rating is entirely dust-tight and will survive in up to one meter of water (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. An IP68-rated device is also completely dust-tight. It is protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water, which usually means it will survive in up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water for 30 minutes. If a phone is IP69 rated, it means it can also handle really hot water under high pressure.\nIP69 ratings are still a bit rare in smartphones, but the list is growing. Some popular phones with an IP69 rating include the OnePlus 13, HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find N5, and the Moto G Power 2025.\nYou\u2019ve probably also heard of an IP69K rating. This one isn\u2019t relevant to smartphones. IP69K ratings are provided to equipment made for road vehicles. It ensures that the rated product can withstand severe washes using pressure washers.\nWater-resistant, but not waterproof\nEven if a smartphone has a high IP rating, it may not be completely waterproof. You can drop a phone with an IP68 rating in a freshwater pond, or a tub, and it should be fine. However, if that phone is dipped in a chlorinated pool, or in the ocean, which has saltwater, that could cause problems.\nManufacturers are always quick to tell you water resistance is not a permanent state. The rubber seals and gaskets that usually protect a high IP-rated phone from water damage could be weakened over time. This could decrease the device\u2019s overall water resistance over time. Those same seals can erode if a smartphone encounters coffee, soft drinks, or champagne spills.\nRemember that a phone\u2019s IP rating is based on closed lab conditions, not real-world situations. In other words, try to keep your phone dry, even if it might have a high IP rating.\nAdditionally, a phone that has been damaged is likely no longer waterproof. Water can leak into the device through cracks.\nATM Rating\nThere\u2019s another rating to consider for devices, especially for smartwatches; the ATM (Atmospheres) rating system indicates how much static atmospheric pressure a device can deal with while in water. It\u2019s actually an older rating system than the IP certification. A rating of 1 ATM means that you are at sea level, outside of water. If a device has a 1 ATM level listed, don\u2019t put it in water under any circumstances.\nThe system is actually much simpler to understand. Each ATM number represents about 10 meters of depth. So, if you have a device with an ATM 3 rating, you should be able to submerge it as deep as 30 meters. An ATM 10 rating increases the depth to 100 meters, and so on. These are usually used in smartwatches and other more specialized tech.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ATM rating system.\n| Rating | Pressure | Device Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rating 1 ATM | Pressure 0. | Device Meaning Do not put in water. |\n| Rating 3 ATM | Pressure Under 100 feet. | Device Meaning Device can be used in the rain, and protected against splashes. |\n| Rating 5 ATM | Pressure Under 165 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for short amounts of time submerged in water, like swimming in a pool. |\n| Rating 10 ATM | Pressure Under 330 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for much longer amounts of time submerged in water, such as for snorkeling in the ocean. |\n| Rating 20 ATM | Pressure Under 660 feet. | Device Meaning Device can handle being used for high impact water sports like surfing and jet skiing. |\nMilitary ready standards\nYou may be wondering if there are any tougher handsets out there. Military certifications guarantee \u201ccombat-ready\u201d smartphones that can handle all kinds of damage. MIL-STD-810G-certified smartphones go through a series of 29 tests. These include exposure to shock, vibration, heat, cold, gunfire shock, humidity, and more. You can learn more about these in the link below. There\u2019s also the improved MIL-STD-810H now, which goes through 30 tests.\nThese MIL-STD ratings are usually reserved for rugged devices. Here\u2019s our list of the best rugged phones, if you want to take a look at some options.\nLooking after your devices\nAn IP or ATM rating gives you peace of mind if you pick up your device with wet hands, accidentally drop it in the pool, or use it in the rain. Without it, there is no reassurance a device will survive some liquid exposure.\nHowever, that does not mean your smartphone is invincible. Here are some quick tips to ensure you will get the most out of your smartphone:\n- If you decide to take your phone in the water, make sure to cover all the ports. Those may include SIM and microSD card slots. Your USB power port may also have a cover.\n- If you take your phone into a chlorinated pool, wash it off with fresh water when you take it out. Don\u2019t use soap or chemicals.\n- Your phone should stay away from saltwater, like the water found in the ocean.\n- Avoid using your phone in extreme locations, including places with high heat, like a sauna, or rough environments.\n- If your phone goes into the water, dry it off thoroughly before plugging other accessories into their ports. That includes your USB phone charger or wired headphones if the phone has a headphone jack. Also, don\u2019t use a hairdryer to dry off your phone; use a dry cloth.\n- Remove any hair or other small objects that you might see inside your phone\u2019s covers and ports. Even small amounts of dirt could damage your microSD card slot, USB power ports, or headphone jack.\n- One last recommendation we can give you is to always have smartphone insurance. You never know when something can go wrong. Also, read your insurance\u2019s terms, as some might not cover water damage, especially when caused by willful actions.\nConsider getting a waterproof pouch\nIf you must take your phone underwater, we recommend investing in a second layer of protection. Waterproof pouches are a great way to keep your expensive electronics safe when submerged in liquids. Here\u2019s a really good one from CaliCase.\nFAQs\nIP ratings are standards that measure how much a product can withstand solids and liquids. It stands for Ingress Protection, and two numbers follow it. The first measures how much the unit can handle solids, while the second number measures liquid resistance.\nThe best smartphones usually come with an IP68 rating. This makes them dust-tight and protected against immersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Some rugged devices take it a step further and also get IP69 certification, which means they can withstand pressured hot water.\nSmartphones don\u2019t usually come with ATM ratings. These ratings are reserved for watches and other products you might take to deeper depths.\nThe most resistant rugged devices come with a MIL-STD rating. Usually MIL-STD-810H, but some devices still have the older MIL-STD-810G rating. These devices go through a wide variety of tests, and can generally handle more damage, such as shock, high pressures, extreme temperatures, and more.\nSome phones don\u2019t have excellent IP ratings. This means it might be unsafe to get them in contact with water. That said, you can always get a waterproof phone pouch and add a layer of protection to any device.\nSay the worst has already happened, and you\u2019ve already water-damaged your smartphone. We have a guide for fixing water-damaged phones. Just keep in mind none of these methods are guaranteed to work. You might need a new phone.

Without further ado, let\u2019s jump right in and discuss everything you need to know about the Google Pixel 9 series!\nExcellent build quality, refined design\nExtensive update policy\nExcellent build quality\nFlexible, capable cameras\nReliable update commitment\nGorgeous display\nSeven years of software updates\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 9 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 9 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a31,099\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro (1TB): $1,499 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (128GB): $1,099 / \u00a31,099\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nGoogle let it be known weeks in advance that it would launch the Pixel 9 series on August 13, 2024, and it followed through on that schedule. As always, the launch was part of Google\u2019s annual Made by Google event, which took place at the company\u2019s Mountain View headquarters.\nInitially, the Pixel line made a name for itself by offering a flagship-level device at a surprisingly affordable price. Unfortunately, slowly and steadily, these handsets have been getting increasingly expensive. In 2023, Google raised the prices of the Pixel line by $100. It has once again raised prices, but this time, only for the base model. The Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and the new 9 Pro XL start at $799, $999, and $1,099, respectively. Depending on where you purchase the XL, you may be able to get it at a lower price.\nWhile pre-orders have opened, you\u2019ll have to wait for on-shelf availability. In the US, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will hit store shelves on August 22. The wait will be a little longer for the Pixel 9 Pro rollout, which is scheduled to be generally available sometime in September.\nThe Pixel 9 series is available in all the usual markets where Pixel phones are sold. That includes the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Specs\nIf you\u2019re looking for a generational leap, the Pixel 9 series was given a handful of notable improvements over its predecessor. This includes factors like the display size, processor, battery, charging speeds, and so on. To get a sense of how it stacks up to the previous generation, be sure to check out our Pixel 8 vs Pixel 9 comparison.\nAs for how each Pixel 9 device compares to one another, here\u2019s a full spec sheet offering every detail you need to know:\n| Pixel 9 | Pixel 9 Pro | Pixel 9 Pro XL | |\n|---|---|---|---|\nDisplay | Pixel 9 6.3-inch OLED, 1,080 x 2,424 resolution, 422 PPI, 60-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 2,700 nits peak brightness | Pixel 9 Pro 6.3-inch LTPO OLED, 1,280 x 2,856 resolution, 495 PPI, 1-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 3,000 nits peak brightness | Pixel 9 Pro XL 6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 1,344 x 2,992 resolution, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, 3,000 nits peak brightness |\nProcessor | Pixel 9 Tensor G4 | Pixel 9 Pro Tensor G4 | Pixel 9 Pro XL Tensor G4 |\nRAM | Pixel 9 12GB | Pixel 9 Pro 16GB | Pixel 9 Pro XL 16GB |\nStorage | Pixel 9 128GB / 256GB | Pixel 9 Pro 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB | Pixel 9 Pro XL 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\nBattery | Pixel 9 4,700mAh | Pixel 9 Pro 4,700mAh | Pixel 9 Pro XL 5,060mAh |\nPower | Pixel 9 27W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share | Pixel 9 Pro 27W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share | Pixel 9 Pro XL 37W wired charging Wireless charging Battery Share |\nCameras | Pixel 9 Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 10.5MP, \u0192/2.2, 95-degree FoV | Pixel 9 Pro Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor - 48MP telephoto camera, \u0192/2.8, 22-degree FoV, 5x optical zoom, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 42MP, \u0192/2.2, 103-degree FoV | Pixel 9 Pro XL Rear: - 50MP wide camera, \u0192/1.68, 82-degree FoV, 1/1.31\" sensor - 48MP ultrawide camera, \u0192/1.7, 123-degree FoV, 1/2.55\" sensor - 48MP telephoto camera, \u0192/2.8, 22-degree FoV, 5x optical zoom, 1/2.55\" sensor Front: 42MP, \u0192/2.2, 103-degree FoV |\nVideo | Pixel 9 Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) | Pixel 9 Pro Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) | Pixel 9 Pro XL Rear: 4K (24/30/60 FPS) 1080p (24/30/60 FPS) Front: 4K (30/60 FPS) |\nConnectivity | Pixel 9 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) | Pixel 9 Pro 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) Ultra-wideband chip | Pixel 9 Pro XL 5G (mmWave + Sub6) Wi-Fi 7 (802.11/be) Bluetooth 5.3 (dual antenna) Ultra-wideband chip |\nSIM | Pixel 9 Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) | Pixel 9 Pro Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) | Pixel 9 Pro XL Dual SIM (Single Nano SIM and eSIM) |\nSecurity | Pixel 9 Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip | Pixel 9 Pro Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip | Pixel 9 Pro XL Face Unlock (Class 3) Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor Titan M2 chip |\nDurability | Pixel 9 IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 | Pixel 9 Pro IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 | Pixel 9 Pro XL IP68 Gorilla Glass Victus 2 |\nSoftware | Pixel 9 Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates | Pixel 9 Pro Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates | Pixel 9 Pro XL Android 14 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates |\nDimensions and weight | Pixel 9 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm 198g | Pixel 9 Pro 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm 199g | Pixel 9 Pro XL 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm 221g |\nColors | Pixel 9 Obsidian Porcelain Wintergreen Peony | Pixel 9 Pro Obsidian Porcelain Hazel Rose Quartz | Pixel 9 Pro XL Obsidian Porcelain Hazel Rose Quartz |\nGoogle Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL: Features\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a new Pixel launch without a slate of hardware and software upgrades. But what exactly has changed between last year and now? Google has fitted these phones with a bevy of features and they\u2019re slated to receive even more in future Pixel Feature Drops. But for now, let\u2019s keep our focus on what you\u2019re getting out of the box and in the near future.\nCamera\nSince the Pixel series hangs its hat on photography, let\u2019s first discuss the camera situation. Pixel phones are usually considered among the best camera phones money can buy. This is supported not only by the quality lenses sitting inside the camera bump, but also by the computational photography Google specializes in. Let\u2019s get into the specifics, starting with the Pixel 9 and moving our way up.\nThe base model has a 50MP primary camera with Octa PD \u2014 an auto-focus method used for large-sized sensors to achieve high sensitivity and high resolution. It has the same aperture (\u0192/1.68), field of view (82 degrees), and sensor size (1/1.31 inches) as the Pixel 8. In addition, the front camera, which is a 10.5MP lens, is also recycled from last year\u2019s model. But don\u2019t expect the whole camera array to be a copy, as the ultrawide has been upgraded from 12MP to 48MP. This ultrawide lens has an aperture of \u0192/1.7, FoV of 123 degrees, and a 1/2.55-inch sensor.\nThe Pixel 9 series should continue Google's excellent track record for making top-tier camera phones.\nNext, we have the Pixel 9 Pro that features a triple camera setup as it always has. That setup includes the same main and ultrawide cameras found in the entry model, but adds a 48MP telephoto to the mix with a \u0192/2.8 aperture, 22-degree FoV, and 1/2.55-inch sensor. However, we do get treated to an improved front camera. While the Pixel 8 Pro shared the same front camera as the Pixel 8, the Pixel 9 Pro jumps up from 10.5MP to 42MP with an \u0192/2.2 aperture and 103-degree ultrawide FoV. For the Pro XL, you\u2019ll be getting the same camera equipment you get with the Pixel 9 Pro.\nPerformance\nThe Pixel 9 series marks the debut of Tensor G4, the latest Google-designed processor. If everything plays out the way it should, this is likely the final Tensor chipset based on Samsung\u2019s Exynos design. It\u2019s believed that the next Tensor SoC will be entirely created from scratch and based on a TSMC processor node. But we\u2019re not here to talk about that right now, let\u2019s focus our attention on Tensor G4.\nAs expected, Tensor G4 makes improvements across the board in terms of performance. For example, web browsing is 20% faster, app launches are 17% faster, and the phone is more efficient for everyday use cases like taking photos or streaming content.\nTo accomplish these feats, the chip has been fitted with a number of upgrades, such as the new Samsung Modem 5400. Compared to the Samsung Modem 5300 in the Pixel 8 series, this modem is faster and more power efficient. In addition, the Tensor G4 has a more conventional 4+3+1 arrangement than the Tensor G3\u2019s 4+4+1 and uses newer ARMv9.2 cores from Arm (Cortex-A520, Cortex-A720, and Cortex-X4). These changes were made to help the unit run cooler and boost performance.\nMoving on to RAM and storage, RAM has gone up while the storage configurations are the same as before. That means the vanilla Pixel 9 gets 128GB or 256GB of storage but is now paired with 12GB of RAM. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL get 16GB of RAM with your choice of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB for storage.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why RAM has been increased across the board, it likely has to do with Google\u2019s AI features, as the technology can be rather demanding in the power department. As usual, storage is not expandable on the Pixel 9 series, so be sure to get the model with the most storage you can afford.\nScreen quality and size\nThe Pixel 9 series is slightly larger than the last generation, which allowed Google to fit in larger displays this time around. These displays have a few advantages over last year\u2019s lineup. Let\u2019s get into the specifics of what\u2019s different in 2024.\nThe Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro have many similarities, but the display is one area where they differ. Focusing on the Pixel 9, the OLED screen has grown 0.1 inches from last year to 6.3-inch. This Actua panel has a pixel density of 422 PPI, a resolution of 2,424 x 1,080, and a 60-120Hz refresh rate. Other than the refresh rate, which is the same, these are all upgrades compared to its predecessor. It also manages to improve the brightness, being capable of reaching a peak of 2,700 nits.\nWhich Pixel 9 series model is the better buy?\nThe Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s OLED display is also 6.3-inch, however, this handset uses an LTPO Super Actua screen. This means that Google\u2019s phone can get very bright \u2014 peaking at 3,000 nits \u2014 without sacrificing color vividness or clarity. It is also capable of dropping its 120Hz frame rate down to 1Hz for viewing static content, which can help save battery life. Choosing this phone over the base model will also get you a better resolution at 2,856 x 1,280 and more pixel density (495 PPI).\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL sets itself apart from the rest with a 6.8-inch OLED LTPO Super Actua display. Interestingly, this display boasts a lower pixel density than the Pro model, at 486 PPI. However, you likely won\u2019t notice the difference, especially given the fact that the panel has a higher resolution, at 2,992 x 1,344. Just like the Pro, it has 3,000 nits of brightness, and the refresh rate maxes out at 120Hz but can dip as low as 1Hz.\nThere is one thing that all three models share, and that is the aspect ratio. Just like in 2023, the new Pixel family has a 20:9 aspect ratio.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nThis year, Google arguably made the biggest design change to the Pixel since the Pixel 6. While not as drastic, the 2024 model transforms the handset\u2019s camera bar, which has become a defining feature for the line, into an oval-shaped camera pill. Furthermore, the squared-off edges used in previous generations have been sidelined for something a little more curvy, somewhat akin to the Pixel 8a. Along with the flat sides, the overall design appears to be inspired by Apple\u2019s iPhone.\nIn terms of dimensions, there\u2019s been a change in this area as well. When the Pixel 8 launched, it was smaller than the Pixel 7, but Google seems to have reversed course for the Pixel 9. The base and Pro models are slightly taller, wider, and less thick than the Pixel 8, measuring 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm. This also means that the Pro version is smaller, slimmer, and less thick than the Pixel 8 Pro. However, there\u2019s an almost negligible difference between the Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes in at 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm.\nThe Pixel 9 series makes some big changes to the Pixel aesthetic.\nMeanwhile, the flat display makes a return, as well as Gorilla Glass. The two biggest differences between this year and last year in terms of the panel are the increased screen sizes and now Gorilla Glass Victus 2 is applied across the line. Speaking of the screen sizes, the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro are now 6.3-inches and the Pro XL is 6.8-inches.\nMoving our attention to the build quality, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 can be found on both the front and back of the hardware. On the vanilla model, the glass has a polished finish, while the 9 Pro and Pro XL sport a silky matte finish. You can also expect a water and dust resistance rating of IP68. Although all three phones up Google\u2019s durability pedigree, you\u2019ll want to snag a suitable case. Thankfully, there are plenty of Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL cases, too.\nAs for the colors, Google is offering an extra option for all three models, bringing the total colorways to four. Each model will get Obsidian (black) and Porcelain (white), but there will be a few model-specific colors. The Pixel 9 will be losing Rose (dull pink) and Hazel (light gray/greenish) from last year, which are being replaced by Wintergreen (light green) and Peony (reddish pink). Meanwhile, the Pro and Pro XL lose Bay (blue), but gain Hazel and Rose Quartz (light pink).\nBattery life and charging speed\nIf you were hoping that Google would up the ante when it comes to the Pixel\u2019s battery, you\u2019ll be pleased to know the battery capacity has been increased. However, it may not be as big of a leap forward as you may have liked.\nStarting with the Pixel 9, Google gave its entry-level handset a 4,700mAh battery. This means that the Pixel 9\u2019s battery capacity is 125mAh higher than the Pixel 8\u2019s 4,575mAh battery. While it is nice to see the increase, you probably won\u2019t notice that much of a difference in real life. As far as charging is concerned, Google is still playing it safe with a 27W charging speed that can get you up to 55% full after 30 minutes.\nNext, we have the Pixel 9 Pro, which actually gets a bit of a downgrade. Like the base model, the Pro comes with a 4,700mAh battery, down from last year\u2019s 5,050mAh. This is likely due to the fact that the Pro has the same dimensions as the vanilla version. On top of that, the device also shares a charging speed of 27W.\nThe 9 Pro XL, on the other hand, has a build that\u2019s more similar to last year\u2019s 8 Pro. As such, this bigger phone comes with a larger 5,060mAh battery, a slight increase compared to the Pixel 8 Pro. For those wanting faster charging, this may be the Pixel you\u2019ve been waiting for, given its 37W charging rate. In the span of 30 minutes, Google says your battery should gain 70% of its juice back.\nThe tech giant didn\u2019t forget about wireless charging. All three models are 12W Qi-certified, so your wireless charger will still work. If you have the 2nd generation Pixel Stand with you, you can get 15W wireless charging on the Pixel 9, 21W wireless on the Pixel 9 Pro, and 23W wireless charging on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nAlso returning is Battery Share, which allows you to use the phone\u2019s battery to charge up other devices, such as the newly announced Pixel Buds Pro 2.\nThere\u2019s no charger in the box for either of these phones, but Google is also launching a 45W charger that can be purchased separately for $29.99. This charger will be available in all markets where the Pixel is sold. Interestingly, the fastest charging speed on the Pixel 9 series is 37W. Of course, you don\u2019t actually need Google\u2019s official charger as any 40W+ USB Power Delivery PPS charger will do the job nicely \u2014 check out our best wall charger and best Google Pixel 9 charger recommendations if you need one.\nSoftware and updates\nOne of the biggest surprises of the Pixel 9 series launch was the realization that it is arriving with Android 14 and not Android 15. Until now, every new Pixel launch has coincided with the rollout of a new Android version. If you\u2019re worried about whether this will count toward your major OS updates, you don\u2019t need to be. Google\u2019s update promise is linked to years, not a specific number.\nRegarding Google\u2019s update promise, every Pixel 9 model gets seven years of OS, security, and feature drop updates. This is the same number of years as promised for the Pixel 8 series, and it should still be plenty of support for most people.\nOn top of everything else, getting a Pixel 9 series will net you VPN by Google. This is a benefit you\u2019ll be able to enjoy for free, regardless of what model you purchase.\nFAQ\nNo, the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, nor the Pixel 9 Pro XL have microSD card slots. This is something Pixel phones have lacked for a long time.\nNo, the Pixel 9 series is not waterproof, but it is water-resistant with an IP68 rating. This means it can be submerged in water of up to 1.5m for up to 30 minutes, not indefinitely.\nNo. Like most phones these days, the Pixel line lost its headphone jack years ago and it hasn\u2019t come back.\nThank you for being part of our community.
