  "description": "With Labor Day just around the corner, many sunseekers are likely to be racing to book short-term rentals.",
  "content": "With Labor Day just around the corner, many sunseekers are likely to be racing to book short-term rentals.\n\nThat\u2019s because, judging by a recent spike in demand for vacation rentals in coastal areas of the U.S., anticipation is high that travelers will be seeking one last summer getaway.\n\nJuly demand for short-term rentals climbed to a record 26.4 million nights, up 3.6% compared with a year ago, according to the latest available figures from AirDNA, a firm that compiles and analyzes Vrbo and Airbnb data.\n\nEven economic uncertainty, weak employment numbers, and persistent affordability challenges could not stop Americans from indulging in travel in July\u2014that despite the average daily rate climbing nearly 6.9% year over year, to just over $351.\n\n\u201cSummer vacation is usually like the last thing someone\u2019s willing to give up,\u201d AirDNA Chief Economist Jamie Lane tells Realtor.com\u00ae. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot to cause people to pull back on those type of vacations.\u201d\n\nAnd Americans not only traveled but also chose larger, more expensive rental properties.\n\n\u201cSince February, demand for six-plus bedroom properties has grown more than 13 times faster than for single-bedroom listings, and about four times faster than for two-bedroom homes,\u201d says Bram Gallagher, AirDNA\u2019s director of economics and forecasting.\n\nHowever, occupancy averaged 67.4%, down 1.1% from a year ago, mostly because of an uptick in listings. But total nights booked rose 0.7% year over year.\n\nYear-to-date occupancy remains ahead of 2024 levels, and the latest pacing data points to a potentially stronger fourth quarter.\n\nForeign tourists turn their backs on U.S.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the heightened geopolitical tensions fueled by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with partner nations, international demand for short-term rentals plunged 16% from a year ago, led by a sharp decline in Canadian stays.\n\nAccording to AirDNA data, demand for short-term rentals in the U.S. among Canadian travelers dropped more that 48% from the same period in 2024.\n\nThis is consistent with a trend of Canadian second-home buyers increasingly retreating from U.S. markets in response to Trump\u2019s tariff policies.\n\nFortunately for AirBnB and Vrbo hosts, Americans filled the gap, driving the majority of summer bookings.\n\nRealtor.com senior economist Joel Berner says the historic surge in short-term rental (STR) demand is noteworthy because, generally, when the economy is tight, travel is one of the first industries to take a hit, because it heavily relies on discretionary spending.\n\n\u201cSTRs do not seem to be feeling this pinch this summer, with the number of nights stayed exceeding last year,\u201d Berner notes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, revenue per available rental (RevPAR)\u2014a measure of how well a property generates revenue for each night of booking\u2014edged up 5.7% annually to $237, driven by steeper rates.\n\nHere are the areas where short-term rental revenue growth has been the strongest:\n\nCoastal areas stood out for registering the highest RevPAR growth in July, led by Maui, HI, which saw a 17.3% year-over-year surge, even as it continued to recover from the deadly 2023 wildfires that ravaged the town of Lahaina on the island\u2019s northwest coast.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been much, or any, supply growth in Maui; there\u2019s actually been slight supply decline,\u201d says Lane. \u201cSo if the same or more people are coming to the area and there\u2019s fewer listings available, that increases occupancy, and then allows those hosts to charge higher rates as well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lane, Maui\u2019s tourism turned a corner this year following the disruption caused by the fires.\n\n\u201cLast year, people were avoiding Maui,\u201d says the economist. \u201cThere was still a lot of, I would say, misunderstanding of whether people were allowed to travel to Maui, whether Maui was welcoming tourists or not welcoming tourists. So now that it\u2019s clear that Maui\u2019s more open, we have seen demand come back much more strongly.\u201d\n\nHowever, Maui\u2019s short-term rental sector is currently in a state of flux, as the Maui County Council is considering a bill to ban short-term rentals in areas dominated by multifamily housing.\n\nProperty owners in condo complexes that will be affected should the legislation pass tell Maui Now they are considering taking legal action to protect their investments.\n\nProposed by Maui Mayor Richard Bissen last year, Bill 9 is designed to boost the island\u2019s long-term housing supply following the loss of thousands of single-family homes and apartments in the wildfires.\n\nMaui County still boasts the largest number of short-term rentals in the Aloha State both in terms of available nights and inventory, with an estimated 10,666 units, which accounts for nearly 15% of the area\u2019s entire housing stock, according to the 2025 Hawaii Housing Factbook.\n\nWithin the contiguous United States, South Carolina stood out with two coastal towns showing some of the nation\u2019s strongest short-term revenue growth.\n\nDespite having a year-round population of just 40,000 inhabitants, Hilton Head Island, SC, attracts over 2.5 million visitors every year.\n\nWith more than 100 miles of scenic trails and two dozen golf courses, Hilton Head is a favorite among tourists who enjoy sports and the outdoors.\n\nLocated about 100 miles to the north, Charleston, SC, ranked third in RevPAR growth, posting a 14.5% rise in revenue compared with July 2024, largely driven by higher rates.\n\nA charming oceanside city of horse-drawn carriages, celebrated Lowcountry cooking, and well-preserved antebellum architecture, Charleston attracts an estimated 7 million tourists annually. In 2024, close to 8 million people visited \u201cThe Holy City,\u201d according to data from the College of Charleston\u2019s Office of Tourism Analysis, reported by Charleston City Paper.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\nEvery adult per trip spent an average of $1,105 last year, generating a record-breaking total economic impact of $14 billion for the city.\n\nLane, with AirDNA, says coastal hot spots like Hilton Head and Charleston have seen their popularity surge among domestic travelers, further bolstered by a slight slowdown in outbound international travel this summer.\n\n\u201cPeople want to go to the beach in the summer, and markets that are sort of attractive have some of the best beaches around the country,\u201d he says.\n\nBerner agrees that U.S. short-term rental markets have benefited from Americans opting to vacation domestically this summer rather than traveling abroad.\n\n\u201cThe luxury segment of STRs appears to be driving growth, and one reason for this may be the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cFamilies who otherwise may have gone abroad this summer may be choosing to vacation stateside this year where their money goes further, and these families are choosing high-dollar rental properties in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThis potentially spells good news for those looking to purchase an investment property as a short-term rental, following a rough patch for the industry marked by oversupply and a lack of demand, which drove revenues down in many areas.\n\nSupply of short-term rentals stumbled in July after two months of growth, with STR listings rising 4.6%, down from 5.7% in June.\n\nGallagher says that if the Federal Reserve follows through with a widely anticipated interest rate cut in September, STR supply could see stronger growth, as more people would be willing to purchase investment properties to rent out.\n\n\u201cThis summer\u2019s data should signal that STRs can still be a good investment, or at least a way to help finance a vacation home purchase,\u201d concurs Berner. \u201cMany would-be vacation-home buyers are staring down still-high mortgage rates as another blocker, but we anticipate a bit more relief on the rate front through the rest of 2025.\u201d",

Despite economic uncertainty, weak employment numbers, and affordability challenges, Americans continued to travel and chose larger, more expensive rental properties. Since February, demand for six-plus bedroom properties has grown more than 13 times faster than for single-bedroom listings. Despite this, occupancy averaged 67.4%, down 1.1% from a year ago, and total nights booked rose 0.7% year over year, indicating a potential stronger fourth quarter.

      "text": "These southern US cities are the best for renters: Report\nA new study has found that a handful of American metros offer renters a significantly higher quality of life.\nAccording to RentCafe\u2019s \u201cBest Cities for Renters to Live in 2024\u201d report, out earlier this month, a number of Sun Belt cities are measurably better for tenants.\nCharleston, South Carolina has, for the second consecutive year, gotten the gold in this regard \u2014 followed by Atlanta and, in third place, Sarasota, Florida.\nTo determine the winners of its annual best city analysis, RentCafe considered 150 US cities based on 20 metrics that fall into three categories: Cost of living and housing (average apartment size, occupancy rate, share of new apartments, etc.); local economy (unemployment rate, job growth); and quality of life (average air quality, average school quality).\nThe South outshined all other regions overall, offering \u201coptions that cater to nearly every renter\u2019s preference,\u201d the report stated.\nCharleston in particular offers a cost of living below the national average, abundant career opportunities and a booming tourism industry.\nIf looking specifically at the western US, the cities of Scottsdale and nearby Gilbert, Arizona; Boise, Idaho; and Denver Colorado took the cake for best urban hubs in the area. Thriving local economies, and reasonable costs of living and housing, helped these areas stand out.\nFor the Midwest, Rochester Minnesota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Minneapolis came out on top.\nIn the northeast, many cities ranked near the bottom of RentCafe\u2019s list, with Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City close to dead last in overall rank thanks to their high occupancy rates, small apartment sizes and exorbitant costs of living. (Newark, New Jersey took home the official title of dead last.)\nStamford, Connecticut and Boston, meanwhile, didn\u2019t fare so badly, coming in 10th and 11th respectively and notably boasting \u201clarge shares of apartments in prime locations, offering renters the advantage of picturesque surroundings,\u201d RentCafe noted."

      "text": "You can still rent a Hamptons home for summer 2025 \u2014 if you think outside the box\nIn spring, the poolside conversation at the Setai in Miami Beach turns to the Hamptons: \u201cWho is paying these prices?\u201d someone asks. \u201cWhere are they coming from?\u201d \u201cShould we go to St. Tropez instead?\u201d\nThis season, the search for the perfect summer rental is leaving these masters of the universe at an unfamiliar loss. Brokers say their frustration is understandable. Each year, the same Hamptons houses come up for rent again and again. And each year they depreciate \u2014 their furnishings wear, along with their novelty.\nYet demand and asking prices are going up, not down. And while new rentals do hit the market, the inventory of deluxe summer palaces that tick the vast checklists top renters demand remains miniscule.\n\u201cMarch was insane,\u201d says Compass broker Yorgos Tsibiridis, who is currently listing a quirky-cool four-bedroom waterfront home at 54 Bay View Drive in Sag Harbor for $360,000 from July through Labor Day. \u201cAnd the money people are spending! It\u2019s the strongest rental season I have seen. I have a couple houses in Amagansett and honestly I could have rented them over and over, like 10 times.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a sour pickle for the Setai set to swallow. They\u2019re happy plunking down $1 million for the season, but they expect quality in return: homes built within the last five years, fresh interiors, a beautiful yard, a large pool with a hot tub, proximity to the ocean or a village and a minimum of six or seven bedrooms.\nGood luck with that this season, says Tsibiridis, with as few as 30 to 50 new homes meeting that criteria on the market from East Hampton to Montauk, and many times that number of interested parties. \u201cThe more expensive houses are the ones that are in most demand right now,\u201d he says. So what gives? \u201cThis year we had a flood of people from LA [due to the January wildfires]. They moved to New York and now they want a house in the Hamptons. I\u2019m also noticing more people this year from Miami and Palm Beach.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s a choosy renter to do? Try something new. Consider something with historic charm, like 10 & 12 Fair Lea Road in Southampton. It\u2019s one of the village\u2019s 19th-century originals, with a conspicuous octagonal turret reminiscent of a lighthouse.\nThis 13-bed classic is asking $1.35 million for Memorial to Labor Day with Erica Grossman of Douglas Elliman.\nOr if you\u2019ve never strayed from the beach, explore the eight-bed estate at 10 Morgan Hill Way in Bridgehampton.\nYes, it\u2019s an impatient six-minute drive to the sand, but what you get in return is 1.4 acres of lawn-pool-and-tennis, surrounded by hectares of protected farmland.\nIt\u2019s asking $950,000 for the season with Compass\u2019 Breitenbach Advisory Team.\nWhichever high-impact home you choose, you won\u2019t have to sacrifice splendor."

Could it stand up in court?\nAt about 70 condo complexes where short-term rentals could become illegal under a proposed bill before the Maui County Council, property owners have been watching, waiting and talking with their lawyers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see if it does pass, and if it does, along with our attorney, we\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d said Cindy Bulger, president of the board at the 188-unit Hale Kamaole in K\u012bhei. \u201cI can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve made any final decision. I think we really want to review our options before we make a decision on that.\u201d\nHJI Weekly Newsletter\nGet more stories like these delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for the Hawai\u2018i Journalism Initiative's weekly newsletter:\nAt the 296-unit Wailea Ekahi, also in South Maui, Board President Lynn Peabody expects the impacts of the bill to lead to legal challenges.\n\u201cSpeaking only on behalf of Wailea Ekahi owners, we will certainly evaluate the potential impacts of Bill 9 and explore our courses of action, legal and otherwise,\u201d Peabody said.\nThey\u2019re among the condo owners and condo associations weighing their options should the county pass a bill to phase out more than 7,000 short-term rentals in apartment districts, which was proposed by Mayor Richard Bissen in May 2024 and recommended by a Maui County Council committee in a 6-3 vote in July after days of impassioned testimony both for and against it.\nIf Bill 9 passes the full council, it will be one of the state\u2019s biggest short-term rental overhauls since 2022, when Honolulu County\u2019s attempt to regulate short-term rentals was blocked by a court ruling. That ruling prompted state lawmakers to pass a bill in 2024 to make clear the counties\u2019 power over short-term rental operations.\nMaui County attorneys believe Bill 9 can hold up in court, but they\u2019ve been careful not to reveal their strategies should they wind up in a legal battle.\n\u201cOur office has thoroughly reviewed Bill 9 and is confident that it complies with state law, the federal and state constitutions, and is squarely within Council\u2019s authority,\u201d the Department of Corporation Counsel said in a statement to the Hawai\u2018i Journalism Initiative last month.\nSpurred by the loss of thousands of homes and apartments following the 2023 wildfires, Maui County became the latest major destination trying to boost its long-term housing supply by cutting down on the short-term rental market. Despite a year of uncertainty over Bill 9, Maui County continues to have the largest short-term rental supply of all four counties both in terms of available nights as well as inventory, with an estimated 10,666 units, making up about 14.8% of its total housing stock, according to the 2025 Hawai\u2018i Housing Factbook.\nIn other places with abundant vacation rentals such as San Francisco, New York City and Barcelona, different versions of restrictions or bans have been tried, often with legal backlash.\nIn April 2022, the Honolulu City Council passed a bill that raised the required minimum stay for short-term rentals from 30 days to 90 days in most residential zones, with the change set to take effect in six months. That sparked a lawsuit from the Hawai\u2018i Legal Short-Term Rental Alliance, which claimed the bill wasn\u2019t constitutional and would take away their property rights.\nA federal judge blocked the ordinance before it could be enforced in October 2022. The judge said state law prevented the city from passing laws that prohibited properties from continuing lawful uses.\nLast year, state lawmakers passed a bill that clarified the counties\u2019 authority to control the time, place, manner and duration of land uses, particularly short-term rentals. The day before Gov. Josh Green signed it into law, Bissen announced Maui County\u2019s proposal to phase out vacation rentals in apartment districts.\nSupporters of the bill say it will free up thousands of potential long-term rentals on an island where many people are still displaced by the 2023 wildfires. Opponents say it will deal a major blow to Maui\u2019s tourism-reliant economy and result in job loss.\nA University of Hawai\u2018i Economic Research Organization report reflected both points of view, finding that the policy could add more than 6,000 units to the long-term housing stock but cut property and business tax revenues by a combined $75 million each year.\nCal Chipchase, partner at the Honolulu-based law firm Cades Schutte and chair of the Real Estate Disputes Group, said the takeaway from Honolulu\u2019s case was the counties\u2019 need for clear authorization to change or phase out existing property uses.\n\u201cI think that the (State) Legislature and the counties took that lesson to heart,\u201d said Chipchase, a litigator who has taught courses on real property and land use at the University of Hawai\u2018i William S. Richardson School of Law for nearly 20 years.\nEven with the changes, Chipchase acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s legal risk associated with any measure that a council passes, particularly when you\u2019re phasing out uses that have been historically on the books for many, many years.\u201d\nIf the bill passes, he said he expects lawsuits to follow.\nGreg Kugle of the law firm Damon Key Leong Kupchak Hastert was certain of the risk, saying in a statement to the Hawai\u02bbi Journalism Initiative: \u201cThe County of Maui will be sued if it passes the unconstitutional Bill 9.\u201d\n\u201cThe U.S. and Hawaii constitutions prevent counties from taking private property without just compensation,\u201d said Kugle, who represented the Hawai\u02bbi Legal Short-Term Rental Alliance against the City and County of Honolulu. \u201cBill 9 has no mechanism for payment of just compensation to landowners making it constitutionally suspect.\u201d\nAt Wailea Ekahi, Peabody says the goal of providing more housing for Maui residents is \u201ccommendable,\u201d but she worries there is not a clear solution for the impacts on owners and Maui\u2019s financial structure.\n\u201cStepping back from the bill and spending time better considering how to deal with the ramifications of its passage would serve Maui well, and in all likelihood, help minimize the related legal challenges,\u201d Peabody said.\nCondos in apartment districts on Maui have had the right to operate short-term rentals for decades under a series of legal protections and a key legal opinion in 2001 by Deputy Corporation Counsel Richard Minatoya. This opinion primarily grandfathered in short-term rentals in Maui\u2019s apartment zones that had been operating as vacation rentals before March of 1991, becoming known as the Minatoya List.\nThe bill exclusively applies to condos on this list.\nThe Maui Vacation Rental Association said in testimony to the council\u2019s Housing and Land Use Committee in July that removing short-term rentals in apartment districts \u201cwould create a significant legal risk and undermine the integrity of the County\u2019s own historical land use decisions.\u201d\nCaitlin Miller, executive director of the association, told the Hawai\u2018i Journalism Initiative via email: \u201cAs an advocacy organization, we can\u2019t speak to the legality of Bill 9, but we do expect it will face legal challenges if passed.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, the courts will have to weigh long-standing property rights and codified uses against the County\u2019s authority. Maui is also operating under a different framework than Honolulu was in 2022, but it will be up to the courts to decide,\u201d Miller said.\nCounty attorneys and council officials have been careful about what they say publicly about the bill.\nDavid Raatz, director of the Office of Council Services, said most of the discussions over the legality of the bill happened at two executive sessions during the council committee meetings in July.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at liberty to disclose what is discussed in executive sessions,\u201d said Raatz, who served as a county legislative attorney for nearly two decades.\nKristin Tarnstrom is among the county attorneys that has spent the last year reviewing the bill and poring over related laws and legal precedents.\n\u201cOur consensus is that it is legally sound, defensible, and within the rights of the County Council to do it,\u201d said Tarnstrom, who has 11 years of experience with the Department of Corporation Counsel, including 10 on the litigation side.\nBecause the county \u201ccan\u2019t anticipate exactly what the lawsuits will look like,\u201d the best way it can prepare is to ensure that it\u2019s as \u201clegally sound as possible,\u201d she said.\nShe declined to comment on the reasons she believed it was defensible, because \u201cit just gets sticky from a litigation standpoint for us to talk about any strategy.\u201d\nWailuku attorney Lance Collins said he thinks the bill is constitutional. He explained that private property owners are protected by the Fifth Amendment, which requires the federal government to pay compensation if it takes private property for a public use.\nThat can either mean an actual physical \u201ctaking\u201d or regulations that limit how the property can be used and denies the owner \u201call economically beneficial or productive use of the land,\u201d Collins said in a June 30 analysis done at the request of the Maui Tomorrow Foundation.\nCourts use a three-part test to decide if the government is taking something from a property owner based on a 1978 case in New York City, Collins explained. The Penn Central Transportation Company, which owned Grand Central Terminal, wanted to build a multistory office building above the train station, but because the terminal was a historical landmark, the city rejected the proposal. Penn Central sued, alleging the city took away its rights above the terminal without compensating the company. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the city.\nIn cases like these, Collins said, three main factors come into play: the economic impact on the property owner, the extent to which the regulation interfered with the owner\u2019s expectations at the time it invested in the property, and the character of the government action, Collins said.\nIf short-term rental owners sue Maui County, Collins thinks they may argue that Bill 9 would result in economic loss and impact the expectations they had when they bought the unit. And while he acknowledged that converting short-term rentals to long-term rentals could make it less profitable, it wouldn\u2019t take away all of the economic benefit to owners.\n\u201cOne of the costs of business \u2026 is that regulation changes,\u201d Collins told the Hawai\u2018i Journalism Initiative. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a legitimate claim of entitlement to run your business the way you want to forever without any changes.\u201d\nGiving people a few years to get a return on their investment and minimize their losses \u201csignificantly strengthens\u201d the county\u2019s position, Collins said.\nCollins pointed out that government has the right to change its regulations, especially if they can show it\u2019s for public benefit.\n\u201cIf somebody\u2019s investment could basically stop the government from regulating \u2026 that would grind government to a halt,\u201d Collins said.\nMatt Jachowski, executive assistant to Mayor Bissen, said that the median owner of a Bill 9 short-term rental bought their property in August 2016. At the time, the median price of a condo was $420,000, according to Realtors Association of Maui data. Even if Bill 9 passes and they\u2019re no longer allowed to operate, they\u2019ve still had years to get a return on their investment and will have an adjustment period as well, he said.\nAs of June, vacation rentals in Maui County were going for an average daily rate of $464 in June, tied for the highest among the state\u2019s counties, according to state tourism data.\n\u201cAny investment comes with risk, right? And in particular when you\u2019re looking at short-term rentals, a major form of risk is regulatory risk \u2026 and that\u2019s not unique to Maui County,\u201d Jachowski said.\nChipchase said the adjustment period is likely something the courts would look at if there were lawsuits.\nHe said it was \u201csmart\u201d of the council to extend the bill\u2019s original timeframe, which at the time it was announced in May 2024 set a deadline of July 2025 for West Maui properties and Jan. 1, 2026 for all other areas. In his experience on land use cases, Chipchase said, \u201cI always looked at five years, if done correctly, as being a reasonable period.\u201d Anything less could be risky, he added.\nUnder the current version of the bill, properties in West Maui, where the housing crisis is seen as even more dire after the fires, would have three years, until Dec. 31, 2028 to adjust, while properties in all other areas would have five years, until Dec. 31, 2030.\nChipchase said he thinks it\u2019s possible to defend a bill like Maui County\u2019s with the phaseout of uses over a period of time.\n\u201cBut I think there\u2019s risk and I think it\u2019s very important that it be done correctly in terms of the time allowed and in terms of the justification for the phaseout as well as its scope,\u201d he said.\nChipchase emphasized that he was commenting solely on the legal merits of the bill and not on the pros or cons of the policy. He declined to comment on whether he was representing any clients with interest in the bill, saying that \u201cwhatever final decision the county makes on the bill, I have many clients who will be affected by it.\u201d\nThe bill was originally set for a first reading with the full council next month but Raatz said Friday that the schedule is now in flux and there was no hard date set yet."

      "text": "Temperatures drop as summer winds down during Labor Day weekend\nAs Americans celebrate summer\u2019s last big weekend, a vast majority of the nation will do so without significant weather impacts. But Mother Nature does look to dampen the holiday weekend spirits for parts of the Plains and Gulf Coast.\nWhile dry elsewhere, much of the U.S. will be running cooler than average, which may make those last-minute vacations feel a bit brisk. Below-average temperatures are expected to settle in through at least Labor Day.\nSaturday: Sunshine State becomes the soggy state\nAs we begin the weekend, let\u2019s get to the bad news first. Rain chances are up across Florida and the southern and northern Plains on Saturday and Sunday.\nFlorida\u2019s soggy stretch with afternoon thunderstorms might limit beach time for some, but early risers can still hit the sand with plenty of time left in the day.\nThe highest rainfall totals are along the Atlantic beaches, with 2-3 inches possible by the end of the weekend near Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\nMeanwhile, a low-pressure system will begin its slow trek from the Rockies into the Plains on Saturday. With daytime heating and plentiful moisture being pulled north, afternoon storms will develop with high rainfall rates that will increase the flooding risk, according to the FOX Forecast Center.\nRainfall rates may reach 1-2 inches per hour. A level 2/4 flash flood risk exists across South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.\nSaturday will be the busiest travel day of the weekend.\n\u201cThe worst times to drive over the holiday weekend are typically in the afternoon and early evening,\u201d the AAA said. \u201cSaturday is expected to be extra busy with many drivers heading out of town or taking day trips.\u201d\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s warm and dry in the West and Great Lakes.\nSunday: Clear across the mid-Atlantic\nIn the mid-Atlantic, the FOX Forecast Center has pegged Ocean City, Maryland, as a true winner for the weekend. With high temperatures in the lower 70s and no rain, it will be a perfect beach weekend to say farewell to summer.\nMeanwhile, Hilton Head, South Carolina, is looking at higher rain chances on Sunday and Labor Day.\nFarther west, a stalled front will keep things rainy throughout most of the week across the Southwest and southern Plains.\nNOAA\u2019s Weather Prediction Center has put a bull\u2019s-eye in the nation\u2019s heartland for continued risk of flash flooding.\nFlash flooding is possible across this area as rain and storm chances continue through Monday.\nMeanwhile, farther south, scattered showers and thunderstorms will roam around large swaths of Texas and New Mexico, but no severe weather is expected. In fact, NOAA\u2019s Storm Prediction Center wasn\u2019t highlighting any area in the nation for a severe weather risk throughout the holiday weekend.\nLabor Day: Cooler for many, still hot for West Coast\nLabor Day Monday again looks tranquil for just about the entire nation, with pleasant conditions across much of the Northeast and the West Coast. For the East, relatively cool air will continue to push in from Canada, leaving temperatures about 10-15 degrees below average.\nScattered showers still dot the weather map across the Plains and Mississippi Valley back into Texas and the Desert Southwest, but no severe or overwhelming rains are predicted.\nThe West will remain warm-to-hot with 90s expected in Southern California up through the Intermountain West and into Montana.\nAs far as the tropics go, FOX Weather Hurricane Specialist Bryan Norcross said overall conditions are hostile to any development.\n\u201cMost likely, significant development won\u2019t restart until the second week or maybe the middle of September.\u201d"

      "text": "Considering a room revamp, but not sure where to begin\u2014or how much to invest? In our latest series, One-Room Renos, we explore renovation projects big and small, from soft-good upgrades you can accomplish in a weekend to total overhauls that cost a small fortune and last for months (or longer).\nToday, an interior designer and mother of a Purdue University student shares how she made a bare-bones double dorm room feel cozy and chic\u2014without breaking the bank.\nMy daughter and her roommate at Purdue are both on the dance team. They wanted their room to be comfortable and serene, with clean lines, a neutral aesthetic, and pops of pink.\nThe girls love their room, and I think it inspires them to be tidy. When you have a pretty space, you want to keep it that way. Plus, some of the bigger-ticket items, like the headboard, can be used throughout their time in college.\nMy daughter posted a photo of her room on her Instagram, and I did, too. There was a big response. That led me to start Dorm Rooms of Purdue. I now help other parents with their kids\u2019 dorm rooms\u2014and not just at Purdue. I have one client in Dubai who hired me to help set up her son\u2019s dorm room in Washington, D.C. Large construction projects are my bread and butter; this is more of a passion project.\nThey both pulled inspiration photos. Then we went back and forth with calls and texts for a couple months. We made a lot of plans but couldn\u2019t finalize anything until we got our actual room assignment.\nThe dorms are having a housing crisis, sometimes putting three people in a two-person room. That means we didn\u2019t know the size or layout or if we were going to have the extra-large twin beds or bunk beds, for starters. And even after we got the room assignment\u2014in Meredith Hall, one of the older Purdue dorms\u2014there were still a lot of unknowns.\nLuckily, I\u2019ve worked as an interior designer for years, so it\u2019s easy for me to see a space and have a sense of dimensions. I guessed about a few things, and my guesses were fairly accurate.\nThe biggest mistake you can make is to go overboard and cram too much in. People tend to think they can fit everything in there.\nBesides space\u2014the room is just 206 square feet\u2014we couldn\u2019t paint the walls and had to leave the curtains. I would\u2019ve picked different curtains.\nTypically, the way a dorm-room install works is that each of the two roommates gets a different move-in time\u2014but we chose to meet up at the same time and work together. Before we started, we cleaned and wiped everything down. Once the girls decided which side they wanted, we put the rug and furniture in place. After that, we brought in all the soft goods and everything else. The whole process took about six to eight hours.\nMy husband and I had set aside money because we knew this was coming.\nI asked if she was good with me doing most of the shopping, and could reimburse me. She agreed, so I sourced a lot of the stuff. We divided up the costs of the bigger items that the girls shared, like the fridge and microwave.\nEverything looked expensive, but the prices were reasonable. You don\u2019t have to spend a lot for good design\u2014you just need to know where to shop.\nI\u2019m at Home Goods and T.J.Maxx several times every week for my interior design and home-staging business.\nI scooped up deals as I found them. I found Kate Spade towels, bed-in-a-bag, and footstools at T.J.Maxx, for example.\nWhen you\u2019re designing a small space, start with the rug. It\u2019s easier to find bedding that matches the rug than vice versa. I also wanted to pick something that we wouldn\u2019t hang onto past that year. These girls are very clean, but a dorm room rug is gross by the end of the year.\nWe made custom artwork to hang above the beds. Both girls chose to have the same artwork, so it matched. It ended up becoming so popular that I worked with and paid a fee to Purdue so I could use the Purdue name and Purdue colors legally and create affordable art prints for other kids. There\u2019s so much artwork on Etsy that doesn\u2019t pay these licensing fees, but I\u2019m a rule-follower.\nI didn\u2019t think the room would have space for a TV, but the other mother found a wire rack that was very sturdy, and they put it at the end of her daughter\u2019s bed so both girls could watch TV. It was a good design choice because when you walked in, you didn\u2019t see it.\nA couch. People often ask me if they can fit a couch. You just can\u2019t. You can't make the room any bigger.\nHow much my daughter loves it. Here\u2019s what she has to say: \u201cI\u2019m glad we took the time to do this. I\u2019m so busy with the dance team and my sorority, so it\u2019s nice to have this space to come back to. All the decor makes our dorm room feel safe and very homey.\u201d\nThe realtor.com\u00ae editorial team highlights a curated selection of product recommendations for your consideration; clicking a link to the retailer that sells the product may earn us a commission."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "Purpose:\nBill 9\u2019s purpose is to discontinue transient vacation rental use in apartment districts over the course of a defined phase-out or amortization period.\nBackground:\nOrdinance 1797 took effect in 1989 and amended the Maui County Code\u2019s Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance to require that buildings and structures within the apartment districts be occupied on a long-term-residential basis\u2014defined as a continuous period of six months or more per year. Exceptions were granted for structures that had received certain county approvals by April 20, 1989, which allowed some multi-unit buildings in the apartment districts to have transient vacation rentals as lawful nonconforming uses.\nIn 2014, the Maui County Council enacted a new law, Ordinance 4167, which put Ordinance 1797\u2019s exceptions into the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance and allowed certain apartment-zoned structures to have transient vacation rentals. The law has since been modified several times to add criteria to qualify for the exceptions.\nJustification:\nMaui County has a longstanding housing crisis, worsened by the August 2023 wildfires, which destroyed over 5,400 households and displaced 12,000 residents.\nThe bill aims to increase the availability of long-term housing in the county.\nPhase-out or amortization period:\nAs of May 3, 2024, Subsection 46-4(a), Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes, provides that, \u201cover a reasonable period of time,\u201d uses that allow transient accommodations \u201cmay be phased out or amortized in any zoning district by county zoning regulations.\u201d\nMayor Richard T. Bissen, Jr. has proposed to phase out transient vacation rental use in the apartment districts by July 1, 2028.\nHousing and Land Use Committee Chair Tasha Kama has submitted an amendment to extend the phase-out period to July 1, 2030.\nFAQs on Bill 9\n1. What is Bill 9?\nBill 9 is the Bissen administration\u2019s proposal to phase out transient vacation rental use in apartment districts.\n2. What would be affected by Bill 9?\nBill 9 would affect apartment-zoned properties that are now used for transient vacation rentals, including those in H\u0101na, South Maui, West Maui and Molokai.\n3. What is a transient vacation rental, also known as a TVR?\n\u201cTransient vacation rentals or use,\u201d as defined in the Maui County Code, means \u201coccupancy of a dwelling or lodging unit by transients for any period of less than one hundred eighty days, excluding bed and breakfast homes and short-term rental homes.\u201d\nWhile some exceptions apply, the zoning code\u2019s general definition of a \u201ctransient\u201d is:\n\u201cany person who owns, rents, or uses a lodging or dwelling unit, or portion of it, for less than one hundred eighty days and whose permanent address for legal purposes is not the lodging or dwelling unit occupied by the person.\u201d\nTVRs include hotels, and they are permitted uses in designated zoning districts.\nBed and breakfast homes and short-term rental homes are other types of transient accommodations that are allowed in certain zoning districts, if they qualify for permits.\n4. Why is Bill 9 under consideration?\nMaui County has a housing shortage, which was worsened by the August 2023 wildfires. The bill aims to end TVR use in apartment-zoned districts in the hope of converting them to residential use and helping to ease the housing shortage. The planning director submitted the bill on the mayor\u2019s behalf in December 2024.\nThe Maui County Charter requires the Maui County Council to consider zoning proposals submitted by the planning director. The council chair referred the bill to the council\u2019s Housing and Land Use Committee, which has been meeting on the bill since June 2025, following the council\u2019s annual budget session.\n5. What would happen to current TVRs in apartment-zoned districts if Bill 9 were enacted?\nExisting TVRs in apartment districts would be able to continue operating until the amortization period ends. Proposals under consideration would set the amortization period to last until July 1, 2028, or July 1, 2030, but other dates could also be considered. Once the period ends, TVR uses in the apartment districts would have to stop.\n6. What is the proposed \u201camortization period\u201d or \u201cphase-out period?\u201d\nThe amortization or phase-out period is the time during which current TVR operators would still be able to conduct TVR uses in their apartment-zoned properties. Operators would have to stop conducting TVR uses when the period ends.\n7. Would this bill affect B&B, STRHs, or time shares?\nBill 9 would not affect bed and breakfast homes permitted under Chapter 19.64, Maui County Code, or short-term rental homes permitted under Chapter 19.65, Maui County Code. Time shares would also be unaffected.\n8. Would property owners be able to convert their TVRs to long-term rentals?\nProperty owners may convert their apartment-zoned properties to residential use now or at any other time, whether Bill 9 gets enacted or not.\n9. Would there be a process for appealing or requesting an exemption?\nAs introduced, Bill 9 would not provide exemptions or an appeal process. Property owners wishing to continue conducting TVR uses could consider applying with the Department of Planning for a zoning change, bed and breakfast home permit, short-term rental home permit or conditional permit.\n10. How would this legislation impact Maui County\u2019s economy and tourism industry?\nNo one can predict for certain what the economic impact would be if Bill 9 is enacted as an ordinance. But the following analytical reports are available in a document prepared for Council Chair Alice L. Lee at https://tinyurl.com/Bill9Reports:\n- \u201cAn Economic Analysis of the Proposal to Phase Out Transient Vacation Rentals in Maui County Apartment Districts,\u201d dated March 31, 2025, by the Economic Research Organization at the University of Hawai\u02bbi for Hawai\u2018i Community Foundation.\n- \u201cState of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui Economic and Fiscal Impacts of the Short-Term Rental Industry,\u201d dated June 12, 2024, by Kloninger & Sims Consulting LLC for the Travel Technology Association.\n- The planning director\u2019s report on the mayor\u2019s proposal to phase out TVRs in the A-1 and A-2 zoning districts, dated June 25, 2024.\n11. Who can I contact for more information?\nWhile Bill 9 is still under consideration by the Maui County Council, please contact the Office of Council Services for information on the bill\u2019s status at county.council@mauicounty.us or (808) 270-7664.\nIf Bill 9 gets enacted, please contact the Department of Planning for information on the bill\u2019s implementation at planning@mauicounty.gov or (808) 270-7735."

      "text": "Southampton bans short-term rentals in move that officially cancels weekend trips to Hamptons: \u2018Out of luck\u2019\nIt\u2019s the end of the Southampton girls\u2019 weekend.\nTony Southampton has banned short-term home rentals after crabby locals complained that weekend warriors\u2019 all-night \u201cragers\u201d were keeping them up too late and making the ritzy beachside village unbearable.\nThe measure \u2014 passed 4-1 by the village board of trustees on Aug. 19 \u2014 sets a new two-week minimum for home rentals across the ritzy beachside locale, effectively banning weekend trips for anyone who can\u2019t shell out for a hotel or fork over thousands of dollars typically required to hold a house for 14 days.\nThat means Hamptons trips \u2014 which already cost between $900 and $2,000 for a weekend stay \u2014 could now cost anything from $10,000 to $15,000 and up for a two-week rental.\n\u201cAll those girls and bridesmaids weekends are out of luck now,\u201d one local real estate broker told The Post.\nBut Southampton mayor Bill Manger says it\u2019s the short-term renters\u2019 own fault for partying too hard and losing their weekend privileges.\n\u201cWe have been getting complaints from people in the village that the house next door is having lots of different renters coming in every weekend, and causing a disruption to the peace and harmony,\u201d Manger told The Post, explaining locals have been calling cops with relentless noise complaints \u201cevery weekend\u201d for months.\n\u201cThey came to me as the mayor and asked, \u2018Can\u2019t you do something about this?'\u201d Manger said.\nHe looked at Southampton\u2019s neighboring communities on Long Island\u2019s South Fork and realized almost everywhere else had already banned weekend rentals over similar complaints, and made the proposal for the village.\n\u201cWe were the only outlier, so it seemed to make sense to put something in place,\u201d he said.\nWord of the new law \u2014 which covers the heart of the Southampton beach community, but not the wider township\u2019s other villages \u2014 has been slow to disseminate across the sleepy but well-heeled enclave, and some fear it will only serve to keep people out and hurt local business owners.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over. This ends my Airbnb business. That\u2019s it,\u201d said 55-year-old Joel Perez, who divides his time between Long Island and Miami and rents out his Southampton home when he\u2019s in Florida.\n\u201cNobody can afford to be out here for two weeks. What happens to people who just want a weekend getaway?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about catering to the rich and keeping people from the middle class down and out of the Hamptons.\u201d\nAnd he thinks the parties will only continue \u2014 but harder.\n\u201cThe people who can afford to book those whole houses and throw ragers will still do it \u2014 they\u2019ll just rent for two weeks, throw more than one party,\u201d he said.\nAn Airbnb spokesperson said the company has banned parties for the last five years, but is committed to working with Southampton leaders to make sure the village is equipped to deal with violators.\n\u201cAirbnb has had a ban on parties since 2020, and while they remain extremely rare, with fewer than 0.06% of reservations on Airbnb in New York resulting in an allegation of a party in 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nZach Erdem, a Southampton restaurateur and star of HBO Max\u2019s \u201cServing the Hamptons,\u201d said he was \u201cshocked\u201d when the law passed.\n\u201cThe rich want the Hamptons to be more exclusive. It\u2019s been the same issue for many years, but in the end, cutting short-term rentals will stop people from coming,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey want to know how to get people to come here, but they are keeping it for only the 1% to enjoy the Hamptons. They are stabbing us all in the back,\u201d Erdem added.\nThe new law comes into effect at the end of a Hamptons summer where rentals were down 30%, according to reports, which some attributed to pandemic-era buyers pumping their prices to break even paying off their mortgages.\nAnd some real-estate agents have even lamented that the old-fashioned long-term rental market that once sustained the Hamptons is long gone \u2014 and not coming back, no matter what laws are passed.\nDespite the criticisms, some have said the new rule is a sensible step in the right direction for homeowners who are in Southampton full-time.\n\u201cThere are too many damn people out here. That\u2019s the problem. There\u2019s too many people for one day or one night. There\u2019s no consistency,\u201d said Paul Brennan, a longtime Hamptons real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\u201cHopefully, this will prevent the practice of one or two-day rentals that drive everyone crazy. They pack the houses and don\u2019t take care of them. Landlords go crazy,\u201d he added.\nMayor Manger pointed out that the rest of the Hamptons \u2014 where similar rental restrictions are already in place \u2014 seemed to be doing just fine.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will hurt business. Is Amagansett hurting? Is East Hampton hurting? I don\u2019t think so, there are no issues on the rest of the South Fork because of this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how this became an issue since we were the last ones to adopt a code.\u201d"
