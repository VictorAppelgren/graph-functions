  "title": "FACT FOCUS: Trump exaggerates, misstates facts on Washington crime",
  "description": "In justifying a federal take over of policing in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump claims that crime in the capital city is on the rise and that homicide rates in 2023 were the highest ever seen.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will take over policing the nation\u2019s capital city in what the Republican said is an effort to bring down rising crime rates in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut Trump exaggerated or misstated many of the facts surrounding public safety in Washington, where the crime rate has fallen in recent years, while leaving out much of the context.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the facts:\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, not getting better. It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Statistics published by Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped in Washington since a post-Pandemic peak in 2023.\n\nAccording to the data, homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\n\nA recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, returning to the previous trend of decreasing crime that puts the district\u2019s violent crime rate at its lowest in 30 years.\n\nThat report shows that when compared to 2023 numbers, homicides are down 32%, armed carjackings are down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27%.\n\nThe city\u2019s statistics have come into question, however, after authorities opened an investigation into allegations that officials altered some of the data to make it look better. But Mayor Muriel Bowser stands by the data and said Trump\u2019s portrait of lawlessness is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime,\u201d Bowser said on MSNBC Sunday. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n\nMurders in 2023 in Washington were high, but not the highest ever\n\nTRUMP: \u201cMurders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don\u2019t know what that means because it just goes back 25 years.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: In 2023, the District of Columbia recorded 274 murders in a city of about 700,000, its highest number in 20 years. But the city\u2019s own crime statistics from the 1970s, 80s and 90s, when the population was smaller, show much higher numbers of homicides.\n\nIn 1990, for instance, the city reported 498 homicides. The next year saw 509, and 460 in 1992.\n\nDecades of statistics on crime in the city is available online.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City. Some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher. This is much higher.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s true, but Trump isn\u2019t telling the whole story. Washington does have a higher homicide rate than many other global cities, including some that have historically been considered unsafe by many Americans. But Trump is leaving out important context: the U.S. in general sees higher violent crime rates than many other countries.\n\nWhile Washington is one of America\u2019s most dangerous big cities, others have higher crime rates.\n\nTRUMP : \u201cThis dire public safety crisis stems from a public safety crisis that is directly from the abject failures of the city\u2019s local leadership. The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Data has not determined the impact of cashless bail on crime rates. Studies, many of which focus on recidivism of defendants rather than crime rates, have shown mixed results.\n\nA 2024 report published by the Brennan Center for Justice saw \u201cno statistically significant relationship\u201d between bail reform and crime rates. The nonprofit looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the U.S., 22 of which had instituted some type of bail reform. Researchers used a statistical method to determine if crime rates had diverged in those with reforms and those without.\n\nAmes Grawert, the report\u2019s co-author and senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, said this conclusion \u201cholds true for trends in crime overall or specifically violent crime.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a 2023 paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence that cash bail helps ensure defendants will show up in court or prevents crime among those who are released while awaiting trial.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any valid studies corroborating the President\u2019s claim and would love to know what the Administration offers in support,\u201d Kellen Funk, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies pretrial procedure and bail bonding, told The Associated Press in a July 25 fact check. \u201cIn my professional judgment I\u2019d call the claim demonstrably false and inflammatory.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the district attorney\u2019s office in Yolo County, California, that looked at how a temporary cashless bail system implemented across the state to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in courts and jails impacted recidivism. It found that out of 595 individuals released between April 2020 and May 2021 under this system, 70.6% were arrested again after they were released.\n\nFunk, contacted Monday, noted that Washington D.C. reformed its cash bail system in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWhat the President is declaring to be an \u2018emergency\u2019 is a system that has functioned much better than cash-based bail systems for nearly thirty years now, including during the recent historic lows in reported crime in the District,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe D.C. bail system has served as a model for bipartisan bail reform efforts in New Jersey and New Mexico over the past decade.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writer Melissa Goldin in New York contributed reporting.",

      "text": "FACT FOCUS: Trump claims cashless bail increases crime, but data is inconclusive\nAs his administration faces mounting pressure to release Justice Department files related the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, President Donald Trump is highlighting a different criminal justice issue \u2014 cashless bail.\nHe suggested in a Truth Social post this week that eliminating cash bail as a condition of pretrial release from jail has led to rising crime in U.S. cities that have enacted these reforms. However, studies have shown no clear link.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the facts.\nTRUMP: \u201cCrime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!\u201d\nTHE FACTS: Data has not determined the impact of cashless bail on crime rates. But experts say it is incorrect to claim that there is an adverse connection.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any valid studies corroborating the President\u2019s claim and would love to know what the Administration offers in support,\u201d said Kellen Funk, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies pretrial procedure and bail bonding. \u201cIn my professional judgment I\u2019d call the claim demonstrably false and inflammatory.\u201d\nJeff Clayton, executive director of the American Bail Coalition, the main lobbying arm of the cash bail industry, also pointed to a lack of evidence.\n\u201cStudies are inconclusive in terms of whether bail reforms have had an impact on overall crime numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is due to pretrial crime being a small subset of overall crime. It is also difficult to categorize reforms as being \u2018cashless\u2019 or not, i.e., policies where preventative detention is introduced as an alternative to being held on bail.\u201d\nDifferent jurisdictions, different laws\nIn 2023, Illinois became the first state to completely eliminate cash bail when the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law abolishing it. The move was part of an expansive criminal justice overhaul adopted in 2021 known as the SAFE-T Act. Under the change, a judge decides whether to release the defendant prior to their trial, weighing factors such as their criminal charges, if they could pose any danger to others and if they are considered a flight risk.\nLoyola University of Chicago\u2019s Center for Criminal Justice published a 2024 report on Illinois\u2019 new cashless bail policy, one year after it went into effect. It acknowledges that there is not yet enough data to know what impact the law has had on crime, but that crime in Illinois did not increase after its implementation. Violent and property crime declined in some counties.\nA number of other jurisdictions, including New Jersey, New Mexico and Washington, D.C., have nearly eliminated cash bail or limited its use. Many include exceptions for high-level crimes.\nProponents of eliminating cash bail describe it as a penalty on poverty, suggesting that the wealthy can pay their way out of jail to await trial while those with fewer financial resources have to sit it out behind bars. Critics have argued that bail is a time-honored way to ensure defendants released from jail show up for court proceedings. They warn that violent criminals will be released pending trial, giving them license to commit other crimes.\nA lack of consensus\nStudies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of cashless bail on crime. Many focus on the recidivism of individual defendants rather than overall crime rates.\nA 2024 report published by the Brennan Center for Justice saw \u201cno statistically significant relationship\u201d between bail reform and crime rates. It looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the U.S., 22 of which had instituted some type of bail reform. Researchers used a statistical method to determine if crime rates had diverged in those with reforms and those without.\nAmes Grawert, the report\u2019s co-author and senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, said this conclusion \u201cholds true for trends in crime overall or specifically violent crime.\u201d\nSimilarly, a 2023 paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence that cash bail helps ensure defendants will show up in court or prevents crime among those who are released while awaiting trial. The paper evaluated the impact of a 2018 policy instituted by the Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney that instructed prosecutors not to set bail for certain offenses.\nA 2019 court decree in Harris County, Texas, requires most people charged with a misdemeanor to be released without bail while awaiting trial. The latest report from the monitoring team responsible for tracking the impact of this decision, released in 2024, notes that the number of people arrested for misdemeanors has declined by more than 15% since 2015. The number of those rearrested within one year has similarly declined, with rearrest rates remaining stable in recent years.\nAsked what data Trump was using to support his claim, the White House pointed to a 2022 report from the district attorney\u2019s office in Yolo County, California, that looked at how a temporary cashless bail system implemented across the state to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in courts and jails impacted recidivism. It found that out of 595 individuals released between April 2020 and May 2021 under this system, 70.6% were arrested again after they were released. A little more than half were rearrested more than once.\nA more recent paper, published in February by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, also explored the effects of California\u2019s decision to suspend most bail during the COVID-19 pandemic. It reports that implementation of this policy \u201ccaused notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days.\u201d However, a return to cash bail did not impact the number of rearrests for any type of offense. The paper acknowledges that other factors, such as societal disruption from the pandemic, could have contributed to the initial increase.\nMany contributing factors\nIt is difficult to pinpoint specific explanations for why crime rises and falls.\nThe American Bail Coalition\u2019s Clayton noted that other policies that have had a negative impact on crime, implemented concurrently with bail reforms, make it \u201cdifficult to isolate or elevate one or more causes over the others.\u201d\nPaul Heaton, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies criminal justice interventions, had a similar outlook.\n\u201cCertainly there are some policy levers that people look at \u2014 the size of the police force and certain policies around sentencing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of variation in crime that I think even criminologists don\u2019t necessarily fully understand.\u201d\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."

      "text": "The nation\u2019s capital waits for Trump\u2019s next move as a federal takeover threat looms\nThe White House has announced an increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., for at least the next week to combat crime.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. A robust but not unusual contingent of city police cruisers lingered around the edges of the crowds. At other late-night hot spots, nearly identical scenes unfolded.\nWhat wasn\u2019t apparent in Friday\u2019s earliest hours: any sort of security lockdown by a multiagency flood of uniformed federal law enforcement officers. That\u2019s what President Donald Trump had promised Thursday, starting at midnight, in the administration\u2019s latest move to impose its will on the nation\u2019s capital.\nIn short, that law enforcement surge to take control of the District of Columbia\u2019s streets did not appear to unfold on schedule. A two-hour city tour, starting around 1 a.m. Friday, revealed no overt or visible law enforcement presence other than members of the Metropolitan Police Department, the city\u2019s police force.\nThat still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to \u201ctake over\u201d a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, \u201cwith the option to extend as needed.\u201d In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country\u2019s safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details.\nOn Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night\u2019s operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said more than 120 members of various federal agencies \u2014 the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service \u2014 were to be on duty Friday night, upping the complement of federal officers involved.\n\u201cThis is the first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, D.C.,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\nMayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump\u2019s declaration. The police department has gone similarly silent.\nA crackdown came after an assault\nThe catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking.\nPolice arrested two 15-year-olds and were seeking others. Trump quickly renewed his calls for the federal government to seize control.\n\u201cIf D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington\u2019s limited \u201chome rule\u201d autonomy to \u201cbringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.\u201d\nThe threats come at a time when Bowser\u2019s government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year.\nThe portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser\u2019s government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. Emergency legislation passed by the D.C. Council this summer imposed tighter youth curfew restrictions and empowered Police Chief Pamela Smith to declare temporary juvenile curfew zones for four days at a time. In those areas, a gathering of nine or more under the age of 18 is unlawful after 8 p.m.\nThis lies within presidential authority\nTrump is within his powers in deploying federal law enforcement assets on D.C. streets. He could deploy the National Guard, although that is not one of the dozen participating agencies listed in his declaration. The first Trump administration called in the National Guard during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and again on Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters overran the Capitol.\nFurther steps, including taking over the police department, would require a declaration of emergency. Legal experts believe that would most likely be challenged in court. Such an approach would fit the general pattern of Trump\u2019s second term in office, when he has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs. In many cases, he moved forward while the courts sorted it out.\nImposing a full federal takeover of Washington would require a congressional repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973. It\u2019s a step that Trump said lawyers are examining.\nThat law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia.\nSigned into law by President Richard Nixon, the measure allowed D.C. residents to elect their own mayor, council and local commissioners. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents.\nSo far, Trump\u2019s criticisms of Washington can be felt most directly in the actions of the National Park Service, which controls large pieces of land throughout the capital. In Trump\u2019s second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks.\nEarlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mike Pesoli, Michael Kunzelman and Michelle L.

      "text": "Trump\u2019s order to deploy troops in DC is his latest use of the National Guard in cities\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city\u2019s streets at any given time, the Army said.\nTrump\u2019s directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.\nHow the National Guard deployment in DC will work\nAccording to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or \u201cfederal-state status\u201d authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 though, at the moment, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the plan.\n\u201cTheir duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.\nHegseth told reporters that Guard members will be \u201cflowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\u201d He also said the Pentagon was \u201cprepared to bring in other National Guard units \u2014 other specialized units,\u201d though he didn\u2019t offer any further details.\nThe timeline for the troop deployment also is vaguely defined. According to Trump\u2019s directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines \u201cthat conditions of law and order have been restored.\u201d\nBesides the 800 Guard members, Trump said \u201cwe will bring in the military if it\u2019s needed\u201d \u2014 seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard \u2014 but added that \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d\nTrump recently sent Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles\nThe deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June.\nTrump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.\nHegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation\u2019s capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,\u201d Hegseth said.\nHowever, California\u2019s governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard\u2019s primary mission had been to guard two buildings that \u201cfrankly didn\u2019t need to be guarded.\u201d\nIn addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d\nTrump deployed the Guard to Washington in his first term\nThis is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.\nIn 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.\nIt became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley\u2019s presence as the military\u2019s endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized."

      "text": "Trump says he\u2019s placing Washington police under federal control and activating the National Guard\nTrump says he\u2019s placing Washington police under federal control and activating the National Guard\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday he\u2019s taking over Washington\u2019s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling in the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe president, flanked by his attorney general, his defense secretary and the FBI director, said he was declaring a public safety emergency and his administration would be removing homeless encampments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump declared, adding he\u2019d also be \u201cgetting rid of the slums.\u201d\nFor Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down an additional 26% this year.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would follow the law regarding the \u201cso-called emergency\u201d even as she indicated that Trump\u2019s actions were a reason why the District of Columbia should be a state with legal protections from such actions.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\nCombating crime\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nThe National Guard\nBowser, a Democrat, has previously questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. She stressed during a Monday news conference that she believed Trump\u2019s views of the city were shaped by the \u201cchallenging times\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, when he faced protests and crime spiked as the country began to recover from the outbreak.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nJesse Rabinowitz, a advocate for homeless people, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cwaste\u201d of resources. He said the move wasn\u2019t about safety.\n\u201cIt is about power, and it is about fascism and authoritarianism,\u201d said Rabinowitz, the campaign and communication director for the National Homelessness Law Center. \u201cIf Donald Trump wanted to keep D.C. safe, he would fund housing and support. Instead, the Republicans just gutted health care, and they\u2019re passing through a budget that will make homelessness worse. They do not care about helping people.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Nathan Ellgren, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

      "text": "Press Release\nViolent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of Columbia\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc\nContact\nUpdated January 3, 2025\nTopic\nViolent Crime\nComponent"
