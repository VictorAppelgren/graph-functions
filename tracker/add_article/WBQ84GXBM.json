      "summary": "Lumber prices fell more than 20% in August and continued to drop into September, reaching their lowest level of 2025. The decline is driven by a glut of wood inventory built up ahead of a planned increase in duties on Canadian imports. Analysts say speculative inventory buildup across mills and dealers has created a “wall of wood” that must be liquidated. The market has also been volatile due to President Trump’s tariff threats.",
