  "content": "Shane Warne left behind a sizeable inheritance for his children after his tragic death in 2022.\n\nWarne's final will, drafted just months before he died, revealed that the cricketer had amassed an incredible $20.7 million fortune.\n\nHis children, Brooke, 28, Jackson, 26, Summer, 23, each inherited just under a third of their father's assets - about $6.41 million each.\n\nWarne requested his prized $375,500 vehicle collection - including a BMW, Mercedes-Benz and a Yamaha motorbike - to be left to his son and 'best mate' Jackson.\n\nWarne's estate included $5 million in his Australian bank account, $514,000 in an overseas account, a $6.5 million seaside Melbourne home, close to $3 million in shares, and $2 million in personal belongings including a jet ski.\n\nThe athlete had spun his stellar cricketing talent and massive personality into a hugely successful business career after his retirement from the sport in 2007.\n\nIn 2019, he founded a gin distillery named 708 Gin, produced in Western Australia. One of his tipples won the gold medal at the Australian Gin Awards that year.\n\nIn August 2020, Warne launched a fragrance called SW23, a mix of his initials and the number he wore playing cricket for Australia.\n\nHe bought, renovated and sold at least five homes in trendy Brighton, Melbourne - in one case buying and selling a mansion twice between 2001 and 2018 and earning $18.8 million.\n\nAnother property he bought for $3.7 million in 2007 and sold for $6.7 million two years later, while he made a similar profit on a $7.5 million property, which he sold for $10.8 million four years later.\n\nWarne also has an apartment in the $540 million dollar Saint Moritz complex in St Kilda, which he is said to have purchased in 2018 for $5.4 million.\n\nWith 93 per cent of his $20,711,013.27 assets going to his three children, the remaining seven per cent was distributed among his brother Jason (two per cent) and his brother's children, Sebastian and Tyla (two and a half per cent each).\n\nHis ex-wife Simone Callahan, who he was married to for 15 years, was not listed in the will.\n\nIt comes after Jackson revealed how his new career move is 'therapy' to help him cope with the loss of his father.\n\nHe has launched his new podcast, Warnes Way, and explains how he pays tribute to his dad on set.\n\n'We've got a studio we've set up which is in dad's old office so it feels like he's there,' Jackson told the Herald Sun.\n\n'We've got all his memorabilia, his book, his ashtray, it's really special.'\n\nJackson says that he and his dad had originally planned to do a father-and-son podcast together back in 2018, but it never happened.\n\nWith guests who knew his dad - such as Eddie McGuire and Mark Howard - Jackson says the podcast has served as a means of healing his grief.\n\n'I'm also treating it as a bit of therapy for me,' the professional poker player said.\n\n'I don't see a therapist, but when I talk to people like Mark Howard and Eddie McGuire it's so personal and we talk about stories with dad.'\n\nJackson announced the new podcast in an Instagram post earlier this week.\n\n'First episode goes live Monday the 11th of August. Listen and watch on YouTube and Spotify,' he explained in his caption.\n\nThe podcast is edited and filmed by Jackson's girlfriend, Kiah Broadsmith.\n\nLegendary cricketer Shane Warne died aged 52 from a heart attack while on holiday in Koh Samui, Thailand.",

One of his tipples won the gold medal at the Australian Gin Awards that year.\nIn early 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Warne announced it would also produce alcohol-based hand sanitiser to help relieve critical shortage of the product.\nIn August 2020, Warne launched a fragrance called SW23, a mix of his initials and the number he wore playing cricket for Australia.\nThe $50 fragrance was described as 'woody and boldly intense' with notes including fresh bergamot, wild mint, Indonesian patchouli and leather accord.\nAway from cricket, Warne had an 18-year partnership with Advanced Hair Studios, and an impressive property portfolio.\nHe bought, renovated and sold at least five homes in the trendy Melbourne bayside of Brighton over two decades.\nHe paid $5.4 million for a five-bedroom home in Brighton in early 2018, installed a nightclub with a wet bar and mirrored ceiling, plus 500-bottle wine cellar, tasting room and a gold-class home theatre.\nHe sold it in December 2020 for an undisclosed sum, and had plans to move to a luxury development in St Kilda, where penthouses cost between $9 m and $19m.\nAt one stage, Warne and his former partner Liz Hurley owned a 13 bedroom home in the UK that they extensively renovated.\nHis massive fortune was matched by his lavish lifestyle and expensive taste with a fleet of luxury cars which he often showed off on social media.\nShane Warne's 'retirement' job, as coach/captain of the Indian Premier League's Rajasthan Royals team (above) proved a massive earner with the franchise valued at least $340m last year\nThe cricket superstar (pictured Fox Sports commentator Sarah Jones) commentated both in Australia and the UK up until his death\nShane Warne has left behind a legacy of one of Australia's most influential and popular sportsmen\nShane Warne had a series of product endorsement deals including a long relationship with Adannced Hair Studios (pictured getting hair growth treatment in 2016)\nHe remained heavily involved in cricket as a coach and commentator and split his time between Australia, the UK and India.\nWarne commentated for Channel Nine for more than a decade until the network lost the broadcasting rights in 2018, when he made the switch to Fox Cricket, where he worked up until his death.\nIn the UK, he had been commentating for Sky Sports since 2009 on top of coaching commitments.\nHis massive fortune was matched by his lavish lifestyle and expensive taste with a fleet of luxury cars, which he often showed off on social media\nSevenZeroEight Gin was launched in 2019, the name is a reference to the 708 test wickets that Warne took over his illustrious career\n'I've had some good feedback from women, they seem to like this,' he told the Daily Telegraph at the time.\n'People will notice you wearing it and they will comment on how wonderful you smell.\n'It creates conversation and will make you feel happy, confident and sophisticated.'\nDue to popular demand, he launched a second fragrance, SW23 Sport last September, which he described as 'a little bit fresher and a bit lighter' than his original scent.\n'It's a sport version, so it's a bit lighter and a bit fresher than the first one,' he said.\n'It's got mandarin spritzes, it's a bit spicy, it's got dry iris and a tonka bean.'\n'SW23 was so popular we thought, geez, let\u2019s do another. Everyone loved it and kept asking when there was going to be another fragrance. That makes you pretty proud when people love it.'\nShane Warne unveiled two fragrances within 12 months, SW23 and SW23 Sport\nWarne was renowned for undertaking huge renovation projects on some of the houses he purchased, before later reselling.\nWarne has made a number of property plays in the Melbourne bayside suburb of Brighton over the years.\nIn one case buying and selling a huge bluestone mansion twice between 2001 and 2018, earning $18,888,888 for the pad.\nAnother bought $3.7 million in 2007 sold for $6.7 million two years later.

If you follow his lifestyle, it changes so often,' he told realestate.com.au.\nIn 2020, Warne listed this house, which has five bedrooms and three bathrooms, a large swimming pool and spa, a basement theatre, a bar, and an underground garage with space for four cars\nHe bought the property in the affluent beachside suburb of Brighton, in Melbourne, back in 2018 for $5.4 million\nWarne also has an apartment in the $540 million dollar Saint Moritz complex in St Kilda, which he is said to have purchased in 2018 for $5.4million.\nMore recently, Warne had submitted plans to build a $5m resort-style retreat on a block he bought for $3.6m in Portsea on Melbourne's outskirts, a playground for established families, business titans, entrepreneurs and sporting greats.\nPlans submitted to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council on Warne's behalf which were set to include a gym, theatre, games room, library, bowling alley, jet ski garage, wine cellar and observation deck, the Herald Sun reported last August.\nOther proposed features included a master bedroom equipped with an ensuite, dressing area and walk in robe, two other bedrooms and a four bedroom guest wing built around a pool and complete with a music room, alfresco bar and separate alfresco barbecue area.\nWarne reportedly purchased the Mornington Peninsula property in October (pictured) last year for $3.6million\nWarne opened up on his obsession with luxury cars during his appearance on 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here' in 2016.\n'I got obsessed with cars, expensive Ferraris, Lamborghinis. I had a 20-car basement garage,' he gloated to his campmates.\n'I had the F type Jag[uar], which only had two seats - I couldn't put in my clubs, couldn't take anyone. I thought it was time to get a different car.'\n'A mate had one and I thought, 'I could leave that in my garage'.
