  "summary": "U.S. stock futures fell following a surge in hopes of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The president's attempts to control monetary policy were highlighted at the Jackson Hole gathering. The long pause between rate cuts could be particularly beneficial for equities, potentially extending the stock market's rally. The sluggish job market is a risk for the economy due to a cooling demand for workers and a decrease in immigration. China's stocks have also been hit hard by doubts about their valuations and the potential of artificial intelligence. The news of the potential rate cut led to a decline in shares of Wayfair after President Trump announced a 50-day investigation to determine a tariff rate on furniture imports.",
