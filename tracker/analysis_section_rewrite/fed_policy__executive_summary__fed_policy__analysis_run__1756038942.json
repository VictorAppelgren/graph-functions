      "feedback": "Actionable edits to elevate to world-class: condense the piece into 4–6 crisp sentences that deliver a single Regime A house view with a clean macro-to-corporate transmission; explicitly structure the causal chain as policy stance → financial conditions (FX, yields) → capex/risk appetite (AI/tech deployment) → risk premia/multiples, and bind every link to precise numbers from the sources (e.g., Sept rate cut 25–50 bp; 10-year yield mid-4%; total easing 150–175 bp; dollar softening; ACMR Q2 revenue $215m, gross margin 49%, 2025 revenue guide $850–$950m; Intel governance signal); sharpen Regimes B/C with concrete data triggers (inflation stickiness/wage resilience for B; data-balanced for C) and separate near-term (0–3 weeks) from 3–6 months horizon; fix obvious typos and inconsistencies (e.g., GMV95 reference and OQ profitability mismatch) and explicitly flag unresolved numbers (e.g., Intel stake valuation variances) as needing official corroboration, not assumption; tighten citation discipline so each macro assertion cites one of GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH, TN66GHPAT, XQWTVR71K, C22MKA9VY, SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, J99EM2TPZ and reconcile conflicting figures rather than listing multiple, competing IDs; ensure the watch-list maps to concrete triggers and timing (Sept action, CPI/payroll prints, Canada carve-out progress, export-control developments) and add a simple invalidation rule (hawkish Fed signals or delayed carve-out) to cap or reprice the thesis; finally, ensure the macro narrative (Regime A) remains the backbone for the cloud/AI earnings thesis, using Azure/Shopify‑style monetization evidence only as supporting validation and not disparate case studies.",
