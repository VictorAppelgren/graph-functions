  "content": "A series of odd design choices has doomed a luxury condominium building on the waterfront in Boston, with the developer now forced to throw in the towel.\n\nRestaurateur Jon Cronin had sought to develop a swanky 22-story residential building overlooking the water in the city's up and coming Seaport neighborhood, on the site of his bars Whisky Priest and Atlantic Beer Garden.\n\nBut Cronin, an Irish man who got his start in construction, surrounded himself with trusted associates who also lacked luxury market knowledge, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nThe result was a stunning, twisted glass exterior that made the St. Regis Residences stand out.\n\nHowever, the interiors were not furnished with a secondary wall system to mask the unusual angles outside - leaving the multi-million dollar units with odd spaces that were challenging to furnish and a lobby that left much to be desired.\n\nUnits that did not face the water were also overpriced, with Cronin apparently refusing to offer a discount on the non-waterfront homes as many other developers do.\n\nNow, nearly three years after the first tenants moved into the building, 40 percent of the 114 units remain unsold and Cronin is turning control of the building over to his lender - Los Angeles-based Cottonwood Group, which holds a $240 million mortgage on the property.\n\nHe is asking for 'no recovery of investor equity' in the deal, according to a Final Project Update in July obtained by real estate broker John F. Gately.\n\nIt notes that the project has had setbacks almost from the beginning and was never able to financially recover.\n\nConstruction was initially delayed on the St. Regis Residences by a legal fight with Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the Cronin Group over public access to Boston's waterfront.\n\nCronin would up settling with the environmental group in early 2018, with commitments for additional public space and mitigation payments, the Globe reports.\n\nBut that was not the end of the developer's woes, as he soon faced COVID-related disruptions, challenges building the massive structure on a parcel of land surrounded by water, as well as an existing apartment tower.\n\nThe original broker on the project, Gibson Sotheby's International Realty, also filed and eventually settled a lawsuit against the Cronin Group in a dispute over alleged unpaid commissions, Banker & Tradesman reports.\n\nIt ultimately took four years for Cronin to complete construction on his project.\n\nBy the time the building finally opened to residents in October 2022, Cronin missed the pandemic-fueled condo sales boom.\n\n'The pandemic triggered a flight from urban luxury housing, weakening presales and significantly slowing absorption in our target buyer segment,' the developers wrote in the Final Project Update.\n\nThey noted that they even placed 10 units up for bid in the fall of 2023, but 'minimum bid pricing was set as much as 30 percent below previously announced asking prices.'\n\nBoston's condo sales are now on pace for its weakest year since 2003, according to data from The Collective Companies, which handles marketing for many luxury buildings in the city.\n\nAt the St. Regis Residences, sales of units priced between $2 to $3 million fell 14.5 percent in the second quarter of this year, while sales of more expensive units fell 23 percent.\n\nThe sales picked up earlier in the year, but slowed due to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's global tariffs.\n\nStill, Cronin said he and his team 'are incredibly proud of what we've built with the St. Regis Residences, Boston.'\n\nHe also said Cottonwood - which developed the EchelonSeaport, a nearly full condo and apartment complex across from the St. Regis, 'has ben a trusted partner from the start of their investment.\n\n'They share our belief in the unparalleled quality, lifestyle and value this building offers and we are excited to work alongside them in this next phase,' Cronin said.\n\n'With its sweeping waterfront views, uniquely exquisite residences, signature butler service and bespoke amenities, now coupled with Cottonwood's financial resources and operational expertise, I have no doubt that the enhanced offerings will continue to make this property the best place to call home in Boston.'\n\nCottonwood CEO Alexander Shing also said that he is bullish about investing in the Seaport neighborhood.\n\n'I don't want to put money anywhere but the Seaport,' he told the Globe. 'Why reinvent something that is already very good and I can make it excellent.'\n\nShing added that he is thrilled to be getting Cronin's building at a discount, as the developer reportedly plans to negotiate a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with Cottonwood that would include an additional $6 million cash infusion from Cronin.\n\n'You can't build for that amount now,' the CEO noted.\n\nBut despite the setbacks, it does not seem that Cronin is done developing either.\n\nIn 2020, he had bought the parent company of Boston Ship Repair, which operates a 1,150-foot long dry dock in the city's marine industrial park.\n\nCronin plans to build three labs overlooking the dry dock, though the efforts are now on hold amid a biotech sector slump.",

      "text": "Aug. 11, 2025\nWelcome to Trendlines. The secret password is \u201cToledo Truth Teller.\u201d\nToday, I look at why restaurateur-turned-developer Jon Cronin is turning over the keys to the St. Regis Residences in the Seaport. Plus: Make up your mind, Wordle Bot.\n\ud83c\udd95 The Latest\n- Boston\u2019s lab building boom has gone bust. What can be done with the empty space?\n- President Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown could cause widespread workforce disruptions in Mass. and across the country.\n- Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of their revenues from AI chip sales to China, as part of an unusual deal with the Trump administration.\n\ud83c\udfe2 Lapse of luxury\nJon Cronin\u2019s first foray into luxury condo development got off to a promising start.\nIn 2015, the ambitious restaurateur unveiled plans for a 22-story residential tower on the site of his Whiskey Priest and Atlantic Beer Garden bars.\nThe $260 million project boasted a prime waterfront location in the booming Seaport and a striking design. Cronin also had a strong Boston economy at his back.\nThis week, he\u2019s poised to hand the keys to his mortgage lender. Nearly three years after the first tenants moved in, 40 percent of the 114 units remain unsold.\nAdvertisement\nThis should have been a home run.\nThat\u2019s the refrain I\u2019ve heard from more than one real estate expert. But a mix of construction delays, poor interior design choices, and overly aggressive pricing turned a high-profile debut into one of the city\u2019s biggest real estate flops in years.\nCronin declined to answer questions but sent me a statement.\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve built with the St. Regis Residences, Boston,\u201d he said.\nMissed opportunity\nConstruction of the St. Regis Residences \u2014 the project\u2019s name after Cronin\u2019s branding deal with the high-end hotel chain \u2014 was delayed by a legal fight with the Conservation Law Foundation.\nThe environmental group sued over public access to the waterfront. Cronin settled in early 2018 with commitments for additional public space and mitigation payments.\nAdvertisement\nCOVID-related disruptions and the challenges of building on a compact parcel boxed in by water, an existing apartment tower, and Seaport Boulevard caused further delays \u2014 and inflated costs.\nIt took four years to complete construction. By the time the building opened in October 2022, Cronin had missed a pandemic-fueled condo sales boom.\nDesign shortcomings\nCronin\u2019s architect, the late Howard Elkus, designed a dramatic twisting exterior that set the building apart from the boring glass boxes in the neighborhood.\nBut interior design decisions put off some prospective buyers.\nThe building doesn\u2019t employ a secondary wall system to mask the exterior\u2019s unusual angles. While that left Cronin more square footage to bake into asking prices, the units can have odd spaces that are challenging to furnish. Common areas such as the lobby are less than luxurious.\nPushing the price limit\nAn experienced condo developer might not have made those mistakes. Cronin surrounded himself with trusted associates who also lacked luxury market knowledge.\nThat led to another bad call: overpricing units that don\u2019t face the water. Developers typically discount these units by as much as 50 percent compared with those with direct water views.\nTough market\nCronin held out for a much smaller differential, hurting sales in an already difficult market.\nOverall, Boston condo sales are on pace for their weakest year since 2003, according to data collected by The Collaborative Companies, which handles marketing for many luxury buildings, including the St. Regis.\nIn the second quarter, sales of units priced between $2 million-$2.99 million fell 14.5 percent, while sales of units above that level fell 23 percent.\nAdvertisement\nSales picked up earlier in the year but momentum slowed sharply in April and May amid economic uncertainty tied to newly introduced tariffs, the firm said.\nCareer path\nGiving up the St. Regis Residences is the latest turn in Cronin\u2019s unconventional career. Born in 1966 in County Cork, Ireland, he was a hurling enthusiast who went into his father\u2019s steel business after college.\nHe arrived in Boston to visit friends in 1989 and decided to stay when he saw he could make more money here than back home.\nThe newcomer worked in construction, tended bar, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering from UMass Lowell, according to a 2022 profile in Boston Irish. He used proceeds from the sale of his South Boston home to open his first restaurant, the Boston Beer Garden, with a group of friends, in 1995.\nCronin\u2019s restaurants include Tony C\u2019s Sports Bar & Grill, Temazcal Tequila Cantina, and Jack\u2019s Coal Fired Pizza, and his company is the food and beverage provider at Lawn on D near the Seaport convention center.\nIn 2020, Cronin bought the parent company of Boston Ship Repair, which operates a 1,150-foot-long dry dock in the city\u2019s marine industrial park. His vision of building three lab buildings overlooking the dry dock \u2014 whose rents would help support the repair business \u2014 is on hold amid a biotech slump.\nNext phase\nCronin\u2019s lender is Cottonwood Group, a Los Angeles real estate investment firm that developed the EchelonSeaport, a nearly full condo and apartment complex across Seaport Boulevard from the St. Regis.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cCottonwood has been a trusted partner from the start of their involvement,\u201d Cronin said in his statement. \u201cCoupled with Cottonwood\u2019s financial resources and operational expertise, I have no doubt that the enhanced offerings will continue to make this property the best place to call home in Boston.\u201d\nCottonwood CEO Alexander Shing said he\u2019s bullish on the Seaport and is thrilled to be getting Cronin\u2019s building at a discount.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t build for that amount now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to put money anywhere but the Seaport,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy reinvent something that is already very good and I can make it excellent.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f On the Record\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like being told that I\u2019m the only one left on the planet Earth that played in the NBA in 1950.\u201d\n\u2014 Boston Celtics legend Bob Cousy, who turned 97 on Saturday.\n\u26a1Energy\nTaking a breather: Massachusetts has delayed its next offshore wind procurement until at least 2026.\n\ud83e\udde0 Artificial Intelligence\nSmart aleck: How to get the most out of ChatGPT\u2019s new model \u2014 and where it still falls down.\n\ud83d\udcc4 Politics & Policy\nMoney questions: Massachusetts business groups are backing two proposed ballot initiatives that would put more money into residents\u2019 pockets by slicing the state income tax and returning excess revenues to taxpayers more frequently.\n\ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f Real Estate\nTrouble in paradise: Some of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s neighbors say the tech mogul has turned their affluent Palo Alto, Calif., enclave into his own personal Monopoly board after he bought a string of properties, building a compound, as well as a private school for his children.\n\ud83d\udcbc C-suite\nWatch your step: A lawyer for Market Basket\u2019s board has issued a stern warning to sidelined chief executive Arthur T.
