  "content": "Eduardo K: Whatever happens, Keegan has gained a ton of fans this past year. He has been under a lot of scrutiny, and has handled it all with grace. And deciding not to pick himself, when it could be his last chance to compete, says a lot as well. Keegan is all in on trying to do what is best for the US Ryder cup team, that is palpable. Hoping for the best for him.\u201d\n\nKevin B: \u201cI feel badly for him. The PGA of America put him in an untenable position. After not being selected last time, you knew he was super motivated to make the team this year. And, he played like he belonged. However, trying to wear two hats under today\u2019s Ryder Cup environment would have been extremely difficult. Now, he will miss consecutive Ryder Cups as a player when he potentially could have been on both. Much respect for him for having to make a terribly difficult decision. Wishing nothing but success for him and his team in September.\u201d\n\nYou can share your opinion by emailing live@theathletic.com.",
