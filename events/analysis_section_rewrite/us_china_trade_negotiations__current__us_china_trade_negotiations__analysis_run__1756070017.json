      "feedback": "This draft is on the right track but needs a tighter, more testable 0–3 week logic and sharper use of the cited sources. Actionable edits:\n\n- Sharpen the causal chain and horizon discipline: start with the immediate driver (policy move to convert CHIPS Act funding into an Intel equity stake, ~10%), then lay out near‑term catalysts (White House/Commerce updates on deal structure; any accelerated foundry milestones, e.g., Ohio timeline movement toward earlier than 2030), and then translate those into a clear reaction function (risk-on if the policy signal advances with concrete milestones; risk-off if governance rights and timelines remain murky). Tie every catalyst to a specific source id (I35H3FBSN for the Putin–Zelensky/CG-tilt context and the Intel structure; M6M4LNMC4 for insider-risk background if you keep the Apple angle).\n\n- Quantify with precision and align to the sources: specify the main numbers you cite (Intel equity stake ~10% [I35H3FBSN], Ohio foundry timeline pushed toward 2030 [I35H3FBSN], stock reaction ~+7% on the news [I35H3FBSN], Taiwan’s share of advanced chips 92% [I35H3FBSN], U.S. manufacturing share ~12% [I35H3FBSN], IBEX at ~15,000 as a market benchmark [91HSMCZ7J]). Treat the 92%/12% figures as a quoted backdrop rather than an immutable law; flag any caveats in the Neuberger/Bloomberg frame if the numbers conflict with other data.\n\n- Strengthen near-term catalysts/invalidation and monitoring: add explicit invalidation triggers (e.g., “If no Intel deal structure governance detail or milestone by D+14 days, reassess the base case; if Putin–Zelensky meeting is not scheduled within 2–3 weeks, downgrade near-term market risk”; and “if Powell/Bowman data deltas push expectations away from a September cut, recast the reaction function”). Tie these to sources: Putin/Zelensky timing from I35H3FBSN; the Jackson Hole rate-cut debate from I35H3FBSN; tariff/inflation signaling from I35H3FBSN and 91HSMCZ7J.\n\n- Clarify scenarios and avoid mixed coverage: provide a clean base/bull/bear framework for Intel in the 0–3 week window (Base: progress on the deal with a non‑board‑seat governance outline and Milestones; Bull: rapid governance clarity + accelerated foundry milestones ahead of 2030; Bear: governance/structural hurdles + delays in timelines plus renewed tariff/regulatory noise). Give explicit probability weights (even if rough) and map each scenario to the likely market move in semis.\n\n- Tighten structure and reduce irrelevant tangents: trim the Apple insider‑trade background unless you explicitly use it to illustrate governance/regulatory risk or IP controls; if kept, tie it to a separate risk theme and cite M6M4LNMC4 only where it strengthens the policy risk narrative.\n\n- Improve measurement, thresholds, and monitoring notes: add a concrete watchlist: (1) White House/Commerce updates on Intel deal structure and any board/governance rights; (2) Intel Ohio milestones and revised timeline; (3) tariff/US-China policy signals; (4) Putin–Zelensky meeting scheduling and any credible deterrence guarantees details; (5) Jackson Hole data cues (CPI, unemployment, tariffs impact) and any guidance from Powell/Bowman on the September path. Link each to the cited sources (I35H3FBSN for geopolitical/monetary policy context, 91HSMCZ7J for macro market context, M6M4LNMC4 only if you keep the insider‑risk thread).\n\n- Raise first-principles clarity: explicitly frame the policy move as a sovereign-capability/industrial-policy lever intended to reduce supply-chain fragility (cite Neuberger’s emphasis on Taiwan-centric bottlenecks and U.S. manufacturing share from I35H3FBSN); explain how a state equity stake changes risk premia, governance incentives, and the price/volatility dynamic for semis.\n\n- Ensure citation discipline and coverage: ensure every factual claim that matters to the 0–3 week view is tethered to an ID (I35H3FBSN, M6M4LNMC4, 91HSMCZ7J) and avoid implying conflicts that aren’t actually in the sources. If you note a potential conflict (e.g., governance rights vs. no board seat guarantee), present it as “unclear per reporting” and cite the specific line.\n\n- Presentation and tone: convert the narrative into a tight, numbers-forward paragraph with a compact watchlist at the end. If you must keep the single-paragraph format, embed the watchlist succinctly (e.g., “Watch: Intel deal structure by Day 14; Ohio milestone by Day 21; Putin–Zelensky meeting timing; Powell/Bowman data signals ahead of September; tariff commentary.”) and attach the citations inline.\n\nIn short, rework the piece into a tightly scoped, numbers-driven 0–3 week forecast with explicit triggers, invalidation points, and a clear basis in the three core sources (I35H3FBSN for geopolitics/US policy, M6M4LNMC4 for background risk context, 91HSMCZ7J for macro-market/inflation/timing cues), and deliver a crisp base/bull/bear set of outcomes with a concrete watchlist.",
