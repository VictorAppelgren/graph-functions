  "title": "Our Experts Gave This 65-Inch LG Smart TV One of Our Highest Ratings Ever and Now It's 20% Off",
  "description": "The LG C3 Evo received an \"Outstanding\" rating from PCMag editors for being one of the very best gaming TVs out there. And now it can be yours at a $300 discount.",
  "content": "A quality TV can be instrumental in getting the best gaming experience possible , and the LG C3 Evo OLED TV is a great option, especially at this sale price. It features solid color performance and incredibly low input lag, thus boosting your gaming immersion on all fronts. Over at Newegg, you can now get it for $303 less (that's a 20% discount, right there)\n\nThe big 65-inch display features LG's Brightness Booster technology, which improves light control to achieve more brightness than other OLED TV models. Along with its gorgeous color saturation and fast 120Hz refresh rate, all of these factors work together to level up the immersion in your gaming sessions.\n\nThis TV also has GeForce Now cloud gaming, which lets you stream PC games from NVIDIA's servers to it. One of the biggest benefits to using a cloud service like this is that players can then try out games on devices that may otherwise not be able to handle them. NVIDIA's servers will be doing the heavy lifting so that you can play the most graphically intensive games with ease and without worry about performance.\n\nOur lead analyst Will Greenwald awarded it an \"Outstanding\" rating. In our LG C3 65-Inch Evo OLED TV (OLED65C3PUA) review , he said, \"The LG C3 Evo is an OLED TV with an incredibly colorful and fairly bright picture, as well as some of the best gaming performance we've seen.\" Don't miss out on this deal!\n\nBe sure to check out more of our Newegg and TV deals .\n\nMore TV Deals on Amazon\n\nMore TV Deals on Walmart\n\nMore TV Deals on Target",
