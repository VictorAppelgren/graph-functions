  "description": "Longtime KROQ host Nicole Alvarez confirms her exit from the station after more than 22 years in an emotional letter: 'Leaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done,' she writes.",
  "content": "Radio personality Nicole Alvarez is leaving KROQ-FM (106.7) behind, after more than 20 years of service and alleged tensions with the station's executive team.\n\nAlvarez confirmed her departure from the station on Wednesday with a post on Instagram and a farewell letter published by the Hollywood Reporter. She spoke about her exit weeks after delivering her final broadcast on July 30. She joined the KROQ team in September 2003 and was an on-air personality for weekday programming.\n\n\"I never knew how it would end. I just knew that when it did, I would have to be the one to write the final chapter,\" Alvarez wrote for THR.\n\nRead more: Radio host Matt Pinfield aims to return to airwaves 'very soon,' months after stroke\n\nAlvarez said she did not intend for the late July broadcast to be her last, writing it was a moment \"that was emotional, frenzied, and irreversible.\" She added she made the abrupt exit after a \"heated exchange\" with her boss. Though she did not share further information about that conversation, Alvarez underlined that her departure is rooted in \"something much larger.\"\n\n\"Leaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done,\" Alvarez said. The station specializes in alternative rock and has long been a platform for notable acts including Nirvana, U2 and Depeche Mode, as Alvarez notes in her letter. During her tenure, Alvarez has also platformed groups including Linkin Park, Muse, the Smashing Pumpkins and Mumford & Sons.\n\nShe added: \"Staying would have been a slow death. After being disrespected by an executive known to do those type of things, I was done.\"\n\nAlvarez, who said she would \"never speak ill\" of her longtime station, did not write any more of the alleged disrespect. A spokesperson for Audacy, which owns KROQ and several other stations across Southern California, did not comment to The Times.\n\nRead more: L.A.\u2019s answer to Tiny Desk is hiding inside Mercado La Paloma\n\nFor Alvarez, her departure from KROQ was more about \"what radio has become\" and \"the way business is handled these days.\" Alvarez resigned after refusing an offer for a contract extension, The Times has learned.\n\nShe lamented an alleged shift in the station's role in the music community over the years, writing that \"it has now become a spreadsheet\" and that its \"caretakers\" are more motivated by professional milestones, and \"not passion.\" Alvarez emphasized her loyalty to KROQ and reflected on her time informing listeners about major news events and the music that hit the airwaves.\n\nAs she moves, Alvarez wrote that the station has a chance to return to its roots.\n\n\"KROQ still has a chance to remember who it is, what made it 'world famous.' To take risks again. To matter,\" she added. \"But it will require courage, not cowardice. Passion, not corporate approval.\"\n\nIn her letter, Alvarez thanked those involved in her tenure, ranging from her \"holy trinity\" of colleagues (KROQ alumni Kevin Weatherly, Lisa Worden and Gene Sandbloom), to listeners and artists.\n\n\"Radio will always matter. In the right hands, it will always matter,\" she wrote.\n\nAlvarez also offered a stern but hopeful message to the executives she accuses of \"suffocating\" radio: \"It's never too late to introduce humanity into the corporate narrative. I challenge you to play the game without selling your souls.\"\n\nRead more: Corp. for Public Broadcasting shuts down after federal funding cuts\n\nOn Instagram, Alvarez said she has been waiting for a moment to pursue a new chapter and the shift in her radio duties \"didn't feel right.\" She said that her devotion to music will remain, even with her KROQ days behind her.\n\n\"Now, with all my energy and all my passion, I can spend another lifetime championing it in new and bigger ways,\" she told her followers.\n\nGet notified when the biggest stories in Hollywood, culture and entertainment go live.

      "text": "Corp. for Public Broadcasting shuts down after federal funding cuts\n- Share via\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting said Friday it was shutting down, a week after President Trump signed legislation stripping its funding.\nThe move startled some public radio and television station managers throughout the country. Many had only begun to absorb the shock of losing federal support and were quickly figuring out ways to keep their stations vibrant.\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting administers funds for PBS TV affiliates and NPR radio stations \u2014 more than 1,500 local television and radio stations nationwide.\nIn a statement, the group said it would \u201cbegin an orderly wind-down of its operations.\u201d A majority of staff positions will be cut Sept. 30, when the group\u2019s fiscal year ends and \u201ca small transition team will remain through January,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThis reflects the devastating impacts on public broadcasting,\u201d said Andrew Russell, PBS SoCal chief executive. \u201cCPB provides funding to local stations, it provides funding to national programming, and it has played a leadership role in public broadcasting since its inception. These are all real losses.\u201d\nSince returning to office, Trump has made a priority of yanking federal funding from public broadcasters as part of a wider campaign against media outlets that he dislikes. The president derided PBS and NPR as government-funded \u201cleft-wing propaganda.\u201d Congress fell into line.\nConservatives have long wanted to strip funding from public media because of what they perceive to be liberal bias.\nLawmakers passed a \u201crescission\u201d measure in mid-July, largely along party lines, that canceled $1.1 billion previously allocated for public broadcasting for two years.\n\u201cThere was no offramp,\u201d said Ken Siebert, general manager of Yellowstone Public Radio in Billings, Mont. \u201cThat money had already been appropriated. It wasn\u2019t like they came and said: \u2018OK, you\u2019ve got two more years to figure out how you\u2019re going to prepare for this revenue shortfall and these additional expenses.\u2019 It was just, \u2018Nope.\u2019\u201d\nSeparately, lawmakers introduced a Senate appropriations bill for 2026 that excludes funding for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting for the first time in more than 50 years.\nThe actions left the public broadcasting group without a steady source of operating money \u2014 and little hope that more would be on the way.\n\u201cThat appears to have been the last straw,\u201d said Kliff Kuehl, chief executive of Kansas City PBS. His station is losing $1.8 million, or about 13% of its television budget and 9% of its financing for its radio operation. \u201cIt\u2019s tough.\u201d\nNPR and PBS outlets, including several in Southern California, will have to make tough decisions as the U.S. Senate votes to claw back money previously allocated for their operations.\nCorp. for Public Broadcasting Chief Executive Patricia Harrison said in a statement: \u201cDespite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations.\u201d\nThe organization dates back nearly 60 years and has helped nurture such notable programs as \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d \u201cNova,\u201d numerous Ken Burns documentaries and \u201cAntiques Roadshow.\u201d It also supported \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood,\u201d distributing educational children\u2019s programming that has long helped fill an important gap in the market. It has fortified such NPR programs as \u201cMorning Edition\u201d and \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d\nThrough its partnerships with local stations and producers, the nonprofit made a mission of supporting educational and cultural programming, local journalism and emergency communications.\nThe move could cripple smaller public stations, including those in rural areas that struggle to mount high-dollar local membership campaigns.\n\u201cOften, the only local media in some of these really small markets is public broadcasting,\u201d said Kuehl, who has worked in public broadcasting for two decades and seen previous funding cut threats come and go.\n\u201cI would always tell our members of Congress: \u2018Hey, if you do this, you\u2019re not going to get rid of L.A. or New York, Chicago, Dallas or Kansas City. You\u2019re going to get rid of Smoky Hills, Kansas, and Redding, California,\u2019\u201d Kuehl said.\nYellowstone Public Radio is losing more than 13% of its budget, or about $350,000 a year \u2014 money that helped provide a small newsroom for its far-flung listener base, an enormous swath of northern Wyoming and Montana stretching to the Canadian border.\n\u201cPeople tend to think about this as just NPR, and PBS, but the heart of it is about the member stations, the people who live and work in the communities,\u201d Siebert said. \u201cWe tailor our programming for the specific arts and culture and educational needs of our listeners \u2014 old-school programming ... news and information, classical music, jazz, bluegrass, blues.\u201d\nPBS SoCal, which operates member stations KOCE and KCET in Orange and Los Angeles counties, respectively, was set to lose more than $4 million in federal funding, Russell, president and chief executive of the stations, previously told The Times.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some of our viewers and funders starting to step up [with donations], but it won\u2019t completely replace that [CPB] funding,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPBS SoCal will continue and public broadcasting will endure, but the system that we\u2019ve known will be different going forward.\u201d\nCongress passed the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cancel federal funding previously allocated for public media, which media leaders say will have devastating consequences.\nNPR has two large affiliates serving Los Angeles: KCRW-FM (89.9) and LAist/KPCC-FM (89.3).\nLAist, based in Pasadena, will lose about 4% of its annual budget \u2014 $1.7 million. Alejandra Santamaria, the station\u2019s chief executive, told The Times last month that funding helped pay for 13 journalist positions in its newsroom.\nKCRW in Santa Monica had been expecting $1.3 million from the Corp. for Public Broadcasting.\nThe stations have asked listeners to donate to compensate for the shortfall. But the station managers said they worried that listener and viewer pledge drives may not be enough to sustain stations and their small newsrooms over the long haul without the funding.\n\u201cEven if you make some of these things dormant, there\u2019s permanent damage,\u201d Kuehl, the Kansas City broadcaster, said. \u201cSome of these stations will get sold, others will shut down. How do you put back together a system that serves 99% of the country again? It\u2019s a real shame.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nYesi Ortiz has been chasing a sense of home ever since her mixed-status family was forced to bounce between Southern California, Las Vegas and Baja California, Mexico.\nNow, the former radio host of L.A.\u2019s hip-hop station Power 106-FM and cast member of VH1 series \u201cLove & Hip Hop: Hollywood\u201d is building that home herself \u2014 by transforming a Historic South-Central food hall with a Michelin-star pedigree into a DIY concert venue. There, she hosts what\u2019s known simply as \u201cThe Rehearsal.\u201d\n(Because it must be said: No, it\u2019s not related to Nathan Fielder\u2019s HBO series of the same name.)\nThe Rehearsal, which opened its sixth season last month at Mercado La Paloma, is a live showcase for young musical talent hoping to be seen and for seasoned musicians who want to try out new material in front of an audience. It\u2019s also streamed live on Twitch and YouTube each Friday night.\nOrtiz and her team describe it as the kind of show \u201cyou go to find the real ones before they break.\u201d\n\u201cI love the Tiny Desk comparison because that\u2019s what Tiny Desk used to be: a place to find undiscovered talent,\u201d Rehearsal co-founder Levi Downey explained. \u201cI still love it, but it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d Downey said NPR Music\u2019s flagship video series has increasingly catered more to established talent, like gospel singer Marvin Sapp, and superstars such as Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish.\n\u201cEl Tiny\u201d completed its third annual takeover of NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series during Latinx Heritage Month. Produced by the Alt.Latino team, \u201cEl Tiny\u201d featured eight acts from various corners of the Latino community.\nFor Ortiz, the Rehearsal represents something even deeper: a culmination of decades spent navigating survival, sacrifice and ambition.\n\u201cI spent a lot of my life basically chasing jobs because I had a family to take care of,\u201d recalled Ortiz, who adopted her seven nieces and nephews when she was in her early 20s. \u201cI had seven kids, my mom, my sister, my brother, my stepdad and my dad, who was in a nursing care facility, who all depended on me. If I need to go work a red carpet so I can get a check, I\u2019m making that happen. If I need to move to Tijuana, I\u2019m making that happen.\u201d\nAfter almost 20 years raising a family while hosting radio shows, reality shows, talk shows and red carpets, Ortiz said the Rehearsal finally feels like she\u2019s gotten to where she was meant to be. \u201cI love music,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to represent my community. I want to represent my people, and that\u2019s all I want to do. I get to do that with [the Rehearsal].\u201d\nAccording to Ortiz, the idea to create a space for \u201creal ones\u201d was born in the spring of 2022 as a counter to L.A.\u2019s notoriously predatory \u201cpay-to-play\u201d live music scene. Pay-to-play is a custom where fledgling artists are given a set number of tickets they have for pre-sale in order to perform at a venue. Any tickets they don\u2019t sell come out of the artists\u2019 own pocket.\nIn these kinds of deals, artists hardly get a share in any ticket sales.\n\u201cI was managing this musician and she was like, \u2018I just want to perform onstage,\u2019\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cBut the way live music in L.A. works for up-and-coming artists is you have to essentially pay venues to perform there.\u201d\nOrtiz partnered with music producer David Tam to turn her Boyle Heights backyard into a showcase for undiscovered talent. \u201cThat first show was a disaster,\u201d she recalled. Yet from that show, Ortiz and Tam connected with like-minded musicians, such as Downey and Shani Gaines-Bernard, the niece of disco legend Donna Summer, to create the Rehearsal.\n\u201cIt feels like a watering hole,\u201d Gaines-Bernard said. \u201cArtists come to [the Rehearsal] to drink and to showcase their stuff. Industry people who are looking for new artists come to this watering hole to discover that. There are people that come because they love the vibe. Everyone\u2019s coming to be nourished from this watering hole.\u201d\nIn the summer of 2023, Ortiz and her team partnered with Mercado La Paloma to premiere the revamped Rehearsal.\nIn 2024, Mercado La Paloma became best known for its Michelin-star-winning ceviche counter Holbox \u2014 and rightly so. Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr. and his brigade of talented line cooks make an uni-topped ceviche tostada that make the finest caviar blinis seem like Cheese Whiz on Ritz crackers.\nBut Ortiz pointed out that Mercado La Paloma has always been a place to find community. The Mercado was founded some 30 years ago by Mexican immigrants who missed the beloved open-air markets of their hometowns. These days \u2014 at least on Friday nights \u2014 the space offers musicians an equitable spotlight.\nOrtiz is no stranger to chasing stardom herself. After moonlighting in the music world while working full time as a nurse, Ortiz got her first break hosting a Latin hip-hop show in Las Vegas, then worked stints on music radio stations in Tijuana and San Diego. She eventually landed a hit show on Power 106-FM, L.A.\u2019s No. 1 hip-hop station; for several years, Ortiz led the midday airwaves with her \u201cNew at Two\u201d segment, where she would introduce new music from established artists and underground artists that had not broken into the mainstream yet.\n\u201cMy first day on Power, the music director comes in and he\u2019s like, \u2018So I know it\u2019s your first day. Congratulations. You\u2019re interviewing Sean Paul in 10 minutes.\u2019\u201d Ortiz recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, what? Hold on!\u2019\u201d\nBeyond the drink slinging and backstabbing romances, VH1\u2019s \u201cLove & Hip Hop\u201d remains one of the most popular reality franchises. How it went from frothy guilty pleasure to pop culture phenomenon and introducer of Cardi B.\nShe parlayed her radio success into TV notoriety, starring in the first season of \u201cLove & Hip Hop\u201d and hosting an entertainment segment on \u201cThe Talk.\u201d Ortiz said she was on a mission to be \u201cthe female Ryan Seacrest, because he had lots of jobs.\u201d\nYet these days, she is much more comfortable working with her team to foster the next generation of talent with the Rehearsal. And she hopes it grows to multiple venues, cities and even countries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the goal. Just to make a bigger space for more artists. But without losing the intimacy of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like how it\u2019s small and mighty. But hopefully we can scale that organically.\u201d"

She spoke about her exit weeks after delivering her final broadcast on July 30. She joined the KROQ team in September 2003 and was an on-air personality for weekday programming.\n\u201cI never knew how it would end. I just knew that when it did, I would have to be the one to write the final chapter,\u201d Alvarez wrote for THR.\nFormer MTV host Matt Pinfield says \u2018it is not lost on me how close I was to death\u2019 when he suffered a \u2018massive\u2019 stroke earlier this year. He says he will return to radio \u2018very soon.\u2019\nAlvarez said she did not intend for the late July broadcast to be her last, writing it was a moment \u201cthat was emotional, frenzied, and irreversible.\u201d She added she made the abrupt exit after a \u201cheated exchange\u201d with her boss. Though she did not share further information about that conversation, Alvarez underlined that her departure is rooted in \u201csomething much larger.\u201d\n\u201cLeaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done,\u201d Alvarez said. The station specializes in alternative rock and has long been a platform for notable acts including Nirvana, U2 and Depeche Mode, as Alvarez notes in her letter. During her tenure, Alvarez has also platformed groups including Linkin Park, Muse, the Smashing Pumpkins and Mumford & Sons.\nShe added: \u201cStaying would have been a slow death. After being disrespected by an executive known to do those type of things, I was done.\u201d\nAlvarez, who said she would \u201cnever speak ill\u201d of her longtime station, did not write any more of the alleged disrespect. A spokesperson for Audacy, which owns KROQ and several other stations across Southern California, did not comment to The Times.\nInside the Rehearsal, the Historic South-Central concert series founded by radio queen Yesi Ortiz\nFor Alvarez, her departure from KROQ was more about \u201cwhat radio has become\u201d and \u201cthe way business is handled these days.\u201d Alvarez resigned after refusing an offer for a contract extension, The Times has learned.\nShe lamented an alleged shift in the station\u2019s role in the music community over the years, writing that \u201cit has now become a spreadsheet\u201d and that its \u201ccaretakers\u201d are more motivated by professional milestones, and \u201cnot passion.\u201d Alvarez emphasized her loyalty to KROQ and reflected on her time informing listeners about major news events and the music that hit the airwaves.\nAs she moves, Alvarez wrote that the station has a chance to return to its roots.\n\u201cKROQ still has a chance to remember who it is, what made it \u2018world famous.\u2019 To take risks again. To matter,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it will require courage, not cowardice. Passion, not corporate approval.\u201d\nIn her letter, Alvarez thanked those involved in her tenure, ranging from her \u201choly trinity\u201d of colleagues (KROQ alumni Kevin Weatherly, Lisa Worden and Gene Sandbloom), to listeners and artists.\n\u201cRadio will always matter. In the right hands, it will always matter,\u201d she wrote.\nAlvarez also offered a stern but hopeful message to the executives she accuses of \u201csuffocating\u201d radio: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to introduce humanity into the corporate narrative. I challenge you to play the game without selling your souls.\u201d\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which funnels federal dollars to NPR and PBS stations, has long been a target of Republicans.\nOn Instagram, Alvarez said she has been waiting for a moment to pursue a new chapter and the shift in her radio duties \u201cdidn\u2019t feel right.\u201d She said that her devotion to music will remain, even with her KROQ days behind her.\n\u201cNow, with all my energy and all my passion, I can spend another lifetime championing it in new and bigger ways,\u201d she told her followers."

      "text": "Longtime KROQ veteran Nicole Alvarez abruptly left the iconic Los Angeles radio station at the end of July, giving a brief goodbye during her final moments on air on July 30. It was a sudden change, and a notable shift after she\u2019d spent the past two decades as a steady presence at the station through successes and the more recent tumult of the past few years.\nNow Alvarez is breaking her silence, penning an emotional letter in The Holllywood Reporter about why she left, her hopes for the future of radio, and what\u2019s on the horizon.\nRelated Stories\nAudacy, which owns KROQ, declined to comment on Alvarez\u2019s letter.\nLike any great love story, this one is messy. It is not perfect, but it is real.\nI never knew how it would end. I just knew that when it did, I would have to be the one to write the final chapter.\nOn September 1, 2003, I walked into The World Famous KROQ for my first day. I remember every detail, the smell of the parking lot asphalt, the pulse in my chest, and Tim Armstrong of Rancid standing there in his \u201cSalvation\u201d jacket. That moment felt like the start of the dream. I had somehow landed a job at what was arguably the most iconic radio station of all time. This was the place that helped launch The Ramones, U2, Depeche Mode, The Cure, Nirvana, and impressive roster of others. The soundtrack of your life probably passed through these call letters.\nOn July 30, 2025, I said my final words on air in a moment that was emotional, frenzied, and irreversible. I did not walk in that morning expecting it to be the end, but I felt something. A shift. A knowing. After a heated exchange with my boss, one that crossed a line no one could come back from, the air cracked open. Time stopped. And I heard Iggy Pop\u2019s voice cut through the static like a liberation siren: \u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m a punk rocker, yes I am.\u201d That was my cue. I did my final break, walked out, and didn\u2019t look back.\nI never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to the city and the listeners I will always love so much. That absence will weigh heavy on me forever.\nIt is worth saying that I love and respect my boss. He too is trying to navigate radio as it now exists under the corporate thumb and an ever-changing landscape. This is not about him. This is about something much larger. He who first hired me will always have a place in my heart.\nI was just shy of my 23-year anniversary at KROQ, and that alone is a badge of honor. I outlasted trends, format disorientation, bosses, budget cuts, and even my own rebellious nature. I did it always as myself. I never dumbed it down or dialed it in. I stood for the music, for the misfits, for Los Angeles, and for the station.\nLeaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done. But staying would have been a slow death. After being disrespected by an executive known to do those types of things, I was done. So I lit my life on fire for something that matters more than anything, my integrity. This round, I was willing to bet on myself.\nI am never going to speak ill of KROQ. This isn\u2019t about a station betraying me. It\u2019s a story about what radio has become. About wanting more. About the way business is handled these days.\nThe truth is, I had already outgrown what radio was allowed to be. This was the station that launched iconic musicians and gave a voice to the outcasts and visionaries of Southern California and beyond. Once a tastemaker, a cultural detonator, a lighthouse for the weird and wild, it has now become a spreadsheet. A machine run by research, not instinct. By caretakers who cling to titles, not passion.\nThere is more I could say that I won\u2019t.\nI gave my whole heart to this brand. I turned down bigger offers to stay loyal. I defended the station through crises and controversies. When the pandemic hit and our legacy morning show was abruptly fired in a move that made us the most hated station in Los Angeles, I held the line. I gave the station my voice, my credibility, my name. I tried to glue it back together. It was hard to stand inside the house that raised you while it was burning to the ground. Still I stood. A lot of us did.\nThrough it all, what mattered to me, was giving the music life. Even the songs I didn\u2019t particularly love. Even the ones we played to death. I focused on giving them context, soul, and a reason for people to hear them again. I wanted to make people feel something. That is what radio is supposed to do. I wanted to be a friend, good company. I wanted everyone to remember why it is that we love music.\nI had the privilege of working with some of the most talented people in the world. I got to be part of legendary events. I talked Los Angeles through championships, earthquakes, wildfires and soul-shaking loss. I got to be part of what many still believe is the greatest radio station of all time.\nKROQ still has a chance to remember who it is, what made it \u201cworld famous.\u201d To take risks again. To matter. But it will require courage, not cowardice. Passion, not corporate approval.\nI leave knowing I gave everything to our listeners, our artists and our culture. I also leave knowing that none of it mattered to the executives in the big offices. But that is not my burden to carry. That is theirs. It mattered to me.\nI leave with KROQ in my heart. It was my honor to stand for it. Part of me always will.\nI started at KROQ under the greatest radio team that ever was. Kevin Weatherly, Lisa Worden and Gene Sandbloom. The holy trinity. I will always consider myself the luckiest girl in the world to have been there when it was untouchable.\nTo the artists, listeners, and colleagues I have crossed paths with, I hope I made you feel something. I hope I reminded you of your own talent. I hope I left a mark. I hope I helped you in some small way. Hell, I hope I even rattled you.\nRadio will always matter. In the right hands, it will always matter. To the executives suffocating it, it\u2019s never too late to introduce humanity into the corporate narrative. I challenge you to play the game without selling your souls. Radio is not dying. You\u2019re killing it. Just do better.\nAs for my legacy, I hope it has everything to do with music, a girl can dream. KROQ taught me that a long time ago. I hope it remembers.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

  "argos_summary": "Nicole Alvarez, a long\u2011time KROQ\u2011FM personality, abruptly left the station after a heated exchange with management and a refusal to sign a contract extension, citing disrespect and a shift toward corporate metrics over passion. In a farewell letter published by the Hollywood Reporter, she praised KROQ\u2019s legacy of launching iconic artists while urging the station to return to its roots and take risks again. The article also touches on broader media issues, noting the shutdown of the Corp. for Public Broadcasting amid federal funding cuts and highlighting Yesi Ortiz\u2019s new music venue, The Rehearsal, as a counter to the pay\u2011to\u2011play model. Additionally, it briefly mentions former MTV host Matt Pinfield\u2019s recovery from a stroke and his plans to return to radio.",
