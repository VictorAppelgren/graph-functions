      "text": "Minneapolis authorities said at least two children are dead and more than a dozen were injured Wednesday after a shooter opened fire during a Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minnesota.\nThe attacker was identified by law enforcement sources to Fox News as a person who may have used two names, Robin Westman and Robert Westman. Police described the gunman as in his early 20s and dressed in black clothing, targeted the Mass, which marked the first week of classes for children attending the school, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.\n\"During the Mass, a gunman approached on the outside on the side of the building and began firing a rifle through the church windows towards the children sitting in the pews at the Mass. Shooting through the windows, he struck children and worshipers that were inside the building,\" O'Hara said. \"The shooter was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshiping. The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.\"\n\"Two young children, ages eight and 10, were killed where they sat in the pews. Their parents have been notified. Seventeen other people were injured, 14 of them being children,\" O'Hara added, noting that \"the coward who fired these shots ultimately took his own life in the rear of the church.\"\nFEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN MINNESOTA LAW BARRING RELIGIOUS COLLEGES FROM STATE PROGRAM\nMayor Jacob Frey said, \"There are no words that can capture the horror and the evil of this unspeakable act.\n\"We are a Minneapolis family.

Residents who live in the area said they heard so much gunfire they didn't initially call police, thinking it was someone roofing their house, according to Fox 9.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"DHS is monitoring the horrific shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis.\"\nSOCIALIST CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR MAKES WAVES IN THE CITY OF LAKES\n\"We are in communication with our interagency partners, and will share more information as soon as it becomes available. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families,\" she continued.\nATF agents \"are responding to reports of an active shooter situation at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis,\" according to the agency\u2019s St. Paul Office.\nPresident Donald Trump said he has been \"fully briefed on the tragic shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\"The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene.
