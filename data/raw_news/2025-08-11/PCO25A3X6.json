  "description": "\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business. On today's show, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) shares his thoughts on President Trump extending the China tariff truce for 90 days. Michael Gerhardt, Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence at UNC School of Law, talks about President Trump abusing his authority with his takeover of the Washington, DC police. Jane Harman, former US Democratic Representative of California, shares her thoughts on what to expect Friday as President Trump and President Putin are expected to meet and discuss the war in Ukraine.

  "content": "> > THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. > > FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON DC STUDIOS TO OUR TV AND RADIO AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE, WELCOME TO BALANCE OF POWER. I'M JOE MATHIEU. TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOYS THE NATIONAL GUARD TO WASHINGTON AND TAKES CONTROL OF LOCAL POLICE DESPITE THE CITY EXPERIENCING A 30 YEAR LOW IN VIOLENT CRIME. > > I'M ANNOUNCING A HISTORIC ACTION TO RESCUE OUR NATION'S CAPITAL FROM CRIME, BLOODSHED, BEDLAM AND SQUALOR. JOE: THE PRESIDENT FLANKED BY HIS OFFICIALS DESPITE WHAT HE SAYS IS AN UPTICK IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL OF CRIME, SENDING THE NATIONAL GUARD AND PUTTING THE CITY STREETS UNDER FEDERAL AUTHORITY. THE FACTS ON THE GROUND ABOUT LOCAL CRIME AND HOW OFFICIALS ARE RESPONDING. PLUS, THE PRESIDENT ON HIS SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN FOLLOWING A MEETING WITH VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THAT TRUMP AND PUTIN SHOW DOWN JUST FOUR DAYS FROM NOW. THE DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, NVIDIA AND AMD, THE COMPANY'S AGREEING TO PAY THE U.S. 15% OF THE REVENUE FROM AI CHIP SALES TO CHINA. THE DEVELOPING NEWS AS WE COME TO AIR, THE TARIFF TRUCE WITH BEIJING EXTENDED ANOTHER 90 DAYS. THAT IS WHERE WE START WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP EXTENDING THE CHAIR IF TRUCE WITH CHINA AN ADDITIONAL 90 DAYS AS OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM BEIJING, THAT COMING AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED A NEGOTIATED DEAL WITH NVIDIA CEO JENSEN HUANG. THAT GIVES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 15% OF ITS REVENUES FROM AI CHIPS SOLD IN CHINA. CHIPMAKER AMD STRUCK A SIMILAR DEAL AND MORE CAN BE COMING. WE KICK THINGS OFF WITH ROMAINE BOSTICK WITH TONIGHT POWER MOVES FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. > > IT WAS AN INTERESTING ANNOUNCEMENT AT 230 P.M. WALL STREET TRITON. UNFORTUNATELY THE MARKET KIND OF SHRUGGED IT OFF. WE DID SEE A VERY MINOR JUMP IN STOCKS OFF THE LOWS OF THE DAY. THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE RED BUT THAT FADED. THEY FADED EVEN DEEPER CLOSER TO THE CLOSE. DOWN 2/10 OF A PERCENT FOR THE S & P 500. A BIG PART OF THE REASON HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP OR TRADE. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE ECONOMIC DATA THAT'S ON TOP INCLUDING THE BIG CPI REPORT TOMORROW WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING THROUGH THAT REPORT FOR ANY SIGNS THERE IS SOME TARIFF PASSED THROUGH. THE IDEA THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE SHOULDERING THESE COSTS ARE MAY BE POTENTIALLY PASSING THEM ON TO CONSUMERS, WHETHER THAT SHOWS UP IN THE REPORT TOMORROW MEANS TO BE SEEN BUT IT'S A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU SAW A BIT OF STASIS WHEN IT COMES TO WHERE EQUITIES MOVE. WE SHOULD POINT OUT THIS IS ALSO A DAY WHERE THERE IS A BIG FOCUS ON THE CHIP SECTOR. COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY BY PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH REGARDS TO THE ABILITY OF JENSEN HUANG AND NVIDIA TO SELL ITS HIGHEST AND MOST POWERFUL TRIPS TO CHINA. THE NEWS OF COURSE ABOUT 15% THEY WOULD PAY ON ANY SALES TO CHINA, AND OF COURSE THE MEETING THAT APPARENTLY JUST ENDED BETWEEN THE INTEL CEO AND THE PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. JOE: BLOOMBERG'S ROMAINE BOSTICK. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. FOR MORE ON THE CHINA TARIFF TRUCE EXTENSION, WE GO TO DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ROGER KRISHNAMURTHY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME BACK. I'M DEEPLY CURIOUS TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE NVIDIA AMD AGREEMENTS. THIS 90 DAY EXTENSION, IS THIS THE RIGHT THING RIGHT NOW? > > I THINK IT'S YET ANOTHER EXTENSION THAT CAUSES MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD. IT HURTS OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. I'VE TALKED TO BUSINESSES ON THE PHONE REPEATEDLY WHO ARE PAUSING HIRING, PAUSING INVESTMENT, AND BASICALLY STARTING TO LAY PEOPLE OFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. SO THESE INFINITE -- EXTENSIONS WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION ESPECIALLY WITH BLANKET TARIFFS CAUSES HIGH PRICES, MAKES THINGS UNAFFORDABLE AND STALLS ECONOMIC GROWTH. JOE: YOU GO WITH ANOTHER 90 DAYS, WILL THAT BE ENOUGH TIME TO GENERATE A DEAL? > > I DON'T KNOW. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR WITH XI JINPING. HE'S TRYING TO BRING THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE OR DO SOMETHING, WE CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT IT IS THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT HE'S HIKING TARIFFS, BLANKET TARIFFS ON OUR PARTNERS AND FRIENDS AND ALLIES, DRIVING THEM FURTHER AWAY EVEN AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED THEIR ASSISTANCE IN CURBING ECONOMIC AGGRESSION BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IN TERMS OF ITS TRADE PRACTICES. SO I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS RIGHT NOW. JOE: WE KNOW CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY HIGH-END AI CHIPS. NOT THE HIGHEST TO BE CLEAR. THE H 20 CHIPS FROM NVIDIA AND A SIMILAR COMPONENT FROM AMD. WHAT IS NEW HOWEVER IS THAT THE TWO COMPANIES I JUST MENTIONED WILL BE GIVING SOME OF THE PROCEEDS TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER TODAY TALKED ABOUT THIS NEGOTIATED DEAL WITH NVIDIA CEO JENSEN LONG THAT WOULD GIVE 15% OF REVENUES FROM CHINA'S AI CHIP SALES. AMD APPARENTLY WILL BE WORKING UNDER A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT. LISTEN TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID EARLIER. > > I DIDN'T -- DEAL WITH JENSEN WAS A GREAT GUY AT NVIDIA. THE CHIP WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT'S AN OLD CHIP. I SAID LISTEN, I WANT 20%. IF I'M GOING TO IMPROVE THIS FOR YOU. HE SAID WOULD YOU MAKE IT 15? WE NEGOTIATED A LITTLE DEAL. ON THE BLACK WELL, I THINK HE'S COMING TO SEE ME AGAIN ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT WOULD BE AN UN-ENHANCED VERSION OF THE BIG ONE. JOE: WE CAN TALK ABOUT BLACK WELL IN A MOMENT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT. BUT JUST THE H20 CHIP WAS OFF-LIMITS TO CHINA ONLY WEEKS AGO ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS. EXPORTS WERE LIFTED AFTER JENSEN HUANG HE MET WITH DONALD TRUMP. NOW 15% OF THEIR SALES WILL BE GOING TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND THIS. DID DONALD TRUMP JUST TO CLEAR THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A PRICE? > > YES, HE DECLARED ARE NATURAL -- NATIONAL SECURITY IS FOR SALE. IT'S A DERELICTION OF DUTY. THE FIRST THING THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO IS PROTECT THE COUNTRY. WHEN HE SAYS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS FOR SALE, THAT OUR CROWN JEWELS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH REVENUE-SHARING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT IS A HORRIBLE SIGN TO OUR ADVERSARIES. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NEXT? SELL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO THE CHINESE AND THE GOVERNMENT TAKES A 20% CUT? THIS IS HORRIBLE. WE SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF THESE H20 CHIPS TO THE CCP. THE FACT THAT HE WOULD EVEN BROACH THE TOPIC OF BLACK WELL PROCESSORS POTENTIALLY BEING FOR SALE TO THE CHINESE MEANS THEY ARE SALIVATING AT THE PROSPECT OF BASICALLY TAKING THOSE TRIPS, INSERTING THEM INTO THEIR MILITARY SYSTEMS, WHICH WOULD BE USED AGAINST US AND OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND ALSO USED AGAINST VARIOUS MINORITIES IN PERPETRATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THIS IS A REALLY REALLY DARK DAY FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. JOE: WOW. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BLACKWELL? IS NVIDIA WORKING ON A CHINA FRIENDLY VERSION? > > I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS AND I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF HEAD SCRATCHING ON CAPITOL HILL. I HOPE MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE ALSO AS DISTURBED AS I AM. BUT WE WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION AT THIS POINT TO REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF THE SALE OF THESE HIGH -- HIGH-END CHIPS TO CHINA BECAUSE FRANKLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR OUR BEST INTERESTS AT THIS POINT AS A COUNTRY. JOE: HAVE YOU WRITTEN THAT BILL AND WOULD YOU GET REPUBLICANS TO SIGN ONTO IT? > > I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO GET REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO JOIN THIS BILL. WE MUST SAY WITH ONE VOICE THAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY COMES FIRST. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF EXPORT CONTROLS. THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO SOMEHOW BE USED TO BARGAINING FOR OTHER TRADE CONCESSIONS, AND YET WE ARE NOW SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE CHINESE THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THOSE EXPORT CONTROLS ARE SUBJECT TO. SO I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED. I HOPE MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS CAN PREVAIL UPON THE WHITE HOUSE TO CHANGE COURSE, BUT REGARDLESS I THINK IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BEFORE THESE CHIPS ARE SOLD GOING FORWARD. JOE: WILL YOU FILE THAT BILL BEFORE YOU GET TO TOWN? > > YES, IF NOT SOONER. JOE: TALK TO US WHEN YOU DO. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ROGER KRISHNAMURTHY. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT PUTIN SET TO MEET FREDDY. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WITH A FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS MOMENT. FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL DEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL. WE WILL BRING YOU THE DETAILS AND THE REALITY OF THE GRANT -- ON THE GROUND NEXT ON BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. \u266a > > OUR CAPITAL CITY HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY VIOLENT GANGS AND BLOODTHIRSTY CRIMINALS, ROVING MOBS OF WILD USE, DRUGGED OUT MANIACS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE. AND WERE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WASHINGTON, D.C. SHOULD BE ONE OF THE SAFEST, CLEANEST, AND MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND WE WILL MAKE IT THAT WAY. WE WILL MAKE IT SAFE, WE WILL MAKE IT SMART, BEAUTIFUL. JOE: THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. PRESIDENT TRUMP ON HIS DECISION TO DEPLOY 800 NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ACROSS THE NATION'S CAPITAL EVEN INVOKING THE HOME RULE ACT THAT ALLOWS HIM TO TEMPORARILY ASSUME CONTROL OF THE DISTRICT POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC TODAY RUNS COUNTER TO STATISTICS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE JUST FROM JANUARY THAT FOUND VIOLENT CRIME IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IN FACT WAS AT A 30 YEAR LOAN. DATA FROM THE D.C. POLICE PAINTING A CLEARER PICTURE, TOTAL CRIME OVERALL DOWN 7% FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR. JOINING US WITH THE LATEST ON THIS IS BLOOMBERG'S MYLES MILLER. WHAT ELSE CAN WE FIGURE OUT FROM THE DATA? > > IF YOU LOOK JUST ANECDOTALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN HIGH-PROFILE INCIDENTS IN WASHINGTON. A CAPITOL HILL STAFFERS WERE ENTERING WERE SHOT AT 7TH STREET WHICH IS A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE BY THE CONVENTION CENTER. THEN A FEW DAYS AGO, A PERSON AFFILIATED WITH THE DOGE EFFORT, A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE WHO WAS ATTACKED WHAT YOU HAVE IS A TAKEOVER BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOME RULE ACT, 800 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS WILL BE DOING MAINLY TRAFFIC AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT BUT EFFECTIVELY RUN BY PAM BONDI. SHE WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THE NEW HEAD OF THE DEA. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MPD, THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT? IT WILL STILL BE RUN BY ITS CHIEF AND THEY WILL ANSWER TO THE CHIEF BUT THE CHIEF WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO PAM BONDI AND TERRY COLE. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THIS FOLLOWS THE MODEL THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN OTHER CITIES. I AM IN L.A. RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW HE DEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD TO ALLAY AFTER THE IMMIGRATION PROTESTS, BUT THIS COMES AFTER CONGRESS STRIPPED $1 BILLION FROM D.C.'S BUDGET. D.C. SAYS THEY NEED MORE COPS. THE PRESIDENT SAYS WHY DO YOU NEED MORE THAN 3000 COPS? HE'S GOING TO DO. THIS WITH FEDERAL JOE: LAW ENFORCEMENT JOE: BLOOMBERG'S MYLES MILLER, THANK YOU FOR COVERING THIS. D.C. MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER SPOKE TO THE MEDIA A SHORT TIME AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT. > > I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL AMERICANS, WE DON'T BELIEVE OR BELIEVE IT'S LEGAL TO USE THE AMERICAN MILITARY ARE AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS ON AMERICAN SOIL. I'M NOT A LAWYER, BUT I THINK THAT'S A FAIRLY WIDE HELD FACT. JOE: JOINING US NOW FOR CONTEXT IS MICHAEL GERHARDT, DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR AT UNC SCHOOL OF LAW OF JURISPRUDENCE. WE SEEK A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHTS ARE AND WHERE HIS AUTHORITY LIES. HAS HE IN ANY WAY ABUSED THE LAW AROUND HIS AUTHORITY? THE MAYOR MADE CLEAR TODAY UNDER THIS HOME RULE ACT, THE PRESIDENT CAN IN FACT DETERMINE WHAT THE EMERGENCY IS THAT HE'S DECLARING. > > I THINK HE HAS ABUSED HIS AUTHORITY. YOU'RE RIGHT, UNDER SECTION 740 OF THE HOME RULE ACT, THE PRESIDENT DOES GET SOME AUTHORITY. BUT I'M NOT SURE HE GETS TO DECIDE FOR HIMSELF WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY. HIS RENDITION OR VERSION OF THE SO FACTS FOR THE CRIME IN D.C. IS QUITE CONTRARY TO WHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFICIALS IN D.C. SAYS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SORT OF ENGAGED IN ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF THE FACTS TO SUIT HIS OWN PURPOSES. HE WANTS TO HAVE A DISTRACTION FROM THE UPSTREAM FILES -- EPSTEIN FILES. THIS IS YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT. HE'S BEEN DOING IT IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS WITH HIS BASE AND THE FACTS ARE CONTRARY TO WHAT HE SAYS. JOE: SO AS THE PRESIDENT DECLARED MARTIAL LAW OVER THE CAPITAL CITY? > > NOT YET BUT HE'S EFFECTIVELY TRYING TO DO THAT. THERE IS NO NEED FOR FEDERAL FORCES TO STEP IN. THERE IS ALREADY A PRETTY GOOD POLICE FORCE IN PLACE IN D.C. AS THE MIRRORS AND OTHERS -- AS THE MAYOR AND OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT, CRIME IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW IN D.C. WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE PRESIDENT'S ASSERTION OF AN EMERGENCY THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO TAKE OVER. HE ONLY GETS 48 HOURS TO DO THAT BEFORE HE HAS TO MAKE A REPORT ON WITH THE PROGRESS IS THAT HE'S DONE. SO WE ARE NEXT WAITING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF THINGS HE SAYS. WE HAVE TO HOPE AT SOME POINT HE WILL BE GROUNDED IN REALITY. JOE: I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL. UNDER THE HOME RULE ACT, THE PRESIDENT CAN IN FACT FEDERALIZE OR TAKE CONTROL OF THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR 48 HOURS BEFORE HAVING TO REASSERT HIS AUTHORITY. WE WILL BE IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY TWO DAYS THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO MAKE A PHONE CALL, DECLARE AN EMERGENCY, AND TAKE OVER THE POLICE? > > WELL, WE COULD BE. I THINK THIS IS PART OF HIS PLAYBOOK. KEEP PEOPLE OFF BALANCE, DISTRACT FROM THINGS HE DOESN'T WANT THEM TO LOOK AT AND TRY TO TURN DEMOCRATS INTO THE ENEMY. BUT THE PEOPLE OF D.C. DESERVE BETTER AND THE CRIME RATE IS LOWER. ALL-TIME LOW AS WE SAID. ACCORDING TO THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE HOME RULE ACT, THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT HE'S DOING. JOE: REALLY INTERESTING. HE DID TALK ABOUT OTHER CITIES TODAY, TALKING WITH REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT CHICAGO AND NEW YORK. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE PRESIDENT DEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN LOS ANGELES AS MILES REMINDED US A MOMENT AGO BUT IS THAT THE END AGAIN? OR IS WASHINGTON SPECIAL AS THE FEDERAL CITY? > > THE FACT THAT HE MENTIONED OTHER CITIES SUGGESTS THAT HIS GAME PLAN IS BASICALLY TO GO AND TRY TO CAST DEMOCRATIC CITIES AS UNDER SIEGE IN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FACTS ARE CONTRARY TO THAT. WHAT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED AND WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES HERE IS FACTS THAT ARE TRUE THAT WOULD GUIDE THE POLICY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS INSTANCE. I THINK THIS IS A PLAY OR A PLOY TO PUT ATTENTION OTHER THAN WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS ATTENTION ON. HE IS STILL LOSING SUPPORT IN SOME CIRCLES BECAUSE OF THE EPSTEIN MESS AND TODAY HE'S TRYING YET AGAIN TO DIVERT ATTENTION. JOE: IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOU. MICHAEL GERHARDT, DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF JURISPRUDENCE AT UNC SCHOOL OF LAW. JOINING US FOR MORE ANALYSIS ON THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THE STORY, THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, ADAM HYDE. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU. WHAT IS GOING ON? THE PROFESSOR MENTIONED JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S NAME AT LEAST TWICE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING WHY NOW WHEN WE HAVE CRIME ACCORDING TO THE DOJ AT A 30 YEAR LOW, WHY WOULD YOU MOBILIZE TO AUTHORITIES AND THE NATIONAL GUARD? IS IT AS SIMPLE AS OBSCURING FROM ANOTHER STORY CALLED EPSTEIN? > > I WILL DO ONE THING FIRST AND ACTUALLY GIVE THE CREDIT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ONE THING. AS YOU POINTED OUT, FACTS MATTER , IT IS A HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATE. PROFESSOR GERHART IS RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT DISTRACTING FROM THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN STORY THAT HAS BEEN DOGGING HIM ALL SUMMER. IT IS SOMETHING HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM HERE YET AGAIN. I THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU COULD TELL THERE IS EVEN MIXED MESSAGES WHEN KASH PATEL SPOKE TO, AT THE WHITE HOUSE STANDING NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT, GOT OFF SCRIPT AND TALKED ABOUT HOW D.C.'S CRIME RATE IS DOWN. I THINK THAT TELLS YOU ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. THE LAST THING I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR, REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND DONALD TRUMP SIGNED IT, A BILL THAT PUTS D.C.'S BUDGET IN LIMBO. YOU HEARD THE MAYOR REPEATEDLY TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WAS HURTING THEIR ABILITY TO PUT COPS IN THE STREET AND TO HIRE NEW COPS IN D.C. WE HAVE A BIT OF A TRICKY ISSUE FOR THE PRESIDENT WHERE HIS ACTIONS ALSO UNDERMINE THE EFFORTS HE'S MADE AND WHAT HE ANNOUNCED TODAY. JOE: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE POLITICS OF D.C.? I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT FROM HERE HAVE DIFFERENT THOUGHTS, BUT THIS IS A REAL CITY, ACTUALLY PEOPLE AND FAMILIES ARE FROM HERE, PEOPLE DON'T JUST WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE GREAT NEIGHBORHOODS WITH WONDERFUL CULTURE AND HISTORY. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR PEOPLE. IF YOU SEE THE LICENSE PLATE IN WASHINGTON IT SAYS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. OF COURSE THERE WAS A LONG TIME DRIVE TO GET STATEHOOD STATUS HERE. NOW PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER HOME RULE WILL SURVIVE THIS ADMINISTRATION. WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT? > > I THINK IT WILL RALLY THE CITY TOGETHER. IT MAY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS HOPING FOR. I THINK THE THING DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THOUGH IS TO NOT GET SIDETRACKED BY THE PRESIDENT. HE'S TRYING TO THROW -- AS THE PROFESSOR WAS SAYING, A LOT OF THINGS IN THE AIR TO DISTRACT. HE HAS BEEN DOGGED BY THE ACTIVE SCENE -- EPSTEIN SCANDAL ALL SUMMER AND THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL IS HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR INCLUDING WITH HIS BASE. THOSE EFFECTS ARE STARTING TO HIT FOR HIS MOTORS AND IT WILL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND I THINK THAT WAS WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM. I THINK WE CAN'T GET CAUGHT WITH A SHINY OBJECT, AND FOCUS ON THE BILLS WE KNOW ARE UNPOPULAR AND TALK ABOUT THE RISING COSTS THAT MAY COME FROM THE TARIFFS WE WILL SEE LATER THIS YEAR. JOE: THE FACT IS THAT WE COULD HAVE SOME INTERESTING OPTIX IN THE DAYS AHEAD. I'M ASSUMING THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SHOW SOMETHING FOR THIS MOBILIZATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A BIT OF SHOCK AND ALL COMING HERE OR IF WE START SEEING A LOT OF ARRESTS. BUT IF THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE CITIZENS OF WASHINGTON, D.C. WITHOUT CAUSE, IF WE START SEEING VIDEO OF THAT HAPPENING, IS THERE A BACKLASH POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE CITY POLITICALLY? > > THERE MIGHT BE. D.C. TODAY IS A CALM CITY. IT IS A MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA WITH SOME VIOLENCE, BUT BY ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, IT'S PRETTY CALM. THIS HAS THE IMPACT OF ACTUALLY CREATING LAWLESSNESS. NO ONE IS CALLING FOR IT, PEOPLE SHOULD PROTEST PEACEFULLY. I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE ON BLOOMBERG AND WILL SAY IT AGAIN, IF YOU WANT TO PROTEST, PROTEST PEACEFULLY. BUT THIS TURNS INTO AN EFFORT OF URBAN CHAOS AND THAT'S ON THE PRESIDENT. HE'S DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE. PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE THEIR PAIN AND CLEAR IN A PEACEFUL -- OPINION CLEAR IN A PEACEFUL AND NONVIOLENT WAY. BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU SEE THAT HAPPEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON TO BLAME. I WALKED AROUND, TOOK MY KIDS TO SCHOOL AND IT WAS A SAFE DAY. ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AROUND HERE IS ON THE PRESIDENT. JOE: I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED TO SEE HIM. I DID NOT SEE ANY MORE CRUISERS OR POLICE THAN I WOULD GOING THROUGH THE DISTRICT AND MAYBE THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE. THE FBI APPARENTLY WAS DEPLOYED AS OF THE END OF LAST WEEK AND WE WILL SEE IF UNIFORMED TROOPS SHOW UP. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, ADAM HODGE, BLOOMBERG POLITICS CONTRIBUTOR AND MANAGING EDITOR AT BULLY PULPIT INTERNATIONAL. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO MEET VLADIMIR PUTIN THIS FRIDAY IN ALASKA AS PART OF THE RENEWED BID TO END THE WAR IN UKRAINE. WE WILL SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AHEAD TO THAT SUMMIT WITH JANE HARMAN, THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN FROM CALIFORNIA AND FORMER RANKING MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS WE PREPARE FOR WHAT COULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT MEETING OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. HIS NEXT ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. > > I'M GOING IN TO SPEAK TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND I'M GOING TO BE TELLING HIM, YOU GOTTA END THIS WAR. I MAY LEAVE AND SAY GOOD LUCK AND THAT WILL BE THE END. I MAY SAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE SETTLED. I WILL MEET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT HE HAS IN MIND AND IF IT'S A FAIR DEAL, I WILL REVEAL IT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS AND NATO LEADERS AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, I THINK OUT OF RESPECT I WILL CALL HIM FIRST. AT THE END OF THAT MEETING, PROBABLY THE FIRST TWO MINUTES, I WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT A DEAL CAN BE MADE. JOE: IT'S BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. I'M JOE MATHIEU. THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP AHEAD OF HIS MEETING WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT LETTERMAN PUTIN AHEAD OF HIS MEETING -- VLADIMIR PUTIN. HERE WITH MORE ON THIS, ERIC MARTIN. THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'S PUSHING FOR ZELENSKYY TO BE AT THE \"NEXT MEETING,\" I'M ASSUMING THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THIS MEETING. WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED? > > ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S WONDERING. WE ARE SO USED TO SEEING SCRIPTED MOMENTS WHERE A U.S. PRESIDENT GETS TOGETHER WITH THE FOREIGN COUNTERPART BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DEAL ALREADY PREARRANGED TO ANNOUNCE THESE DELIVERABLES, IF THE PRESIDENT GO SOMEPLACE, THEY WANT TO HAVE DELIVERABLES AND THINGS TO ROLL OUT. THIS IS A MEETING WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE. SEEING WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN SEEING EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2019 AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER TO HIM THE MESSAGE HE DELIVERED PUBLICLY IN THE BRIEFING ROOM TODAY AND THEN SEE WHERE THINGS ARE. ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING IN THIS DISCUSSION AND REPRESENTING AND DOWNLOADING THAT HIS PERCEPTIONS TO THE U.K., FRANCE, GERMANY, UKRAINE TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, TO ALL OF THESE OTHER U.S. ALLIES AND PARTNERS, AND EVERYBODY WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE RESULTS OF THAT CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE. JOE: SCANT DETAILS ON EXACTLY WHERE IN ALASKA THIS WILL TAKE PLACE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LONG THEY WILL MEET AND WHAT THE CONDITIONS WILL BE? > > THAT'S RIGHT, WE STILL DON'T KNOW. WE ARE STILL IN THE DARK ON HOW THIS WILL HAPPEN. THE HISTORIC NATURE IS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE WILL HAVE A RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ON U.S. SOIL IN A DECADE SINCE THE U.N. MEETINGS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN 2015 IN THE FIRST BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN A U.S. PRESIDENT AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SINCE 1988. MIKHAIL GORBACHEV. REALLY THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE SUMMIT IS QUITE FASCINATING IN AND OF ITSELF. JOE: FOR SURE, WE UNDERSCORE THE HISTORIC NATURE OF WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE. BLOOMBERG'S ERIC MARTIN, THANK YOU. JOINING US FOR MORE INSIGHTS INTO WHAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE, JANE HARMAN, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN FROM DIMOCK -- CALIFORNIA AND MEMBER OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. THIS IS AN INTERESTING SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. WHY IS THE UNITED STATES THE HOST NATION FOR THE SUMMIT? > > WELL, I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TALK TO PUTIN SOLO IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND IT'S ON U.S. SOIL AND WEIRD IT'S ON U.S. SOIL BECAUSE PUTIN CANNOT GO A LOT OF PLACES. THE ICC HAS DECLARED HIM A WAR CRIMINAL AND WE DON'T BELONG TO THE ICC SO HE'S WELCOME HERE AND HE'S NOT GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET TO THE UNITED STATES. REMEMBER SARAH PALIN ONCE SAID SHE COULD SEE RUSSIA FROM ALASKA. JUST POINTING THAT OUT. [LAUGHTER] IN 1994, THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE GIVE UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AGREEMENT TO RESPECT ITS SOVEREIGNTY. WHO WAS ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THAT? HIS NAME IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE'S VIOLATED EVERY AGREEMENT HE'S MADE WITH UKRAINE SINCE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GUY COMING INTO THIS MEETING THAT I WOULD PUT A LOT OF TRUST IN. PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SAID HE WILL KNOW WHEN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES WHETHER THERE SOMETHING SERIOUS HERE. PUTIN HAS ALREADY SAID HE WANTS OF VICTORY AND HIS PEOPLE THINK HE'S WON. LET'S UNDERSTAND THE COMEBACKS IN VOICE OF AMERICA AND RADIO FREE EUROPE HAVE ELIMINATED A HUGE SOURCE OF INFORMATION INTO RUSSIA. PUTIN IS COMING INTO THIS FEELING GREAT. JOE: THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THIS AS A FEELING OUT KIND OF MEETING AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING WITH PRECONDITIONS, WITH AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE, WITH AN AGENDA. YOU KNOW WITH THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HERE IS, THIS IS ALREADY A WIN FOR PUTIN, THE FACT THAT HE'S GOT AN INVITE TO THE USA TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. THE OPTICS, IS THAT JUST THE COST OF BROKERING PEACE? > > I'M IN TOTAL AGREEMENT. BASICALLY WHAT YOU SAID, I THINK THIS IS THE COST OF BEING PLAYED AGAIN BY VLADIMIR PUTIN. IT'S TOTALLY CLEAR THE REST OF THE WORLD THINKS AND CERTAINLY I DO, AND I HOPE YOU DO, THAT RUSSIA WAS THE AGGRESSOR HERE. UKRAINE WAS THERE STARTING IN 2014, THERE'S BEEN RUSSIA MEDDLING WITH A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION. I WAS AN ELECTION OBSERVER BACK THEN. BUT 11 YEARS LATER, IT'S HOT WAR AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AND NOTHING HAS COME OUT OF IT EXCEPT MISERY . THERE'S NO WAY PUTIN WILL GET WHAT HE'S ASKING FOR AND THERE'S NO WAY TRUMP CAN GIVE IT TO HIM. TRUMP ALREADY KNOWS WHAT IT IS SO THE MUCH BETTER APPROACH TO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TALK TO THE VICTIM HERE, UKRAINE, AND FIND OUT WITH THEIR TERMS ARE AND THEN MAY BRING PUTIN INTO THE ROOM AND SEE HOW TO SETTLE IT OUT. BUT THERE CANNOT BE, GIVEN THE HISTORY WITH RUSSIA, ANY AGREEMENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF A FORCE ALONG THE BORDER , THE AGREED TO BORDER, THE NEW ONE BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE PUTIN WILL VIOLATE IT AGAIN. JOE: I DON'T KNOW YOU MAKE OF THIS TALK, ALTHOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE I DO KNOW WHAT YOU TAKE OF THE TALK ABOUT LAND SWAPS. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PLAN, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WILL NOT BE AT THE TABLE NOR WILL ANY OF OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES WHO OF COURSE HAVE A LOT TO LOSE OR GAIN, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME HERE. AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN WAS BROUGHT FORTH OVER THE WEEKEND FROM OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES WITH A JOINT STATEMENT THAT CAME FROM EMMANUEL MACRON, THE CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY, U.K. PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER AND OTHERS, THAT THEY DO -- DIPLOMATIC AND TO THE MUST PROC PROTECT THE SECURITY OF EUROPE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? > > PROTECTING EUROPE REQUIRES MAKING SURE PUTIN HAS NO ROOM TO VIOLATE ANY AGREEMENT UKRAINE CHOOSES TO MAKE. LET'S UNDERSTAND UKRAINE HAS TO MAKE THIS AGREEMENT. NOT ME, NOT YOU AND NOT DONALD TRUMP. UKRAINE HAS VALIANTLY FOUGHT THIS WAR AND IS THE COUNTRY THAT IS THE VICTIM. IF PUTIN GETS AWAY WITH THIS, HE GOES RIGHT INTO EUROPE. THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING ANY AGREEMENT ON BORDERS, LET'S IMAGINE EXISTING PREWAR BORDERS, STILL WILL REQUIRE SOME KIND OF A FORCE ALONG THE BORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT PUTIN DOES NOT VIOLATE IT. AND WELCOMING UKRAINE INTO NATO SEEMS A NONSTARTER AT THE MOMENT , BUT A NATO FORCE ALONG THE BORDER SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME OR CERTAINLY NATO COUNTRIES ALONG THAT BORDER SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME IF THERE'S GOING TO BE IN AGREEMENT. THE WAR SHOULD STOP. SOMEONE WAS QUIPPING THAT TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY IS HATES WAR, HE LOVES GOLD. BUT HE HATES MORE, SO OK. HE GETS A WIN IF THIS THING IS DONE CORRECTLY. HE'S NOT GOING TO GET A WIN TOMORROW. THE GUY WHO WILL GET A WIN TOMORROW -- FRIDAY IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. JOE: I JUST WONDER REALISTICALLY WHAT YOU SEE HERE FOR POTENTIAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING WITH THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THAT REMARK. HE'S SAYING GOOD LUCK, WE ARE PULLING AWAY FROM THE TABLE EVEN THOUGH WE SAID WE WOULD END THIS IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT ANGLING FOR A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. IS IT POSSIBLE AT THIS STAGE FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY TO KEEP THE DONBAS AND CRIMEA PART OF HIS COUNTRY? > > WELL, LET'S LET HIM DECIDE THAT WITH HELP FROM MOST OF US WHO THINK HE HAS FOUGHT VALIANTLY TO PROTECT HIS SOVEREIGNTY. LET'S SEE. I'M NOT SAYING THE DONBAS IS GONE. IT HAS BEEN INTERFERED WITH FOR 11 YEARS BY RUSSIA. BUT STILL THERE WAS A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION IN 2014. I DON'T THINK IT'S GONE. I DON'T THINK CRIMEA IS GONE. I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS PLAYING A WEAK HAND BRILLIANTLY. PEOPLE THINK HE'S WON AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING RIGHT INTO THAT BY SAYING I WILL KNOW WHEN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES. THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ANY KIND OF EFFECTIVE DIPLOMACY. JOE: DO YOU THINK WE GET A BILATERAL NEWS CONFERENCE WHEN IT'S DONE OR DO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MEETING? > > WE HAD ONE A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE HE QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE AND SAID RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE IS BETTER. I'M SAYING THAT I DON'T SEE A WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THIS MEETING AND I SEE ANOTHER DISTRACTION FROM OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT WORKING SO WELL LIKE ISRAEL AND GAZA. I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH PRESIDENT NETANYAHU STRATEGY HERE AND I THINK THERE ARE MUCH BETTER OPTIONS. PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL. THERE MIGHT BE A NOBEL PRIZE AT THE END OF THAT ONE IF IT WORKS OUT WELL BUT I DON'T SEE IT HERE. ONE MORE FUNNY THING, WHERE IS THE NORM -- NOBEL PRIZE? IT'S IN NORTHERN EUROPE. THESE ARE PEOPLE BEING DISSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE MEETS WITH PUTIN ON FRIDAY. JOE: ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU. JEAN HARMON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. COMING UP, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENNETT GERMAN THIS AND DEFENDING THE PLAN TO EXPAND HIS MILITARY SWEEP IN GAZA. AND WE WILL TURN BACK TO OUR CONVERSATION ON THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS INTO D.C. WHEN WE ASSEMBLE OUR POLITICAL PANEL, COMING UP NEXT ON BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. \u266a JOE: THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. SOME OF THE STORIES WE ARE WATCHING AHEAD OF OUR POLITICAL PANEL IN TODAY'S POWER BRIEF. A COLOMBIAN SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL HAS DIED TWO MONTHS AFTER BEING SHOT WHILE CAMPAIGNING IN BOGOTA. HIS WIFE CONFIRMED HIS DEATH ON SOCIAL MEDIA EARLIER THIS MORNING. A SENATOR SINCE 2022 FOR THE CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATIC CENTER PARTY. HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD WHILE SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID IN JUNE. HE HAD BEEN IN CRITICAL CONDITION SINCE. POLICE DETAINED AT LEAST SIX PEOPLE INCLUDING A TEAM THAT WAS APPREHENDED AT THE SCENE. THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. HE WAS 39. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR. IS VISITING THE CDC FOLLOWING A DEADLY ATTACK ON THE ATLANTA-BASED AGENCY LAST WEEK. FRIDAY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER DIED AFTER THE SHOOTING NEAR THE MAIN CAMPUS OF THE CDC. THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER DIED AT THE SCENE. EARLIER THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTED TO ENTER HEADQUARTERS BUT THEN STOPPED BY A PHARMACY AND OPEN FIRE. HIS FATHER SAYS HIS SON HAD BECOME FIXATED WITH THE COVID-19 VACCINE. NETANYAHU IS PLANNING FOR MILITARY SLEEP AGAINST THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF HAMAS IN GAZA. NETANYAHU DEFENDING THE PLAN ON SUNDAY DESPITE VOCAL OPPOSITION AT HOME AND ABROAD. > > OUR GOAL IS NOT TO OCCUPY GAZA. OUR GOAL IS TO FREE GAZA FROM HAMAS TERRORISTS. THE WORK -- WAR CAN END TOMORROW IF GAZA -- RATHER HAMAS LEAVES DOWN ITS ARMS AND GIVES US THE REMAINING OFFICERS. -- HOSTAGES. JOE: AND THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING HE PLANS TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO THE CITY. > > I'M OFFICIALLY INVOKING 740 OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. AND PLACING THE D.C. METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT UNDER DIRECT FEDERAL CONTROL. IN ADDITION I'M DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD HELP REESTABLISH LAW, ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND WASHINGTON, D.C. > > WE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. OUR FAMILIES GO TO WAR. WE PAY TAXES AND WE UPHOLD THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZENSHIP. WHILE THIS ACTION TODAY IS UNSETTLING AND UNPRECEDENTED, I CAN'T SAY THAT GIVEN SOME OF THE RHETORIC OF THE PAST THAT WE ARE TOTALLY SURPRISED. JOE: JOINING US WITH THEIR TAKE ON THESE STORIES HERE, THIS EVENING'S POLITICAL PANEL, RICK DAVIS, PARTNER AT STONECOURT CAPITAL, A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, AND JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH IN STUDIO WITH US AGAIN TODAY. I'VE HEARD A COUPLE THINGS TODAY ABOUT THIS STORY, LARGELY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HIS AUTHORITY TO DO THIS, AND ALSO HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT THE WORLD FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN. ARE BOTH TRUE? > > I DON'T THINK WE KNOW. I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION I HAVE. WHY IS THE PRESIDENT DOING THIS NOW? IS IT TO DISTRACT FROM SOMETHING OR SET GROUNDWORK FOR SOMETHING TO COME? WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT HIS RHETORIC AND THIS DYSTOPIAN NARRATIVE HE'S CONCOCTED DOES NOT MATCH WITH EITHER THE NUMBERS OR MANY PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.'S LIVED EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN IN THE CITY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, YEAR, WHATEVER IT IS. YOU HAVE TO ASK WHY IS HE DOING THIS? I THINK THAT'S A BIG QUESTION WE STILL DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO. JOE: YOU HAVE LIVED AROUND HERE FOR MOST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU LOVE WASHINGTON AS MUCH AS WE ALL DO WHO LIVE HERE AND YOU'VE SEEN THE CITY GO THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES FOLLOWING TOUGH YEARS IN THE 1970'S AND 1980'S. THIS IS A DIFFERENT PLACE. THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF INVESTMENT, A MUCH MORE DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE TIMING? IN FACT CRIME IS AT A 30 YEAR LOW. > > I THINK THAT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL. I THINK SHE SUMMED IT UP RIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW THE MOTIVATION TO DO THIS. WHAT HE ARTICULATED TODAY WHICH WAS RAMPANT CRIME, HIGH MURDER RATES, THINGS LIKE THAT, DON'T FIT WITH THE HISTORY OF WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY. SO YOU HAVE TO ASSUME SOMETHING ELSE IS MOTIVATING HIM. HE DOES HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT. THE PRESIDENCY HAS CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THE CITY AND THE CITY HAS CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THE PRESIDENCY. AGAIN, IT IS THE USE OF EMERGENCY POWERS BASED ON A NARRATIVE OF CRIME THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY PAN OUT. BUT HE'S WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. HE'S WILLING TO SAY PROVE ME WRONG AND TAKE ME TO COURT BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I'VE GOT 15 FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT WILL FAN OUT ALL OVER THE CITY AND HE'S ALREADY DONE IT. AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THIS IS ALL PART OF A BROADER SCHEME. WE SEE HIM DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN L.A., THREATENING CHICAGO, BOSTON AND OTHER CITIES. I THINK THIS IS A BROADER CAMPAIGN TO BRANDISH HIS LAW AND ORDER CREDENTIALS. IT IS AN EASY THING FOR HIM TO DO AND HE GETS A BIG IMPACT OFF OF IT POLITICALLY. I DON'T THINK HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT PEOPLE, I THINK HE'S TRYING TO FOCUS THEM ON I'M FIGHTING CRIME IN THE CITIES RUN BY DEMOCRATS. JOE: FASCINATING. THE PICTURES HE PUT ON TRUTH SOCIAL WERE APPARENTLY TAKEN FROM HIS MOTORCADE ON THE WAY TO THE GOLF COURSE IN VIRGINIA AND HE SAW A NUMBER OF HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS, HE TOOK A PICTURE OF A GUTTER THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED. HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED NEW YORK AND CHICAGO IN THE CONFERENCE TODAY. YOU HAVE BOTH ALLUDED TO THIS. TO THOSE -- SHOULD THOSE CITIES GET READY FOR THE SAME? > > HE SAID IT COULD BE COMING AND THEN HE WENT ON TO SAY IT MAY BE THE PEOPLE THERE WILL CLEAN UP ON THEIR OWN BUT IF NOT, THIS COULD BE COMING. I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THE HOMELESS ISSUE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. WHERE DID THEY GO? THE YOUNG HOUSE, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS IN THIS COUNTRY UNFORTUNATELY WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, ADDICTION, OTHER REALLY REALLY HORRIFYING CONDITIONS THAT ARE ON HOUSTON AND HE SAYING WE ARE GOING TO MOVE YOU, TO WEAR? NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW. WE HAVE A HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY OF WHEN WE FEDERALIZE WITH TROOPS DOMESTICALLY, IT HAS NOT WORKED OUT WELL. THIS IS CONCERNING. I THINK ALSO FOR ANY TRUE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, IT HAS TO BE CONCERNING BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE PROFOUNDLY IN LIBERTY AND FREEDOM FROM BIG GOVERNMENT AND YET WE'VE GOT A PRESIDENT AS A REPUBLICAN PUTTING FEDERAL TROOPS ON THE STREETS. JOE: THERE IS A LIVE VIEW OF OUR STREETS RIGHT NOW, JUST A COUPLE DOORS DOWN FROM THE GUCCI STORE AND THE TIFFANY STORE. I POINT TO THAT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T SEEN, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU, I DID NOT SEE MASSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT, I DIDN'T RUN INTO ANY GROUPS THAT NEEDED TO BE ROUNDED UP OR ARRESTED. IS THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING? HE NEEDS TO MAKE GOOD WITH SHOCK AND AWE? > > I THINK THE OVAL AWFUL -- OVAL OFFICE THING TODAY WAS THE SHOCK AND AWE. LOOK AT L.A. HE SENDS IN NATIONAL GUARD AND THERE IS 48 HOURS OF CONTROVERSY . BY A WEEK LATER, THERE WAS NO NEWS COMING OUT OF L.A., NO RIOTS, AND THREE WEEKS AFTER THAT, THE NATIONAL GUARD WENT HOME. IT WASN'T EVEN A NEW STORY. JOE: IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS HERE? > > I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY A PATTERN. AS THE MAYOR ARTICULATED, IT SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE THE PRESIDENT IS USING THE POWERS OF HIS OFFICE TO PLAY THESE GAMES. JOE: FROM THE FILE OF SELF CONTRADICTIONS, THERE WAS ANOTHER CONVERSATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT MARIJUANA, THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT IT. HE DID CONFIRM HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS. > > WE ARE LOOKING AT IT. SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT. SOME PEOPLE HATE IT. SOME PEOPLE HATE THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF MARIJUANA BECAUSE IT DOES BAD FOR THE CHILDREN AND PEOPLE OLDER THAN CHILDREN. WE WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I'VE HEARD GREAT THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH THE MEDICAL BUT I'VE HEARD BAD THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. JOE: I DON'T KNOW -- WE DID HEAR A PROMISE ON THE CAMPAIGN HE WOULD CONSIDER THIS AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT. DOES THIS RUN AGAINST THE GRAIN OF WHAT HE'S DOING > > > > IN WASHINGTON? SUCH A GREAT POINT. THAT'S WHAT THE REPORTER ASKED HIM. YOU ARE TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT ARE UNPRECEDENTED TO CLEAN UP WASHINGTON OF CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE CONSIDERING D CLASSIFYING MARIJUANA. ISN'T THAT HYPOCRITICAL OF YOU? THAT'S WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID WE ARE CONSIDERING. I THINK THIS IS SOME OF THE PUSHBACK HE'S GOING TO GET IF INDEED THEY DID DECIDE TO GO THAT WAY AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WILL GO. JOE: HE APPARENTLY TOLD A NUMBER OF CANNABIS CEOS AT A FUNDRAISER RECENTLY THAT HE'S OPEN TO DOING THIS. > > I THINK YOU ALREADY ARTICULATED A KEY THING, AT A FUNDRAISER. [LAUGHTER] MAYBE THIS WILL GET A A 90 DAY DELAY. IT COULD BE A TACO TRADE. [LAUGHTER] JOE: IT MOVES STOCKS. ARE THESE INVESTORS GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED? > > YES, EXCEPT HE MIGHT JUST GO AHEAD AND DO IT AND HE WILL HAVE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON AND NOBODY WILL NOTICE THAT HE DID IT. JOE: I KNOW HE WANTS TO MAKE GOOD ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE BUT IS THIS THE TRUMP BRAND? > > I THINK THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY AND THAT'S WHAT HE IS STRUGGLING WITH THE INTERNALLY. JOE: HE DOESN'T DRINK, HE DOESN'T SMOKE. > > HE > > DOESN'T DRINK OR SMOKE AND WANTS TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS LAW AND ORDER AND YET YOU ARE D CLASSIFYING A DRUG. JOE: HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR PEOPLE OLDER THAN CHILDREN, BY THE WAY. [LAUGHTER] I THINK THAT WOULD BE US. BY THE END OF THE WEEK, WE WILL TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IN ALASKA WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. WILL THAT BE THE END OF THIS WHOLE STORY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON? > > I DO THINK TURNING THIS TO FRIDAY, THIS IS GEOPOLITICAL IMPACT AROUND THE WORLD, DIFFERENT FROM FBI AGENTS WALKING THE STREETS OF D.C. WHICH SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYBODY. THIS ONE IS FULL OF POTENTIAL SURPRISES. WHAT IS THE DEAL VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL SAY YES TO? THAT'S CLEARLY WERE DONALD TRUMP IS HEADED. I DON'T THINK IT IS IN DONALD TRUMP'S MIND TO COME OUT OF ALASKA WITHOUT A DEAL ON THE TABLE. BUT WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SETTLE FOR WITHOUT THE UKRAINIANS INVOLVED IS ANYBODY'S GUESS. JOE: WE WILL FIND OUT TOGETHER ON FRIDAY. RICK DAVIS AND JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO, WE WILL MEET WITH YOU ON FRIDAY TO TALK ABOUT IT. CHECK OUT THE WASHINGTON, D.C. NEWSLETTER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON BALANCE OF POWER. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.",

  "summary": "President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, taking control of local police following a 30-year low in crime rates in the city. The move comes as part of a historic effort to protect the capital from crime, including crime, terrorism, and other crime. The National Guard is being transferred to Washington and takes over local policing. This comes as President Trump extends the TARIFF TRUCE with BEIJING with an extension of 90 days' extension. Meanwhile, a deal between NVIDIA CEO Jensen HUANG and AMD allows the US. The companies will pay the US government 15% of the REVENUE from AI CHIP SALES to China, giving the government 15%, giving it an additional 15%. The deal is expected to be finalised soon, with further developments expected. The S&P 500 is down 2/10% for the S & P 500.",

This move allows him to take control of local police under the Home Rule Act, which has raised concerns among local officials and experts about the legality and necessity of such actions. Additionally, Trump has negotiated deals with NVIDIA and AMD to receive a percentage of their AI chip sales to China, amidst ongoing trade tensions and a 90-day extension of a tariff truce with Beijing.",
