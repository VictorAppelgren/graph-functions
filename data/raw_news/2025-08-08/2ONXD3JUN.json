  "description": "Proposed federal legislation would require companies to clearly label grocery-store produce treated with shelf-life coatings, giving Americans clarity about what they're purchasing and eating.",
  "content": "Transparency is the focus of new proposed legislation when it comes to the coatings that are added to produce before the grocery-store items are sold to Americans.\n\nFocusing on fruits and vegetables treated with a shelf-life-extending coating, Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., introduced HR 4737, known as the Apeel Reveal Act, in the House.\n\nThe bill targets product coatings from companies to provide labeling that discloses the use of the coating.\n\nAMERICA'S DAIRY FARMERS AND ICE CREAM PRODUCERS AGREE TO QUIT USING ARTIFICIAL COLORS\n\n\"We should know what we're eating \u2013 transparency is essential for making healthy choices,\" Stutzman wrote on X.\n\n\"My Apeel Reveal Act gives Americans the clarity they deserve when deciding what to feed themselves and their kids.\"\n\nApeel Sciences, an industry leader in the space, said it agrees with Stutzman that \"every consumer deserves to know where they can find safer, higher-quality, fresher produce in their grocery stores.\"\n\n\"Our plant-based, edible coatings help keep produce naturally fresh for longer, reduce food waste and lower grocery costs for American families,\" Apeel said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Our products are among the safest and most rigorously tested on the market.\"\n\nApeel said its ingredients are \"plant-based simple fats called mono- and diglycerides, baking soda and citric acid\" and \"common, naturally occurring food ingredients found in the edible peels, pulp and seeds of fruits and vegetables that also have a long history of safe use.\"\n\nApeel reiterated that its products have an Apeel logo or sticker.\n\nThey \"remain the only post-harvest food coating brand most consumers can name,\" the California-based company said.\n\nAll coating materials must be composed of substances \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" (GRAS).\n\nThey must be produced under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practices for food ingredients and packaging.\n\nThe company says on its site, \"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms mono- and diglycerides as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).

Such term includes Apeel Sciences product coatings, including Edipeel and Organipeel.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nApeel's coatings, according to the company and others, have \"demonstrably reduced waste \u2014 saving 166 million pieces of produce, conserving 1.8 billion gallons of water, and preventing over 64 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.\"",

  "summary": "New proposed legislation aims to increase transparency about the coatings added to produce before they are sold to Americans. The Apeel Reveal Act, introduced by Rep. Marlin Stutzman, aims to require product coatings from companies to provide labeling that clearly clarifies the use of the coating. The bill focuses on fruits and vegetables treated with a shelf-life-extending coating, specifically those treated with this coating. Apeal Sciences, an industry leader in this field, supports the bill, arguing that its plant-based, edible coatings help keep produce fresh for longer, reduce food waste and lower grocery costs. All coating materials must be composed of substances \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" (GRAS). They must be produced under the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices for food ingredients and packaging.",

      "text": "As the health of Americans continues to decline, researchers at the University of Florida are urging a national rethink about fruits and vegetables.\nTheir message is that it's time to treat produce not just as food but as medicine.\nIn a recent article published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers endorse the \"food is medicine\" movement, arguing fruits and vegetables play a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases and improving public health.\nTROPICAL FRUIT COULD BE THE ANSWER TO BETTER HEART HEALTH, RESEARCHERS SUGGEST\nYet only one in 10 adults in the U.S. consumes the recommended daily servings \u2013 a shortfall researchers claim is fueling the crisis.\nThe article warns that current U.S. agricultural output is insufficient to support a healthy population.\nTo address this gap, the authors advocate for a substantial increase in fruit and vegetable production, with a focus on nutrient-dense produce such as berries, leafy greens and carrots.\nDanielle Treadwell, an associate professor of horticultural sciences at the University of Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about her involvement in the study.\nEATING THESE COMMON FOODS BEFORE BED COULD TRIGGER SWEET DREAMS OR NIGHT TERRORS\n\"In the U.S., we have a healthcare crisis, due in large part to dietary choices,\" she said.\nTreadwell defined horticulture as \"the art and science of fruit production and vegetable production\" \u2014 integral to expanding the quantity and quality of produce in the U.S.\n\"Where are all those fruits and vegetables going to come from?\" Treadwell said. \"Because currently, the United States is only able to produce 50% of what we anticipate we would need if every adult in the U.S. were to follow the dietary advice of eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\"\nShe added, \"That is not enough.\"\nTreadwell cited common barriers to eating more produce, including the time required to prepare them and limited access \u2014 especially in underserved areas.\n\"Here in Florida, we grow fruits and vegetables nine months out of the year [and] many of us have citrus trees in our yard,\" the horticulturist said. \"However, that's not true in other parts of the country.\"\nCAN DRINKING SODA HELP MIGRAINES? DOCTORS REVEAL WHETHER BUBBLY DRINKS CURE HEADACHES OR NOT\nTreadwell also observed that many Americans work \"very long hours, sometimes multiple jobs.\"\nShe added, \"All of these things can come together and really [have] an impact on how many servings a day [of produce that] the average adult can take in.\"\n\"Frozen vegetables, by and large, retain 100% of their nutritional content that they had when they left the field.\"\nTreadwell's main advice is to choose what you eat wisely and to start out small.\n\"Remember that a serving is half a cup \u2026 so maybe, eat a whole cup at a time,\" she suggested. \"It certainly doesn't necessarily have to be fresh. Frozen vegetables, by and large, retain 100% of their nutritional content that they had when they left the field.\"\nSo if food can be medicine, which specific fruits and vegetables target certain ailments?\nDr. William W. Li, author of the book \"Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself,\" shared some examples with Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nHe cited pears and strawberries as two fruits that can target specific medical conditions.\n\"Pears contain polyphenols like quercetin and chlorogenic acid that can reduce blood pressure, shrink body fat, improve energy balance and reverse metabolic syndrome,\" Li said.\nStrawberries, on the other hand, contain \"polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins that can decrease insulin resistance in obese persons to improve metabolism.\"\nPears and strawberries are two fruits that can target specific medical conditions.\nFor those with a high amount of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol and stubborn abdominal fat, the doctor suggested the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in avocados.\nBlueberries can also help \"reduce body weight, increase insulin sensitivity, shrink visceral fat and improve metabolism,\" Li said.\nYaa Boakye, a dietitian based in Illinois, echoed the notion of the healing powers of fruits and vegetables.\n\"Physiological shifts happen when fruits and vegetables become a daily, consistent part of your life,\" Boakye told Fox News Digital. \"Not once a week. Not a once-a-month juice cleanse, but consistency.\"\n\"Fruits and vegetables must be a non-negotiable part of our daily diet.\"\nShe also said that diet is one of many factors in a person's health and encouraged Americans to be well-balanced in their approaches to health.\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\"Stress, sleep, trauma, environment, medications, access \u2014 they all matter, too,\" Boakye said. \"If nutrition is your shield, then movement, sleep and emotional regulation are your armor, reinforcements and escape routes.\"\nBoakye said Americans should make eating produce a habit.\n\"We are what we repeatedly do,\" Boakye said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Eating fruits and vegetables can't be an afterthought or a luxury. They must be a non-negotiable part of our daily diet.\""
