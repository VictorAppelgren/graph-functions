  "title": "With censorship swirling, devs of polarizing anime RPG Blue Archive say Steam delay \"was unrelated to the game's content\" and there were \"no modifications or censorship of the content specifically for Steam approval\"",
  "description": "Blue Archive made the jump to Steam unscathed",
  "content": "With PC gaming payment processors, now including PayPal as well as the likes of Mastercard, grilling Steam and Itch.io as they recoil from a recent uptick in pearl clutching, it felt almost ironic to see divisive anime RPG Blue Archive, which came to Steam last month, cruise by without issue. Its Steam launch was delayed due to platform review snags, but developer Nexon Games says the game wasn't censored in order to get it on Valve's store, and it seems to have been unaffected by the ongoing censor storm.\n\nStudio producer Gyeong Seop An discussed the delayed Steam release in a written interview with GamesRadar+.\n\n\"First of all, I would like to apologize to all the players for the delay beyond the originally promised launch date. While we cannot go into detail about the issues encountered during the review process, the need to provide the same level of service as the existing mobile version caused some delays. That said, we maintained continuous communication with Steam and worked hard to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. Thanks to their support, we were able to launch on July 4th.\"\n\nExecutive producer Yongha Kim put a finer point on it: \"To clarify further, the delay in the Steam launch was unrelated to the game's content. There were no modifications or censorship of the content specifically for Steam approval.\"\n\nA joint response from the two adds: \"We communicated extensively with the platform to identify issues and resolve them as quickly as possible. We would also like to express our gratitude to Steam for their continuous support and assistance throughout the process.\"\n\nBlue Archive has been around for years as one of the bigger games in the gacha space, and it's cultivated a reputation not just for loud-and-proud sexy characters, but also for having a lot of characters who are, or at least look like, young girls. The cast is not exclusively this type of character, but there are a lot of them. Players assume a \"Sensei\" role in a world filled with sci-fi schools, and the game leans fairly hard into building student relationships.\n\nIts Steam page notes \"This game contains some suggestive images and dialogue that may not be suitable for all ages and access may be restricted for users in certain age groups,\" and it's rated Mature on mobile.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of cute little chibi characters blasting through waves of enemies and bosses in tactical action levels. It has its naysayers, but Blue Archive's strong user reviews shows it also has its devotees. It's already got 13,762 reviews on Steam averaging 92% positive. One of the top recent reviews champions advice I've come to embrace for other games: \"Good game though just ignore the fans.\"\n\nI asked about the colorful rhetoric that had infested the game's Steam forums before it was even released, and the criticism that Blue Archive's character designs have seen over the years. Kim and Seop An jointly responded.\n\n\"At its heart, we see Blue Archive as a bright and uplifting game. We know players may interpret its themes in different ways, but our goal has always been to create an experience that celebrates positivity and warmth, resonating with those who appreciate the game\u2019s positive and wholesome qualities.\"\n\nWith more and more gacha games jumping from mobile to PC, and often encountering new audiences less forgiving of the baggage and monetization associated with the genre, I also asked about criticism of Blue Archive's gacha system and drop rates, and potential changes there.\n\nAgain, the two devs responded jointly: \"We understand this isn\u2019t just about adjusting probabilities slightly, it\u2019s a deeper concern about fairness in the gacha system from the community.\n\n\"Creating a system that truly reflects players\u2019 expectations, especially given their time and investment, is a complex challenge. As both developers and fellow gamers, we\u2019re always exploring ways to improve the experience. This includes features like guaranteed rewards or better predictability to make the system more player-friendly.\"\n\nElsewhere, in another Steam gacha boom: Move over, Skyrim grandma, because Japan's \"legendary horse grandpa\" with \"40 years of horse racing experience\" got a whole new fandom thanks to Umamusume: \"This game is at a high level\"",

      "text": "Stellar Blade dev's game reveal sparks AI art accusations, sounds like its own take on Genshin Impact, and surprises nobody with art so horny I can't show you the whole thing here\nProject Witches is now Project Spirits, and looks about as you'd expect\nStellar Blade and Goddess of Victory: Nikke developer Shift Up has released the first snippet of art for its upcoming game Project Witches, newly renamed to Project Spirits, and it's as over-the-top horny as you'd expect.\nI had to crop the bejesus out of it to make a SFW listing image for this article, so here's the full piece, as spotted by Genki:\nShift Up have renamed \"Project Witches\" to \"Project Spirits\" and provided a first look at the characters!- New flagship cross-platform title with an \u201cEastern Fantasy\u201d theme.- Top-quality new IP after Steller Blade and NIKKEhttps://t.co/VJnuZLXyLd pic.twitter.com/2FuG4wh8DYJune 2, 2025\nI don't expect anyone is shocked by this style, nor do I think Shift Up's biggest fans are upset about it. Speaking as someone who disliked how ridiculous some unlockable outfits looked on Stellar Blade's female lead Eve, I actually prefer the Nikke approach of making the entire game loudly and proudly sexualized so everything's at least coherent. (I do, after all, play Zenless Zone Zero.)\nMore surprising, especially given Shift Up's pedigree for character designs, is an accompanying row over alleged generative AI use in the reveal art for Spirits, which features two women framed by dramatic temples demonstrating the \"Eastern Fantasy\" theme discussed in (machine translated) job applications attached to the project.\nReacting to the reveal on Reddit, some Nikke fans pounced on the bizarre thumb on the left woman's left hand. Snippets of the background are more curious still, with the wood frames of several temples showing the sort of bizarre artifacting, inconsistent smoothness, and illogical nesting of details typical of generative AI.\nIt's difficult to say definitively that this art was made with or assisted by AI, but Shift Up has notably been accused of using generative AI in previous promotional art. Studio boss Hyung Tae Kim has also repeatedly shared AI, or at least AI-assisted, illustrations on his personal Twitter, and seems to be an advocate for the technology.\nAI aside, the style for Project Spirits has been widely likened to Shift Up's first game, Destiny Child, which launched in 2016 and shut down a few years ago. This, coupled with Nikke, may also provide a rough idea of what to expect from Spirits.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nJob listings for Project Spirits suggest it will be closer to Nikke than Stellar Blade, at least in terms of format and monetization. Machine translated details from combat, art, and narrative listings indicate it will feature multiple playable characters, open-world areas as well as towns and dungeons, and a focus on action gameplay. An abundance of playable characters would be straight from the gacha action RPG handbook, and not at all unfamiliar to the house of Nikke.\nThere's also mention of cross-platform support, and though we don't know those platforms, it's increasingly common for modern gacha action RPGs to launch on both mobile and console or PC. To really hammer it home, multiple listings also specify applicants familiar with games like Genshin Impact and Zenless Zone Zero.\nThis is still just speculation, but it's mighty informed speculation. Stellar Blade is a good, sort-of open-world action RPG, and Nikke remains a powerhouse in the gacha space, so in a post-Genshin world filled with games like Wuthering Waves and Silver Palace, it seemed inevitable that Shift Up would try its hand at a similar formula. It certainly has the experience and appetite for these kinds of games.\nProject Spirits, whatever shape it takes, may end up being exactly that. If you were holding out hope for another no-nonsense single-player game in the style of Stellar Blade, well, you can still hold out until we get more official details, and there's always Stellar Blade 2.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Steam dropping PayPal support for all but 6 currencies is \"related\" to pressure from banks and card companies to remove NSFW games, Valve confirms as censorship controversy continues\n\"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain\"\nUpdate: Valve has confirmed that Steam's sudden refusal to accept PayPal in many currencies is related to the payment processor-led crackdown on NSFW games.\nThe removal of PayPal support for all but six currencies is \"regarding content on Steam, related to what we\u2019ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard,\" Valve tells Rock, Paper, Shotgun. Earlier this month, Mastercard claimed to have no direct involvement in Steam's adult game crackdown. Valve disputed that claim, arguing that Mastercard's pressure on payment processors led to their push against certain kinds of adult content on Steam.\nAs for the sudden limitation on most PayPal currencies, the Valve spokesperson adds that, \"in this case, one of PayPal\u2019s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies.\"\nOriginal story: Steam users recently discovered that PayPal was unavailable as a payment option for some, and Valve has finally explained why that is.\nSteam users have a few different ways to pay for their games, be it your typical credit and debit card providers or the likes of PaySafeCard. The more options there are the better, and given some payment processors have led to a ton of games being removed from Steam and de-indexed from Itch.io, naturally some users are keen to use different payment methods on the platform. But around a month ago, some players noticed that PayPal was no longer available for an unknown reason, with some assuming this was somehow related to the NSFW crackdown.\nSteam PayPal unavailable update from r/Steam\nHowever, Redditor jeeg123 made a post (which was spotted by PC Gamer) after noticing that Steam had added an explanation to the message. It reads, \"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\"\nThe message adds, \"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nSo the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, US, and countries in Europe that use the Euro (which excludes the likes of Poland, Bulgaria, and Sweden) are all still fine to use PayPal for their purchases on Steam. However, PayPal hasn't explained why or how it came to this decision, or if it is in fact related to the ongoing delisting of NSFW games.\nScott has been freelancing for over three years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024.

      "text": "Move over, Skyrim grandma, because Japan's \"legendary horse grandpa\" with \"40 years of horse racing experience\" got a whole new fandom thanks to Umamusume: \"This game is at a high level\"\n\"I think people who aren't interested in horse racing might not understand it\"\nDepending on how you count birthdays, video games as a medium are probably younger than your grandparents, and people like Shirly \"Skyrim Grandma\" Curry have proven just how much gamers love seeing folks from older generations enjoying their favorite hobby. The same appeal applies to Japanese YouTuber Matchan, a veteran of horse racing who's gaining global fame thanks to his videos on Umamusume: Pretty Derby.\nMatchan's YouTube channel is largely a pretty unassuming vlog with most videos sitting at a few hundred views. But there's one big exception: a video with 4.5 million views titled \"[umamusume] Can an old man with 40 years of horse racing experience guess the horses' names?\" Presented with a series of printed images of the Umamusume cast, Matchan tries to guess their real-life race horse counterparts.\nHe doesn't get every one right, but makes enough successful connections \u2013 spurred on by some vague hints by the video's off-screen host \u2013 to make clear that the guessing game is winnable. His knowledge of real-life horse racing is impressive enough to me, somebody who once had to Google whether \"Seabiscuit\" was a real horse, and it's endearing seeing him lean into the anime world with such enthusiasm.\n\"This game is at a high level,\" Matchan remarks after learning of its depictions of Gold Ship and Rice Shower, according to the video's subtitles. \"I think people who aren't interested in horse racing might not understand it.\"\nThat video was uploaded back in 2021, a few months after the Umamusume game launched in Japan. But the game's more recent global launch, as noted by Automaton West, has brought Matchan's guessing game to a worldwide audience.\n\"Hello, everybody, how do you do? My name is Matchan,\" he says in a new video in admirable English. Switching back to Japanese, he explains that \"when I looked at the comments section, there were quite a lot of comments from foreigners, so I thought that it would be bad if I couldn't at least speak broken English to respond to them.\"\nThrough the remainder of this new video, Matchan again matches race horses with horse girls, because the pace of new characters in a gacha game simply does not slow down. And hey, if you've got a winning gimmick, why give it up?\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "One of the best-rated action RPGs on Steam faced the wrath of furries over a body slider nerf, but the dev says it was a misunderstanding: \"I won't write a manifesto\"\nAtlyss dodges a bullet which wasn't really there to begin with\nWhen you think of the top-rated action RPGs on Steam \u2013 Elden Ring, Monster Hunter World, Path of Exile, God of War, and so on \u2013 you may not think of Atlyss, a single player RPG (with available multiplayer) that entered early access in November 2024. But since launch, the furry-coded game has amassed over 14,000 97% positive Steam reviews, putting it comfortably in the upper echelon of Steam's genre rankings. That rating was very briefly dinged last month following an amusing controversy over perceived nerfs to the game's famously curvy character models, which has ultimately come to nothing \u2013 or, really, better character models.\nThis being an intersection of things I find journalistically irresistible \u2013 paradoxically huge niches and absurd non-troversies \u2013 I obviously had to find out what happened. This all started in late May when Atlyss creator Kiseff rolled out a test change to the game's beta branch. As an admin in the Atlyss Discord server recounted, this was \"an experimental procedure\" introducing a \"slight reduction of the max sliders\" on some character creation settings, most notably capping some body width sliders.\nIn other words, you suddenly couldn't make your characters quite as round or endowed. As a reminder, Atlyss is not an \"adult\" game. Its Steam content warning reads: \"The game contains sexualized clothing and character designs (however, nothing explicit), blood and cartoon violence. Dialog may contain occasional swearing and mild sexual innuendo. In-game chat is included in online play, which can provide varied experiences.\"\nNevertheless, in a demonstration of some of the appeal here, one of the top-rated Atlyss Steam user reviews reads: \"My player model is cute and my ass is fat. You should be playing right now.\"\nThere are, in fairness, a lot of other reviews saying the gameplay is genuinely great even if you're not into furry characters, and frankly, you don't get Steam traction like this without reason. Steam user Bucky Seifert, a real scholar of our time, said it best, I think: \"You'll come for the thicc furry shortstacks but stay for the combat and cracked movement.\"\nBut as you can probably imagine, for a certain crowd this slider change was an anvil suddenly heaped upon the (previously unburdened) camel's back. Some of the reviews from this time of slider unrest reckon \"character creation was significantly and intently hamstrung by a recent update.\"\nAnother player argues \"the dev has made the really unfortunate decision to strip away the thing so many of us had bought the game for: The ability to make your characters the kinds of body shapes you can't in any other game.\" And you know what? I can kind of understand that disappointment.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBased on social media posts collected in the Atlyss subreddit, the whole thing was blown out of proportion in some circles, which, I know, you really wouldn't expect from the internet. (And for goodness' sake, if you're going to browse the Atlyss subreddit, do so cautiously). Unrest ensued, \"resulting in a large influx of back-and-forth of the Atlyss community, positive and negative review dynamite sticks alike,\" as that Discord post rather democratically put it.\nKiseff released a statement \"regarding all this\" pretty quickly, assuring players that \"I am still working on the models. They are not final. That's it. I won't write a manifesto about that. I will fix this.\"\nThe whole thing was a communication issue, they said, not a design decision. \"I made bad choices in the midst of all this and I did share a private build for a moment on my support discord to sort some things out,\" Kiseff added. \"I removed all the test branches for the time being.\"\nFast forward to this month, Atlyss' latest update, between new skills and environments and subclass developments, has not only preserved the character models some players had fallen in love with, it's added a new environment to the character creation screen and \"all of the player models have been refined to look more rounder / softer and less jagged.\" I do love a happy ending.\n\"I will stay by my word and be committed to continue providing communication and transparency at the best of my ability here each month,\" Kiseff says in the latest update. \"Again, I do apologize for taking as long as I am. There is a silver lining to all of this and I'm certain things will turn in a good direction soon.\"\nHere are our picks for the 25 best RPGs you can play right now.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Echoing Nier's Yoko Taro, Peak devs blast \"puritan\" group behind recent Steam and Itch game takedowns: \"It'd be foolish to assume that any game is safe\"\n\"It threatens video games' ability to operate as art in any way whatsoever\"\nJoining a chorus of enraged voices, Peak and Another Crab's Treasure developer Aggro Crab says \"puritan\" groups like Collective Shout \u2013 the Australian org behind the recent wave of Steam and Itch.io game takedowns and de-indexing \u2013 or payment processors cannot be allowed to influence what games are sold or how.\n\"Steam and Itch are being threatened by an anti-NSFW group in order to force them to remove any content they deem distasteful by petitioning Visa and MasterCard, who are threatening these gaming platforms to cut payment access if they do not remove the games,\" the studio says in a Twitter thread.\nAfter sending an open letter and many requests to payment processors, Collective Shout has publicly taken credit for the game takedowns, though it has denied \"false claims and misinformation\" and insisted it only \"raised our objection\" to \"rape and incest games\" or \"content that involved sexualized violence and torture of women.\" Beyond one controversial game called No Mercy, it did not clarify these objections, nor did it elaborate on what these alleged false claims are.\nThe fact is, the group's campaign demonstrably cast a wide and poorly defined net over anything that could possibly be seen as inappropriate, sexual or not, and its actions directly led to a scorched earth response from Steam and Itch.io under threat of losing critical payment avenues for all games. Steam and Itch have taken some of the fury, and their responses deserve scrutiny, but it's the invisible hand of Mastercard et al. at fault here.\nJust to put these standards into perspective, Collective Shout previously tried to get GTA 5 banned in Australia by, as Rock Paper Shotgun reported, misleadingly describing it as a game \"that encourages players to brutally murder women for entertainment.\" This mischaracterization suggests that any game depicting or allowing any violence against women would be fair game for this kind of moral attack.\nGames that explore mature themes in non-sexualized ways \u2013 not that the sexualized ways are a problem to begin with \u2013 have also been caught up in this mess, further stoking fears that this sort of attack on content will be (and has been) used to bury any art supporting sexual expression, LGBT relationships, gender inequality, or other ideas that may be dubbed inappropriate by outspoken organizations.\nThe response from affected game devs, artists, or players \u2013 or simply from people concerned about the ability of a random Australian non-profit, or payment processors like credit card companies, to play moral police on a global stage \u2013 has skewered the very notion as well as the collateral damage predictably dealt to games far outside this group's purported \"objections\".\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAggro Crab continues: \"By focusing on the most inflammatory games available, Collective Shout is trying to gain support for a broad ban of content. Friends of ours have had their livelihoods jeopardized overnight after having their games removed due to mature content, sexual or otherwise.\"\n\"If puritan groups are able to dictate what people worldwide are allowed to spend their money on, it threatens video games' ability to operate as art in any way whatsoever, and it'd be foolish to assume that any game is safe,\" Aggro Crab adds.\nAggro Crab points to a resource page titled \"Protect Queer Creators and Sex Workers - Tell Payment Processors to STOP,\" assembled by Unbeatable developer D-Cell Games, which collects contact info for payment processors like Mastercard, Visa, Paypal, and Stripe, as well as other related resources.\nNier mastermind Yoko Taro also spoke out against the censoring power of credit companies, now being wielded as moral bludgeons, saying that a processor's power to \"do such things at its own discretion seems to me to be dangerous on a whole new level.\"\nBeyond immediate implications for games and art, Yoko Taro warned, \"It implies that by controlling payment processing companies, you can even censor another country\u2019s free speech.\" He added: \"I feel like it\u2019s not just a matter of censoring adult content or jeopardizing freedom of expression, but rather a security hole that endangers democracy itself.\"\nAggro Crab agrees that \"the best thing you can do is to call these companies directly and tell anyone who answers how you feel. The more resources they spend listening and the clearer it is that public opinion is against them, the faster this decision can be reversed.\"\nThere have already been reports (per Polygon) of representatives at companies like Visa buckling under torrential call volume, so the campaign already seems to be having an impact.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.
