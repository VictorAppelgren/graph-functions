  "content": "CBMJ shares have increased by 131.58% over the past month, including a 37.5% gain in the last week alone, and a 2.33% rise in the most recent trading session. As traditional media companies face declining revenues and brand erosion\n\nATLANTA, GEORGIA / ACCESS Newswire / August 7, 2025 / Patriot.TV, a division of Conservative Broadcast Media & Journalism Inc. (OTCID:CBMJ), today reported record-setting viewership alongside a significant increase in shareholder value. In July, Patriot.TV reached a new high with 1.6 million live viewers via its Rumble channel, its strongest monthly performance to date, underscoring the platform's continued growth and resonance with audiences seeking traditional American values, faith-based programming, and fact-driven journalism.\n\nThis surge in engagement aligns with broader trends favoring conservative-oriented networks. Patriot.TV, alongside Fox Corporation's Fox News (FOX), Newsmax (NMAX), and Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI), have seen rising viewer loyalty. In contrast, major networks under Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount Global (PARA), and The Walt Disney Company (DIS) have experienced marked declines in ratings and advertising revenues.\n\nPatriot.TV's expansion reflects shifting consumer behavior toward platforms perceived as more transparent and mission aligned.\n\n\"This exceptional growth highlights the relevance of our content and the continued trust of our audience,\" said Mark Schaftlein, CEO of CBMJ. \"We remain committed to delivering programming that reflects traditional American values while meeting the evolving needs of our viewers.\"\n\nStrategic leadership under President and COO JD Rucker, appointed in June 2025, has contributed significantly to this upward trajectory. Under Rucker's guidance, Patriot.TV added prominent conservative hosts Wayne Dupree and Drew Berquist, both with strong followings and national recognition. The addition of their respective programs, \"The Wayne Dupree Show\" and \"This Is My Show with Drew Berquist\", has accelerated audience growth and diversified the platform's programming slate.\n\nFurthermore, the company secured a key advertising partnership with Evergreen Media Partners, granting advertisers direct access to Patriot.TV's highly engaged audience. This relationship enables new monetization opportunities and supports Patriot.TV's continued expansion.\n\nThis growth also mirrors strong investor sentiment. CBMJ shares have increased by 131.58% over the past month, including a 37.5% gain in the last week alone, and a 2.33% rise in the most recent trading session.",
