  "description": "Legendary New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has finally found a buyer for his sprawling beachfront Massachusetts $3.9 million cottage \u2014 five days after listing the charming dwelling.\u2026",
  "content": "Legendary New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has finally found a buyer for his sprawling beachfront Massachusetts $3.9 million cottage \u2014 five days after listing the charming dwelling.\n\nThe 73-year-old football legend \u2014 who has stirred up controversy due to his relationship with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson \u2014 snapped up the stunning three-bedroom, two-bathroom abode in 2014 for $2.45 million.\n\nJust a few days ago, Belichick decided to offload his Nantucket dwelling in preparation for his new role as the head football coach of the University of North Carolina after 24 seasons with the Patriots, during which the team garnered six Super Bowl wins.\n\nNow, Realtor.com\u00ae can exclusively reveal that the football mogul has found a buyer, with the home officially being in the contingency phase, which means that Belichick has accepted an offer; however, the sale is contingent on certain conditions.\n\nIt is unclear how much the buyer offered Belichick, but the home was listed for $3.895 million.\n\nAccording to the listing, which was held by Coldwell Banker, the property features a \u201cvaulted living room with stone fireplace and views of the beach and conservation land. The cottage exudes old world charm with wooden walls, built-in bookshelves, a window with diamond mullions, and many nooks and crannies while still offering modern amenities for today\u2019s living.\u201d\n\nBelichick \u2014 who boasts a net worth of $70 million \u2014 holds the keys to several properties in Massachusetts and is even building a new home just down the street from the abode he put on the market.\n\nIn 2006, Belichick reportedly snapped up his first Massachusetts home for a relatively modest $1.4 million.\n\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home sprawls across 4,400 square feet and boasts a two-car garage.\n\nAccording to the original listing, the property overlooks a third hole on a golf course and features two pools, a tennis court, a clubhouse, and a recreation center.\n\nInside, there is a media room, wine cellar, and wet bar.\n\nAlthough he purchased the charming abode for $1.4 million, Realtor.com\u00ae now estimates Belichick\u2019s property is worth $2.1 million.\n\nIn 2024, he forked over $4.8 million for a 2,854-square-foot Nantucket home.\n\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom property was built in 1983 and boasts an expansive living area, a sophisticated dining space, and an office space.\n\nOn the second floor, there is an en suite primary bedroom and two guest rooms with a shared bath.\n\nThe property was renovated in 2017 and features a basement with an additional bathroom and tub.\n\nBelichick previously gushed about Nantucket while speaking to N Magazine in 2017, telling the outlet: \u201cThe island is spectacular. The people are great, fishing, bike paths, the lighthouses, the beach, the history \u2014 I mean it\u2019s got it all.\u201d\n\nThe legendary coach once held the keys to another Nantucket property, which he purchased for $4.6 million in 2006; however, property records indicate that the home went to his ex-wife, Debby Clarke, after they divorced that same year.\n\nAccording to the documents, the former couple purchased the home together; however, it is now solely registered in her name.\n\nThe property boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms, and several cozy fireplaces.\n\nWhen he isn\u2019t enjoying one of his many homes in Massachusetts, the NFL coach is laying low in his stunning Florida condo, which he purchased in 2009.\n\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom home sprawls across 4,085 square feet and boasts 20-foot ceilings and sweeping views of the deep sea.\n\nAlthough he snapped up the property for $1.6 million, Realtor.com\u00ae now estimates it is worth $3.7 million.\n\nThe property is located right off of a golf course and boasts a wine cellar and an encircled patio.\n\nSince bidding farewell to his long career with the Patriots in January, Belichick has been at the center of headlines due to his controversial romance with Hudson, a former cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant.\n\nThe couple, who began dating in 2023, have been thrown into the hot seat time and time again since going public with their age-gap relationship.\n\nThey previously had their romance thrown into the spotlight during the NFL Honors, when they were mercilessly roasted by rapper Snoop Dogg over their 48-year age gap.\n\nTelling the crowd that he\u2019s been \u201ca football fan for a long time,\u201d Snoop, 53, said that many things have changed since he first started watching games \u201cback when the Cowboys was good\u201d and \u201cwhen the Chiefs was bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I remember, what was it \u2014 Bill Belichick\u2019s girlfriend wasn\u2019t even born yet?\u201d he joked, leaving Hudson open-mouthed in surprise, while her partner simply chuckled along with the rest of the audience.\n\nThe longtime coach\u2019s dating life wasn\u2019t even spared by two of his most successful players, Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, both of whom savaged him over it during Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Roast of Tom Brady.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoach, you used to talk about Foxborough High School when we sucked,\u201d Gronkowski said during the livestreamed special on May 5, 2024. \u201cBut now I know why you were so obsessed with Foxborough High School: You were scouting your new girlfriend.\u201d\n\nBrady then followed that up by mocking Belichick over Ring camera footage that caught him sneaking out of Hudson\u2019s home shirtless, saying: \u201cEverybody asks me which ring is my favorite, I used to say \u2018the next one.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl\u2019s house a few months ago. Hey, you still got it. Respect, baby.\u201d\n\nThe home in question was located in Massachusetts home where former cheerleader Hudson was living at the time \u2014 having attended Bridgewater State University.\n\nIn addition to boasting an impressive career as a cheerleader, Hudson also holds an $8 million property portfolio, forging the path for her to become a real estate mogul.\n\nShe began snapping up a host of multifamily homes in the greater Boston area in December 2023, property records reveal, just a few months after she was first seen spending time with Belichick, 73, although they are reported to have met around 18 months earlier.\n\nAccording to mortgage documents seen by Realtor.com\u00ae, Hudson purchased three multi-family dwellings at the end of 2023, all of which were purchased through separate LLCs, but with the former cheerleader\u2019s name listed as the \u201cborrower\u201d for each.\n\nAs first reported by DailyMail.com, Hudson took out a $1.2 million mortgage on the first dwelling \u2014 a $2.2 million Dorchester townhouse that has been converted into three separate apartments \u2014 on Dec. 1, 2023, with a listing on Realtor.com revealing that one of the units in the property is currently available to rent for $5,000 a month.\n\nThe listing suggests that Hudson has spent time renovating the property since she purchased it, calling attention to the \u201cbeautiful\u201d updates that have been made to the four-bedroom unit.\n\nOn the same day that she completed mortgage paperwork on the first apartment building, Hudson also took out a $1.2 million mortgage on another nearby townhouse conversion, which was purchased for $2.3 million.\n\nHowever, records indicate that the property was purchased a few months earlier, in June 2023, just over one month after it was listed.\n\nMuch like her first townhouse, the second property has been split into three apartments, all of which feature four bedrooms and two bathrooms, with the original listing revealing that the building had been \u201crenovated to the studs\u201d prior to being put on the market.\n\nLocated in Dorchester\u2019s \u201cvibrant Polish Triangle neighborhood,\u201d the apartments all come complete with private outdoor space, as well as high ceilings and ample natural light, per the online description.\n\nThe third property in Hudson\u2019s booming real estate collection is in Boston, in the city\u2019s Roxbury Crossing neighborhood.\n\nHudson paid $3 million for that multifamily dwelling, which she purchased on Dec. 15, 2023, just two weeks after buying the properties in Dorchester.\n\nIn its listing, the property was described as a \u201cone-of-a-kind three-family home\u201d that features a total of 15 bedrooms and 8.5 bathrooms spread across three separate units.\n\nWhen it was listed, the description noted that all three of the units were leased until August 2024, \u201cgenerating a rental income of $17,675 a month.\u201d\n\nOn all of the mortgage documents for those properties, Hudson listed a fourth dwelling \u2014 this time a single-family home \u2014 as her residence, a quaint two-bedroom cottage in Harwich, MA, which she purchased for $610,000 in October 2023.\n\nLocated on the side of a pond, the property features two bathrooms and a \u201csmall but workable\u201d kitchen, per the listing.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms.

      "text": "Bill Belichick's provocative girlfriend Jordon Hudson, 24, has quietly amassed a $9 MILLION real estate empire since hooking up with the 73-year-old sports legend\nBill Belichick's 49-years-younger girlfriend made headlines this week when she muscled in on his CBS interview.\nBut awkward headlines aren't the only thing Jordon Hudson, 24, has been racking up. The former cheerleader has quietly amassed a real estate portfolio worth $9.1 million since the controversial couple began dating, the Daily Mail can reveal.\nHudson has snapped up at least four properties, including one worth $3million, which were all purchased after she met the former New England Patriots coach, 73, in 2021.\nEven more impressively, public records reveal Belichick's girlfriend has already paid off the mortgages on all of these homes.\nSince she began dating the eight-time Super Bowl winner, Hudson has also registered 18 companies - several with names that suggest she has some control over his affairs.\nHudson, the daughter of a fisherman from Maine, has also managed to secure the services of a high-end wealth manager whose firm requires its clients to have at least $2million in assets.\nJordon Hudson has quietly built a $9.1 million real estate empire since she began dating NFL legend Bill Belichick, the Daily Mail can reveal\nPublic records show the former college cheerleader, 24, has snapped up at least four properties since she linked up with the NFL Hall of Famer in 2021\nNeither Belichick nor Hudson have responded to the Daily Mail's request for comment.\nThe legendary NFL coach, who is said to be worth around $70million, refers to Hudson as his 'idea mill and creative muse' in his forthcoming memoir which is out in May.\nHudson's role in Belichick's life became a topic of national conversation after she interrupted his CBS interview about his book on Sunday to shut down questions about how they met.\n'We're not talking about this', she said, even though the reported story of the pair meeting on a plane appears to be innocuous.\nHudson, who is competing in the Miss Maine USA beauty pageant in May, is said to have stormed out of the interview for 30 minutes and delayed the filming.\nFriends of Belichick have reportedly raised concerns that the relationship is a 'runaway train' and claim Hudson 'saw an opening and took it' with him.\nThey are said to be staging an intervention but 'very gently because they know how deep in he is', the New York Post claimed.\nA $3million, three-bedroom home in the Roxbury Crossing area of Boston was bought by Hudson in December 2023\nHudson took out a $1.1million mortgage on the property\nA large townhouse which is divided up into three large apartments in Dorchester, Massachusetts, was bought by Hudson on December 1, 2023\nHudson got a $1.1million mortgage on the $2.2million home. One four-bedroom apartment in the building is currently on the market for rent for $4,900 a month\nThe full extent of Hudson's assets will likely raise further questions about her relationship with Belichick, who is infamous for being a micromanager.\nRecords obtained by the Daily Mail show three of Hudson's properties were bought in a cluster within three days of each other in December 2023, when Belichick was still in charge of the New England Patriots, during his 24th and final season.\nSuffolk County deed records show that Hudson bought two large townhouses in Dorchester, Massachusetts on December 1, 2023 - one worth $2.2m and the other $2.3m. Hudson got a $1.1m mortgage on both properties, which are each divided into three large apartments.\nOne four-bedroom apartment in the first building is currently available for rent at $4,900 a month.\nA second property, also a large townhouse in Dorchester, worth $2.3million was bought on the same day\nRecords show she got another substantial mortgage of $1.1million on the home, which is also divided up into three apartments\nThe fourth property, in Harwich, Massachusetts, is a two-bedroom, 1,200 sq ft cottage\nThe property was purchased on October 18, 2023 for $610,000, property records show, with a mortgage of $488,000.\nThen on December 8, 2023, Hudson took out a mortgage on her most expensive property yet: a $3million, three-bedroom family home in the Roxbury Crossing area of Boston.\nYet again, she got a $1.1million mortgage on the property.\nA fourth property - bought nearly two months before the other three houses - is a two-bedroom, 1,200 sq ft cottage located in Harwich, Massachusetts. It was purchased on October 18, 2023 for $610,000 and property records show it had a mortgage of $488,000.\nHudson used a trust called the TCE Trust, created on June 12, 2023, to help with the transaction.\nBut the most intriguing twist was yet to come: according to Massachusetts property records, all four mortgages were paid off within a week of each other in late January this year.\nHudson's role in Belichick's life became a topic of national conversation this week when she interrupted his CBS interview (pictured) about his book to shut down questions about how they met\nThe stony-faced 24-year-old was seen in the background before awkwardly muscling into boyfriend Bill Belichick's CBS interview\nThe 18 companies set up by Hudson are mostly in the state of Massachusetts.\nSome were set up to help her buy properties, such as TCE Cottage LLC, but others suggest she could be more involved in running Belichick's life.\nAmong them is Trouble Club Enterprises LLC, set up on January 20 this year.\nOn her LinkedIn page, Hudson says she is chief executive and founder of a company of the same name.\nThe LinkedIn page also states that, as of August last year, Hudson has been chief operating officer of 'Belichick Productions'.\nA company by that name was set up in New Jersey on April 17 this year but it is unclear if it is related to Hudson.\nOther companies set up by Hudson include 'All BB Team LLC', an apparent reference to Belichick, 'Chapel Bill LLC' and 'Coach Show LLC'. It is not clear how much she is managing Belichick's rights and image.\nHudson, a trained cosmetologist, has also set up 'Roosevelt Glam LLC' named after one of her middle names.\nThere are numerous versions of TCE such as 'TCE Creative Consulting LLC' and 'TCE Rights Management'. There is even a company called 'TEC Tech Support LLC' suggesting she is involved in IT too.\nOn her LinkedIn page, Hudson, a philosophy graduate from Bridgewater State University who only graduated in 2022, states her skills include real estate development, contract management, strategic partnerships, mergers and acquisitions and leadership development.\nBelichick's girlfriend Hudson shared an email from the coach to Instagram on Tuesday\nHudson's interruption of Belichick's interview sparked fears for the 73-year-old coach amid his relationship with the former cheerleader\nThe couple were photographed together after enjoying a double date night with friends at the Boarding House, a swanky private members club in Nantucket, last June\nNow at college level with North Carolina, striking footage recently emerged of Hudson by Belichick's side as he coached the team at a spring camp\nThe names that appear on the property and company documents are Massachusetts real-estate lawyer David Jensen and Joshua Christian, an advisor with Cerity Partners, a high-end wealth management company based in Boston.\nOn Cerity's website, the company says that its clients have to have a minimum of $2million in assets and pay an annual fee of $20,000 to use its services.\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Cerity and Jensen for comment.\nPrevious reports have raised questions about how much Hudson is in charge of Belichick's life. She recently moved with him to Chapel Hill, where the head coach is preparing for his first season coaching college ball for the University of North Carolina.\nAt the dinner table, the couple were seen locked in conversation and gazing at each other lovingly\nLast month it emerged that Belichick wanted Hudson copied in on all emails between him and Robbi Pickeral Evans, the school's Senior Associate Athletic Director for External Affairs and Strategic Communications.\nIn her email signature, Hudson refers to herself as Chief Operating Officer of Belichick Productions.\nShe has also been involved in negotiations with the NFL about a documentary covering Belichick and UNC, it has been reported.\nOne of Belichick's friends told the New York Post: 'This guy is known as being such a strong voice and in many ways autocratic - and here he is becoming mush in her hands and letting her direct everything.\n'She is so much younger, so inexperienced and so lacking in perspective and professionalism'."

      "text": "Bill Belichick lists Nantucket beachfront cottage for $3.9M \u2014 one week before starting as head coach at UNC\nIconic New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has put his beachfront Massachusetts cottage on the market for $3.9 million\u2014just one week before moving onto a new coaching chapter at the University of North Carolina.\nThe 73-year-old football legend\u2014who has stirred up controversy due to his relationship with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordan Hudson\u2014snapped up the stunning three-bedroom, two-bathroom abode in 2014 for $2.45 million.\nNow, Belichick has decided to offload his Nantucket dwelling as he prepares to enter a new chapter as the head football coach of the University of North Carolina after 24 seasons with the Patriots, during which the team garnered six Super Bowl wins.\nAccording to the listing, which is held by Coldwell Banker, the property features a \u201cvaulted living room with stone fireplace and views of the beach and conservation land. The cottage exudes old world charm with wooden walls, built-in bookshelves, a window with diamond mullions, and many nooks and crannies while still offering modern amenities for today\u2019s living.\u201d\nBelichick\u2014who boasts a net worth of $70 million\u2014holds the keys to several properties in Massachusetts and is even building a new home just down the street from the abode he put on the market.\nIn 2006, Belichick reportedly snapped up his first Massachusetts home for a relatively modest $1.4 million.\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home sprawls across 4,400 square feet and boasts a two-car garage.\nAccording to the original listing, the property overlooks a third hole on a golf course and features two pools, a tennis court, a clubhouse, and a recreation center.\nInside, there is a media room, wine cellar, and wet bar.\nAlthough he purchased the charming abode for $1.4 million, Realtor.com\u00ae now estimates Belichick\u2019s property is worth $2.1 million.\nIn 2024, he forked over $4.8 million for a 2,854-square-foot Nantucket home.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom property was built in 1983 and boasts an expansive living area, a sophisticated dining space, and an office space.\nOn the second floor, there is an en suite primary bedroom and two guest rooms with a shared bath.\nThe property was renovated in 2017 and features a basement with an additional bathroom and tub.\nBelichick previously gushed about Nantucket while speaking to N Magazine in 2017, telling the outlet: \u201cThe island is spectacular. The people are great, fishing, bike paths, the lighthouses, the beach, the history\u2014I mean it\u2019s got it all.\u201d\nThe legendary coach once held the keys to another Nantucket property, which he purchased for $4.6 million in 2006; however, property records indicate that the home went to his ex-wife, Debby Clarke, after they divorced that same year.\nAccording to the documents, the former couple purchased the home together; however, it is now solely registered in her name.\nThe property boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms, and several cozy fireplaces.\nWhen he isn\u2019t enjoying one of his many homes in Massachusetts, the NFL coach is laying low in his stunning Florida condo, which he purchased in 2009.\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom home sprawls across 4,085 square feet and boasts 20-foot ceilings and sweeping views of the deep sea.\nAlthough he snapped up the property for $1.6 million, Realtor.com\u00ae now estimates it is worth $3.7 million.\nThe property is located right off of a golf course and boasts a wine cellar and an encircled patio.\nSince bidding farewell to his long career with the Patriots in January, Belichick has been at the center of headlines due to his controversial romance with Hudson, a former cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant.\nThe couple, who began dating in 2023, have been thrown into the hot seat time and time again since going public with their age-gap relationship.\nThey previously had their romance thrown into the spotlight during the NFL Honors, when they were mercilessly roasted by rapper Snoop Dogg over their 48-year age gap.\nTelling the crowd that he\u2019s been \u201ca football fan for a long time,\u201d Snoop, 53, said that many things have changed since he first started watching games \u201cback when the Cowboys was good\u201d and \u201cwhen the Chiefs was bad.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I remember, what was it\u2014Bill Belichick\u2019s girlfriend wasn\u2019t even born yet?\u201d he joked, leaving Hudson open-mouthed in surprise, while her partner simply chuckled along with the rest of the audience.\nThe longtime coach\u2019s dating life wasn\u2019t even spared by two of his most successful players, Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, both of whom savaged him over it during Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Roast of Tom Brady.\u201d\n\u201cCoach, you used to talk about Foxborough High School when we sucked,\u201d Gronkowski said during the livestreamed special on May 5, 2024.\n\u201cBut now I know why you were so obsessed with Foxborough High School: You were scouting your new girlfriend.\u201d\nBrady then followed that up by mocking Belichick over Ring camera footage that caught him sneaking out of Hudson\u2019s home shirtless, saying: \u201cEverybody asks me which ring is my favorite, I used to say \u2018the next one.\u2019\n\u201cBut now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl\u2019s house a few months ago. Hey, you still got it. Respect, baby.\u201d\nThe home in question was located in Massachusetts home where former cheerleader Hudson was living at the time\u2014having attended Bridgewater State University.\nIn addition to boasting an impressive career as a cheerleader, Hudson also holds an $8 million property portfolio, forging the path for her to become a real estate mogul.\nShe began snapping up a host of multifamily homes in the greater Boston area in December 2023, property records reveal, just a few months after she was first seen spending time with Belichick, 73, although they are reported to have met around 18 months earlier.\nAccording to mortgage documents seen by Realtor.com\u00ae, Hudson purchased three multi-family dwellings at the end of 2023, all of which were purchased through separate LLCs, but with the former cheerleader\u2019s name listed as the \u201cborrower\u201d for each.\nAs first reported by DailyMail.com, Hudson took out a $1.2 million mortgage on the first dwelling\u2014a $2.2 million Dorchester townhouse that has been converted into three separate apartments\u2014on Dec. 1, 2023, with a listing on Realtor.com revealing that one of the units in the property is currently available to rent for $5,000 a month.\nThe listing suggests that Hudson has spent time renovating the property since she purchased it, calling attention to the \u201cbeautiful\u201d updates that have been made to the four-bedroom unit.\nOn the same day that she completed mortgage paperwork on the first apartment building, Hudson also took out a $1.2 million mortgage on another nearby townhouse conversion, which was purchased for $2.3 million.\nHowever, records indicate that the property was purchased a few months earlier, in June 2023, just over one month after it was listed.\nMuch like her first townhouse, the second property has been split into three apartments, all of which feature four bedrooms and two bathrooms, with the original listing revealing that the building had been \u201crenovated to the studs\u201d prior to being put on the market.\nLocated in Dorchester\u2019s \u201cvibrant Polish Triangle neighborhood,\u201d the apartments all come complete with private outdoor space, as well as high ceilings and ample natural light, per the online description.\nThe third property in Hudson\u2019s booming real estate collection is in Boston, in the city\u2019s Roxbury Crossing neighborhood.\nHudson paid $3 million for that multifamily dwelling, which she purchased on Dec. 15, 2023, just two weeks after buying the properties in Dorchester.\nIn its listing, the property was described as a \u201cone-of-a-kind three-family home\u201d that features a total of 15 bedrooms and 8.5 bathrooms spread across three separate units.\nWhen it was listed, the description noted that all three of the units were leased until August 2024, \u201cgenerating a rental income of $17,675 a month.\u201d\nOn all of the mortgage documents for those properties, Hudson listed a fourth dwelling\u2014this time a single-family home\u2014as her residence, a quaint two-bedroom cottage in Harwich, MA, which she purchased for $610,000 in October 2023.\nLocated on the side of a pond, the property features two bathrooms and a \u201csmall but workable\u201d kitchen, per the listing."

      "text": "Shirtless Bill Belichick seen sneaking from 24-year-old girlfriend\u2019s home in newest dating twist\nIt appears there\u2019s a new twist in this tale of the tape.\nMonths after Ring camera footage surfaced of a shirtless man \u2014 whom many believed to be Bill Belichick \u2014 leaving a house in the morning, the Daily Mail reported Wednesday the video blasted on social media in November 2023 was the eight-time Super Bowl winner exiting the Massachusetts residence of his 24-year-old girlfriend, former cheerleader Jordon Hudson.\nThe latest Belichick revelation comes days after TMZ revealed the former Patriots coach, 72, is dating Hudson, whom he met on a plane in 2021.\nBelichick was said to be enthralled with the then-student-athlete\u2019s philosophy project and even signed his autograph in her \u201cDeductive Logic\u201d textbook.\n\u201cJordon, Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels!\u201d Belichick wrote before signing his name.\nTMZ obtained a photo of their first encounter Tuesday which featured the pair smiling.\nBelichick\u2019s relationship with Hudson turned romantic following his split from longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday.\nPage Six reported in September 2023 that Belichick and Holliday \u2014 who had been together since 2007 \u2014 were \u201cinvolved in a drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup for nearly a year.\u201d\nBelichick\u2019s dalliances became a punchline at Tom Brady\u2019s raunchy Netflix roast last month, with the legendary Patriots quarterback torching his former coach over the early-hours exit in the Ring video.\n\u201cEverybody asks me which ring is my favorite, I used to say \u2018the next one.\u2019 But now that I am retired, my favorite Ring is the camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl\u2019s house a few months ago. Hey, you still got it. Respect baby,\u201d Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champ, quipped.\nBelichick and Brady, 46, won six Super Bowls during their 20 seasons together in New England.\nBrady won what would be his final championship in 2021 when he was a member of the Buccaneers.\nThe future Hall-of-Fame quarterback retired from the NFL in 2023 after 23 seasons.\nBelichick and the Patriots parted ways in January after 24 seasons."

      "text": "Bill Belichick is unknowingly playing with one of his Super Bowl rings. The ring is the size of a shot glass, and each time he turns it in his hand, light dances around the room. His other hand is draped casually over the shoulder of his longtime partner, Linda Holliday, and clasps hers. They\u2019re sitting on a casual, unfussy couch in the Belichick\u2019s living room in \u2018Sconset. The space is quaint and comfortable. An antique Wurlitzer jukebox stands quietly behind them and there\u2019s a seascape painting hanging over the mantel. Beyond locker rooms, practice fields and stadiums, this is the inner sanctum of arguably the greatest coach in the history of sports.\n\u201cI started off in Detroit, then Denver, then the Giants, then Cleveland, then the Patriots, then the Jets, and then the Patriots [again],\u201d Belichick says. \u201cBut at the end of every one of those years I was here.\u201d He slaps his knee. \u201cNantucket has always been a constant.\u201d Belichick first discovered the island while he was in high school in Annapolis, Maryland where his father was a football coach at the US Naval Academy. His high school friend Mark Fredland had a family home on the island and invited him to join one summer. In 1979, he and Fredland purchased this plot of land off Sankaty Road and developed it together. Fredland still lives nearby. It\u2019s a charming property that harks back to the old Nantucket when screen doors clapped closed and unpretentiousness was a community ethos.\n\u201cThis is where everybody flocks home,\u201d says Holliday. \u201cNo matter what everybody is doing during their busy lives, Nantucket is where family comes together as a unit again.\u201d If there was ever kryptonite to soften the steeliest coach in the game, it\u2019s Linda Holliday. Warm and vivacious, she pairs well with Belichick \u2014 or as he put it earlier in the day, \u201cShe\u2019s the rose next to the thorn.\u201d The couple appear completely at ease with one another and share a playfulness and unabashed affection that belies Belichick\u2019s stern on-field persona. Indeed, Holliday knows a side of the coach that very few do, and she smiles widely when asked what most people would be surprised to learn about him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something about Bill,\u201d she says with a hint of Tennessee twang in her voice. \u201cHe can sing. And he can sing well. You won\u2019t hear it. You won\u2019t see it. But he can sing well.\u201d A boyish grin spreads across Belichick\u2019s face, and for an instant, one almost forgets that this is the same man who leads 350-pound behemoths into battle.\nBelichick is coming off what is widely considered to be the greatest victory in Super Bowl history \u2014 perhaps the greatest comeback in all of sports. His improbable win over the Falcons \u2014 clawing back from a 28-3 deficit with less than a half to play\u2014only further cemented his legend. If there\u2019s ever a question of how many championships he\u2019s won in his forty-two-year career, one only needs to find Belichick\u2019s fishing boat\u2014now renamed VII RINGS \u2014 bobbing in Nantucket harbor to get the official count. And yet despite being one of the winningest coaches in NFL history, Belichick has earned a reputation for not relishing his victories.\nIt begs the question whether he allows himself to savor victory at all? Or is his taciturn demeanor a deliberate part of his coaching style to keep his team level? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely part of keeping level,\u201d Belichick responds when asked these questions. \u201cPart of my job is to tell the truth to the team, because I feel I know the truth. When we win \u2014 and we\u2019ve won a lot fortunately \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of accolades of how great things are. The team gets plenty of that from outside sources. I think the pendulum swings a little too far that way in general. And so I try to swing it back a little bit the other way. Now, it\u2019s important to celebrate wins, but not for very long.\u201d\nWhen asked how long his team can afford to soak up a victory, Belichick says, \u201cFor the most part it\u2019s brief because you have to move on. If you win on Sunday and you have another game on the following Sunday, you can\u2019t hang on to [the win] for very long. I\u2019d say less than twenty-four hours because you have a new challenge ahead.\u201d\nInstead of reveling in the touchdowns and goal-line stops, he focuses on dropped passes, missed tackles, and botched plays. \u201cWe\u2019re going to point those things out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on them. We\u2019re not just going to be happy that things went our way. The truth is if we don\u2019t do better than this, we\u2019re probably not going to win too many more games.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cNow when things go the other way. When things aren\u2019t going well. When the pendulum is swinging down on your team and everybody is pounding on them \u2014 the fans, the media, maybe a little bit of self doubt or lack of confidence \u2014 then that\u2019s when they need to be brought up. I try to keep it on an even keel.\u201d\nPerhaps the most extreme example of Belichick swinging the pendulum back to center came the day after his most recent Super Bowl win. \u201cAs great as today feels,\u201d he famously told a pack of reporters, \u201cwe\u2019re five weeks behind the other teams for the 2017 season.\u201d Instead of basking in the afterglow of such a biblical accomplishment, Belichick already seemed to have his eyes set on the next game eight months away. Was this statement calculated or would he simply not allow himself to revel in what many considered the greatest victory of all time?\n\u201cI definitely can hang on to that game,\u201d he says when asked these questions. \u201cI mean I wasn\u2019t saying [that statement] critically or with remorse or anything; that was just a point of fact. Had we been eliminated from the playoffs in the regular season like twenty of the thirty-two teams did, we would have started immediately working on the draft, free agency, going back over the previous season. When you play an additional five weeks, and then if you win the [Super Bowl]\u2026 the reality is once you pick up the pen and paper and start going to work for the next year, the other teams are six weeks ahead of you. I was just pointing that out.\u201d\n\u201cHe can separate enjoying the win, and realizing that he has to get back to work, too,\u201d says Holliday, who has witnessed this up close during their ten-year relationship. A former boutique clothing store owner and television personality, Holliday has brought her own unique air to Patriots Nation. This Super Bowl she grabbed fashion headlines with a custom-made Swarovski crystal Patriots hoodie, complete with BELICHICK in big sparkling letters bedazzled from shoulder to shoulder. Now she has two of her own custom-engraved Super Bowl rings to match.\n\u201cI grew up in the south, so I was an SEC football girl and never paid attention to pro football,\u201d Holliday says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have pro football when I was growing up in Tennessee, so Bill has brought me into that world.\u201d Today, Holliday serves as the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation, an organization Belichick credits her for starting. The organization has helped change the lives of hundreds of students from Nantucket to Uganda.\n\u201cThe foundation all came together around Bill\u2019s sixtieth birthday,\u201d says Holliday. \u201cIn lieu of birthday presents, friends gave the first donations to the foundation.\u201d For years, Belichick awarded scholarships in honor of his father to student athletes at his alma mater Annapolis High School. Holliday saw an opportunity to expand upon this through a nonprofit that would not only continue to award scholarships to Annapolis students, but to students across the country. \u201cBill and I handpick every single person,\u201d Holliday says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we take lightly. We want to know who the person is on a first name basis.\u201d\nThe foundation also awards grants to help programs such as The Nantucket Skating Club, which gained vital support in 2015. Beyond Nantucket, the foundation\u2019s reach has expanded across the country and around the globe, particularly in supporting football and lacrosse programs. \u201cWe built a field in Uganda,\u201d Belichick says. \u201cWe\u2019re in foreign countries. We\u2019re national and we\u2019re local. In particular, we try to help out Boston\u2019s underprivileged lacrosse teams.\u201d With a faint glimmer of pride in his voice, he adds that the lacrosse team they support in Croatia recently won the European championship.\nThe Bill Belichick Foundation was established in memory of Belichick\u2019s father, Steve Belichick. Steve\u2019s parents immigrated to the United States from Croatia at the turn of the twentieth century, and he grew up in the thick of the Great Depression. Football became his saving grace, earning him a partial athletic scholarship to college and eventually a season playing with the Detroit Lions before the war. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Steve Belichick coached for a number of college teams before assuming his thirty-three-year post as coach and scout for the US Naval Academy. Bill Belichick was four years old when his father took the job, and he grew up absorbing formative lessons from his dad on and off the field.\n\u201cWhen I look back on it, one of the things I learned at Annapolis, when I grew up around the Navy football teams in the early sixties \u2014 Joe Bellino, Roger Staubach, Coach Wayne Hardin and some of the great teams they had \u2014 I didn\u2019t know any differently,\u201d he says. \u201cI just assumed that\u2019s what football was. Guys were very disciplined. They worked very hard. They did extra things. They were always on time, alert, ready to go, team-oriented, unselfish. I thought that\u2019s the way it all was. I wasn\u2019t aware of it at the time, but I can see how that molded me.\u201d\nThe military mindset Belichick witnessed at the Naval Academy is now a trademark of his coaching style. Watching him stalwartly prowl the sidelines directing his players, it\u2019s not hard to imagine him as a field general in another life. In fact, Belichick is passionate about military history, and even narrated a PBS documentary about World War II called D-Day: Over Normandy that premiered this spring. His coaching style and personal interest in military history begs the question whether the coach could ever have pictured himself as a military leader? Could Bill Belichick see himself as a general leading troops on the battle field? \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have been a general, because I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the Army,\u201d Belichick says, when asked this hypothetical question. \u201cI would have wanted to be in the Navy. I\u2019d want to be an admiral.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my admiral,\u201d Holliday laughs.\nThere\u2019s a certain military mentality,\u201d Belichick continues. \u201cWhen you join the military and make it a career, you\u2019re doing it to defend the country from all enemies foreign and domestic. Basically you want to fight. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do: to fight and to win battles and not to lose them. I\u2019m not sure that I have that type of mentality. It\u2019s not quite the same in business or in sports. I mean, there\u2019s certainly things that are similar, but that fighting and playing for keeps is a little bit of a different mentality. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really the way that I\u2019m wired.\u201d\nWhen asked which feeling is more intense, the thrill of winning or the pain of defeat, the coach responds without hesitation: \u201cThe disappointment of losing. The lows are lower than the highs.\u201d He contemplates it more and continues, \u201cBut when the last game turns out like it did this year, or like it turned out two years ago \u2014 or, you know, I\u2019ve been involved with seven championship seasons \u2014 those last a little bit longer. At some point you\u2019ve got to move on from them, but you can hang on a little bit longer.\u201d\nHere in his home in \u2018Sconset, there\u2019s an airiness to Bill Belichick that television cameras don\u2019t capture when he\u2019s pacing the sidelines or stonewalling reporters after the game. Sitting next to the woman he loves, still hand in hand, he\u2019s quick to laugh. While the conversation may have begun in true Belichickian fashion, with his responses clipped and measured, there\u2019s now an undeniable ease to his demeanor. He\u2019s talking about Nantucket and no question seems out of bounds.\nThen, this question: \u201cBill, you\u2019re obviously very well compensated for what you do\u2026\u201d The conversation suddenly groans to a halt. The interview has just entered uncharted waters and an uncomfortable silence floods the room. Waiting for the rest of the question, Belichick stares back with a look that could stop a bullet. \u201c\u2026But are you paid well enough to shop at the \u2018Sconset Market?\u201d\nThe coach throws his head back and breaks out into a full belly laugh. Holliday joins him. \u201cThe market is great, but the prices\u2026\u201d he jokes, continuing to chuckle. \u201cThat place could be a study in monopolies!\u201d Belichick clearly loves what the \u2018Sconset Market represents. Like so many spots on the island, the \u2018Sconset Market connects him with his past, conjuring fond memories of when his children were young and began the day by scampering up to buy warm baked goods for breakfast. \u201cThe baked goods there are pretty hard to resist,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cespecially their muffins or cookies.\u201d \u201cAnd the ice cream,\u201d Holliday adds. \u201cNothing better than walking down there to get ice cream.\u201d\nThe exchange illustrates why he and Holliday love this island so much. Belichick appears to still relish the folksy charm and simplicity that drew him here nearly forty years ago. \u201cThe island is spectacular,\u201d he says \u201cThe people are great, fishing, bike paths, the lighthouses, the beach, the history \u2014 I mean it\u2019s got it all.\u201d Holliday smiles in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of getting over here and having that island factor,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re away from everything and yet you\u2019re still among friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou know how it is,\u201d Belichick continues. \u201cWhen you drive along the moors, you\u2019re going to pull over for me, and I\u2019m going to pull over for you. It\u2019s just a question of which one of us is finally going to go first. Because you always want to be courteous and polite to the other guy.\u201d This good will and sense of community continues to afford Belichick and Holliday an escape from the flashbulbs and microphones that define much of their year. So no matter how many more Super Bowl rings he collects, no matter how far and wide his foundation reaches, life will always return to this quiet retreat in \u2018Sconset where the most enigmatic, scrutinized coach in the game can enjoy a long, much-deserved timeout.\nBELICHICK FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIPS\nSince launching in 2013, the Bill Belichick Foundation has awarded $350,000 in scholarships to student athletes across the country. Here on Nantucket, past recipients have included James Aloisi, Kezia Duarte, Megan Cranston, Nathan Leibowitz, and Olivia Slade. This past May, Katie Fox, daughter of Chicken Box co-owners Rocky and Lori Fox, was awarded one of the most recent scholarships. \u201cI was super excited,\u201d Fox says. \u201cA scholarship goes a long way and motivates me to work even harder and not let the Bill Belichick Foundation down.\u201d\nAn exemplary student, Fox also played varsity basketball and field hockey all four years at Nantucket High School and later became captain of both teams. Despite the time required by her athletic endeavors, Fox also volunteered extensively on the island. She was an ideal candidate for the scholarship.\n\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know Bill Belichick personally, I think that he\u2019s a great football coach, but even a better person for helping all these kids and groups with his foundation,\u201d says Fox, who is entering her sophomore year at UMASS Amherst and is considering studying social work. \u201cHe\u2019s truly taken the platform he was given and is now doing whatever he can to give back. After attending the ceremony, I can see what a difference it is making.\u201d\nBELICHICK FOUNDATION GRANTS\nIn an effort to champion communities, the Bill Belichick Foundation has awarded $385,000 in grants in the last four years. The grant program began when Linda Holliday observed the dire needs of fledgling lacrosse programs in both inner cities and rural areas of the country. \u201cSeveral friends of mine were having to do bake sales to get enough money to hire a coach and buy lacrosse sticks and get uniforms,\u201d she says. \u201cI was thinking that there has to be better ways to raise money and awareness for youth fun in sports as well as continue education.\u201d Enter the Bill Belichick Foundation (BBF) grant program.\nSince 2013, the BBF has awarded forty-two grants, supporting everything from building a field in Uganda to outfitting a lacrosse team in Croatia. Here on the island, The Nantucket Skating Club received a grant that dramatically propelled its mission. \u201cWe\u2019re a small organization, but we are unique in that we have a lot more expenses compared to off-island skating clubs,\u201d says Nantucket Skating Club president, Jody Paterson. As a 100 percent volunteer nonprofit, every fundraising dollar goes to paying for ice time, coaching, and travel to off-island competitions. The grant enabled the Skating Club to not only meet its needs on the ice, but also expand its program to incorporate off-ice training and coaching year-round. \u201cWhat the Bill Belichick Foundation has done for the club has been amazing,\u201d says Paterson. \u201cThe financial support is always welcome for any type of nonprofit, but in particular the name recognition of Bill Belichick gave a huge boost to morale and raised people\u2019s awareness of our club.\u201d"

      "text": "How Jordon Hudson, 24, amassed $8 million real estate portfolio within months of meeting Bill Belichick\nBill Belichick\u2019s spry girlfriend Jordon Hudson has amassed a New England real estate portfolio worth about $8 million \u2014 all within months of the fisherman\u2019s daughter meeting the 73-year-old ex-Patriots coach, according to property records.\nHudson, 24, bought three multi-family homes across the Boston area in December 2023 for about $7.5 million \u2014 inking millions of dollars in mortgage agreements within days, documents reviewed by Realtor.com show.\nJust two months earlier, Hudson dropped $610,000 on a cottage in the scenic Cape Cod town of Harwich, which she listed as her home address on the mortgage documents.\nThose hefty purchases came about 18 months after the former cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant began dating the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach.\nThe couple reportedly met in February 2021 when she was 20, and their relationship was first publicly revealed in June 2024 \u2014 around the time she began showing up to her cheerleading practice in a $75,000 Porsche.\nRevelations about Hudson\u2019s seven-figure real estate portfolio come after an awkward Belichick interview with CBS News left many wondering about how much control she has over the superstar coach.\nFriends of Belichick previously told The Post they were \u201cshaking their heads\u201d after Hudson cut off an interviewer\u2019s question about how the couple met to declare, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d\nFirst reported by DailyMail.com, Hudson\u2019s real estate portfolio suggests she has managed to grow her net worth since she met Belichick.\nHudson\u2019s properties include a $2.2 million Dorchester townhouse that was bought with a $1.2 million mortgage in December 2023. The home is split into three apartments \u2014 one four-bed currently rents for about $5,000 per month \u2014 and appears to have undergone extensive interior renovations, according to Realtor.com.\nAnd on the very same day she signed that mortgage, Hudson took out another $1.2 million mortgage on a second Dorchester townhouse that she bought for $2.3 million in June 2023, records show.\nThat townhouse has also been split into three apartments, and listings show it was \u201crenovated to the studs\u201d before Hudson bought it.\nHer third major property was purchased on Dec. 15, 2023 \u2014 just two days later \u2014 for $3 million.\nProperty listings describe the large multi-family house as a \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d with 15 bedrooms across three units. Those apartments were earning about $17,675 in monthly income as of August 2024, listings show.\nEach of those properties was bought under an LLC, with mortgage documents listing Hudson as the \u201cborrower.\u201d\nAnd her Cape Cod bungalow was bought just two months earlier in October 2023. It has two bedrooms, and is located alongside a pond in the popular New England vacation community.\nAt the time of the purchases, Belichick was still working as head coach for the New England Patriots, where he earned about $25 million per year and over $200 million during his more than 20-year career there, according to Bloomberg.\nHe now earns about $10 million annually as head coach for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels football team.\nHudson was raised in Hancock, Maine, to parents who ran a fishing business that went bankrupt after their fishing grounds were closed in 2000.\nHer mother eventually moved to Provincetown, on Cape Cod, where she manages a sex-toy shop and museum.\nThe football star and the cheerleader are said to have met on a flight from Boston to Florida \u2014 but the pair have never publicly confirmed the stories, and the subject appears to be a sore spot for them, based on her abrupt response to a question about their meet-cute from CBS host Tony Dokoupil.\nBut her presence during the CBS interview was far more overbearing than that clip showed, Dokoupil said, describing Hudson as \u201ca constant presence during our interview.\u201d\nBelichick hit back at CBS and said the network produced a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d out of the interview.\n\u201cSome of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\u201d he said.\nAnd in March, Axios revealed that Belichick had requested Hudson be CC\u2019ed on all emails with UNC\u2019s senior associate athletic director for external affairs and strategic communications. The Athletic reported that Hudson\u2019s email signature described her as \u201cChief Operating Officer of Belichick Productions.\u201d\nBelichick broke up with his longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday in September 2023. She was 60 at the time.\nHe and Hudson did not respond to request for comment."
