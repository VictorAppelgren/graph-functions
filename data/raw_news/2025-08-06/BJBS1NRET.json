  "content": "This nepo baby has been working tirelessly for the past decade to change the public perception of his mother \u2013 and it has been paying off spectacularly.\n\nBrandon Thomas Lee, the eldest son of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, has focused all his energy into transforming how his mom, the former Baywatch actress, is perceived.\n\n'He's masterminded this whole comeback,' the 58\u2013year\u2013old told Entertainment Tonight in December after being nominated for a Best Actress gong for her performance in The Last Showgirl.\n\nIt's been nine months since then, and Pamela's career is showing no sign of slowing.\n\nFollowing her latest box office smash, The Naked Gun, and her new relationship with her co\u2013star, actor Liam Neeson, FEMAIL takes a closer look at the man behind her recent Hollywood successes: her firstborn son.\n\nBorn on June 5, 1996 in California, Brandon is the first child from the couple's whirlwind three\u2013year marriage. They also share a second son Dylan, 27, who has made a name for himself as both a model and musician.\n\nAlthough he spent his first few years growing up in California, mom Pamela moved Brandon, now 29, and his brother to boarding school in Canada.\n\nDuring an interview on The Wendy Williams Show in 2016, she revealed that she had her children educated in her native country so they could 'see something outside of entertainment.'\n\nBut it wasn't long before Brandon decided to follow in his mother's footsteps.\n\n'Brandon is taking acting really seriously and is taking acting lessons and wants to do that,' Pamela shared in that same interview.\n\nIn 2017, he made his film debut alongside his mom in the Baywatch film, which also starred Zac Efron and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.\n\nOne year later, he appeared alongside Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo in the 2018 film, Cosmic Sin, as well as the romcom Sierra Burgess Is a Loser.\n\nBesides his foray into acting, Brandon is a producer and has several films under his belt, including the documentary, Pamela, a Love Story, which was instrumental in reviving Pamela's career.\n\nReleased in 2023, the Netflix documentary, recounted the Playboy model's rise to stardom, her turbulent marriage to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy, and how she became a global sex symbol.\n\nBrandon got the wheels for the film in motion when he asked filmmaker Ryan White to direct the project in a bid to show his mother in a different light.\n\nPamela's raw and unfiltered account put her back into the spotlight and she herself credited Brandon and his efforts on the film for making it the success that it was.\n\nShe also notes that it was the documentary that led her to getting the lead role in the Gia Coppola directed film, The Last Showgirl, which earned her Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes and the Sag Awards.\n\n'He [Brandon] did the documentary and that's how Gia discovered me,' she told ET.\n\nBrandon has also served as an executive producer on Pamela's Garden of Eden and Pamela's Cooking with Love, as well as on The Last Showgirl.\n\nOver the past four years, Brandon embarked on this mission to overhaul his mom's image, which he said was sparked out of wanting the world to 'truly see my mom.'\n\n'She's an icon who helped shape a generation, but it was about time she shaped her own narrative,' he continued.\n\n'Today, I'm overjoyed knowing that the world not only recognizes her but has come to adore her the way I always have.'\n\nIn December, Brandon spoke out about how he made it his mission to help his mother shift her narrative from sex symbol to human being \u2013 and to aid her in following her dreams.\n\n'The reason I got involved, other than for various business reasons \u2013 my personal mission was to give my mom the opportunities she gave me as a child,' he told Variety.\n\n'She would do anything for me. She showed up and was a very good mother. And at a certain point in your life, you become a protector.\n\n'I knew from a very early age that I was going to eventually be the one that put the stake in the ground for my family and rally around that.\n\n'So, it would have been very easy for us, or for me, to come up with some sort of scheme to make money off the Pamela that people thought they knew.\n\n'It would have meant she wasn't going to be happy, but she would have been making money.'\n\nHe continued to the publication: 'But I really just wanted her to feel like she had the opportunity, whether it happened or not, to achieve success in the field she wanted to be in.\n\n'We turned down a lot of big opportunities, but it just wasn't going to make Pamela feel proud.\n\n'But we had to take a moment and be steadfast in our position, that we needed to take the time to do the memoir and documentary, and shy away from other opportunities that weren't going to shine a light or clarify or embolden her.'",

      "text": "Pamela Anderson\u2018s eldest son Brandon Thomas Lee is getting emotional.\nIt\u2019s taken years, but he might have helped shatter a Hollywood stereotype that has been a cloud over Anderson\u2019s career for years.\nThe actor-turned-producer is sitting on Zoom discussing her recent success in Roadside Attractions \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d which Gia Coppola directed. In the film, Anderson plays Shelly, a veteran dancer who finds herself at a crossroads when the Vegas revue she performs in abruptly closes after 30 years, just as her estranged biological daughter Hannah (Billie Lourd) re-enters her life. Aside from winning rave reviews from critics, Anderson landed herself a Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a drama/motion picture. Lee, an executive producer on the film, says the nomination \u201cmeans a lot,\u201d but also hopes this marks a new chapter for Anderson\u2019s career. He says, \u201cIt means the culmination of a very long road and a lot of hard work, and the crescendo of an amazing moment that really only marks the beginning for her.\u201d\nFor years, Anderson has been boxed into the blonde bombshell archetype after getting her start as a Playboy Playmate and then appearing in the TV series, \u201cBaywatch.\u201d Her marriage to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee made headlines when a sex tape leaked.\nPopular on Variety\nAnderson took a brief break from the spotlight to focus on raising her two sons, but she soon returned, starring as Roxie Hart in \u201cChicago\u201d on Broadway. And last year, she took control of her narrative by publishing her memoir \u201cLove, Pamela\u201d and appeared in the Netflix documentary \u201cPamela, a Love Story,\u201d which Lee produced.\nLee\u2019s pride is felt over the computer screen. His emotions are high as he recalls how Anderson always told him that \u201cshe was going to have to always going to have to prove herself to people, and we would always have to do that.\u201d\nBut the tide is turning. Has Anderson finally proved herself and her acting abilities? With the critical acclaim for her performance as Shelly, Lee has seen a shift not just from audiences and fans, but also from Hollywood and what roles she\u2019s getting offered. But it didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it took \u201cThe Last Showgirl\u201d to get there. Lee says, \u201cWhen you really think about it and where we\u2019ve come from over the last decade, it\u2019s remarkable.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cWhat Pamela is doing and the opportunities she\u2019s getting right now are just fantastic. It lets you know you\u2019re doing the right things.\u201d\nBelow, Lee who also oversees the Anderson family business affairs talks about why he has made it his personal mission to help shift the narrative toward Anderson, whom he calls \u201cPamela\u201d during the conversation, and how Hollywood has responded to her.\nThere\u2019s a story of the script being turned down by Pamela\u2019s former agent before even showing it to her, and you happened to come across it. Can you talk about meeting with Gia and that gut instinct that this was right for Pamela?\nWhen I first laid eyes on it, I wasn\u2019t really used to looking at projects like that for Pamela. It was such a breath of fresh air, and it was so impactful, and it was something I knew she could deliver on. And it was so timely, and it just seemed like the stars were aligning a bit on it and how it was playing into this arc of where she was in her career. I knew there were so many real-life inspirations she could take into this.\nSo, I met with Gia and [producer] Robert Schwartzman and was figuring out if they were going to be the people we trusted with this \u2014 her comeback performance.\nIt is very much a family business with them as well, and everything\u2019s kind of entangled like that, and that\u2019s kind of how we operate. I knew we could trust them, and I think it was about just putting the right pieces in place. Once the cast started to come together for that, and who was going to be helping Pamela carry this film, it just became such a no-brainer and such a fantastic opportunity. And I knew from day one it was going to be a special product.\nWhat about getting the script to Pamela, what was her reaction when you gave her this story?\nMy mom\u2019s so funny. She will tell you it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s ever read a real script. I think that\u2019s probably mostly true.\nThe conversation was very quick. She read it and said, \u201cI want to do it.\u201d There was no deliberation around it. She was instantly enamored with Shelly, and it spoke to her.\nThis film was made for just over a million bucks in 18 days. So the fact that it has the impact that it has is incredible. It just shows that everyone involved with the project had to come together. It\u2019s incredible what can happen when people can put ego and stardom to the side and really make it an art project and come together for the sake of filmmaking, great writing, great directing and great cinematography.\nTo that, Jamie Lee Curtis said she wanted to be in it because Pamela Anderson was going to star in it. When you hear that, what does it mean?\nWhen I hear stuff like that, it makes me feel incredibly proud. Not just of her, but just of everything we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years.\nThe documentary and book gave Pamela the opportunity to own her narrative and really present that story to the world. When we had the opportunity to do that, it was something in the back of my head that I was always thinking about the goal of those projects \u2014 it wasn\u2019t to bring opportunities, the goal of those projects was to get people to understand and get to know Pamela because there was so much misconception around her and who she was. It was really holding her back in terms of the opportunity she was being presented. So to hear Jamie say that, what else could you ask for?\nYou were instrumental in shattering the Hollywood stereotype. How did you navigate that?\nThe reason I got involved, other than for various business reasons \u2014 my personal mission was to give my mom the opportunities she gave me as a child. She would do anything for me. She showed up and was a very good mother. And at a certain point in your life, you become a protector.\nI knew from a very early age that I was going to eventually be the one that put the stake in the ground for my family and rally around that.\nSo, it would have been very easy for us, or for me, to come up with some sort of scheme to make money off the Pamela that people thought they knew. It would have meant she wasn\u2019t going to be happy, but she would have been making money.\nBut I really just wanted her to feel like she had the opportunity, whether it happened or not, to achieve success in the field she wanted to be in.\nWe turned down a lot of big opportunities, but it just wasn\u2019t going to make Pamela feel proud. But we had to take a moment and be steadfast in our position, that we needed to take the time to do the memoir and documentary, and shy away from other opportunities that weren\u2019t going to shine a light or clarify or embolden her.\nWell those projects shifted the narrative, and the support shifted from largely male to female.\nI guess it\u2019s this acceptance. The category she was in before, she was just very objectified and very made for the, you know, her whole career was just positioned towards the male gaze. And for us to see the shift after we laid all the cards out on the table was shocking to me. I knew at that point that there was going to be this great shift in her career, because she was no longer this misunderstood or threatening personality.\nShe wasn\u2019t this sex symbol anymore. She was a human being, and I think people were looking at her in a completely new light. And I feel like that kind of reintroduced her to the world. It feels like everyone\u2019s rooting for her.\nGoing back to \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d are you seeing a shift in the scripts coming her way?\nAfter the documentary, there was this incredible public shift and there was a lot of attention on her, but we were still not seeing incredible stuff for Pamela.\nIt was not until \u201cThe Last Showgirl\u201d came along that we had something special. Yes, there were offers, but it was all geared towards something that she didn\u2019t really want. But the opportunity was there.\nI hadn\u2019t seen a shift in the type of material she had been presented until \u201cShowgirl.\u201d Now, it is incredible. The opportunities that she has and where she is going to go from this is fantastic. I think it pushed people who were curious about what they think she could accomplish. The documentary wasn\u2019t meant to prove her as an actress. She\u2019s proved that she\u2019s got the chops to do it.\nSo she\u2019s going to be acting more, right?\nIt\u2019s very safe to say that you\u2019ll be seeing her on the big screen for some time.\nWhat did you think of Hulu\u2019s \u201cPam and Tommy\u201d series?\nI feel like the more people that are talking about Pamela, it just helps us accomplish our mission. I don\u2019t really have any thoughts on the series itself. We just tend to take what we see and move forward, and that\u2019s my thought on it.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

      "text": "Meet the nepo baby with a very famous father who is forging an impressive career AWAY from Hollywood\n- Hannah, 36, was born to acclaimed actor Tom and his wife Jillie Mack\n- She credits her famous parents for helping her find 'her own path'\n- READ MORE: Tom Selleck looks almost unrecognizable in new pictures\nHannah Selleck, the daughter of beloved A-list actor Tom Selleck and his wife, actress Jillie Mack, has established a career worlds away from the bright lights of Hollywood.\nBorn in December, 1988, she was introduced to the saddle aged four years old.\nNow, at the age of 36, Hannah is a successful international show jumper and owner of a boutique training operation in California.\n'My passion was horses and I knew then that horses was what I wanted to pursue,' she said in a 2013 campaign with Reviver. '[My dad] has always been very supportive of my riding and so has my mom.\n'My mom is amazing. She comes to nearly every show and is always at the ring videotaping my rounds. I wouldn't be where I am today without all their love and support.'\nHere, FEMAIL looks into Hannah's privileged early start, her impressive feats, and the life-altering hurdles she has faced along the way.\nHannah's love for horses began at an early age largely thanks to her parents raising her on the sprawling 65-acre avocado ranch in Ventura County, California, which they purchased in 1988.\nMom Jillie said of their decision to move to the enormous estate was spurred by Hannah's birth.\nTom Selleck shares daughter Hannah Selleck with his wife Jillie Mack (pictured in 2010)\nHannah, 36, is a successful international show jumper and owner of a training operation in California\n'We both thought it was the best environment for her to grow up,' she told People in 2012, and she was certainly right.\nSix years after her introduction to the saddle, Hannah went pro at the age of 10.\nAnd, in the years since she has received an amalgamation of titles, including the United States Equestrian Federation Hunt Medal Finals Reserve Champion in 2007 and numerous top 10 finishes in international show jumping.\nHannah previously told Sidelines magazine that instead of the Hollywood lifestyle her 'very private' parents encouraged her to find her 'own path.'\nAs a teenager, she tried her hand at ice skating, ballet, soccer and gymnastics. In college she took all but one acting class and described getting up on stage as 'terrifying.'\nAfter leaving university with a degree in communications, she accepted a summer internship at a public relations firm in Beverly Hills but found that she didn't like 'being inside from 9 to 6.'\nIt was then that she decided to ride full-time.\nNow, she is the proud owner of Descanso Farm, in Thousand Oaks, California, which brands itself a 'boutique training and sales operation,' as well as a 'world class breeding operation.'\nHannah's love for horses began early and she was first introduced to the saddle at four\nShe went pro aged 10 and decided to pursue show jumping full time after college\nAccording to the website, the Loyola Marymount University graduate focuses on 'the development of top-quality sale horses and the advancement of horses' show careers.'\nAlthough she's cemented herself as an established and decorated rider, Hannah's journey hasn't been completely smooth sailing.\nSeven years ago, she suffered an accident which took a huge mental and physical toll.\nRecalling the trying time in an interview with real estate agent Jenna Steffens Mayer, she said: 'The worst time was probably in 2018, when I broke my leg really badly.\n'Two years later, got all the hardware taken out and got a nerve disease, so dealing with the mental game with that.'\nDespite the injury, Hannah revealed that she was able to come back to a higher level than she had been at before, which she described as 'rewarding.'\nHannah was encouraged by her 'very private' parents to find her 'own path'\nLike her mom and dad, she keeps her personal life to herself. It's not known whether she is dating\nThe road to recovery wasn't easy though, but yoga and working with a psychologist helped her through.\nShe explained: 'There's a lot of fear, and you have to unravel that and find a way to work through it.'\nA broken leg isn't all that Hannah has battled with health-wise.\nWhen she was just four years old, she was hospitalized with viral pneumonia.\nAt the time, her dad had just landed a role in Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, opposite Marlon Brando.\n'We got Hannah home, and then I went, but I didn't like that,' Tom recalled of the stressful period.\n'But it wasn't worth it. It was never going to be worth it. And I said, this is crazy. I quit Magnum really, to have a family, and now I'm jumping at every movie that comes along.'\nFollowing the film, he took a three-year hiatus from acting to focus on being a present father to Hannah, and his adopted son, Kevin Shepard, from his first marriage to model Jacqueline Ray.\nTom previously said it was important that he was a hands-on father. 'I've always treasured the balance between work and time with my family,' he once told People.\n'It's always about them.'\nDespite keeping a distance from the media, Hannah has stepped out with her parents on an array of high-profile celebrity events over the years.\nHannah was born to actors tom and Jillie in 1988 (pictured in London in 1995)\nShe joined her parents on the red carpet for the 52nd Creative Arts Emmy Awards in 2000\nThe trio also attended the 56th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 2004\nHer first red carpet was the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 2000.\nAs a teen, she also appeared with her parents at The 56th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 2004 and the 31st Annual People's Choice Awards in 2005.\nWhen she's not busy riding or working at her expansive stables, Hannah is an avid traveler and loves to globetrot.\nIn recent weeks, she has holidayed in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, sharing snaps of the shenanigans on her Instagram profile, where she has 36.2k followers.\nWhile Hannah's social media feed is typically made up of professional photos from her show jumping events, she does occasionally post pictures taken from photoshoots and glitzy nights out.\nAlthough she is not often in the limelight, in 2022, she watched the Beach Polo World Cup in sunny Miami Beach with her friend, actress, Anna Kendrick.\nNot much is known about Hannah's love life.\nShe previously dated polo player Nic Roldan, 42, and they were pictured together in 2021 and 2022.\nIt is not clear whether the two are still together."

Email ayaat.yassin-kassab@mailonline.co.uk\nThe long-awaited reboot of The Naked Gun franchise has landed with a bang, receiving a flood of glowing reviews ahead of its official release today with many critics calling it the 'funniest film of the year'.\nStarring Liam Neeson as the hapless detective and Pamela Anderson as the sultry blonde with a suspiciously criminal past, the spoof comedy has drawn praise for its ludicrous tone, gags and over-the-top set pieces.\nDaily Mail reviewer Brian Viner gave the slapstick flick a contented four-star review, and sung the praises of leading man Neeson.\n'Some of the physical comedy has echoes of peak Inspector Clouseau, and it's a lovely surprise to find that Neeson has it in him,' he wrote.\nOther reviewers have labelled the film 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'outrageous' and 'stupid' but in a tone of admiration rather than disdain. The absurdity, it seems, is what lends the flick its charm.\nThe punchy sequel is being hailed as a much-needed revival of a style of comedy that has all but disappeared from modern cinema - a broad, self-aware genre that doesn't take itself too seriously.\nThe long-awaited reboot of The Naked Gun franchise has landed with a bang, receiving a flood of glowing reviews ahead of its official release tomorrow\nThe punchy sequel is being hailed as a much-needed revival of a style of comedy that has all but disappeared from modern cinema\nWhile some have quibbled over a slump in pacing towards the end, or questioned whether Neeson lives up to the late Leslie Nielsen, most have emerged from early screenings delighted.\nDirector Akiva Schaffer, best known for Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, faced the daunting task of rebooting a beloved franchise with a fresh twist.\nAnd while not every critic was wholly convinced, the consensus is he has largely pulled it off.\nRobbie Collin, chief film critic at The Telegraph, was particularly effusive. 'The Naked Gun is the stupidest film I've ever seen,' he wrote. 'I loved it.'\nHe added that the film made him 'physically crumple in my seat on multiple occasions', calling it so funny that it rendered much of the rest of his review needless.\nWriting in The Times, Ed Potton found Neeson and Anderson 'irresistible', noting that Neeson 'has comic timing, presence, even spoof cops need to look and sound like cops, and chemistry with his femme fatale, Beth (a game Pamela Anderson).\n'Most importantly he has the ability to keep a straight face through an absolute cavalcade of sight gags, groan-worthy puns and weapons-grade buffoonery.'\nPeter Bradshaw, reviewing for The Guardian, did acknowledge that Neeson may lack 'Nielsen's eerie innocence', but insisted this did little to dampen the film's appeal.\nReviewers have labelled the film 'silly', 'ridiculous', 'outrageous' and 'stupid' but in a tone of admiration rather than disdain\nThe spoof comedy stars Liam Neeson as the hapless detective and Pamela Anderson as the sultry blonde with a suspiciously criminal past\nHe described it as 'amiably ridiculous, refreshingly shallow, entirely pointless and guilelessly crass.'\nAt Variety, Owen Gleiberman struck a more measured tone. While he found 'a handful of jokes that are delirious', he felt the reboot didn't quite live up to the comic heights of the original.\n'The new Naked Gun, by contrast, is amusing,' he wrote. 'What it won't do the way these movies once used to is shock you into laughter.'\nHe was also less convinced by Neeson in the lead role, writing: 'Neeson, game as he is to be used as a glowering found object, is not a natural comedian, and you can feel that. His Drebin doesn't flow the way Nielsen's did.'\nBut others were far more generous with their praise. Rachel Leishman at The Mary Sue called it 'one of the funniest movies in recent history', adding: 'It is just what I have been missing with comedies. The Naked Gun is one of my favourite movies of 2025.'\nDavid Gonzalez of The Cinematic Reel described it as 'one of the most audacious comedies in years, one that evoked the biggest laughs of any press screening I've ever attended.'\nJoey Magidson, writing for Awards Radar, agreed, saying: 'It's the funniest film of the year. The flick achieves what few comedies these days even attempt.'\nOther critics were more cautious, but nonetheless appreciated the film's presence in a barren comedic landscape.\nWhile some have quibbled over a slump in pacing towards the end, or questioned whether Neeson lives up to the late Leslie Nielsen, most have emerged from early screenings delighted\nDirector Akiva Schaffer, best known for Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, faced the daunting task of rebooting a beloved franchise with a fresh twist\nSome critics were cautious, but nonetheless appreciated the film's presence in a barren comedic landscape\n'The big-screen comedy has grown almost nonexistent lately,' said Jake Coyle at the Associated Press.\n'So it would be easy to hail The Naked Gun as something better than it is, since it simply existing is cause for celebration.'\nAttention was focused on whether director Akiva Schaffer had succeeded in staying true to the franchise's roots.\n'Akiva Schaffer's The Naked Gun really is The Naked Gun, not some halfhearted rehash or itemized nostalgia checklist,' wrote William Bibbiani at TheWrap.\nHe also praised Pamela Anderson's comic performance, adding: 'Matching Neeson joke for joke is Pamela Anderson\u2026 reminding us that she is, and always was, a skilled comedian.'\nAidan Kelley at Collider declared it 'arguably just as funny as the first three', and 'one of the most consistently funny films of 2025.'\nBut David Rooney, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, did express concerns over pacing, noting that 'the movie kind of stalls midway as Schaffer struggles to balance the gags with the action of an overly elaborate crime plot.'\nNevertheless, he concluded that 'there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to keep nostalgic fans of the earlier films happy and maybe make some new converts.'\nAttention was focused on whether director Akiva Schaffer had succeeded in staying true to the franchise's roots\nRobbie Collin, chief film critic at The Telegraph, wrote: 'The Naked Gun is the stupidest film I've ever seen - I loved it'\nSiddhant Adlakha at Inverse found the film's attention to visual and background gags impressive.\n'The frame is filled with stealth jokes at every turn, extending far into the background, even out of focus,' he wrote.\n'There's barely a shot or line of dialogue that isn't a joke, and the film has a stunning (and eye-watering) success rate.'\nAs for the film's handling of heavier themes, he remarked: 'The film's approach to heavy political themes is as serious as a whoopee cushion.'\nDavid Ehrlich at IndieWire said: 'While I wish the whole thing could have been even denser with throwaway sight gags and liminal ADR soundbites\u2026 every comic set piece is a total home run.\n'The Naked Gun is almost objectively the funniest movie of the year.'\nMichael Balderston of What to Watch noted that 'not every joke is going to land for everyone', but praised the film's consistency.\n'You won't go more than a minute or two without some kind of joke or Easter egg, and a good majority of them will break through to at least earn a chuckle, while a solid number earned true laugh-out-loud moments for me.'\nWhile star Neeson was the subject of most reviews, leading lady Pamela Anderson caught the eye of critics\nEven with its imperfections, the overall consensus suggests that The Naked Gun reboot may well be the comedy antidote cinema-goers didn't know they needed\nHe was also among several reviewers to comment on the whopping task of replacing Leslie Nielsen.\n'It's a near-impossible task for anyone to take the mantle from Nielsen, whose deadpan delivery and pseudo-seriousness were perfect for these movies,' he acknowledged.\n'Neeson does about as good as anyone could, though.'\nOn the film's final act, he added: 'The jokes in the final act of the movie aren't as consistently strong\u2026 as it puts a little more focus on action and making sure the thin plot gets wrapped up.'\nWhile star Neeson was the subject of most reviews, leading lady Pamela Anderson caught the eye of critics.\nPete Hammond of Deadline praised Anderson's performance in particular, saying she 'matches [Neeson] line for line in reeling off the noirish dialogue.'\nAllison Rose at FlickDirect, though, was less charmed, remarking: 'There were times when the movie turned boring, even though it was only 85 minutes long.'\nEven with its imperfections, the overall consensus suggests that The Naked Gun reboot may well be the comedy antidote cinema-goers didn't know they needed."

Because I just didn't know.\n'I did not want to emulate the wonderful Leslie Nielsen, but the only thing I grabbed from him, was, 'Be serious. Don't try to be funny. Just stick to being a serious cop who is a bit of a doofus.'\nThe two could not keep their hands off each other when at Cineworld Leicester Square\nThe Taken actor also admitted he wasn't sure if he was funny enough for The Naked Gun, which also stars Paul Walter Hauser and Danny Huston.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Neeson said: 'During the whole shoot \u2014 I'm being very honest \u2014 I still did not know, when we wrapped at the end of each working day, whether it was working for me.\n'Pamela, Paul, Danny, everybody else, I thought, were very funny. I just couldn't put a verdict on myself, on my own performance.\n'I'd always ask Akiva, \"Are you sure it's working?\" That continued from day one till we finished.'"
