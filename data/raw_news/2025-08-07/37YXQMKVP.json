  "content": "Sir Keir Starmer's lead over Nigel Farage as \"best prime minister\" has halved in three months, new polling shows. The YouGov survey found that 35% of Britons say Sir Keir would be a better premier than the Reform UK leader. Meanwhile, 28% picked the Clacton MP over the current PM. It marks an eight-point drop in Sir Keir's lead since the question was last asked in May when it was 44% to 29%.\n\nMr Farage was backed by respondents over Tory leader Kemi Badenoch by 23% to 21% in their head-to-head. Meanwhile, Sir Keir was 10 points ahead of Mrs Badenoch 30% to 20% respectively. When given a choice between the Reform UK leader and Jeremy Corbyn, who is set to launch a new political party, Mr Farage had a narrow lead with 30% to 29%. Meanwhile, Sir Keir beat the veteran left-winger by 27% to 22%.\n\nMr Farage scored highest when respondents were asked who would make a good PM. The Brexiteer was backed by 24% of respondents, compared to 8% for Mrs Badenoch, 19% for Mr Corbyn and 11% for Deputy PM Angela Rayner. Just 9% said Sir Keir has been a good prime minister so far, with 55% saying he has been poor or terrible.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
