  "description": "Gaming mice come in all shapes, sizes, and price brackets, so it's important to pick the right one that ticks all the boxes.",
  "content": "Knowing how to buy the right gaming PC is crucial, but once you\u2019ve spent all that money on an outstanding rig, it\u2019s easy to overlook your peripherals. I know \u2014 I was in the same boat for years, ignoring my headset, mouse, and keyboard in favor of buying a better GPU. These days, I know better, and I\u2019m here to tell you everything I\u2019ve learned.\n\nA gaming mouse might seem like an inconsequential purchase, but it can truly make or break your gameplay. Below, I\u2019ll break down everything you need to know about picking the right mouse, and leave you with some recommendations of my own so that you can buy the best gaming mouse for your needs.\n\nFirst and foremost, let\u2019s talk about the type of mouse you\u2019ll be buying. This is your most basic first choice to make, and it depends entirely on the type of games you play as well as what else you\u2019re going to use this mouse for.\n\nSome mice, like the Razer Naga V2 Pro with its countless programmable buttons, are strictly for gamers. Others, like the Logitech Lightspeed G305, are more lightweight and versatile, meaning they\u2019ll serve you well in games and for work, if you ever need to do that.\n\nThen, there are vertical mice. Using those for games is tricky, and in all honesty, I can\u2019t imagine playing competitive esports titles with a vertical mouse. They typically have a much lower dots per inch (DPI), making them less responsive in fast-paced scenarios. However \u2014 and I speak from experience here \u2014 they can be a godsend if you\u2019re dealing with wrist pain. These days, I use a vertical mouse during the day, for work, and switch to my gaming mouse when the day is over.\n\nThe key is to think about what you\u2019ll actually be doing most of the time. If you mainly play shooters, a lightweight mouse with a high DPI sensor will serve you better than a button-heavy MMO mouse. On the other hand, if you\u2019re like me and somehow you\u2019re still in your World of Warcraft phase, those extra buttons are so, so, so good.\n\nChoosing the right type kind of sets the foundation for everything else here. No matter the features, the size, or the shape, if you don\u2019t pick the mouse that suits your lifestyle, you might have some regrets. I know I had.\n\nNext, the size and the weight. Let\u2019s not beat around the bush \u2014 it\u2019s critical that your new mouse just feels good in your hand. If your palm is too big or too small for any given mouse, you\u2019ll certainly feel it. These kinds of mismatches show up in gameplay, as you simply won\u2019t be able to react fast enough compared to what you\u2019d be able to do with the right-sized mouse. They also catch up to you eventually in the form of wrist or hand pain.\n\nGrip type matters, too. Palm grip players usually need a larger, more supportive mouse to keep their whole hand comfortable, while claw grip users do better with mid-sized designs. Fingertip grip players, on the other hand, often prefer smaller, lighter mice that let them move with minimal effort. If you\u2019re not sure about your grip and palm size, it\u2019s a good idea to go to a local store and just try how different mice feel in your hand.\n\nOutside of size and shape, which are both highly individual factors, weight plays a part. Lighter mice, often dipping under 60 grams, are popular among competitive first-person shooter (FPS) games, as they make it easier to whip around quickly without losing time (and hurting your wrist). Heavier mice are more stable to control, especially at a higher DPI.\n\nSome mice are weight-adjustable. They often have a hidden little compartment at the bottom with a weight inside. You can remove it to make the mouse lighter, or add it in to make it steadier and heavier. Some mice, like the aforementioned Razer Naga V2 Pro, are just super heavy all on their own, which is why it\u2019s important to avoid those if you\u2019re into fast-paced titles.\n\nI still stand by the opinion that the weight and the shape are the most important things in a mouse \u2014 after all, if it\u2019s uncomfortable, you simply can\u2019t use it for long, even if you should wish to. However, spec-wise, the sensor is the single most important part of any gaming mouse.\n\nThe sensor is what makes your movements feel fluid and precise. It measures how far the mouse moves across a surface and translates that movement into DPI (also known as CPI), which controls how much your on-screen cursor moves for each inch of physical movement. The higher the DPI, the faster the cursor can move, and if you\u2019re not used to it, a high DPI can make a mouse feel completely out of control. Those who know how to make the most of it, though, can become true gaming beasts when they find a good mouse.\n\nDPI numbers on gaming mice vary \u2026 wildly, to be honest. You\u2019ll find mice marketed as \u201cgaming\u201d with a DPI of 3,000, and then you\u2019ll find variants with a DPI over 40,000. Realistically, many people will never need 40,000-plus DPI. What matters isn\u2019t just the max DPI, but also whether the sensor tracks consistently at the speeds and sensitivities you use. The best mice won\u2019t skip or jitter and will feel even, no matter what you do.\n\nPolling rate is another thing to watch. Most modern gaming mice still default to 1,000Hz, which means the mouse reports its position every millisecond. That\u2019s already more than fast enough for the vast majority of players, delivering smooth and responsive performance across just about any game. Some newer, high-end models push to 4,000Hz or even 8,000Hz, which can feel slightly smoother on a high-refresh display.\n\nPicking between a wired vs. wireless mouse is one of those \u201cno going back\u201d things. I was perfectly happy with a wired mouse for gaming for years and years \u2014 after all, they were widely known as more stable \u2014 until I tried wireless. Now? I absolutely can\u2019t see myself going back.\n\nThese days, wireless mice have caught up in terms of how reliable their connections are, but not all connections are created equal. Bluetooth is fine for everyday use, but it\u2019s not ideal for gaming. It adds latency, which is pretty much the last thing you want in a gaming setup, ever. Look for mice that have a 2.4GHz connection with a USB dongle.\n\nBattery life and battery type are another thing. Most mice will last for 40-60 hours on a single charge, but it all depends on usage. Some mice still take AA or AAA batteries instead of letting you plug them in to recharge, which can be annoying, expensive, and not eco-friendly, but you can get around that by buying rechargeable batteries.\n\nMice, gaming and otherwise, always come with the basics when it comes to buttons: left, right, a scroll wheel, and usually a pair of side buttons for quick actions. This is often enough for many titles, especially shooters and MOBAs, which only have a few abilities to use at a time. However, more involved games \u2014 especially MMOs \u2014 call for mice with extra buttons.\n\nSome mice, like the Razer Naga or the Corsair Scimitar, cram a full keypad onto the side, giving you a dozen or more programmable buttons. Razer also has HyperShift, which lets you essentially bind two things to the same button; for one, you use Shift as a modifier. Razer Naga also lets you swap between different sideplates, which means you can turn it from a basic mouse into the MMO mouse of your dreams.\n\nFor most players, the sweet spot usually lies at around two to eight programmable buttons. Remember that adding more buttons adds weight, so those 12+ button mice are not ideal for FPS games.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I know that it\u2019s all too easy to overlook your mouse and settle for something cheap. I got by for years, buying $10 mouse after $10 mouse, without thinking much of it. However, in the last few years, I realized that it\u2019s much better to spend your peripheral budget somewhat evenly.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a casual gamer and the most competitive game you play is Stardew Valley, build quality, DPI, and battery life (if wireless) all make a difference. I\u2019m not saying you should buy the priciest gaming mouse there is \u2014 far from that. However, with prices ranging from $10 to just south of $200, it\u2019s hard to find that sweet spot.\n\nIf you want a high-quality mouse for whatever game you play, I\u2019d say you can usually find them in the $70 to $120 price bracket. Anything above that is often overkill, and anything below it might not cut it. With that said, there are some really good budget gaming mice out there, and I\u2019ll show you them below.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best gaming mouse to buy in 2025?\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve tested many different mice, and many fell kind of short of that special \u201csomething\u201d for me. I ultimately settled for a combo of the Razer Naga V2 Pro, which I continuously recommend after nearly two years of usage. It\u2019s a fantastic mouse, and with swappable side plates, it\u2019s fit for every gamer. Mind you, it\u2019s on the heavier side. You can buy it for $175 on Amazon.\n\nI\u2019m also a fan of two Logitech mice, and one is actually super cheap. The G305 Lightspeed is lightweight, fast, and feels good in a small to medium hand. It also comes in a range of fun colors, which I love. You can pick it up for $29 while on sale, and $50 when not on sale, on Amazon.\n\nI love the Logitech G502 Hero, too. It\u2019s a more robust mouse, with more buttons and a more gamer-like style, plus twice the DPI. I found it on sale now, too, for just $43 at Amazon (normally $70).\n\nFor those fast-paced titles where it\u2019s important to have a lightweight mouse, the SteelSeries Aerox 5 Wireless is another favorite of mine. It weighs just 74 grams and has a powerful sensor. With this mouse, you\u2019ll have to blame it on the lag if you lose a game, because the mouse won\u2019t be the problem \u2014 at least in my experience. This one is pricier, currently $98 at Amazon, down from $170.\n\nWe also have a full guide to the best gaming mice, so make sure to check that out as a starting point.\n\nWhat should I consider when buying a gaming mouse?\n\nStart by thinking about your playstyle. Do you need an MMO mouse with lots of buttons, or a lightweight mouse for FPS games? Then, consider your grip type, and thus your desired mouse size and shape. Lastly, look into things like DPI or CPI and the number of programmable buttons.\n\nYes, 4,000 DPI is more than good enough for gaming. In fact, most players never go that high, and many competitive gamers use settings between 400 and 1,600 DPI because lower sensitivity means that you get a lot of control over the mouse. At high DPIs, the mouse flies across the screen with the slightest movement. Personally, I tend to use a higher DPI when not gaming, strangely enough, and scale back when playing competitively.\n\nYes, 26,000 DPI is most likely overkill. Many modern mice advertise ultra-high DPI numbers to grab attention, but you\u2019ll almost never use them in practice. At 26,000 DPI, even the smallest movement would fling your cursor across the screen and make it almost impossible to control. Most gamers stick to a much lower range, usually between 400 and 3,200 DPI, because that offers the best balance of speed and precision.",

      "text": "When you're buying a new gaming mouse, it's not always obvious what to look for. Do you need an ultralight gaming mouse with the fastest sensor? Or do you need a gaming mouse with more buttons? Are dedicated left-handed mice the best, or will an ambidextrous mouse do?\nTo clear out some of the concerns, we've put together a list of the very best gaming mice you can buy in 2025. Whatever you're looking for, from the very high end to the most affordably effective, here are the best gaming mice out there.\nBest mouse for FPS gaming\nLogitech G Pro X Superlight 2\n- Lightweight and nimble\n- Responsive with low latency\n- Up to 95 hours of battery\n- Lacks dedicated DPI switch\n- Not the cheapest\nWhy you should buy this: It\u2019s the best overall gaming mouse you can buy.\nWho it\u2019s for: First-person shooter (FPS) gamers looking for the best\nWhy we chose the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2:\nThe Logitech G Pro X Superlight has long been one of the best lightweight wireless gaming mice on the market. This year, Logitech finally introduced a successor. While maintaining the overall shape and design, the newer version improves on almost every shortcoming of the original. It now comes with a USB-C port, an upgraded sensor, an increased polling rate, hybrid optical-mechanical switches, and improved battery life. It is also lighter at just 60 grams.\nThe new-and-improved Hero 2 sensor now brings in up to 32,000DPI (even though you are never going to game at such high settings) and a maximum speed of 500 IPS. It also supports a polling rate 2,000Hz, which is double of what you get on the original G Pro X Superlight, and the mouse also gets Logitech's new Lightforce hybrid optical/mechanical switches. This makes it an excellent choice for FPS gamers or anyone who is looking for a premium lightweight mouse that offers excellent response.\nBest compact wireless gaming mouse\nPulsar X2V2 Mini\n- Compact, lightweight design\n- Fast and responsive sensor\n- Ambidextrous design\n- Low click latency\n- Might be small for some people\n- Polling rate is limited to 1,000Hz\nWhy you should buy this: You need a reliable, ultralight mobile gaming mouse.\nWho it\u2019s for: Laptop gamers, or gamers who like small mice\nWhy we chose the Pulsar X2V2:\nIf you have smaller hands, or prefer a more compact gaming mouse, the Pulsar X2V2 is hard to beat. It's a super-lightweight, short and squat gaming mouse that offers premium performance and build quality at an affordable price. Its ambidextrous design makes it an excellent choice for both right- and left-handed gamers, and it has a fast and responsive sensor that pairs wonderfully with its slick skates. This is a mouse that's ready for competitive play.\nIt doesn't have a high polling rate, though 1,000Hz is plenty for most gamers. If you want more than that and don't mind a larger version, the standard X2V2 can be upgraded to a 4,000Hz rate. The Mini is the most versatile mouse for smaller-handed gamers, though, and its optical switches are both fast and durable. It's best suited for claw and fingertip gamers.\nBest budget gaming mouse\nCooler Master MM711\n- Dirt cheap\n- Pleasing honeycomb pattern with RGB\n- Lightweight\n- Ambidextrous design\n- May not be suitable for large hands\nWhy you should buy this: A highly affordable, lightweight gaming mouse that is functional and looks good too.\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginners looking for a low-cost option that doesn't compromise on design and performance.\nWhy we chose the Cooler Master MM711:\nThe Cooler Master MM711 is an affordable and proficient gaming mouse option catering to gamers seeking a flashy, lightweight, and practical device. While visually appealing with its honeycomb pattern and polytetrafluoroethylene feet, it features a simple two-button mouse appearance with essential design elements. The emphasis on comfort and customization is evident, with ambidextrous design catering to both left-handed and right-handed users, as well as various grip types.\nThe inclusion of Pixart's PMW3389 sensor means that it offers excellent tracking while the 1000Hz polling rate should ensure a fast and responsive experience. Cooler Master has also incorporated Omron switches for both the left-click and right-click functions, and they are renowned for delivering a comfortable and gratifying clicking sound.\nWeighing just 60 grams, the mouse boasts an Ultraweave cable and RGB lighting, offering a balance between portability and gaming performance. Despite its limited additional buttons, the MM711 excels in simplicity for MOBA or FPS gaming. The accompanying MasterPlus+ software is also quite useful as it enables customization of features, DPI adjustment, and lighting, providing a comprehensive gaming experience. While it may lack ergonomic design for larger hands, the MM711's competitive price of $20 positions it as a reliable choice for beginners entering the PC gaming realm.\nBest MMO gaming mouse\nCorsair Scimitar RGB Elite\n- Variety of customizable buttons\n- Solid constuction\n- Compatible with Windows and Mac\n- Low click latency\n- Slightly bulky\n- Suitable for right-hand users only\n- Has a learning curve\nWhy you should buy this: It's a well-built mouse featuring an array of additional customizable buttons.\nWho it\u2019s for: MMO gamers or anyone who wants a gaming mouse with a ton of buttons.\nWhy we chose the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite:\nThe Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, priced at $80, stands out as the top choice for MMO gaming with its grid of 12 side buttons. The mouse boasts a sturdy construction and features a soft-touch plastic body. The right side incorporates a textured grip, providing an enhanced feel, while on the left, a 12-button side panel adds versatility, allowing you to adjust its position forward or backward according to your hand size. These buttons, featuring varying textures, are easily distinguishable in intense gaming situations.\nIdeal for a claw grip, this mouse accommodates hands of any size. Additionally, it proves comfortable for a fingertip grip, except for those with extra-large hands, and for a palm grip, except for those with smaller hands.\nWith four distinct RGB lighting zones and companion software compatible with Windows, this is also one of the best mice for macOS, and offers extensive customization options. It is notably heavier than most gaming mice at over 120 grams, but that's due to the array of additional customizable buttons. Thankfully it comes with low click latency, and a low liftoff distance. If you don't want to deal with cables, the Scimitar RGB Elite also comes in a wireless version.\nBest wireless gaming mouse\nRazer Deathadder V3 Hyperspeed\n- Incredibly lightweight\n- Accurate and responsive sensor\n- Fast 8,000 Hz polling rate\n- Sturdy build quality\n- Ergonomic design makes it unsuitable for left-handed gamers\n- Smaller size not as well-suited to larger hands\nWhy you should buy this: It's the pinnacle of high-speed, wireless gaming mice.\nWho it\u2019s for: Those who want a no-compromise high-end wireless gaming mouse.\nWhy we chose the Razer Deathadder V3 Hyperspeed:\nWe were already major fans of the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro, so when the Hyperspeed came along and lowered the weight, and the price, in a more compact size with better feet, we were instantly sold. This is an iconic gaming mouse design, but with a modern flavor. Weighing just 55 grams, it's leaner and lighter than its predecessor, and the larger Pro version. The claw grip-friendly design, ergonomic shape, and overall build make it better-suited to smaller hand size than the Pro model, so if you have larger hands, consider that alternative.\nWith a 100-hour battery life and the inclusion of the Razer HyperPolling wireless dongle, it provides excellent wireless performance. Razer is also using its new Focus X 26K optical sensor for enhanced accuracy, while the third-generation Razer optical mouse switches are said to offer a rapid 0.2ms response time and a 90-million-click lifespan.\nWhile tailored for esports professionals, its minimalistic button configuration should suit diverse gaming genres or work tasks. With a price tag of $100, the DeathAdder V3 Pro caters to those seeking a high-performance, no-nonsense gaming tool, and one of the best ergonomic mice available.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDPI, or dots per inch, measures the sensitivity of a gaming mouse, determining how many pixels the cursor moves for each inch the mouse is physically moved. While often emphasized, its importance depends on personal preferences and game types.\nHere's why DPI matters for a gaming mouse:\n- Precision: Higher DPI offers more precise movements, which is crucial for accuracy in games like first-person shooters.\n- Adjustability: Adjustable DPI caters to different gaming scenarios, allowing for fine control or quick, responsive movements.\n- Gaming Styles: Preferences vary; some prefer low DPI for control, while others favor high DPI for agility.\n- Large Monitors: Higher DPI benefits those with larger monitors or higher resolutions, covering more screen with less movement.\n- Personal Comfort: Ultimately, DPI importance is subjective; personal comfort dictates its significance.\nAlthough many gaming mice tout sensors with extremely high DPI figures, we\u2019re telling you now: You\u2019ll never use anything above 4,000 DPI. In fact, most pro gamers play at 400 DPI to 800 DPI, with the goal being longer swoops for the same in-game movement, allowing you to take aim with much higher accuracy. This is also why 60% and 65% keyboards are so popular among gamers: They give the player much more space for mousing around without a numpad in the way.\nBut don\u2019t take that to mean you should ignore all these high-DPI mice. Rather, take the high DPI number as the maker vouching for its sensor\u2019s performance, as high-DPI mice generally have better tracking, zero pointer acceleration, adjustable or pre-optimized liftoff distance, and most importantly, they are capable of high-speed sweeps while maintaining accurate tracking, something that\u2019s important when playing at much lower DPI settings.\nThis one\u2019s really a matter of cost, but generally, our preference goes to wireless mice. It used to be that wireless gaming mice suffered in performance compared to their tethered counterparts due to slow communications and interference, but that\u2019s no longer the case thanks to radio developments over the last few years. Wireless mice today perform as well as, if not better than their wired counterparts due to not having to drag a cable around. The flip side is that they cost more, need to be charged (especially if they have RGB), and tend to weigh a little more, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the costs.\n(However, you're more likely to need to unlock a wireless mouse if your computer locks up.)\nIf you\u2019re an MMORPG gamer, then the answer to this is a resounding yes. But other than that, most gamers should focus on finding a mouse with a comfortable shape, excellent sensor, and light weight, as these will help better your performance more than having buttons that you don\u2019t use. Because, remember, those buttons add complexity and weight, which will slow you down when aiming down sights.\nIt is also recommended that you invest in a quality mouse pad for seamless gliding. For optimal gaming performance, consider a compact keyboard with a TKL layout and a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor. To enhance your advantage in competitive games, target a powerful PC capable of achieving higher frame rates that prioritizes performance over visual aesthetics.\nIf you're gaming on the go, make sure you know how to connect a wireless mouse to your laptop before the game starts."

      "text": "A gaming PC is a big investment \u2014 and in the case of a gaming desktop PC, it can be a big piece of equipment, too. That\u2019s why consulting a comprehensive gaming PC buying guide like this one is a great way to figure out what you need and where you should focus your budget. Between your graphics card, processor, RAM, and storage, there\u2019s a lot to consider, but not all of it requires the same level of investment. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to show you how to buy a gaming desktop.\nPutting together a gaming rig for the first time is daunting, but it doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. As long as you know what to look for and where to look for it, you can buy the pre-built gaming PC of your dreams or even build your own gaming rig. Either way, with our know-how, you\u2019ll surely end up with a gaming PC that fulfills all your wants and needs.\nHow big a PC do you want?\nMost gamers start with the hardware inside a computer. We\u2019ll cover that soon enough, but before we get there, let\u2019s talk about the overall build\u2019s shape, size, and form factor.\nGaming computers now come in many shapes and sizes. There are small systems such as the Alienware Aurora 16, monstrously massive systems like the CLX Hathor, and a wide range of options in between.\nSmall systems can be incredibly compact and unobtrusive, and fit where larger systems simply can\u2019t. They\u2019re ideal for gamers who lack a large desk or want to use the PC in a home theater. Going small can limit future upgrade options, however, and some pint-sized PCs make a lot of noise due to their limited space for cooling. They\u2019re usually based around the Mini-ITX form factor, so they require motherboards and cases of that same specification. You can even build a small form factor (SFF) PC to replace your console.\nMid-towers are a good compromise and are ideal for most people. They\u2019re small enough to fit under, on, or in a typical desk, yet large enough to offer upgradability and acceptable cooling. You\u2019ll need to pay a little extra for glass side panels and fancy color schemes, but you\u2019ll already know whether that\u2019s something you care about. These tend to be based around Micro-ATX or ATX designs, so you\u2019ll need a motherboard and case compatible with those design specifications.\nFinally, we come to the monoliths known as full towers. These are often placed under the desk rather than on it due to their sheer size, but that\u2019s not always the case.\nA full-tower system may carry a slight price premium over a mid-tower. But they are exceedingly easy to work with because they have enough space for anything you want to put in them, including your hands, which can be super helpful if you have large mitts.\nSome custom manufacturers, such as Origin and CyberPower, offer a selection of cases during customization. A full tower is the easiest to grip and work with, but make sure you know its dimensions beforehand. If desktop space is important, but you\u2019re not totally comfortable working within a cramped area, opt for a mid-tower.\nThere are smaller options, but they are harder to modify, typically louder, and don\u2019t necessarily support all of your hardware choices. Furthermore, small form factor cases get hot, so keep that in mind if you plan on running demanding games or if you want to venture into overclocking.\nThe processor makes a big difference\nWhen you buy a gaming desktop, whether it\u2019s one you built yourself, a custom gaming rig, or a premade model from Dell or HP, the processor will be the first specification you see \u2014 and for good reason. The processor determines how a system will perform in most software.\nThe processor core count is a major consideration. Options range between two and 24 cores in the mainstream space, although two-core CPUs are pretty much obsolete at this point, and AMD doesn\u2019t offer 24-core options. For the tightest of budgets, a four-core chip should be as low as you go, as you really need at least that many for baseline performance in most modern games. Fortunately, you can get super affordable CPUs like the Core i3-12100F or AMD Ryzen 5500 if you want a cheap PC for casual gaming.\nFor more powerful (and expensive) builds, there are some amazingly affordable mainstream CPUs in 2025. The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still one of the best gaming CPUs right now, although it\u2019s last-gen. The newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D provides a great alternative, and the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is pretty much the best you can get right now. On the Intel side, you can buy the Core i5-13600K as an affordable option, or the Core i7-14700K as an optimal CPU for gaming and most tasks.\nCheck out our best Intel CPU and best AMD CPU roundups for more in-depth information.\nWhen it comes to AMD vs. Intel, AMD tends to offer better value throughout the pricing spectrum, as well as much better efficiency. Its X3D CPUs hold the gaming crown, too. Intel has had a rough couple of years due to various stability issues with the Raptor Lake generation, but on the midrange to lower end, Intel\u2019s CPUs are stable and affordable. They also offer a better blend of productivity and gaming capability.\nFor a deeper dive into the best bang-for-your-buck CPUs, check our in-depth guide.\nA powerful graphics card is a must\nWhen building or buying a gaming PC, the graphics card is where you should pay the most attention. It\u2019s the component with the biggest hand in beautifying your games, spitting out high frame rates, making it possible to play higher resolutions, like 4K, and enabling higher-end visual features, like ray tracing.\nModel numbers tell you much of the story here, with higher numbered cards typically meaning more performance, though there are some caveats there, and overclocked models from third-party GPU partners can close performance gaps between versions. The RTX 5070 Ti is faster than the 5070 but not as fast as the 5080, for example.\nFor casual gaming at 1080p, affordable graphics cards like Intel Arc B580 or the AMD RX 9060 XT are great buys, while you\u2019ll want something like the RX 9070 (XT or non-XT) or the RTX 5070 to RTX 5070 Ti to play at 1440p. Comfortable gaming at 4K continues to be demanding, which also means expensive. You\u2019ll need an RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 5080 for that, and if you have an unlimited budget, the RTX 5090 is the best you can get. When it comes to AMD cards, the last-gen RX 7900 XTX still does a good job of handling 4K gameplay.\nAlthough higher-end cards show diminishing returns \u2014 the \u201csweet spot\u201d is around $500-$700, where the RX 9070 XT, the RTX 5070, and the RTX 5070 Ti sit \u2014 they will still show performance scaling in most games. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should spend more on a GPU, however. It\u2019s important to consider the game you want to play before setting a GPU budget.\nIt\u2019s generally a good idea to opt for newer cards, which in this case are Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50 and RTX 40 series, or AMD\u2019s RX 7000 and RX 9000.\nVideo memory (or VRAM) is often confusing in graphics cards. It\u2019s easy to determine how much system RAM you need, but GPUs are a little harder to determine. You may find yourself with a choice between two cards that are similar but offer different VRAM amounts. Not having enough VRAM means that the GPU needs to tap into system RAM to run your games, which is drastically slower and may result in throttling or crashes. Newer games are also starting to demand more than 8GB at a minimum, so you\u2019ll want to buy a card with more if you\u2019re upgrading in 2025 and want to play the top AAA games in the coming years.\nIf you\u2019re stuck choosing between AMD or Nvidia, the latter is known for better ray tracing performance. Nvidia also offers DLSS 3 and 4, which are upscaling technologies that generate extra frames to improve your frames per second (fps). AMD has comparable tech in FSR 3, but it\u2019s not widely available right now. However, AMD tends to give you better bang for your buck, although many graphics cards are currently overpriced.\nBoth companies\u2019 drivers offer input lag reduction software and image sharpening for improving the look of your games.\nFor more tips on GPU buying, check out our guide to the best graphics cards.\nDon\u2019t waste money on unnecessary RAM\nWe\u2019ve tested gaming PCs with up to 64GB of RAM, and it\u2019s completely wasted. Even in the most demanding of sim games, 32GB is plenty. It\u2019s kind of the current gold standard, with 16GB slowly being too little, although budget systems can certainly make do with that much.\nMemory is one of the easiest things to upgrade later \u2014 and one of the most affordable. So just get enough for now, and get more later if you need to.\nBut keep this in mind: System memory isn\u2019t only used by games. Everything running on your PC requires memory, from the operating system to your mouse and keyboard drivers. If Destiny 2 alone uses 6GB of system memory while it\u2019s running, you need ample memory available for everything else. This is why developers recommend higher amounts, so your PC has room to breathe while the game remains active.\nThe only instances where more than 32GB of RAM will benefit you are productivity applications like video editors. There 64GB and more can still be useful, so look up your particular app in question to see what you might want to get to accelerate some of its functions.\nMake sure your configuration comes with at least two sticks. Some gaming desktops advertise 8GB of RAM but only include a single 8GB stick. Two sticks will allow you to take advantage of dual-channel memory on most motherboards, which effectively doubles the data transfer speed versus a single stick. Mind you, 8GB is really not enough in 2025, so aim for at least 16GB.\nYou also probably want to be using DDR5, as it\u2019s more future-proofed and offers better performance, but if your gaming PC pre-build comes with DDR4, it won\u2019t make a huge difference, and you can either upgrade it later, or that\u2019s the fastest your system can support anyway.\nSSDs are (almost) all you need\nMost computers sold today come with a small NVMe SSD and either a larger SATA SSD or an older hard drive for longer-term storage. With the low price of SSDs today, you don\u2019t need to really be concerned about using hard drives outside of massive video and photo storage. For game libraries, Windows installations, and more, SSDs are affordable and offer much better performance.\nA 1TB SSD is enough to store Windows and most of your games, and it will make a huge difference to how your PC feels and how fast your games load. But you can get larger 2TB or even 4TB models that offer better performance and much more storage space for your game libraries. They should also last longer, with much higher TBW (terabytes written) ratings.\nWith a decent SSD under the hood, Windows should boot and be ready to use in under 30 seconds. Most modern games should load in 10-20 seconds, though heavier sim titles might take longer on slower SSDs.\nMost modern SSDs are based on the slim M.2 NVMe standard, though there are also some older 2.5-inch SATA drives around, which are still useful for larger, more affordable SSD storage drives. They use a SATA 3.0 connection to transfer data, just like traditional hard drives, and require external power from the power supply.\nM.2 SSDs slot into the motherboard and are typically a little more expensive than their 2.5-inch counterparts \u2014 much more expensive at larger capacities. The \u201cM.2\u201d part refers to the form factor, which is a small stick that slots into your motherboard (see the image above for reference). The \u201cNVMe\u201d part refers to the drive using PCI Express instead of SATA for data transfer. PCIe can support much more bandwidth than SATA, making M.2 NVMe drivers faster than their 2.5-inch counterparts.\nNot all M.2 drives use PCIe, however. They can use PCIe or SATA, depending on the specification. Ensure the drive is marked with \u201cNVMe,\u201d like the Samsung 970 Evo drives above.\nWhichever drive you buy, make sure the SSD you choose as your primary storage device contains the operating system. You\u2019ll benefit from quick boot times and fast operation in day-to-day use. This is also why we don\u2019t recommend an SSD with less than 256GB of space. With Windows installed, a small drive can only contain a handful of games.\nIf you need lots of storage space for media or work, consider a secondary hard drive for additional space, with the SSD for Windows and games only.\nCool and quiet\nCooling isn\u2019t directly related to performance, but it can have an impact, as well as the enjoyment you get from your PC. Most AMD CPUs and all graphics cards ship with coolers right out of the box, so if you don\u2019t care about noise levels or keeping components cool for overclocking, you don\u2019t need to think any more about it \u2014 especially if you play with headphones on, where noise isn\u2019t as important.\nYou can find a reasonable solution for CPUs that don\u2019t ship with a cooler for around $30. If you want a whisper-quiet PC and/or want to push it beyond its basic specifications, though, thinking about advanced cooling is a good idea. Big air coolers are some of the most affordable and efficient ways to cool a CPU, though all-in-one water cooling and custom loops are an option, too.\nGraphics cards are a little more complicated, though you can water-cool them. We recommend simply buying a third-party card with a decent custom cooling solution to enable lower noise levels and better performance.\nQuality power is important\nThere are some components that we would recommend you spend a little extra on to get the quality you need. A good power supply (PSU) is a prime example, and we have a list of the best PSUs you can buy on various budgets.\nNever buy a poor PSU; a cheap one can die and take other components with it. The first thing to consider is your wattage. Select a PSU that exceeds your PC\u2019s required wattage by quite a bit, but you don\u2019t need to go crazy (a 650w PSU is perfect for a build rated for 400w, for example).\nAfter, look for an 80 Plus certification. The 80 Plus standard rates PSUs based on their power efficiency, and there are multiple tiers. 80 Plus certified PSUs, for example, are 80% power efficient at average power draw, while 80 Plus Titanium PSUs are 92% power efficient in that same wattage range.\nThe 80 Plus certification simply makes a statement about power efficiency. However, PSUs with an 80 Plus rating generally use better components to earn that rating and deliver the advertised wattage.\nFinally, you\u2019ll find modular, semi-modular, and non-modular PSUs. Non-modular power supplies have all of the cables attached to the PSU itself. Semi-modular PSUs have some essential cables attached \u2014 such as your motherboard\u2019s 24-pin power connector \u2014 but give you detachable cables for other components, such as 8-pin power for your video card. Lastly, modular power supplies come with all the cables detached.\nThe upside of a modular PSU is that you only need to plug in the cables you\u2019re actually going to use, making building and cable management much easier. However, modular PSUs are expensive, sometimes twice as much as their non-modular counterparts. You can save big by opting for a non-modular PSU.\nChoosing a motherboard\nBringing everything together is your motherboard. You don\u2019t want to cheap out here, but you don\u2019t need to go too expensive, either. There are two aspects to consider: the socket and the chipset. Thankfully, the former is easy. Every processor is manufactured to fit in a certain socket \u2014 Ryzen 5000 processors use the AM4 socket, while Intel 14th generation uses LGA 1700, for example \u2014 so you need to make sure your CPU fits the socket on your motherboard. If you\u2019re buying a prebuilt machine, you don\u2019t need to worry about the socket.\nThe chipset is more interesting. Both AMD and Intel offer different chipsets with different features targeting different prices. For example, Intel\u2019s flagship Z790 chipset supports overclocking, while the cheaper H610 chipset does not. Similarly, AMD\u2019s top-end X670E chipset has more PCIe lanes than the cheaper B650 chipset.\nFrankly, there\u2019s almost too much to consider between chipsets. For gaming, the important question is if you want to overclock your processor. AMD supports overclocking on its X- and B-series chipsets, while Intel only supports overclocking on its Z-series chipsets. Otherwise, your motherboard will have almost zero performance impact.\nThere are considerations outside of performance, however. Manufacturers will include different features on their motherboards, such as better networking capabilities or a better sound chip. Furthermore, motherboards come with different levels of expandability (some may come with only two RAM slots, for example). You don\u2019t need to spend a lot on your motherboard, but you should consider overclocking support, expandability, and other features like networking and sound.\nFocus on what matters to you\nWhen setting up your gaming desktop, remember that your gaming ecosystem is a careful balancing act. You have to figure out what you prefer and want from your overall gameplay experience and then invest in the resources to make that happen.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to organize a budget for this, we recommend investing the majority of your budget in the graphics card and the CPU. Those features will make the biggest difference in improving how your game visually looks. From there, reliable and ample storage will make the game run and load faster. While a sleek design or fancy case would look nice, it won\u2019t affect your in-game experience. More memory has its place, but if it\u2019s more than you can use, it won\u2019t do much.\nKeep in mind that this investment is entirely up to you, so build a PC that works for you. If how your PC looks matters to you, then trick it out. Light the PC up and make it look incredible. If you\u2019d rather tweak and overclock, spend some money getting a nicer motherboard and a decent cooler. We recommend spending the bulk of your money on features that will ultimately improve your device\u2019s gaming functions, but the PC should also fit your preferences.\nDon\u2019t forget to check out our step-by-step guide on how to build a PC so that you can put it all together once you\u2019ve bought the parts."

      "text": "It\u2019s been nearly 20 years since I built my first PC. Those first attempts were shaky, scary, and of course, very budget-oriented, but I was immediately hooked. But PC building is an expensive hobby, so in my chase for the best graphics cards and top-shelf processors, I always neglected my peripherals.\nYears later, I\u2019ve learned my lesson, and I know now that finding some balance between loading up on components and ignoring them in favor of expensive peripherals is important. Here are the three upgrades I splurged on in the last couple of years, and why I think you should do the same.\nHigh-quality gaming mouse\nBefore I ever entertained the idea of building my own PC, I was already a gamer. I started gaming when I was just a few years old, and that was mostly on the SNES. Despite that fact, I never really played games that relied heavily on having a good mouse.\nMy early PC gaming memories include titles like RollerCoaster Tycoon, Pharaoh, Civilization, The Sims, and Diablo 2. (I bet you can guess my age based on that information.) I later moved on to World of Warcraft and got hooked for, well, a very long time. A mouse was needed, sure, but it was never a make it or break it kind of situation. I never got into first-person shooters or MOBAs, so I didn\u2019t need a speedy mouse; I just needed something that worked.\nThe result? I continuously bought $5 to $10 mice that lasted a mere few months before needing to be replaced. I thought that was good enough, but boy, was I wrong.\nThe concept of the Razer Naga mouse was always intriguing to me. As I often play MMOs and games that require a bunch of keybinds, assigning different combinations of Shift or Control was getting annoying. I never had the budget to support getting a better mouse, though, so I ignored the hunch for years \u2014 until I finally decided to take the plunge and get myself the Razer Naga V2 Pro.\nGetting a proper mouse was an eye-opening experience. The feel, the speed, the accuracy, and the addition of so many extra buttons really transformed my gaming experience. This mouse wasn\u2019t cheap, and I tried out a few midrange mice before it, but ultimately, I got stuck on this one \u2014 and I love it.\nMy only regret? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to use a super cheap mouse again without wishing I had something better. I might just stick to various iterations of the Naga as long as they\u2019re being produced.\nMechanical keyboard\nI\u2019ve always abused my keyboards \u2014 anyone who types as much as I do does the same thing. I don\u2019t just use my keyboard for games, I use it for work and for fun (I like to write in my spare time, too, who would\u2019ve thought). As such, I went through keyboards the same way I went through mice: Very, very quickly.\nBeing on a tight budget for many of my PC builds, I always just bought any sort of keyboard. The kind that\u2019s just called \u201cgaming keyboard\u201d and barely even mentions the manufacturer. I eyed the big brands with some jealousy, but I always settled for those $10 to $20 no-name alternatives.\nFunnily enough, reading articles right here on Digital Trends convinced me to reconsider my stance on expensive keyboards. One of my colleagues covered a lot of mechanical keyboards and curated a list of the best gaming keyboards. Reading about them convinced me to give it a go, and wow, am I glad that I did.\nIf you\u2019re a little skeptical like I was, let me tell you: Mechanical keyboards are not just an unnecessary expense. If you like a click-y type of keyboard that really responds to everything you type, as well as a keyboard you can fully customize, you really should just try one.\nMe? I owned my mechanical keyboard for all of five minutes before declaring that I\u2019d never ever go back to membrane. It\u2019s just way too good.\nDecent monitors (that actually match)\nI\u2019m one of those people who are still holding on to their dual monitor setups instead of switching to ultrawides. What can I say \u2014 my neck hates it, but I can\u2019t imagine scaling back to just one monitor. Both for gaming and for work, I use my second monitor nearly constantly, and sometimes, I almost wish I had three. (I\u2019m talking myself out of it, I promise.)\nBut, much like keyboards and mice, I always just prioritized my displays a lot lower than my actual PC. I\u2019d spend more of my budget on components and then tell myself that I\u2019d maybe get a better monitor one day. Then, once I saved up, I\u2019d instead be tempted by something like more storage, RAM, or a better GPU.\nWhen I upgraded my PC last year, I chose to balance things out a bit more. The truth is that having a great PC and low-quality displays is a waste; a monitor needs to be good enough to keep up with your GPU, after all. As a result, I finally upgraded to 1440p monitors with 165Hz refresh rates. Those monitors are kind of the standard now, but I used 1080p 60Hz for years.\nIt\u2019s like night and day. The refresh rates are almost a necessity with a decent PC, and more screen real estate, thanks to the higher resolution, is super welcome, too. Again, I ruined budget monitors for myself, and I can\u2019t imagine going back.\nBalance is important\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to get by with low-quality peripherals. I did it for years, and I still had a blast using each and every PC I\u2019ve ever built \u2014 no complaints.\nI knew that it wasn\u2019t optimal. Having a cheap monitor with a high-end PC doesn\u2019t make much sense, but then, I mostly had mainstream PCs that couldn\u2019t aim higher than 1080p anyway. When you\u2019re trying to stay within a certain budget, it\u2019s easy to focus on the one thing you know is going to be a huge upgrade, such as pushing for more RAM or a better processor.\nIt\u2019s true that my pricier (although not super high-end) peripherals don\u2019t increase my frame rates in games, but they certainly boost the enjoyment I get from using my PC. I love every single keystroke on my mechanical keyboard; my mouse (kind of) makes me play better (sometimes); my monitors finally feel right and can keep up with my GPU.\nGaming experience doesn\u2019t always need to equal frame rates. It took me too long to realize that, but from now on, I know I\u2019ll always balance it out.\nIf you\u2019re in the same boat, treat yourself to a better keyboard or a new headset when you can \u2014 you\u2019ll love it in a whole new way."

      "text": "When I bought the Razer Naga V2 Pro, I thought that I would instantly love it, and I thought that I knew what I was getting myself into. One month later, I can now say with full conviction that I was wrong on both accounts.\nDespite being two years old, many still rank the Razer Naga V2 Pro among the best gaming mice, and having tested it myself, I fully agree. But make no mistake: It\u2019s definitely a mouse with a learning curve, and I learned that the hard way.\nMy first rodeo\nI realize that I\u2019m pretty late on the Razer Naga train. The concept of Razer\u2019s 12-button mouse is nothing new at this point, and various iterations of the mouse have been around since 2009. I\u2019ve never owned one until just over a month ago, though.\nThe Razer Naga is primarily an MMO mouse, and 2009 was a prime year for such players; I, myself, was deep into my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King phase at that time. I sure could\u2019ve used a Naga, but there was always something that kept me away from giving it a try, such as it being expensive (I paid $160 for mine, but the recommended list price is $180) or the fact that all those buttons made it downright intimidating.\nThis makes the Razer Naga V2 Pro my first attempt at using Razer\u2019s MMO mouse. It\u2019s not my first Razer mouse, but it\u2019s the first gaming mouse where I truly felt like I was trying something new. As a result, a lot of my impressions of the mouse aren\u2019t strictly related to the V2 Pro as much as the Razer Naga overall, but I\u2019ll cover parts that are unique to this mouse, too.\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. Although the Razer Naga V2 Pro is plug-and-play, it\u2019s also anything but.\nNot a love at first sight\nI was excited to get the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but my initial excitement was short-lived. There were some things that I didn\u2019t love from the get-go. The good news is that adapting to the mouse helped me get past most of them.\nBefore I dive in, let\u2019s go over the basic specs.\n| Razer Naga V2 Pro | |\n| Sensitivity | 30,000 DPI |\n| Polling rates | 125/500/1,000Hz |\n| IPS | 750 |\n| Max acceleration | 70g |\n| Connectivity | 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, USB-C |\n| Battery | Up to 150 hours (2.4GHz)/Up to 300 hours (Bluetooth) |\n| Programmable buttons | 10/14/20, depending on side plate |\n| Weight | 134g |\n| Recommended price (at launch) | $180 |\nThe Razer Naga V2 Pro is a high-end wireless mouse, and the specs show it. It comes with three hot-swappable side plates: one with the standard two thumb buttons, one with six, and one with 12. This amounts to up to 20 programmable buttons, and the V2 Pro adds the HyperScroll Pro scroll wheel, which comes with six presets and a custom mode. You can effectively double the number of programmable inputs because of Razer\u2019s Hypershift tech, which I\u2019ll go into a bit later.\nThe mouse comes with its own 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and once you plug it in, you\u2019re good to go. You need the Razer Synapse software to set it up, which I\u2019ve already had due to owning a Razer keyboard; I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d be prompted to download it otherwise.\nMy first thoughts as I held the mouse were that it was really heavy and that my hand was slightly too small. (I knew that it\u2019s not exactly perfect for small hands and bought it despite that.) Despite the weight and the size, the mouse felt comfortable for the most part, although the sheer number of buttons underneath my thumb took some effort getting used to. I use a palm grip and found the mouse to be perfectly suited to that grip type, although with bigger hands, I think a claw grip would work just as well.\nI have to give it to Razer \u2014 the hot-swappable side plates are extremely easy to swap back and forth. Truthfully, I\u2019ve had more problems unplugging the mouse from its charging cable than I\u2019ve had swapping out the 12-button plate for the two-button version. In fact, I found the charging cable a little difficult to unplug.\nDespite the ease of use, I had some buyer\u2019s remorse. I didn\u2019t love this mouse at first sight. It was heavier than I expected, it was bulky, and it quickly dawned on me that setting up the keybinds would be a project instead of a quick five-minute job.\nThe different stages of using a Naga\nI feel like one of the things that people don\u2019t mention much in reviews of this mouse (of which I\u2019ve read plenty) is that it doesn\u2019t just take a long time to set up but also to learn. I want to touch on that aspect, because that\u2019s probably what\u2019s taken me the longest time to adapt to. Again, this is more of a Naga thing than the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but if you\u2019re a first-time user, you might run into the same obstacles that I\u2019ve encountered.\nGetting started is easy, but only on paper. I dove right in with the 12-button version, naively thinking I\u2019d be a pro gamer within an hour. (Spoiler alert: I was decidedly not a pro gamer within an hour.)\nWithout a lot of tweaking in Synapse, those thumb buttons don\u2019t do anything, so I set out to bind them to certain keyboard keys, which, in turn, made them usable in games. Most games don\u2019t recognize these side panel keys, so this keyboard-to-mouse transition is necessary.\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother.\nA process that I thought would take me five minutes ended up taking the better part of an hour as I changed certain binds back and forth. I can\u2019t complain about the actual software \u2014 it\u2019s easy enough to navigate. No one tells you how hard it\u2019s going to be to pick the right stuff to bind, though.\nThe side panel accounts for 12 separate keybinds, and you can double the number of programmable inputs on the Naga V2 Pro thanks to Razer\u2019s HyperShift tech. This lets you assign a secondary function to each button, and when holding down the HyperShift key, the keybind changes accordingly.\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother. The games I primarily play don\u2019t require a whopping 24 different binds on top of the stuff I\u2019m already very used to using on my keyboard. Picking the right things to re-map was a process. I had a lot of binds that I was comfortable with using during gameplay, and a lot of those I simply didn\u2019t want to swap out.\nOnce I was done, the reality check fully set in.\nA never-ending process\nThis mouse has been out for nearly two years now, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details that are available in nearly every review of it. Instead, I want to look at the practical side of using such a mouse as your daily driver.\nMy main MMO is still World of Warcraft. (Yes, I know, time to find a new game.) Much like most MMOs, WoW gives you different spells and therefore different keybinds for each character. The binds themselves are uniform across every character, but as each comes with its own abilities, you need to figure out a way to streamline these binds and memorize them.\nUsing the 12-button side panel really shook things up for me. At first, I found myself reverting to what I already remembered, meaning using the keyboard instead of trying to use the mouse. This was especially hard to avoid during intense gameplay, where using the wrong ability can be deadly.\nEven when I forced myself to stick to the mouse, it took me a while to learn the button placement. Fortunately, Razer must have put a fair bit of thought into each, because once you\u2019ve used the mouse for a couple of days, the button shape becomes distinct enough that it gets a lot easier to tell them apart without looking.\nBut that first day or two? Not only did I not remember which button was assigned to which spell but I also had to stop and think which button I was even pressing.\nI eventually got used to the button layout, but honestly, I rarely make use of all 12 buttons. I could, but I hardly ever need to. I can\u2019t imagine doubling them with HyperShift \u2014 I think I\u2019d spend most of my time being confused as to what I\u2019m doing as opposed to actually playing.\nIt was an uphill climb, but one month later, I\u2019m feeling the real benefit of using this mouse. Gameplay becomes more intuitive; casting spells is so much quicker; you free up more of your keyboard for other things. I\u2019m not sure if it made me a better gamer, but it certainly made gameplay more enjoyable for me.\nThe only downside? Adjusting this mouse to your needs is a never-ending process. Sure, I\u2019ve mastered it for one character, but playing a different character or a different game means starting all over again and memorizing even more binds. This is true for any game, but with the sheer number of programmable buttons that the Razer Naga V2 Pro offers, it does feel like a chore if you play a lot of different titles.\nThe good part of it is that even if you don\u2019t end up using all 12 buttons and stick to the basic or the six-button side panel, the Naga V2 Pro is a superb mouse regardless, so you won\u2019t be missing out. I could see it being less great for first-person shooters, though, if only because of the weight.\nThe best (and most frustrating) mouse I\u2019ve ever owned\nThere\u2019s so much that I love about the Razer Naga V2 Pro: the sky-high DPI; the excellent sensor; the seamless wireless connectivity; the high-end build quality that tells me that it might last me a long time (which is quite a feat, as I break mice in record time).\nA month later, I also love the side panels. I\u2019ve gotten so used to the 12-button version that I hardly ever bother to scale down to two as it doesn\u2019t bug me when I work. The six-button panel is the one that\u2019s gotten the least love, simply because I\u2019ve gotten used to the maximum layout and I think that introducing any changes at this point would only end in frustration.\nAnother thing that put me off at first but is now a favorite is the customizable scroll wheel. Out of the box, using the scroll wheel feels like pulling teeth, but a quick adjustment in Synapse turns it into the smoothest scroll wheel I\u2019ve ever tried. There are so many modes that there\u2019s something in there for everyone, and if the presets don\u2019t work for you, you can always create your own profile. Personally, as I don\u2019t use the scroll wheel much during gameplay, I haven\u2019t had to make any tweaks after that initial adjustment.\nThe battery life is another thing I\u2019ve enjoyed and can applaud this mouse for. Prior to this mouse, I briefly used a battery-powered Logitech, and swapping those AA batteries every week or so was tedious \u2014 not to mention expensive. The battery on the Naga V2 Pro is excellent, lasting for days on end if you turn off the RGB lighting. Turning that on makes it deplete a lot faster, though.\nOutside of those more Naga-specific things, this is just a really solid mouse. It\u2019s quick, reliable, and super customizable.\nIt\u2019s also entirely overkill for my needs, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to non-MMO gamers. If you don\u2019t regularly play games with lots of different binds, you don\u2019t need this mouse. Even if you do (like I do), it\u2019s still overkill for many people and it has a steep learning curve that never really ends.\nWith all that said, I\u2019d buy the Razer Naga V2 Pro again without any hesitation, and I\u2019d happily go through the tedious process of learning my binds all over again. I\u2019m officially a convert."
