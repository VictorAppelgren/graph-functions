  "title": "China's courtyard workshops are reviving rural economies - and running up revenue figures in the millions",
  "description": "",
  "content": "A 'courtyard economy' nudge from Beijing is turning rural homes into microfactories and craft workshops, creating jobs, preserving heritage and opening new frontiers for investors\n\n\"I wanted people to see we could thrive here without leaving for the big cities,\" said one 39-year-old Chinese entrepreneur.\n\nAt the heart of China's rural revitalization lies a dramatic transformation. In countless villages across the country, traditional courtyards - once the quiet hubs of daily life - now thrum with creativity and commerce as home-based workshops revive livelihoods and traditions alike.\n\nFor 74-year-old Wei Xuexin in Shandong province, the change began in 2020, when pandemic lockdowns severed supply chains and factory doors slammed shut. Wei used his savings to buy basic equipment and converted his modest courtyard into a microfactory. He began hand assembling small metal parts for a local e-commerce company, working with his wife and daughter-in-law.\n\nThe days were long, the margins thin, but the arrangement allowed him to earn more than 100 yuan (about $14) a day without leaving his home. \"It was something we could control,\" Wei, a retired factory hand, was quoted as having told local media, \"and it kept us working when there was nothing else.\"\n\nIn Guangxi's Gongcheng county, 39-year-old entrepreneur Wang Yungui returned from the city with a different ambition. A member of the Yao minority, she had studied e-commerce and saw potential in combining modern digital tools with traditional skills. Wang began by livestreaming cooking demonstrations in colorful ethnic dress, drawing thousands of viewers and connecting local farmers directly with buyers. She soon expanded into tea production, using her mother's recipe, and later bottled spring water from the nearby hills. By 2021, her enterprises were turning over around 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) annually, and more than 150 households in her village had joined her supply network. \"I wanted people to see we could thrive here,\" she told a regional broadcaster, \"without leaving for the big cities.\"\n\nThese personal stories are part of what Beijing now calls the \"courtyard economy,\" an umbrella term for microenterprises operating from rural homes. Once informal and overlooked, the model is gaining official recognition. This year's No. 1 Central Document - the government's top annual policy blueprint for agriculture and rural affairs - calls for the systematic development of courtyard-based businesses, from craft workshops and specialty food processing to streaming studios and bed-and-breakfast lodging operations.\n\nGovernment data suggest the scale is already significant. More than 11,000 \"intangible cultural heritage\" workshops now operate across 2,005 county-level jurisdictions, including 670 areas formerly designated as impoverished. Over 4,300 are embedded directly in villages, providing employment for more than 1.2 million people in related industries. Many of these jobs are flexible and home-based, making them especially attractive to elderly residents and those with limited mobility, as well as women with families.\n\nZhejiang province's Xiaoshan district offers one striking example. There, a pickled-radish heritage workshop has organized more than 40,000 farmers into a contract production system. The result: an output value of 300 million yuan ($42 million) in 2024, according to official figures. The pickled radishes are still made according to traditional methods, but production, packaging and distribution are now coordinated through a semiformal network of courtyards, village processing sheds and online sales channels.\n\nThe benefits are not only economic. Advocates say the model strengthens social cohesion by allowing families to remain together, revives traditional craftsmanship and reduces the rural-to-urban migration pressures that have hollowed out communities. Architect Xu Tiantian, known for her \"architectural acupuncture\" projects in Zhejiang's Songyang county, says that integrating small-scale cultural and industrial facilities into existing village layouts can make them both economically viable and culturally relevant. Her designs - ranging from small workshops to museums - are meant to complement, not replace, traditional structures. \"It's about stitching new functions into old fabrics,\" she told Chinese media.\n\nFor investors, the courtyard economy opens several niche opportunities. Rural e-commerce platforms, microcredit providers and logistics firms - especially those offering cold-chain or short-haul delivery - stand to benefit from the growth of these small producers. So might companies that supply packaging, labeling and basic machinery. Consumer demand for \"authentic\" regional goods, amplified via streaming video, has also created higher margins for certain heritage products. In a sense, the model compresses the supply chain: production, marketing and fulfillment occur within a few kilometers, often under one family's management.\n\nThe trend does face hurdles. Scaling up from one courtyard to many can strain quality control. Brand recognition is still limited for most operators, and the dependence on social-media algorithms can make sales unpredictable. There are also environmental and regulatory concerns, as some microfactories operate without formal licenses and pollution controls.\n\nStill, the momentum is building. Local governments are beginning to offer training in product safety, digital marketing and business registration. Provincial programs in 18 regions now certify and promote heritage workshops, sometimes providing subsidies for equipment upgrades. Meanwhile, e-commerce giants like Alibaba (HK:9988) (BABA) and Pinduoduo are expanding rural outreach teams to onboard small producers.\n\n\"We built it, we work in it, and we decide what to make. That matters.\"\n\nBack in Shandong, Wei Xuexin says he never imagined his family courtyard would double as a factory floor. Yet, for him, the model represents something both practical and dignified: \"It's ours,\" he said in a recent interview. \"We built it, we work in it, and we decide what to make. That matters.\"\n\nFrom the aroma of radish pickling in Zhejiang to the sounds of metal-parts assembly in Shandong, these low-key spaces are knitting together a new rural economy - one built not in industrial parks, but in the shaded courtyards of family homes. For investors willing to look beyond China's megacities, they may also offer an early glimpse at a profitable, deeply local future.\n\nWestern brands still carry cachet in China's lower-tier cities. So that's where they're turning their attention.\n\nWhat is a '996' work culture, and why are young professionals in China giving it the cold shoulder?\n\nChina's trillion-yuan gamble on AI and chips is creating strange bedfellows\n\nTrump extends trade truce with China. What it means for tariffs.\n\nChina may have put up another hurdle for Nvidia to overcome\n\nTrump tried slowing China's AI development. He may have hurt Nvidia instead.\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
