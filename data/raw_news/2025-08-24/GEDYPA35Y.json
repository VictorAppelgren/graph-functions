  "description": "In contrast to innocence of AA Milne\u2019s children\u2019s stories, EH Shepard satirised chaos of political challenges leading up to Second World War",
  "content": "Newly published sketches by the illustrator behind Winnie-the-Pooh have revealed how he overcame his distaste for conflict to rail against appeasement in the run-up to the Second World War.\n\nIn a world away from the innocence of AA Milne\u2019s classic children\u2019s stories, EH Shepard explored his distaste for fascism and appeasement with caricatures of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, whose name is identified with the policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d toward Hitler\u2019s Germany.\n\nJames Campbell, overseer of the EH Shepard artistic and literary estate, told The Telegraph that the caricatures revealed Shepard as a man who was \u201cinstinctively nervous about regimes and individuals who essentially wanted to take control of people\u2019s lives\u201d.\n\nHe said that, while Milne was anxious to avoid war at almost any cost, Shepard was more pragmatic. \u201cHe had lost his only brother in the war. He was to lose his only son in the Second World War\u2026 But there came a point where he realised that somebody had to stand up for what was right\u2026 There are very interesting parallels with what\u2019s going on now.\u201d\n\nCampbell added that the caricatures showed that Shepard attempted to find ways of illustrating the rise of fascism and his dismay at the widespread desire among the British establishment for a policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany, and the ill-fated Munich Agreement between Chamberlain and Hitler.\n\nOver 20 years, Shepard was chief political cartoonist for Punch magazine and in a previously unpublished cartoon, he satirised the chaos of political challenges leading up to the Second World War.\n\nHe depicted a bustling amusement park, with attractions that poked fun at politicians Anthony Eden, Clement Atlee and Winston Churchill. A small paddle-boat is captained by a man pointing to its \u201cEdens Conducted Tours\u201d flag, a wrestler stands by a banner proclaiming \u201cBattling Winston Bruiser\u201d, and a top-hatted man is holding a bottle and pointing to a poster promoting \u201cAtlees Antidotes Tasteless\u201d. A couple of visitors just look bewildered.",

Shepard\u2019s work shows a pragmatic stance shaped by personal loss, with cartoons satirising the political chaos of the era and the ill\u2011fated Munich Agreement. The illustrations also hint at parallels to contemporary political concerns, according to the estate overseer. Shepard\u2019s long tenure as Punch\u2019s chief political cartoonist is highlighted by a previously unpublished piece depicting the era\u2019s leaders as amusement\u2011park attractions.",
