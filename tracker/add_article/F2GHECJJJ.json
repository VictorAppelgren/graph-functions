      "title": "Trump tariffs push India closer to America's strategic rivals China and Russia",
      "summary": "The article describes how U.S. tariffs on Indian imports under Trump have eroded a 25‑year partnership, prompting India to pivot eastward, deepen ties with Russia and China, and buy discounted Russian oil. Indian officials and analysts say the trust that underpinned cooperation on defense, trade and intelligence has collapsed, and Modi is using the dispute to rally domestic support for sovereignty. While the U.S. remains a key strategic partner, the relationship now faces its most serious test, with India signaling it can pursue its interests independently of Washington.",
