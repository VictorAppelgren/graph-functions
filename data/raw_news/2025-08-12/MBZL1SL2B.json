  "description": "A federal appeals court allowed teams affiliated with DOGE to gain access to potentially sensitive data on millions of Americans, overruling a lower court.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court on Tuesday allowed teams affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency to gain access to potentially sensitive data on millions of Americans, overruling a lower court that had blocked that access in February.\n\nBy a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted access to data stored at the Treasury Department, the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in a similar case in June involving Social Security data.\n\nThe decision cleared the way for teams put in place this year by Elon Musk to reclaim \u201chigh-level IT access\u201d to government databases, Judge Julius Richardson wrote, over the objections of a number of labor unions that had sued, arguing the move violated federal privacy laws.\n\nWriting for the majority, Richardson said the circumstances of the case mirrored those in a lawsuit involving data that the Supreme Court had weighed as an emergency application this year. In an unsigned order in that case, the Supreme Court intervened to allow the DOGE analysts to continue sifting through the records \u201cin order for those members to do their work.\u201d\n\nBesides sensitive financial data linked to Social Security benefits, the government regularly collects other information on residents such as addresses, employer details and related statistics that could be used to identify individual people. The decision Tuesday concerned that kind of data, as well as information on student debt stored at the Education Department, which collects personal financial data on more than 40 million borrowers.\n\nRichardson, appointed by President Donald Trump, and Judge G. Steven Agee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, formed the majority.\n\nOver the course of multiple lawsuits, the Justice Department has argued that DOGE teams were directed by Trump to scrutinize federal data to screen for evidence of wasted taxpayer dollars, redundant contracts or fraud.\n\nAfter several federal judges moved this year to restrict their access, the government offered several concessions, including agreeing to have DOGE staff undergo routine security trainings and background checks, or to limit their access to only anonymized data that could not be linked to individual people.\n\nBut as those cases have been appealed, the Supreme Court and appellate judges have more consistently sided with the government in allowing members of DOGE largely unfettered access to government systems.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Judge Robert King, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, echoed the concerns raised by the federal labor unions, including the lack of public information about DOGE\u2019s operations and its unrestrained approach in seizing sensitive data.\n\nKing wrote that a lower court\u2019s reaction to the rapid-fire demands by DOGE was careful and reasonable, rejecting the suggestion in the majority\u2019s opinion that it was overreaching.\n\n\u201cJust in early February 2025, the district court found itself confronted with this matter of immense urgency and import: the president\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, or \u2018DOGE,\u2019 had been accorded sudden, unfettered, unprecedented and apparently unnecessary access to highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEven after Musk stepped down from his role atop DOGE in May, the unit has continued to operate largely out of public view in what critics have described as a mission to hasten the downsizing of federal agencies and a reduction of the government\u2019s services.",

      "text": "Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company\u2019s new streaming home.\nThat was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House.\nTrump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to happen,\u201d White told The Associated Press. \u201cThink about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.\u201d\nThe idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion.\nWhite helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group\u2019s richest one yet \u2014 a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS.\nESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights \u2014 White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms \u2014 but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window.\nThe Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount.\n\u201cWhen you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they\u2019re brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,\u201d White said. \u201cThey\u2019re right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.\u201d\nThe $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC\u2019s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans \u2014 with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees.\nParamount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. \u201cas they become available in the future.\u201d\nUFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night.\n\u201cThis is a 1-of-1 event,\u201d White said.\nThere are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d \u201cRoad To UFC,\u201d and \u201cDana White\u2019s Contender Series.\u201d It\u2019s not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet but we will,\u201d White said.\nAnd what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal \u2014 with $1.1 billion headed the fight company\u2019s way.\n\u201cIt will affect fighter pay, big time,\u201d White said. \u201cFrom deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.\u201d\nBoxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model \u2014 which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events \u2014 should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.\n\u201cEvery fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is\u2026no more PPV excuses,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cGet your worth boys and girls.\u201d\nWhite also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead.\nThere are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo \u00c1lvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not run it\u2019s course,\u201d White said. \u201cThere were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren\u2019t. Wherever we ended up, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to roll with.\u201d\nWhite said UFC archival footage \u201ckills it\u201d in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.\nJust when it seems there\u2019s little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there\u2019s always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports?\n\u201cYou have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming. We\u2019re coming for all of them.\u201d\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports"

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The new picture of law enforcement in the nation\u2019s capital began taking shape Tuesday as some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by the Trump administration began arriving. The city\u2019s police and federal officials, projecting cooperation, took the first steps in an uneasy partnership to reduce crime in what President Donald Trump called \u2014 without substantiation \u2014 a lawless city.\nThe influx came the morning after the Republican president announced he would be activating the guard members and taking over the District\u2019s police department, something the law allows him to do temporarily. He cited a crime emergency \u2014 but referred to the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably.\nBy evening, the administration was saying that National Guard members were expected to be on the streets starting Tuesday night, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Army said there were no specifics on the locations they will be patrolling, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason.\nMayor Muriel Bowser pledged to work alongside the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city\u2019s law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers.\n\u201cHow we got here or what we think about the circumstances \u2014 right now we have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,\u201d she told reporters.\nThe tone was a shift from the day before, when Bowser said Trump\u2019s plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn\u2019t match the declining crime numbers. Still, the law gives the federal government more sway over the capital city than in U.S. states, and Bowser said her administration\u2019s ability to push back is limited.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media that the meeting was productive.\nThe law allows Trump to take over the D.C. police for up to 30 days, though White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested it could last longer as authorities later \u201creevaluate and reassess.\u201d Extending federal control past that time would require Congressional approval, something likely tough to achieve in the face of Democratic resistance.\nAbout 850 officers and agents fanned out across Washington on Monday and arrested 23 people overnight, Leavitt said. The charges, she said, included homicide, drunk driving, gun and drug crimes and subway fare evasion. She didn\u2019t immediately provide further information on the arrests.\nThe U.S. Park Police has also removed 70 homeless encampments over the last five months, she said. People who were living in them can leave, go to a homeless shelter or go into drug addiction treatment, Leavitt said. Those who refuse could face fines or jail time.\nThe city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship\nWhile Trump invokes his plan by saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024 and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.\nResident Jeraod Tyre, who\u2019s lived in Washington for 15 years, said he does see crime slowing down. He\u2019s wary of the National Guard troops, who don\u2019t have the same local knowledge as the city\u2019s regular police force. \u201cI feel safe walking through the city each and every day. The police are doing a mighty fine job,\u201d he said.\nBowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump\u2019s first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. She later had the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted in giant yellow letters on the street about a block from the White House.\nIn Trump\u2019s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia.\nShe watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved.\nNow that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many D.C. officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics. \u201cIt\u2019s a power play and we\u2019re an easy target,\u201d said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the D.C. Justice Lab and a frequent Bowser critic.\nWhere the power actually lies\nBowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that local officials can do little other than comply and make the best of it. As long as Washington remains a federal enclave with limited autonomy under the 1973 Home Rule Act, she said, it will remain vulnerable to such takeovers.\nTrump is the first president to use the law\u2019s Section 740 to take over Washington\u2019s police for up to 30 days during times of emergencies.\nFor Trump, the effort to take over public safety in D.C. reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nTrump\u2019s declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office. He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. In many cases, he has moved forward while the courts sorted them out.\nBowser\u2019s claims about successfully driving down violent crime rates received backing earlier this year from an unlikely source. Ed Martin, Trump\u2019s original choice for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, issued a press release in April hailing a 25% drop in violent crime rates from the previous year.\nTom Power, resident of the hip Logan Circle neighborhood for over a decade, said he occasionally hears about shootings or car break-ins, but he\u2019s never been a victim himself. \u201cI never felt threatened, I\u2019ve never given much thought to it,\u201d he said.\nWashington native Sheina Taylor said the troops are putting her on edge. \u201cIt\u2019s more fearful now because even though you\u2019re a law abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don\u2019t know, especially because I\u2019m African-American,\u201d she said.\nTrump\u2019s newly confirmed top federal prosecutor for Washington, onetime judge and former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, argued that violent crime remains high and a significant issue for victims, despite recent decreases. \u201cThese were vibrant human beings cut down because of illegal guns,\u201d she said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington, Jonathan J.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has taken control of D.C.\u2019s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are necessary to curb an urgent public safety crisis.\nEven as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the Republican president promised a \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d His rhetoric echoed that used by conservatives going back decades who have denounced cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressives, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump promised Monday.\nTrump\u2019s action echoes uncomfortable historical chapters\nAs D.C. the National Guard arrived at their headquarters Tuesday, for many residents, the prospect of federal troops surging into neighborhoods represented an alarming violation of local agency. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action.\nApril Goggans, a longtime D.C. resident and grassroots organizer, said she was not surprised by Trump\u2019s actions. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in D.C. since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.\n\u201cWe have to be vigilant,\u201d said Goggans, who has coordinated local protests for nearly a decade. She worries about what a surge in law enforcement could mean for residents\u2019 freedoms.\n\u201cRegardless of where you fall on the political scale, understand that this could be you, your children, your grandmother, your co-worker who are brutalized or have certain rights violated,\u201d she said.\nOther residents reacted with mixed feelings to Trump\u2019s executive order. Crime and homelessness has been a top concern for residents in recent years, but opinions on how to solve the issue vary. And very few residents take Trump\u2019s catastrophic view of life in D.C.\n\u201cI think Trump\u2019s trying to help people, some people,\u201d said Melvin Brown, a D.C. resident. \u201cBut as far as (him) trying to get (the) homeless out of this city, that ain\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a band-aid to a gunshot wound,\u201d said Melissa Velasquez, a commuter into D.C. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been an increase of racial profiling and stuff, and so it\u2019s concerning for individuals who are worried about how they might be perceived as they go about their day-to-day lives.\u201d\nUncertainty raises alarms\nAccording to White House officials, troops will be deployed to protect federal assets and facilitate a safe environment for law enforcement to make arrests. The Trump administration believes the highly visible presence of law enforcement will deter violent crime. It is unclear how the administration defines providing a safe environment for law enforcement to conduct arrests, raising alarm bells for some advocates.\n\u201cThe president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,\u201d said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. chapter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen before how federal control of the D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations \u2014 from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,\u201d Hopkins said.\nA history of denigrating language\nConservatives have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. Republicans have called for greater police crackdowns in cities since at least the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles.\nPresident Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his \u201cSouthern Strategy.\u201d Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from liberal cities for decades.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump\u2019s takeover of local police \u201cunsettling\u201d but not without precedent. Bowser kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference but decried Trump\u2019s reasoning as a \u201cso-called emergency,\u201d saying residents \u201cknow that access to our democracy is tenuous.\u201d\nTrump threatened to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cbeautify\u201d D.C. on the campaign trail and claimed it was \u201ca nightmare of murder and crime.\u201d He also argued the city was \u201chorribly run\u201d and said his team intended \u201cto take it away from the mayor.\u201d Trump on Monday repeated old comments about some of the nation\u2019s largest cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland and his hometown of New York City. All are currently run by Black mayors.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities in a very bad, New York is a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don\u2019t even mention that anymore. They\u2019re so far gone. We\u2019re not going to let it happen,\u201d he said.\nCivil rights advocates see the rhetoric as part of a broader political strategy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a playbook he\u2019s used in the past,\u201d said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric \u201cpaints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people\u2019s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,\u201d Wiley said.\nShe added that the playbook has special potency in D.C. because local law enforcement can be directly placed under federal control, a power Trump invoked in his announcement.\nLeaders call the order an unjustified distraction\nTrump\u2019s actions in Washington and comments about other major cities sent shock waves across the country, as other leaders prepare to respond to potential federal action.\nDemocratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement that Trump\u2019s plan \u201clacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous\u201d and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump\u2019s characterization of the city \u201cfearmongering.\u201d\nThe administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in LA despite opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass.\nCivil rights leaders have denounced Trump\u2019s action in D.C. as an unjustified distraction.\n\u201cThis president campaigned on \u2018law and order,\u2019 but he is the president of chaos and corruption,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson. \u201cThere\u2019s no emergency in D.C., so why would he deploy the National Guard? To distract us from his alleged inclusion in the Epstein files? To rid the city of unhoused people? D.C. has the right to govern itself. It doesn\u2019t need this federal coup.\u201d\n\u2014\nAssociated Press writer River Zhang contributed reporting."

      "text": "President Donald Trump has unleashed a torrent of executive orders \u2014 far more than any of his recent predecessors \u2014 intent on remaking the federal government.\nTrump\u2019s opponents have responded with a flurry of lawsuits across the country trying to block the president\u2019s agenda. And, just as in Trump\u2019s first term, many of the most prominent legal challenges have come from Washington state.\nBelow, track the latest on Washington lawsuits.\nClick on the Trump order for the latest coverage of the case.\nState Attorney General Nick Brown has challenged Trump\u2019s actions in federal court, just as his predecessor, now-Gov. Bob Ferguson, did during Trump\u2019s first term.\nIn 2017, a judge in Seattle halted Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from certain Muslim countries, just as the travel ban had thrown airports into chaos. In 2025, a judge in Seattle blocked Trump\u2019s attempt to rescind birthright citizenship, saying Trump\u2019s order was \u201cclearly unconstitutional\u201d and accusing Trump of ignoring the rule of law.\nThe city of Seattle and King County have sued the Trump administration. So have local nonprofits.\nAll these lawsuits are in the early stages and may take years to ultimately resolve.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "The Republicans\u2019 domestic policy legislation will most likely raise after-tax incomes of the richest Americans while its cuts to social spending will leave the poorest at a substantial disadvantage, according to an analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nThe report also estimated that millions of low-income Americans could lose access to federal food assistance or Medicaid under the sweeping bill that President Donald Trump signed into law last month.\nThis highly regressive pattern \u2014 both cutting the safety net for the poor and reducing taxes for the rich \u2014 has no precedent among large budget bills passed in the last 40 years.\nThe budget office\u2019s report was an update to an earlier analysis it had issued in June. It looked at how the bill\u2019s long list of policies would affect Americans at every level of income, estimating that the incomes for the highest 10% of earners would rise by an average of 2.7% by 2034, mainly driven by tax cuts, while those of the lowest 10% would fall by 3.1%, mostly because of cuts to programs such as Medicaid and food aid.\nThe gains for the top 10% of earners would be higher than for any other income group, relative to their income, and the bottom 10% would face the biggest relative losses, the analysis suggested.\nThe budget office also released updated estimates on the number of people who could lose benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps. The office estimated that stricter work requirements would reduce participation in the program by roughly 2.4 million people in an average month over the next decade.\nThe policy bill made several changes to the program, which provides food assistance to roughly 42 million people each month. The law imposes more stringent work requirements on SNAP recipients, applying them to able-bodied adults through age 64 and parents with children 14 and older. Previously, adults up to age 54 had to comply and people with dependents were exempt.\nThe law also makes it more challenging for areas with higher unemployment rates to qualify for work requirement waivers, and it eliminates work requirement exemptions for veterans, homeless people and certain former foster youths.\nStates will also have to pay a portion of SNAP benefits for the first time unless they maintain lower payment error rates. The budget office said it expected that states would respond in various ways. Some would maintain current benefits and eligibility, while others would modify benefits or \u201cleave the program altogether.\u201d\nSome states, including Pennsylvania, have questioned whether they can continue operating SNAP if they cannot cover the extra costs of providing benefits.\nThe budget office estimated that the cost share change would reduce or eliminate SNAP benefits for about 300,000 people in an average month.\nThe budget office also updated detailed estimates about how the bill will affect the number of Americans with health insurance. Under the law, 10 million more people are expected to become uninsured by 2034. The office had published that number before, but Monday\u2019s report included more detail about which policies would have the largest impacts.\nThe law\u2019s new strict work requirement for Medicaid will have the largest impact of any other health care policy change, causing an estimated 5.3 million more Americans to become uninsured. Overall, the bill\u2019s Medicaid policies will cause around 7.5 million Americans to lose health insurance.\nIn addition, its changes to Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause around 2.1 million to lose coverage, and the elimination of Medicare coverage for certain legal immigrants who have contributed to the program for at least 15 years will cause 100,000 such people to become uninsured, according to the report. An additional 300,000 people are estimated to lose insurance because of interactions between the policies."

The ruling allows DOGE teams, established by Elon Musk, to analyze government databases for potential waste and fraud, despite concerns from labor unions about privacy violations. Meanwhile, President Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., claiming a public safety emergency, which has sparked controversy and raised questions about local autonomy and the implications of federal intervention.",
