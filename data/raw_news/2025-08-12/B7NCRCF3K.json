  "content": "The much-anticipated Perseid meteor shower, one of nature's most dazzling sky shows, is set to peak Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, lighting up skies across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\"The Perseids are caused by Earth running into trails of debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle,\" Bill Cooke, lead for NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office, told ABC News.\n\nThe shower has been captivating humans since it was first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 36 A.D., nearly 2,000 years ago.\n\nFor the best view of this celestial spectacle, timing is everything.\n\n\"The best time to see the Perseids would be in the wee hours of [Wednesday] morning, around 2 to 4 a.m.,\" Cooke said.\n\nIf you want to catch the show you won't need a telescope, Cooke said.\n\nMORE: Taylor Swift will appear on Travis and Jason Kelce's 'New Heights' podcast\n\n\"You definitely do not want to use a telescope or binoculars, as the best way to see a meteor shower is to take in as much sky as possible,\" Cooke advised. \"Just use your eyes and enjoy the show!\"\n\nWhile this year's display will be affected by moonlight, determined sky-watchers can still catch plenty of meteors.\n\n\"The average person under dark skies could see somewhere between 40 and 50 Perseids per hour,\" Cooke said. \"Instead, you're probably going to see 10 to 20 per hour or fewer.\"\n\nThese \"shooting stars\" are actually space debris from Comet Swift-Tuttle, which last visited our cosmic neighborhood in 1992, according to NASA press release. (The comet is named for the two scientists who discovered the comet in 1862, Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle).\n\nWhen these pieces hit Earth's atmosphere, they create brilliant streaks of light across the night sky. The shower gets its name because the meteors appear to shoot out from near the Perseus constellation, NASA said.\n\nFor the best viewing experience, find a safe, dark spot away from city lights with a wide view of the sky. The shower will remain active until Sept. 1, though Tuesday night offers peak viewing opportunities. Just remember to dress warmly, bring a comfortable chair and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.\n\n\"You're not going to see Perseids around suppertime,\" Cooke said. \"You're going to have to go out later.\"\n\nBut for those willing to stay up late, the celestial show promises to be worth the wait.",

Taylor Swift is joining the New Heights podcast with Travis Kelce.\nOn Monday night, New Heights shared a video of Kelce and Swift on Instagram teasing the upcoming episode. Watch here.\nSwift appears, telling boyfriend Travis Kelce, who is wearing a blue hoodie, \"It's such a nice color on you.\"\nHe replies, \"Yeah, it's the color of your eyes, sweetie. That's why we match so well.\"\n\"We're about to do a f---ing podcast!\" Swift adds.\nThe news comes after tons of speculation earlier on Monday that Swift would make a guest appearance on the show.\nThe \"New Heights\" podcast, which is co-hosted by Travis and his brother Jason Kelce, teased on social media that \"a special episode with a VERY special guest\" will be released on Wednesday.\nThey illustrated the post with a picture of Jason wearing an Eras Tour tee and a vaguely Swift-shaped silhouette.\nSoon after that post went up, the official fan site Taylor Nation posted, \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era.'\"\nThe post featured a number of onstage photos showing Swift wearing orange during the Eras Tour -- the same background color that was used on the New Heights post.\nAll this has, of course, convinced Swifties that she may use an appearance on New Heights to announce her next album.\nWhile Swift has never appeared on the brothers' podcast, she's been mentioned a few times on the show.\nIn July 2023, Travis Kelce talked about how he wanted to give Swift a friendship bracelet at her concert with his number on it.\nHe also reacted to the time she attended her first Chiefs game in September 2023.\nAfter Travis Kelce made a cameo during the Eras Tour in June 2024 in London, he also spoke about the experience on the podcast and said \"it was awesome.\"\nIn January, Travis Kelce said Swift \"listens every week\" to the \"New Heights\" podcast.\nThe next \"New Heights\" podcast with Swift arrives on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET."
