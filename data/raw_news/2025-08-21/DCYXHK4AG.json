  "title": "I wore PJs all through pregnancy \u2014 these 7 were the most comfortable",
  "description": "From nightgowns to pajama sets, these are the best maternity and nursing pajamas to pack for pregnancy, hospital, and beyond.",
  "content": "Getting enough quality sleep isn't always easy to get during pregnancy \u2014 especially as those kicks get stronger, the urge to pee becomes inconveniently frequent, and your belly expands, making it nearly impossible to find a comfy position. The good news? Having a good set of maternity PJs can definitely help. Personally, I've found that a lot of traditional pajamas aren't designed to keep you cool and comfortable through hormonal shifts and fluctuations, body changes, and postpartum recovery.Particularly during the third trimester, I spent a lot of time in my PJs \u2014 and I expect I'll continue to after the baby is born. So, on my quest for the best pregnancy pajamas, I sought out sets that could carry me through not only this final stretch of pregnancy, but also while I'm recovering from delivery in the hospital, and the many late nights I'll be up nursing after the baby arrives. IMO, the smartest picks are made with breathable, easy-care fabric, offer easy access for breastfeeding, and feature forgiving cuts that will fit from the first to the fourth trimester and beyond.After wearing and washing a dozen different options at various price points, here are the PJs I've been swearing by during pregnancy.And for more of our sleepwear coverage, see our article on the best pajamas, the best cooling pajamas, and more. Plus, you can check out my guide to the best maternity clothing for all of my top recommendations to get you through pregnancy.",

      "text": "Whether you're a hot sleeper or your partner is, the best way to prevent night sweats is a fresh set of cooling pajamas. Going nude may seem like the obvious solution (as a hot sleeper myself, I've tried this). But by morning, your sheets will be just as sweaty and sticky as you are.\nLet's talk about who night sweats affect most: as with many areas of women's healthcare, menopausal and perimenopausal research is underfunded. There's still no single cure for hot flashes, even though it's one of the most common symptoms. I spoke to the women in my family who have gone through these symptoms, and they gave me tips on managing them.\nIt starts with a few simple lifestyle changes, like wearing cooling pajamas and sleeping on cooling sheets with a cooling pillow. To wake up feeling refreshed even while I was pregnant with twins in summer, I wore nightgowns and PJ sets made of breathable, natural materials. That includes bamboo, cotton, eucalyptus, and silk, which wick moisture and regulate body temperature.\nBelow are all the nightgowns and separates our team has tested for their ability to keep us cool and dry, even in the dog days of summer. To learn more about our favorite sleepwear, see our guides to the best women's pajamas, nightgowns, and silk pajamas.\nTop 5 Cooling Pajamas:\nThe patented blend of eucalyptus fiber fabric of this cowl-neck nightie feels slippery and cool to the touch. It stayed dry through the night thanks to its impressive moisture-wicking properties.\nThis luxe PJ set is made of 16 momme, grade 6A silk \u2014 in other words, some of the softest, smoothest silk we tested. The lightweight material almost floats over your skin and feels cool to the touch.\n\"I want all my dresses to feel this breathable and light,\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. \"[It] basically floats around your body, with no uncomfortable necklines or even rough seams.\"\n\"This dress is as comfortable as my favorite pair of sweatpants, yet makes me feel a thousand times more put together, which is a nice feeling (even when you\u2019re just getting in bed),\" writes style editor Samantha Crozier. It's perfect for starfish sleepers, since it has high leg slits and a low scoop back.\nThis cooling bamboo viscose fabric creates a drapey, no-bunch silhouette. It's a stretchy, soft set available in sizes XS-3X.\nBest overall: Dagsmejan Nattcool Air Sleep Tech Slip Dress\n\"Usually when I sweat in my sleep, my pajamas are damp as a result. But waking up in this slip dress, I feel genuinely refreshed.\nDagsmejan is a Swedish sleepwear brand that uses patented technology in their fabrics, like the eucalyptus-based 'Nattcool.' It's a unique textile with impressive moisture-wicking properties that the brand claims is eight times as breathable as cotton.\nI first tested this claim last summer by sleeping in the August heat without air conditioning. Sure enough, it kept me comfortably dry through the night. Then, when this summer began with a heat dome, I broke out this nightdress again. It's held up even after months of washing and wearing.\nIt's made with 100% Lyocell, which feels cool, slippery, and lightweight to the touch. It's almost a shock to the system when you feel how cold the fabric is, even after it's been sitting in a climate-controlled room. The fit of the dress is relaxed with a split hem, so it's easy to move in if you toss and turn in your sleep.\nYes, the price is pretty steep for a nightie, but it really does work to curb night sweats. In fact, I found both Dagsmejan pieces I tested to be worth it, including the Relaxwear Kimono. It's my favorite bathrobe for summer, since I take hot showers no matter the temperature outside.\" \u2014 Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\nBest silk set: Eberjey Inez Washable Silk Short Set\n\"Eberjey's silk is beautifully billowy and cool to the touch. It's made of 16 momme, grade 6A silk, which is some of the highest quality around. And one touch will tell you all you need to know about how luxurious this set is, especially compared to some of the lower-cost pajamas on this list. It's expensive, but you get what you're paying for.\nThere are two versions of the Inez set. I had originally tested the long-sleeve and long pant version, which I love dearly but the arms and legs were a little long for my five-foot-one frame. The fabric is still the same luxurious silk, but having to roll the pants and sleeves up prevented it from being my go-to.\nBut I absolutely live in the Inez Washable Silk Short Set. It is so light and soft that it feels like silk is floating on my body. I got the printed version in the blue and white Wedgewood pattern (as an antique enthusiast, this little detail made it even more special).\nI almost had to force myself to wear anything other than this set. The fit is perfect on me, and the fabric is pure luxury. But like all silk, it takes a little bit of effort to launder and de-wrinkle. However, this set makes it all worth it.\" \u2014 Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\nSee our full Eberjey pajama review to hear more about our non-silk favorites from the brand.\nBest silk nightgown: Lunya Washable Silk Tulip Dress\n\"Lunya's washable silk pajamas are celeb-favorites and Instagram darlings. And while all of Lunya's silk is great, their Tulip Nightgown is the breezy, cooling sleepwear of your dreams.\nOne of my favorite things about Lunya is the sleep-friendly features that they incorporate into their pieces. For example, this set has long side slits so your legs are free to sprawl in bed. The back of the dress also has a racerback silhouette, so your shoulders and arms are unrestricted.\nLunya is also great at making their silk actually washable. I've tested tons of silk pajamas and not all of them hold up after multiple washed. But this one definitely does \u2014 you may need to hit it with a steamer if you want it completely wrinkle-free, though.\" \u2014 Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\nSee our Lunya washable silk review for our full rundown on the brand's silk pajamas.\nBest cotton nightgown: Lake Alice Nightgown\nStyle editor Samantha Crozier found that nightgowns don't just make great cooling sleepwear \u2014 they double as a comfy daytime look, too. One of her favorites is the Alice Nightgown, made by Georgia-based pajama brand Lake. It's a knee-length dress that comes with pockets (huzzah!) and is crafted with a lightweight, puckered Pima cotton. Pima is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of cottons, known for its silkiness and strength.\n\"Trust me, sleeping in front of the fan in this crisp, thin-strapped dress will be a much more pleasant experience than sleeping in an old T-shirt that's probably made with nonporous synthetics,\" she writes. \"Fabrics make all the difference when it comes to temperature control.\"\nBest bamboo pajamas: Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set\n\"I'm a big fan of Cozy Earth's bamboo bedding, and their pajamas and loungewear are no exception. I'm particularly drawn to the women's stretch-knit bamboo viscose pajamas, which are breathable and naturally temperature-regulating. The Cozy Earth bamboo pajamas are available in various set combinations whether you like shorts or pants and long sleeves or short sleeves. The bottoms all have pockets and I love the contrast piping. I opted for the short sleeve and pants set, and I was comfortable all day and night (I admittedly didn't want to change and spent the day working in them, not to mention, the button-down top is definitely Zoom meeting friendly).\nIn addition to being insanely soft with plenty of spa-like colors to choose from, Cozy Earth is super size inclusive up to size 3XL and with petite and tall sizing. I have found that the fabric pills a bit between my thighs, but the fabric is designed to be warranted against that and overall washes pretty nicely.\" \u2014 Jaclyn Turner, senior home editor, Insider Reviews\nFind more of Jaclyn's favorite bedroom accessories in our guide to the best cooling products for better sleep.\nBest affordable silk set: Quince 100% Washable Silk Pajamas\nIf you need an affordable silk pajama set, we found Quince silk pieces to be a satisfactory option. It's not as top-tier as Lunya or Eberjey, but still worth considering if you're on a budget.\n\"I love the breezy silhouette of the wide-leg pants with the side-slit and the oversized tee \u2014 it makes this set great to transition between seasons. I also appreciate that the top and bottoms are sold separately, so you can mix and matches sizes and colors, as well as other silk PJ styles including a button-up shirt, tank, and shorts. Best of all, during testing, I found these pajamas to be truly washable without any detriment to the quality. There are seven gorgeous colors available in sizes XS through XL.\" \u2014 Talia Ergas, freelance style reporter, Insider Reviews\nSome Quince silk pieces lasted us longer than others. Read more in our full Quince washable silk review.\nBest pant set: Soma Cool Nights Printed Short-Sleeve Notch Collar & Cropped Pants\nI know what you're thinking: How can long pajama pants be considered cooling? That's because these are made with a lightweight, cool-to-the-touch fabric that, in my opinion, offers plenty of breathing room when tossing and turning all night long (ah, pregnancy insomnia).\nThe relaxed fit and comfy elastic waistband are both added bonuses; plus, the matching short-sleeve button-down top is equally soft. I love this pair so much I packed them in my hospital go-bag when I went to deliver my twins. For me, the pretty palm tree print was just the icing on the cake, but you can choose from a handful of other patterns to suit your individual style.\nBest shorts set: Tommy John Second Skin Sleep Tank & Short Set\nI tend to gravitate towards shorts sets \u2014 especially in the summer months \u2014 so I was especially excited to try this one from Tommy John, which, as the name suggests, truly does feel like a second skin. Tommy John also sells its Second Skin pajamas as a set in a luxe ribbed fabric.\nI especially loved the ultra-stretchy waistband, which didn't roll over let alone dig, tug, or irritate my very sensitive skin. It's worth noting that the set features modal, which is known for its supreme softness and durable properties (i.e. pill- , shrink-, and fade-resistant). I washed it to see how well it would hold up and was relieved to find it was just as soft and sumptuous as the first time I took it out of the box.\nRead more in our full Tommy John loungewear review.\nBest affordable nightgown: Bamboo Cool Sleep Dress\nBamboo fabric is known for its thermoregulating and moisture-wicking properties, making it ideal for year-round wear. So, as a hot sleeper, I was especially excited to try out this sleep dress, which, at under $25, is a total steal. The short-sleeve nightgown has a soft, stretchy, and oversized fit, providing plenty of coverage and breathing room while you snooze. One caveat: While it's not advertised, the dress does have a built-in shelf bra, which I wasn't particularly fond of. That said, some folks may count this as a pro.\nBest patterned: Printfresh Short Sleep Set\nPrintfresh is best known for their loud prints and colorful designs as seen on many lifestyle influencers, but we've put their Short Sleep Set to the hot sleeper test and can confirm that they're more than just a bedtime fashion statement. This set comes in vibrant patterns for anyone who isn't afraid of a little color, and is available from petite small to a standard 6XL.\n\"I sleep hot, so shorts and a t-shirt are my go-to for bed, no matter the weather. Printfresh's short sleep set is comfortable, lightweight, and breathable; perfect for those of us who tend to overheat at night. I tried the set in my normal 3X and it was a little snugger than I prefer for pjs, and as Sally mentioned, there's not a ton of stretch to the material. If, like me, you prefer your PJs loose, I'd recommend sizing up.\" \u2014 Lauren Savoie, deputy editor, Insider Reviews\nRead more in our full Printfresh review.\nBest satin: PJ Harlow Anne Satin Sleep Cami\n\"If you're looking for a cooling top to wear to bed, consider PJ Harlow's Anne Satin Sleep Cami. It's made with 75% rayon and 25% satin faille, and I found it to be the perfect simple top to pair with shorts or underwear on particularly scorching nights.\" \u2014 Julia Guerra, freelance style reporter, Insider Reviews\nWhat to look for in the best cooling pajamas, according to a sleep psychologist\nA fresh pair of cooling pajamas might just be your saving grace if you're also someone who constantly wakes up hot and sweaty. When shopping for new sleepwear, health and sleep psychologist Joshua Tal, PhD tells Business Insider that shoppers should look for fabrics like cotton, linen, bamboo, and rayon, as these materials \"allow your body to release moisture, but [are] loose enough to let air in to cool you down and wick away the moisture.\"\nEucalyptus fibers are also great, as they're ultra-lightweight, hypoallergenic, moisture-wicking, and cool to the touch, adds Elle Liu, founder of cooling sheets brand, Eucalypso.\nSince hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms for people experiencing hormonal imbalance, we recommend brands that carry perimenopausal and menopausal nightwear. Dagsmejan is one with a wide variety of fabrics that target sleep concerns like night sweats.\nHow we tested the best cooling pajamas\nI slept in five pairs of cooling pajamas at least two times each (while I was pregnant with twins). I selected each set after combing through dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of user reviews. The rest of the cooling pajamas we listed come from our team members' personal experiences and recommendations.\nAs I tested, I ensured each pair was made with a breathable, stretchy fabric so I wouldn't feel weighed down or constricted, which, as someone who tosses and turns all night long, happens far too often.\nIt was also important for me to put the sweat factor to the test. If I woke up feeling like I was laying in a pool of perspiration, or the pajamas stuck to my skin, then they didn't make the cut.\nIn the morning, I paid attention to how refreshed I felt waking up in each set. If I slept through the night without waking up with the night sweats, I considered it a successful trial.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "Pregnancy requires embracing a lot of changes \u2014 one of them being the fact that by the second trimester, some of your clothes will no longer fit. While it might be a bummer stashing away some of those favorite jeans or button-down shirts, there's an increasingly wider selection of bump-friendly alternatives, so consider this an excuse to treat yourself to a few new pieces.\nTo be clear, not everyone needs to go this route. If you strategically buy clothing that can accommodate the bump (and perhaps size up), it's totally possible to get through the nine-month stretch without ever buying maternity-specific clothing. That said, maternity clothes can definitely be a worthy investment. These items typically boast thoughtful design features to keep you cool, comfortable, and supported as you start carrying around that increasingly heavy cargo. And did we mention that many of them are even meant to fit you well after pregnancy is over?\nOur favorite place to buy maternity clothing is Bumpsuit, the celebrity-favorite brand that makes trendy pieces that support your bump in styles. And if you're looking for affordable maternity clothing, we can't say enough good things about Old Navy's maternity line, which has great basics that usually retail for under $50.\nAfter testing dozens of products from a handful of top brands, we found some winning items that are absolute essentials. And then, I've written about the best places to buy maternity clothing \u2014 even some retailers that aren't maternity-specific.\nThe five best maternity essentials in my closet\nIf you're building a maternity wardrobe from scratch, start here. These are my hero items \u2014 the maternity essentials that I can't live without.\nThese feature super soft fabric and a supportive fit. Plus, they can be worn over or under the bump as well as post-pregnancy, and are versatile enough to be worn in and out of the gym\nButtery soft, lightweight, and breathable, this set is perfect for relaxing at home year-round both during pregnancy and beyond.\nThis will take you through every stage of pregnancy. It's elegant, easy to layer over tees and under sweaters, and can be dressed down with flats and a denim jacket or dressed up with heels and an eye-catching necklace\nThese are remarkably stretchy and universally flattering with a vintage look \u2014 plus, they come in two different inseam lengths.\nThis godsend piece works as a comfy and wire-free maternity bralette, as well as a bra for hands-free nursing and pumping.\nThe most important things I've learned to look for in maternity wear\nI've tested tons of brands for this guide, sorting through uncomfortable pieces or items that simply weren't versatile enough to make them worth it. Here's what I learned about what to look out for when you're buying maternity clothing for every trimester.\n- Breathability: Ideally, seek out ultra-breathable natural fabrics like cotton, linen, or bamboo \u2014 especially if you're pregnant during the warmer months.\n- Stretch and flexibility: It can also be helpful to look for items that contain a touch of elastane or spandex for stretch. This tends to be particularly important for items like leggings, tanks, and bras \u2014 the stretchier they are, the longer you'll be able to comfortably wear them as your bust and belly grow.\n- Fit for every stage: Pieces that have plenty of stretch, or have thoughtful features like ruching, for example, are more likely to fit you throughout your entire pregnancy.\n- Adaptable post-pregnancy: Look for pieces with adjustable features and ample stretch \u2014 these will continue to fit after your baby is born, so your investment goes a long way.\n- Style: You shouldn't have to compromise your personal style during pregnancy. We've included lots of brands that make stylish maternity outfits, even if they're not made specifically for maternity wear. Make sure that whatever pieces you invest in, you feel like yourself wearing them \u2014 accentuating your favorite features, complementing your coloring, and reflecting your own preferences.\nBest overall: Bumpsuit\nBumpsuit was founded on the philosophy that just because you're pregnant, doesn't mean you can look and feel stylish \u2014 and dare we say downright sexy? Everything in this celeb-loved line is designed to fit throughout every stage of pregnancy and beyond. Thanks to the more-than-adequate level of stretch, we found Bumpsuit pieces to be just as comfortable and flattering when not quite showing at eight weeks pregnant as they are at 30 weeks pregnant with a more prominent belly.\nFrom stretch jersey onesies that can be dressed up or down to lounge sets we want to live in all weekend and chic off-the-shoulder dresses, Bumpsuit has something for just about every occasion. With sleek curve-hugging cuts and neutral palettes, the styles feel modern but timeless, and elevated without trying too hard.\nWe're especially big fans of the Bianca Dress (far left in the picture above) for everything from baby showers and weddings to date nights \u2014 as well as the best-selling Lucy Maternity Unitard (far right) for low-impact workouts and casual hangs. Also worth a mention? The ultra-versatile 2-in-1 Maxi Skirt \u2014 which also doubles as a midi tube dress.\nFor more of my favorites from the brand, see my full Bumpsuit review.\nBest budget: Old Navy\nBelieve it or not, this trusty standby retailer has a dedicated maternity line that features nearly 400 pieces at any given time \u2014 and it covers all the bases, from athleisure and pajamas to jumpsuits, skirts, and dresses suitable for more formal occasions. Best of all, nothing in the Old Navy maternity line runs above around $50, meaning you don't have to blow your budget on a few bump-friendly pieces you may not wear again post-pregnancy. It is worth noting, too, that lots of the pieces in this line are designed to fit well after you give birth. Plus, it's pretty size-inclusive, with items available up to size XXL (20).\nOne thing that stands out here is that Old Navy's shopping filters allow you to search specifically for pieces that suit your stage of pregnancy \u2014 whether that's first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, nursing, or postpartum. Filter for nursing products, for example, and you'll find dozens of camisoles, sports bras, tanks, and hoodies that allow for easy access when it's time to breastfeed or pump.\nWe love Old Navy for the basics, like T-shirts, bike shorts, leggings, and jeans. The Maternity CloudComfy Cami Athletic Dress is perfect for a spring or summer afternoon running errands \u2014 it's made with ultra-soft moisture-wicking material and features a built-in shelf bra, adjustable straps, and bike shorts for added support and coverage. Another piece that wowed us is the Occasion by Old Navy Maternity Asymmetrical Shoulder Maxi Dress, which looks a lot more expensive than it actually is, flatters every body type, and features shirred sides for a flexible fit during and after pregnancy.\nBest for basics: Ingrid + Isabel\nBuilding out the foundation of your maternity wardrobe is a breeze with Ingrid + Isabel, a line that offers every must-have you can think of from nursing-friendly tanks and jumpsuits to comfy leggings and cotton dresses. These products are made with high-quality fabrics, designed to grow with you, fit true to size, and in some cases, are still wearable post-pregnancy.\nFor spring and summer walks, travel excursions, and Yoga and Pilates classes, we've been reaching for the Short Maternity Active Unitard Jumpsuit, which is made with buttery soft fabric and truly feels like a second skin. The day-to-night EveryWear Bodycon Maternity Dress is a no-brainer for quick transitions from daytime errands to evening outings.\nBy the way \u2014 if you're on a budget, or value sustainable fashion, be sure to check out the Pre-Loved section of the site, where you can find loads of very gently worn Ingrid + Isabel pieces.\nFor more of our favorite basics, see our article on the best basics brands.\nBest for dresses: Show Me Your Mumu\nWhile it's true that Show Me Your Mumu isn't solely a maternity line, it does offer an impressive collection of maternity dresses and jumpsuits \u2014 and even has a dedicated category for wedding guest dresses. Whether you're looking for a flowy frock to bring on your upcoming babymoon, or a luxe satin gown for a formal affair, this brand has you covered for every occasion. Best of all, every single piece is still wearable after your pregnancy is over.\nShow Me Your Mumu is size-inclusive, with many items available from XXS to 3X. From little black dresses to vibrant floral maxis, the brand has plenty of options for any and every style sensibility. Chrissy Teigen, Millie Bobby Brown, Kate Hudson, and Jessica Alba are just a few celebrities who have been spotted wearing this line.\nOne of our favorite pieces is the Tropez Maxi \u2014 you can just as easily wear it with flat sandals for resort dinners as you can pair it with heels and statement jewelry for a black-tie wedding. Other best-sellers that are perfect for dressier events include the Romance Ruffle Dress and Jasmine Halter Mini Dress. Looking for something a little more casual? The beachy and boho-inspired Long Weekend Maxi is lightweight, comfy, and fits true to size.\nA bonus? Many of these pieces double as postpartum clothing options.\nBest for loungewear and bras: Kindred Bravely\nThis brand was born when cofounder Deeanne Akerson couldn't find a good pair of nursing pajamas, so she designed her own. Nowadays, though, Kindred Bravely offers more than just PJs \u2014 including maternity leggings, joggers, lounge shorts, and underwear, as well as a wide selection of everyday dresses, tank tops, and nightgowns that allow for easy and convenient nursing. Basically, these are the kinds of comfy pieces you'll be living in during your third trimester, post-labor recovery, and even after pregnancy.\nWe were instantly sold on the Grow with Me Maternity & Postpartum Legging and matching Grow with Me Maternity & Nursing Tank. This incredibly breathable set stretches with you all the way up to delivery \u2014 without stretching out so much that you can't wear it post-partum. The tank, it's also worth mentioning, pulls down easily for convenient feedings. Another standout item is the Olivia Ribbed Bamboo 2-in-1 Maternity & Nursing Dress, which includes a jersey bump-enhancing bodycon dress and crop tee to layer over it \u2014 both of which can be worn separately or mixed and matched with other pieces. The moisture-wicking fabric kept us cool on sweltering days, and the hidden inner button helps to secure the dress to the top so there's no slippage or straps peeking out.\nThe Universal Labor & Delivery Gown is definitely a hospital delivery bag must-have, with the softness of your favorite T-shirt; a front opening for fetal monitoring, ultrasounds, and skin-to-skin contact; and a back opening for epidural placement. Plus, post-childbirth, it also serves as a nursing gown with snaps along the shoulders for instant breastfeeding access.\nThe Sublime Hands-Free Pumping & Nursing Bra is a consistent bestseller and after testing we totally understand the hype \u2014 it features four-way stretch and adjustable straps to accommodate changing breast size, a patented double-layer system for ultimate feeding flexibility, and removable padding for customized coverage. Not to mention, it fits all pump flanges.\nBest for workwear: Seraphine\nFor years now, Seraphine has remained one of the most beloved maternity brands \u2014 and it's easy to see why. Every piece oozes timeless sophistication and features thoughtful design details that allow them to stretch, contract, and evolve with your changing body. Plus, the line offers loads of office-ready options, from shirt dresses to structured trousers.\nOne worthy investment is the Lexa Matt-Coated Maternity Leggings. These are not your average maternity leggings, thanks to the edgy faux leather material \u2014 they're polished enough to wear to the office with a sweater and flats or out for a dinner date with heels and a blouse. The stretchy over-bump panel ensures you have plenty of room to grow, and the secure high-waisted back ensures they stay up all day and night. We love that these come in numbered sizes (2 to 16) rather than traditional XS-XXL sizes, allowing for a more personalized and accurate fit. Something to keep in mind: These run a tad tight in the thighs, so we recommend opting for one size up from what you typically wear.\nThe Esme Linen Mix Zip-Front Maternity & Nursing Jumpsuit is another work-appropriate essential, with a waist-defining detachable belt, side pockets, and even a concealed front zipper for discreet nursing access. Meanwhile, the ultra-feminine and featherlight Alania Button-Through V-Neck Maternity & Nursing Dress can work for professional settings and romantic dates alike, with an elasticized back and self-tie for a customized fit and button-down design to allow for quick feeding sessions.\nSee our article on the best women's workwear for our favorite picks from brands that we love.\nBest for working out: Beyond Yoga\nBeyond Yoga has long been an influencer and celebrity favorite athleisure line \u2014 Jennifer Lopez and Kendall Jenner are both fans \u2014 and their maternity collection definitely doesn't disappoint. Whether you prefer to work out in leggings and tees, bike shorts and tanks, or jumpsuits and hoodies, Beyond Yoga has options. The brand even has a Beyond Birth collection that includes nursing camis, bras, and tees.\nYou can't go wrong with the Spacedye Love the Bump Midi Maternity Legging which can be worn over or under the bump and is stretchy enough to allow for maximum mobility, or the Spacedye Bases Covered Maternity Tank, which features a supportive built-in bra and racerback design and shirred sides to expand with your growing bump. Our top-favorite piece, hands down, is the Spacedye Uplevel Maternity Jumpsuit, which is designed to fit through every stage of pregnancy as well as postpartum.\nBest for jeans: Paige\nBy now, odds are you've heard of Paige \u2014 while the brand now makes dresses, outerwear, shoes, accessories, and more, it all started with well-made jeans. Fortunately for those of us with a baby on the way, the denim line has expanded to include maternity options. And from skinny jeans to cropped flares, there's a style for everyone.\nMaternity jeans are notorious for being awkward-looking and ill-fitting, but that's definitely not the case with Paige's offerings. What we love most about Paige maternity jeans is that, unlike so many other brands, they feature two modest elastic inset panels on the sides rather than one giant panel that wraps all the way around the front of the waistband. So, they don't scream maternity \u2014 in fact, at first glance, they just look like regular ol' jeans.\nFrom the moment I slipped on the Anessa Maternity Wide Leg Jean, I was smitten. The mid-rise sits right under the bump and the legs hit at the perfect place on the ankle to show off some cute footwear. We also appreciate that they come in two different inseam lengths \u2014 27 inches for those of us who are 5'4 and under and 31\" for taller folks. We highly recommend sticking with your regular pre-pregnancy size\nThe Colette Crop Maternity Flare Jean is a great pick for spring and summer \u2014 it has a slightly lower rise and fits slimmer through the leg with a cropped length and cute kick flare at the bottom. But you can never go wrong with a pair of dark wash straight-leg jeans, and the Noella Maternity Straight Jean combines a vintage-inspired wash with a modern-looking cut for the best of both worlds.\nBest for casual wear: PinkBlush Maternity\nYou could easily build an entire maternity wardrobe solely by shopping at this trendy online store \u2014 it features nearly 6,500 items ranging from tops, dresses, and skirts to nursing loungewear and swimsuits. Another perk to PinkBlush Maternity is that they have a dedicated plus-size shop with pieces that are available up to size 3X. PinkBlush has plenty of special occasion outfits, but where the brand really shines is with everyday clothes \u2014 like basic T-shirts, cardigans, and jersey dresses.\nWe've had a lot of trouble finding a solid pair of maternity jean shorts, and PinkBlush finally delivered with the Blue Distressed Petite Maternity Denim Shorts, which combine a visually appealing frayed hem and distressed detailing with a super stretchy belly band for optimum comfort. Another solid alternative if you're average to tall in height are the PinkBlush Blue Cuffed Maternity Denim Shorts, which have the advantage of some decent stretch in the hip area. We found that these jean shorts run a bit small, so consider going up one size from what you typically wear.\nThe Seamless Maternity Tank Top has also become a go-item for layering or just wearing on its own with shorts, jeans, and skirts \u2014 it's got adequate stretch to accommodate my ever-expanding belly but no distinctive \"maternity\" details like ruching, so I know I can wear it post-pregnancy, too. Thanks to the thick fabric and light compression, it has a subtle smoothing and shaping effect, too.\nBest non-maternity but bump-friendly: Petal & Pup\nAlthough Petal & Pup isn't specifically a maternity brand, the shop does offer an extensive collection of bump-friendly items \u2014 and an easy filter to search for them.\nThe Annette Puff Sleeve Midi Dress \u2014 which is a great pick for photoshoots and baby showers \u2014 is a perfect example. The elasticized shirred bodice can stretch with your bust throughout pregnancy, and the A-line skirt leaves plenty of room for your growing bump. We were super impressed with how well-fitting and flattering this dress is \u2014 and best of all, it can be worn long after pregnancy is over. Another standout bump-friendly option is the Linsey Strapless Midi Dress, which is made with ultra-breathable 100% cotton and features a relaxed fit from the waist down so there's plenty of space for a bump of any size. This dress offers peak versatility: It can be dressed down with flat sandals for a backyard barbecue, or dressed up with wedges and hoops for a beach wedding.\nWe also love the wide-leg white Allyse Pants, which work during pregnancy due to the adjustable drawstring waistband. These are great to throw on over a swimsuit at lunchtime, but they can also be worn out to dinner with the right footwear and accessories.\nFinally, the Wilson Short Set is another winner in our book. The elastic-waist shorts can be worn under or over the bump, and the matching button-down tee is loose-fitting enough to be worn buttoned or open. It doubles as both a cute beach coverup as well as PJs that'll keep you cool during the sweltering months.\nMaternity wardrobe essentials checklist\nHow many items in each clothing category you opt to buy will probably depend on the season you're pregnant and your everyday lifestyle. However, this list is a good starting point that covers all the basics.\n- 2\u20143 pairs of maternity leggings \u2014 including options suitable for exercise\n- 1\u20142 pairs of jeans/pants\n- 4\u20146 everyday tops that are either flowy or stretchy enough to accommodate the bump (tanks and tees in the summer, long-sleeve shirts, blouses, and sweaters in the winter)\n- 2\u20143 dresses that are versatile enough for casual as well as dressy events\n- 1 more formal special occasion dress or jumpsuit for showers, weddings, etc.\n- 2-3 nursing bras (depending on how often you do laundry)\n- 2 comfy loungewear or PJ sets\n- 1 bump-friendly coat or jacket for winter pregnancies\n- 2 swimsuits for spring/summer pregnancies (these come in handy post-partum, too)\n- Nursing gown/robe (particularly helpful for recovery immediately after delivery)\nCertainly, not all maternity clothing is created equal. By shopping with the right brands and choosing thoughtfully designed items, though, dressing during pregnancy doesn't have to entail compromising on comfort or style. As a general rule, the best maternity clothes are made with breathable fabrics, feature a touch of stretch, and offer generous room to grow.\nThe key to smart maternity shopping is to focus on investing in a few well-fitting pieces you know you'll wear on repeat during your pregnancy \u2014 like, say, a supportive pair of leggings, a versatile day-to-night dress, and a comfy loungewear set. Better yet, to get more bang for your buck, look for items that will continue to fit in postpartum and beyond.\nFAQs and buying tips\nWhen should I start wearing maternity clothes?\nThe rate at which pregnant bodies change can vary quite a bit \u2014 for those who \"pop\" early, it might be necessary to start switching to maternity clothes as early as 12 weeks. Others might find that they're able to mostly get by with their pre-pregnancy clothes until about halfway through the second trimester, around weeks 20-24.\nThe bottom line? The right time to start wearing maternity clothes is when your current wardrobe no longer makes you feel comfortable and confident.\nCan I size up instead of buying maternity-specific styles?\nIf you're looking to avoid investing in maternity-specific pieces \u2014 which may not fit right any longer after childbirth \u2014 buying a size up from your normal size is a great alternative. Note that this method doesn't always work, though. For example, in the case of jeans, I've found that they still feel too tight even when sizing up, unless it's a low-rise style that sits under the bump.\nHowever, when it comes to more forgiving items with stretch like T-shirts, jersey dresses, and drawstring shorts or pants, opting for a size up usually works during pregnancy.\nDo maternity clothes run true to size?\nThe majority of maternity brands recommend buying your pre-pregnancy size. So, if you normally wear a medium, start there when shopping for maternity clothes. That said, it's always best to check the brand's size chart for exact guidance on whether you need to size up or down.\nIt can also be helpful to read customer reviews \u2014 which may offer helpful insight as to whether a particular pair of maternity denim shorts runs small in the waist, or a maternity swimsuit top runs more roomy in the bust.\nAre maternity clothes worth it if I'm only pregnant once?\nUltimately, this all comes down to your budget and preferences. Certainly, maternity clothes can provide a more comfortable, supportive, and flattering fit, helping you to embrace the physical changes you're undergoing. That said, if you're able to find cute, comfy pieces that still fit well simply by sizing up, you may decide that maternity clothes aren't worth shelling out for.\nIt also depends on your lifestyle. Pregnant people who live in leggings and dresses are more likely to find non-maternity clothes that work. Conversely, those who love to wear jeans, or work out very frequently, might find that they need to invest in some maternity-specific items that accommodate their growing bellies.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/best-nightgowns",
      "text": "The summer of 2025 is the summer of pajamas as real clothing. Walk around SoHo or Brooklyn, and you'll see tons of New York City's tastemakers wearing boxers as shorts. Often, these are paired with a long-sleeved button-down in what I call the \"Skype interview\" or Risky Business aesthetic.\nSo it stands to reason that nightgowns are the next bedroom staple to emerge from the intimates drawer and onto the city streets. Credit this to Sabrina Carpenter's tour wardrobe, influencer Harling Ross' collaboration with nightdress brand If Only If, the rise of a vintage, romantic aesthetic, or even the simple fact that we deserve a break from fitted waistbands.\nAll of these dresses (minus the last one, which is made from a linen blend) are 100% cotton. Once you go 100% cotton, it's almost impossible to return to the stifling polyester blends that are so common in sundresses. Cotton \u2014 especially cotton poplin \u2014 is breathable, light, and feels great against your skin.\nAll these nightgowns function as some of the best pajamas, even if you choose to wear them as a dress. And they're perfect for hot sleepers in the summer who want the best cooling pajamas for temperature regulation.\nA short, breezy choice that isn't see-through at all\nThe Alice Nightgown from Lake is made from a seersucker material that stays crisp and cool. I got it in the more nightdress-adjacent white color, but there are other colorways, like nautical blue or mint green, that look a little more like real dresses.\nHow it feels to wear as a dress: I want all my dresses to feel this breathable and light. The Alice Nightgown basically floats around your body, with no uncomfortable necklines or even rough seams. When there's inevitably a day in the summer when it's so humid that breathing outside feels like gulping steam, this is the dress I will reach for. Not only does the white version not show sweat, but the fabric is also cool to the touch and supremely airy.\nThis nightgown is also pretty opaque. While some of the dresses on this list lean into the casual sheerness of cotton, the seersucker material keeps this from being translucent, even in direct sunlight.\nHow it feels to sleep in it: I mentioned above that when the humidity hits, this is the first dress I'll be wearing outside. So I have a feeling that this piece will be constantly in the wash, because this would be my choice for hot, sticky nights as well. Trust me, sleeping in front of the fan in this crisp, thin-strapped dress will be a much more pleasant experience than sleeping in an old T-shirt that's probably made with nonporous synthetics. Fabrics make all the difference when it comes to temperature control.\nWhat I wore it with:\nThe elegant vintage gown that's too pretty to just wear to bed\nWhen I walk around in The Kayla from Eileen West, I feel like a heroine from a bygone era. Granted, the heroine of a Jane Austen novel would never use this nightgown as an outside dress \u2014 but she would have a great scene brushing her hair in front of an antique vanity while wearing it.\nHow it feels to wear as a dress: Modest dressers, be warned that this pick is a little see-through. It's not overly transparent, but you can see the outline of your legs in direct sunlight. Personally, I'm all for enjoying the breezy, sheet-like feel of the dress and leaning into the subtle sheerness. Nude underwear is definitely a must, though.\nI love wearing this out in the summer. It's perfect for picnics, brunches in the sunshine, and holding a baguette and flowers as you dreamily walk through the farmers market. Unlike some of the more modern cuts, this nightgown has a distinct vintage feel that's fun to lean into.\nHow it feels to sleep in it: Since I have a larger bust, this wouldn't be my first choice for sleeping. The lace neckline \u2014 while beautiful \u2014 makes this a little tight under my arms and around my chest. Unbuttoning the first two buttons solves this problem pretty well and makes it comfortable enough to be a daytime dress, but I think it would tug at me if I tried to sleep in it. If you don't have a larger bust, though, this shouldn't be a concern.\nWhat I wore it with:\nA cottagecore number with Swiss dots and delicate florals\nWith a pattern of tiny blue flowers and a ruffled neckline, the Elizabeth Nightgown is what cottagecore dreams are made of. It makes me wish I had a garden and a sourdough loaf in the oven.\nHow it feels to wear as a dress: On the scale of transparent to opaque, this definitely errs on the side of transparent. If you want to wear it as a dress, pairing it with a nude slip (or even a skirt slip) is a good idea.\nThe aesthetic itself is definitely on par with ultra-feminine trends like hair bows and Mary Janes. Plus, the general vibe is reminiscent of trend-making brands like Hill House (but the dresses and nightgowns there will run you around $200, compared to $74 for Eileen West).\nHow it feels to sleep in it: Because the fabric is a little more sheer, it's also ultra breezy, which makes it good for summer nights. Initially, I had my doubts about sleeping in this gown because of the raised Swiss Dots and the longer length. But even though it's a full-length dress, I had no issues tossing and turning in this at night. And the Swiss Dots didn't cause me any annoyance at all, even though I'm a sensitive sleeper.\nWhat I wore it with:\nThe perfect dress for cosplaying as a Victorian ghost\nThis dress from Petite Plume was my nightgown gateway drug. I wore it once to bed. And then again to work from home the next day. And then right into bed again. It makes me look like a chic vintage ghost, and I love that about it.\nHow it feels to wear as a dress: The Ava Nightgown isn't very see-through, so it's ready for the streets even with no slip (although it is still a nightgown, so it's not 100% opaque). But it's quite a versatile dress. You can wear the sleeves off the shoulder or keep the square neckline. Personally, I love how it looks off the shoulder, but I can't bring myself to wear a restricting strapless bra with a dress that's meant to be comfy and breezy. It would also look great with a thin belt to give it some shape.\nHow it feels to sleep in it: Wonderful. It's comfortable, loose enough that nothing is tugging at you, and has no extra design details that are for aesthetics rather than comfort. It does get wrinkled in bed, though, but that's expected with 100% cotton.\nWhat I wore it with:\nAn embroidered pick that's fully opaque\nThis is the only nightgown on this list that's not 100% cotton. It's a mix of cotton and linen, which is the only acceptable \"cotton blend\" that we will stand for. The material on this one isn't as soft and billowy as the others, but it is considerably more opaque. It's also from one of our favorite up-and-coming clothing brands, Damsen Madder, a London-based label.\nHow it feels to wear as a dress: If you're tall, this will be more like a shirt on you. I'm just under five feet two inches, and even I could use an extra inch or two on the hem. But despite it being a little short, I still get tons of use out of it as a dress. It's what I pull on when I'm crossing the street to get a coffee or walking my dog. Plus, I love the look of the babydoll silhouette with a cute pair of Mary Janes.\nHow it feels to sleep in it: If you want to wear it to bed, I would recommend sizing up a bit. The neckline is a little restricting, so those who thrash about in their sleep might find it a little too uncomfortable. I've also found that the material isn't as breathable as the other picks on this list, so it traps heat in a bit more.\nWhat I wore it with:\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

      "text": "For some people, sleeping in their favorite old t-shirt and hole-ridden sweatpants is what works for them. Now there's certainly nothing wrong with wearing what makes you feel the most comfortable. However, if you're ready for an upgrade, you can curate a nighttime routine with our lineup of the best pajamas for women ranging from gorgeous nightgowns to silk sets so that you can inject a little indulgence into your bedtime ritual.\nWe've rounded up the best pajamas for women, whether it's a cozy classic PJ set or pieces you can mix and match. We tested tons of pajamas from dozens of brands, including options for cooling, cotton, and everything in between.\nFor more pajama coverage, see our pieces on the best silk pajamas and the best cooling pajamas.\nBest overall: Tommy John Downtime Pajamas\nHaving tested and reviewed Tommy John's collection of basics and undergarments, our team can safely say that they have the best pajamas for women out there. Their fabrics are uniquely soft and breathable, serving as an excellent choice for any kind of sleeper.\nThe Downtime Pajamas also come with tons of thoughtful, comfort-forward details like a tagless label (a brilliant innovation that I wish more pajama brands would incorporate) and a waistband that isn't too tight.\nHere's what I said about the Downtime Pajamas in our Tommy John loungewear review: \"It's all about the details with the downtime pajama set. For example, it has a tagless label. It's also made with fabric that has a four-way stretch, which we mostly see in fabric used for high-quality leggings and athletic wear. This four-way stretch material means that you can comfortably sprawl out in bed without having to wear a huge T-shirt to sleep. Instead, you can don this put-together set that feels similar but looks way better at breakfast.\n\"I get warm when I sleep, so I'm also a huge fan of how cooling these pajamas are. They're super breathable and a great choice for both summer and winter sleeping. Plus, they definitely hold up in the wash. No pilling or shrinking here.\"\nBest silk pajamas: Eberjey Inez Washable Silk Pajamas\nI've tested almost every silk brand on the market, and Eberjey is my absolute favorite. Here's what I said about the Inez sets in my review of the best silk pajamas.\n\"Eberjey's silk is beautifully billowy and cool to the touch. It's made of 16 momme, grade 6A silk, which is some of the highest quality around. And one touch will tell you all you need to know about how luxurious this set is, especially compared to some of the lower-cost pajamas on this list. It's expensive, but you get what you're paying for.\n\"There are two versions of the Inez set. I had originally tested the long-sleeve and long pant version, which I love dearly but the arms and legs were a little long for my five-foot-one frame. The fabric is still the same luxurious silk, but having to roll the pants and sleeves up prevented it from being my go-to.\n\"But I absolutely live in the Inez Washable Silk Short Set. It is so light and soft that it feels like silk is floating on my body. I got the printed version in the blue and white Wedgewood pattern (as an antique enthusiast, this little detail made it even more special).\n\"I almost had to force myself to wear anything other than this set. The fit is perfect on me, and the fabric is pure luxury. But like all silk, it takes a little bit of effort to launder and de-wrinkle. However, this set makes it all worth it.\"\nSee our full Eberjey pajama review to hear more about our non-silk favorites from the brand.\nBest printed: BedHead Knit Cotton Stretch Pajamas\nBedHead's line of Knit Cotton Stretch Pajamas are the best printed pajamas we've ever tested. Unlike other brands of printed pajamas, which tend to be made of stiffer material, these are incredibly soft.\nIf you're someone who likes to starfish in bed, rest assured that you'll be able to sprawl as much as you want in this super stretchy fabric. In fact, these might be the stretchiest on this list.\nI love the unique designs that BedHead comes up with. Yes, they have a whole host of Christmas pajamas, but there are also other quirky designs like \"Party Animals\" and an ode to espresso martinis.\nThe pajamas are also super washable. I've never experienced pilling, even after laundering the sets multiple times and putting them through the dryer.\nBest luxury: Ravella Amore Silk Pajamas\nIf you want to fall asleep like an Italian heiress, Ravella's pajamas are perfect for you.\nI never thought I would describe pajamas as beautifully tailored, but these are the exception. Unlike most pajamas that tend to be looser-fitting and shapeless, Ravella's Amore Silk Set is perfectly fitted. If you want your pajamas to be baggier, I suggest sizing up. But I love the fact that these are elevated, not only by the luxurious material but also by the aesthetically-minded cut.\nThe silk itself is beautifully shiny and perfectly airy. Since it's silk, it does require some upkeep, like air-drying and steaming out wrinkles. But it's hard to imagine electing to sleep in anything synthetic after testing Ravella's natural, mulberry silk sleepwear.\nSoftest material: Stripe and Stare Soft Brushed Woven Pajamas\nI have lots of criteria for the best pajamas for women. Of course, pajamas have to be comfortable. But there are lots of factors that go into making a truly comfortable set.\nMy favorite part about the Soft Brushed Woven Pajamas is the waistband, which looks and feels like a boxer waistband. It's elastic, but there's no tension in the stretch when it sits on your hips \u2014 it almost floats on your body. Also, if you're a little shorter, like me, it's also easy to roll up the waist so that the pants don't drag on the floor.\nThe material is also incredibly soft to the touch, even softer than most Tencel pajamas. I'm often skeptical of non-organic fibers, but I found that these were super breathable. In fact, the brushed fabric feels almost exactly like cotton, but it has a little more stretch.\nAll in all, this set just has that extra bit of style and comfort that makes you keep coming back to it. I love the classy pinstripe design, and I know I'll be ordering the short set the moment winter is over.\nBest nightgown: Lunya Washable Silk Tulip Dress\nLunya's washable silk pajamas are celeb-favorites and Instagram darlings. And while all of Lunya's silk is great, their Tulip Nightgown is the breezy, cooling sleepwear of your dreams.\nOne of my favorite things about Lunya is the sleep-friendly features that they incorporate into their pieces. For example, this set has long side slits so your legs are free to sprawl in bed. The back of the dress also has a racerback silhouette, so your shoulders and arms are unrestricted.\nLunya is also great at making their silk actually washable. I've tested tons of silk pajamas and not all of them hold up after multiple washed. But this one definitely does \u2014 you may need to hit it with a steamer if you want it completely wrinkle-free, though.\nSee our Lunya washable silk review for our full thoughts.\nBest robe: MASONgrey Kaia Kimono Robe\nThis robe is a true lounge robe. If you're like me and you love to sit around in a robe but often find that bathrobes get too bulky and warm once you've dried off, then this is the perfect solution.\nMASONgrey's Kaia Kimono Robe is a chic, comfy dream. I wear it after an evening shower before bed or throw it over a pajama set if I get a little cold.\nIt's also incredibly wearable. It won't get in the way while you make coffee or brush your teeth. And if you want it to be even more streamlined for practical use, you can get the same robe with banded cuffs so that your sleeves are always under control.\n- Women\u2019s shoes, particularly heels and boots\n- Petite fashion\n- Workwear\n- Swimwear\n- Jewelry"
