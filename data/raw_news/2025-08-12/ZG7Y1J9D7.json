  "title": "10 things to look out for in the 2025-2026 Premier League season",
  "description": "The new Premier League campaign brings with it some interesting additions and Daily Mail Sport has chronicled them here.",
  "content": "Is it that time of year already? On Friday night, fans will flock to Anfield as champions Liverpool raise the curtain on the new Premier League season as they take on Bournemouth.\n\nIt only feels like yesterday that Virgil van Dijk was lifting the Reds' history-equalling 20th league title, with red confetti raining down around him.\n\nBut here we are, two weeks into August, and 20 teams are getting primed and ready for a new season that promises to be like no other - and where fans will be desperate for the answers to a host of burning questions.\n\nWill Arsenal finally be rid of their Bridesmaid's title? Can Pep Guardiola lead his new-look Manchester City side back to the summit? And what about Ruben Amorim's Man United? What can we expect from them?\n\nWe will find out over the next 40 weeks.\n\nThe new campaign, of course, brings with it some interesting storylines that have been crafted over the course of the summer, but there are some other additions that you should also look out for.\n\nAfter years of being berated by sections of the Reds' fanbase, owner John Henry has finally got his chequebook out this transfer window and splashed the cash. Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, and Hugo Ekitike have all come in for big fees, but the biggest of them all was the mouth-watering \u00a3116m deal they struck with Bayer Leverkusen to acquire Florian Wirtz.\n\nAll four signings, which could end up costing the club over \u00a3250million, are a signal of intent from Arne Slot and the club that they don't want last season's title triumph to be a one-off; they want this to be the start of a dynasty.\n\nAnd their spending might not be over as they continue to show interest in Alexander Isak, with the Reds already having a bid thought to be worth \u00a3110m rejected.\n\nBut will this new-look side gel? All four signings started the Community Shield on Sunday, with Wirtz and Ekitike taking just four minutes to combine for the opener. Going forward, the Reds showed glimpses of the champagne football they are capable of playing, and there is no doubt that they will have no trouble in front of goal.\n\nThe new arrivals seem, however, to have left them very open at the back - a point alluded to by Jamie Carragher during Sunday's clash.\n\nPalace's forwards had a field day on the break, with Kerkez in particular being targeted. It was a sign that Slot may need more signings, having let the likes of Jarell Quansah, Luis Diaz, and Darwin Nunez all go, while this juggernaut of a team may need time to settle as they look to defend their title.\n\nThis is going to feel weird. For the last 25 years, fans have been used to seeing teams kick around the iconic Nike ball, and boy, have there been some beauties over the last quarter century.\n\nHowever, this season the Premier League will use a ball not made by Nike, with the two severing ties at the end of the 2024-25 campaign. Instead, the Puma \u2018Orbita Ultimate\u2019 will debut as the league\u2019s official match ball when Liverpool host Bournemouth.\n\nIt's certainly different from what we are used to. It has flashy pink lines outlining 12 geometric panels that supposedly help distribute the weight and improve aerodynamics. As long as it hits the net a lot, that's all that will matter to fans.\n\nSomething tells me that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta will not be a fan of the new ball, though. Many of you may remember that he bizarrely blamed his Arsenal side\u2019s home defeat by Newcastle in last season\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-finals on the Puma ball that was used.\n\nRemember Granit Xhaka's furious response towards his own fans when the then-Arsenal captain was substituted during a game against Crystal Palace back in 2019? Now, just imagine Sky Sports reporter Patrick Davison trying to chase him down the tunnel in an attempt to interview him after that incident.\n\nTouchline interviews with substituted players and cameras inside the dressing room will feature as part of the Premier League\u2019s new \u00a36.7billion TV deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports, as broadcasters try to make their coverage more American.\n\nUnfortunately, for those who like drama, we won't get to see players like Xhaka immediately after he has sworn at his own fans, as players will be allowed to cool down before being interviewed. There will also be no access to the dressing room during team talks.\n\nIn another new innovation for the 2025-26 season, footage of goal celebrations will now look more like something from a video game as camera operators will be permitted to take to the pitch to get close-up shots of the players as they jump all over each other with joy.\n\nIf only Luis Diaz were still in the Premier League. This season, there will be no chance that the mistake that led to his goal against Tottenham in 2023 being wrongfully called offside will be allowed to happen.\n\nThe days of officials drawing lines on a screen for minutes on end, leading to moans and groans from the terraces, are long gone, as semi-automated offside technology will be in operation from the start of this season, having featured in the final seven weeks of the last campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s quick, it\u2019s clearer, and it's easy to understand. Fans won't be able to have too many complaints with this system in place, although it's not exactly perfect. It's far from it.\n\nIf the penalty area is crammed full of bodies, the software struggles, and we have to resort to the annoyingly tedious and pesky lines. The precision of the technology means that decisions may be made quickly, but it won't stop supporters taking to X to vent their fury when their striker has had a goal ruled out for a toenail being offside.\n\n5. Can Howe and Newcastle weather the Isak storm?\n\nThe Alexander Isak saga has arguably been the saga of the summer. Is he coming? Is he going? At this point, it's anybody's guess; the story seems to be changing with each passing day.\n\nIt's been a nightmare summer for Newcastle, with Isak's links to Liverpool at the centre of it. Eddie Howe has missed out on target, after target, after target as they seek potential replacements, and now it feels as though they are at panic stations in the market.\n\nAll of this is bound to have affected Howe and his players. The team failed to win a single one of their six pre-season games, and the mood around St. James' Park is subdued, to say the least.\n\nWith Champions League football back on the table for the Magpies this year, it will be interesting to see if Howe can galvanise his group of players for the challenge of Europe, as well as the Premier League, after such a troubling period for the club.\n\nNobody likes a time-waster, well, unless it's your goalkeeper doing it while your team is 1-0 up in stoppage time of an important game, then that's OK. Well, it's not OK anymore.\n\nGoalkeepers are no longer going to be able to run down the clock following a significant change to the law, which means they now have just eight seconds to release the ball. If they do not, then the referee will award the opposition a corner - and they could also be booked.\n\nThe funny thing is, the old rule only allowed keepers six seconds before they were supposed to be penalised with an indirect free-kick, so if anything, goalkeepers are getting cut some more slack. The problem was, the referees never actually enforced it.\n\nThe new rule, however, was enforced at the summer\u2019s Club World Cup for the first time, and it certainly baffled players who ended up being caught out. Mamelodi Sundowns keeper Ronwen Williams held on to the ball for too long against Ulsan HD, and the referee awarded a corner.\n\nWhile Ruben Amorim had a whole raft of problems to contend with last season, perhaps the biggest one of them all was a distinct lack of goals.\n\nThe Red Devils were in desperate need of an attacking reboot after scoring just 44 Premier League goals in 38 games last campaign, with their main man up top, Rasmus Hojlund, only netting four of those.\n\nA reboot is what they have got, with Amorim refreshing his frontline by signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko to the tune of more than \u00a3200m.\n\nThat's a lot of money to spend, but in Mbeumo and Cunha, they are gaining proven Premier League goalscorers, with the pair netting a combined 35 goals in the league last campaign. That's just nine shy of what United's whole squad managed.\n\nWhile Amorim is certainly still in need of reinforcements in midfield and defence, United's shiny new frontline should be able to propel them up the table after a dismal campaign last time out, given everything clicks. That, of course, is not guaranteed.\n\nReferees will get their own spotlight as from this season, they will announce the reasoning for VAR decisions to crowds.\n\nThe aim is for the announcements to provide greater transparency, with the man in the middle now implored to explain why they have overturned a decision after reviewing footage on the pitchside monitor.\n\nThis has already been introduced in the cup competitions, with Stuart Attwell making the first in-stadium announcement last season in the Carabao Cup semi-final between Tottenham and Liverpool.\n\nHowever, only the decisions will be relayed, not the process that has led to them, like in rugby or cricket. Broadcasting live conversations of VAR decisions being made is still outlawed by lawmakers IFAB.\n\nYou'd think after the stellar campaign that Nottingham Forest had last season \u2014 qualifying for Europe through a seventh-placed finish in the Premier League next season and being bumped up to the Europa League by the lawmakers \u2014 that there would be a good feeling around the club heading into a fresh new season.\n\nThat doesn't feel like the case, however.\n\nDespite managing to tie Morgan Gibbs-White down to a new deal, there is still an air of uncertainty over how well Nottingham Forest will do, especially now that they will have Europa League nights to contend with, after taking the place of Crystal Palace, who were demoted to the Conference League by UEFA.\n\nForest failed to win a single one of their seven pre-season matches, only scoring a single goal across the 630 minutes of action. Five of the games ended 0-0, and the electric attack that Nuno Espirito Santo built last season seems to have dissipated since the exit of Anthony Elanga to Newcastle.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis is a ruthless man and craves success. That was proven when he managed to change Gibbs-White's mind when he had one foot already inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Nuno may have credit in the back, but there is no doubt that he will have to sort things out early in the season if he is to avoid a run-in with the Greek owner.\n\nWest Brom, Norwich City, and Watford: what do all of these teams have in common? They are the traditional Premier League yo-yo teams.\n\nThese days, though, the relegation zone itself has become a yo-yo. For the past two seasons, the three teams that have been promoted to the top-flight from the Championship have been sent right back down.\n\nIt's almost as if teams are doomed from the start. Nobody believed that Leicester City, Ipswich, or Southampton had a fighting chance last season due to the sheer gulf between the top two divisions in English football, and those suspicions were practically realised by November. All three went down with a whimper.\n\nNobody wants this. Fans don't want the Premier League to become an exclusive club, where you only get a free trial before being dumped out, never to return.\n\nThis season, though, it doesn't feel like there is quite as much certainty that the promoted trio will be relegated. That's not to say that Sunderland, Burnley, and Leeds United aren't in for long and tough seasons; they just aren't the only ones.\n\nBrentford have been decimated, losing head coach Thomas Frank and main man Mbeumo, while their captain Christian Norgaard has also ditched west London. The Bees are certainly not expected to thrive quite as much as they have in recent years, while Wolves could be in danger too.",

      "text": "Why Benjamin Sesko is the final piece of Manchester United's puzzle: Inside the Iceland board summit to solve misfiring forward line, why he fits Ruben Amorim system perfectly... and why they turned him down in 2019\n- Unlock more from inside the Manchester United camp with a Mail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight, analysis and more\nWhen Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada met Sir Jim Ratcliffe at a summit in Iceland recently, they set about tackling a glaring problem: their team could not score goals.\nManchester United, known worldwide for free-flowing football and 'attack, attack, attack' were the fifth-lowest scorers in the Premier League last season, with nobody hitting double figures.\nOnly three players in Ruben Amorim's team scored more than four league goals and strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee - brought in for a combined \u00a3115million - hit just seven between them. And so director of football Wilcox and CEO Berrada went to work.\nMatheus Cunha arrives on the back of 15 league goals at Wolves last season, and Bryan Mbeumo hit 20 for Brentford. But Amorim and United wanted more.\nThat is why they have gone so hard for Benjamin Sesko, the \u00a374million man who has scored more goals in Europe's top five leagues (39) than any other player under the age of 23 in the last two years. He is just in front of Jude Bellingham (38), Florian Wirtz (34) and Jamal Musiala (33) in that regard, which is decent company to keep.\nThe hope is that Sesko is the final piece of a jigsaw that is being carefully constructed. Not a Hail Mary attempt at success.\nBenjamin Sesko may be the last piece of a Manchester United jigsaw if he joins from RB Leipzig\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund cost a combined \u00a3115million for just four league goals\nWhat Sesko would bring most significantly is a presence and a threat in the air that United have so badly lacked in recent years, with Hojlund too easy to bully off the ball.\nUnited ranked dead last for headed goals in the Premier League last season with just four. Across the past two seasons, that total is 12. Sesko, at 6ft 5in and with a trademark gigantic leap from his days as a basketball-obsessed kid, has scored eight on his own in that same period in the Bundesliga.\nSesko will bring pace too - a key attribute Amorim is seeking to help drive the team up the pitch and to stretch the play. Last season his top speed of 22.18mph put him 26th among 492 players in the Bundesliga. The year before he was 15th-quickest.\nHis arrival would allow Cunha and Mbeumo to play as No 10s - neither having to masquerade as a No 9 - in Amorim's 3-4-3 system and for Bruno Fernandes to conduct the play from a deeper position. It would allow for a more attacking setup with Amad Diallo at wing back and just one defensive-minded midfielder next to Fernandes.\n\u2018His potential is unlimited,\u2019 Mirsad Mujakic, who coached Sesko at Under 15s level with NK Krsko, tells Mail Sport.\n\u2018I believe he can be even better than (Erling) Haaland because he is a such a hard worker. He will do everything and more to succeed.\n\u2018That's why I think he will quickly show in England why he is among the best strikers in the world.\u2019\nMujakic also scoffs at the idea that Sesko, who scored 21 goals for RB Leipzig last season, is a gamble that could backfire for United, who paid a similar fee for Hojlund only to see him struggle in the Premier League spotlight.\nSesko will look to link up with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha\n\u2018We all understand what the English league means across the world, that it is the best league in the world and that the smallest details make all the difference,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018That\u2019s why I think he's the right person for the Premier League with his work ethic and his lifestyle. Anyone who doubts his quality will change their mind after a few games.\u2019\nIf Ratcliffe had his way in the transfer market, he would have United swing for potential every time.\n\u2018What I would rather do is find the next (Kylian) Mbappe, rather than spend a fortune just trying to buy success. It's not that clever, is it, buying Mbappe, in a way?\u2019 Ratcliffe mused on a podcast last year.\n\u2018Anybody could figure that one out. But what's much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe, the next (Jude) Bellingham or the next Roy Keane. The solution isn\u2019t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They\u2019ve done that, if you look at the last 10 years.\n\u2018The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes, managing and organising the club. We must make sure we get recruitment right. Such a vital part of running a football club is getting recruitment right, finding new players.\u2019\nThis mindset chafed with that of Amorim, who made it known to the powers that be that time was not on his or this team\u2019s side. He needed Premier League-proven players who could hit the ground running in August.\nIt was why Amorim so badly wanted Cunha from Wolves and Mbeumo of Brentford. It was why Amorim was leaning towards a move for 29-year-old Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins after Wilcox pushed for 22-year-old Liam Delap, and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell lobbied for Sesko. In the end, Vivell won out.\nChristopher Vivell is United's director of recruitment and has spent big to fix their forward line\nSesko first went to Red Bull Salzburg when he left his homeland, then to RB Leipzig in 2023\nAlthough United\u2019s interest in Sesko stretches back six years to when he was a wiry teenager playing for NK Domzale in Slovenia, the role of Vivell here cannot be understated.\nIt is three years to the week since Vivell, who became director of recruitment at United in February, pulled off the deal to bring Sesko to Leipzig, having previously masterminded his move to Red Bull Salzburg in 2019.\nAt the time of the Leipzig deal, Vivell said: \u2018Sesko is among the top international talents and has enormous potential to become a top player. He has everything it takes, is extremely fast, has tremendous jumping ability and is very strong in the air.\u2019\nRatcliffe admires and trusts Vivell\u2019s player-identification skills and his concerted push for Sesko above all other striker targets has not gone unnoticed.\nCredited with identifying Dayot Upamecano, Karim Adeyemi, Josko Gvardiol, Dominik Szoboszlai, Sesko, Ibrahima Konate, Patson Daka, Hwang Hee-chan and, to a lesser extent, Haaland, trust in Vivell from Ineos is clear to see.\nThis is a swing for potential by United, make no mistake. The fee is high - \u00a365.1m plus \u00a38.7m in add-ons - and is not quite how Ratcliffe\u2019s dream was explained in that podcast a year ago.\nThe potential upside is that of a genuine, bona fide superstar. The downside is of a player who gets totally overwhelmed by English football, as with Hojlund.\nThey could have had him for a tiny fraction of that \u00a374m total fee six years ago, but he wasn't a gamble Manchester United were willing to take when Domzale sought \u20ac2million (\u00a31.74m). Instead they swung for Ajax\u2019s Dillon Hoogewerf as the future superstar-in-waiting.\nUnited overlooked Sesko six years ago and signed Dillon Hoogewerf (centre) instead\nSesko went to Red Bull Salzburg instead and lit it up, scoring 29 goals in 79 games and winning three Austrian Bundesliga titles. Hoogewerf signed his first professional contract in March 2020 but left for Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s reserves in 2022 without ever looking like fulfilling his potential for United's first team.\nThree years later and it was Sesko not willing to take the gamble. \u2018For a lot of players the desire for money and a big club takes over, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s better to take a smaller step first and build yourself up gradually,\u2019 he said in 2023 on his way to Leipzig. \u2018That way you get minutes, keep developing and eventually reach the top level when you\u2019re truly ready.\u2019\nHe described himself then as being at 60 per cent of his potential. Now United are all-in on having Sesko as the centrepiece of their Project 150 vision to win the Premier League by 2028, the club\u2019s 150th anniversary year.\nIn Ayden Heaven (18), Diego Leon (18), Leny Yoro (19) and Patrick Dorgu (20), Ineos are swinging at potential in a bid to turn Manchester United around, and Sesko fits that theme too.\nAsked at RB Leipzig how to turn around a club in crisis, Vivell was clear and concise. \u2018Three things: a good team, a good coach and a good plan,\u2019 he said. Now the swing for Sesko will tell us just how good a team, coach and plan Manchester United really have."
