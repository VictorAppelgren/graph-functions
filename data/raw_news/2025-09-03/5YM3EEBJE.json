  "description": "iOS 26 brings a welcome change to the Messages app when using CarPlay, fixing one of the most annoying limitations by supporting tapbacks.",
  "content": "It\u2019s turning out to be a huge year for CarPlay, surprising many of us after years of middling updates. Among the host of new CarPlay features coming in iOS 26, there\u2019s a key fix for what\u2019s long been the most annoying Messages issue for me: the lack of tapbacks support.\n\nEver since Apple unveiled the \u201cnext generation of CarPlay\u201d in 2022, new updates for the standard CarPlay experience have been fairly underwhelming.\n\nBut things are starting to change, with CarPlay Ultra\u2019s launch finally arriving and iOS 26 bringing a packed lineup of new CarPlay features.\n\nOne such feature is the kind of low-hanging fruit that serves as perfect evidence of CarPlay\u2019s previous lack of attention from Apple.\n\nTapbacks are a core feature of the Messages app, and have been since they debuted almost a decade ago in iOS 10.\n\nYet until now, you could never send tapbacks over CarPlay.\n\nThis has proven especially annoying for me personally, as my typical Messages conversations almost always end with a tapback.\n\nUsing a thumbs up, heart, or laughing emoji has become extremely common for me. It\u2019s a way to acknowledge the previous message but also intentionally not continue the conversation.\n\nNow with iOS 26, tapbacks are finally supported in CarPlay\u2019s Messages app.\n\nThe same simple convenience of tapbacks on the iPhone will be available inside the car too.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only Messages change: pinned conversations are now supported too.\n\nThese features join the variety of other iOS 26 upgrades coming to the Messages app on iPhone.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Apple\u2019s renewed CarPlay efforts are a sign that Apple won\u2019t let similarly core app features, like tapbacks, go absent from the car for so long moving forward.\n\nAre you excited for CarPlay to support tapbacks in Messages? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $199, down from $249)",

      "text": "Turns out you don\u2019t need an Aston Martin to have a new CarPlay experience in 2025. That\u2019s because iOS 26 brings a fresh coat of paint and some new features to CarPlay for everyone.\nLiquid Glass design\nThe most obvious change is essentially a new theme that mirrors Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design language used on iPhone. In CarPlay, Liquid Glass is present from app appearance options to buttons and other interface elements.\nCarPlay icons now support these appearance modes: Default, Dark, and Clear. Clear is the super glassy look with options for Light, Dark, or Auto. The new Clear Dark option is my early favorite.\nHere\u2019s a quick shot of the Can-Am Pulse electric motorcycle I\u2019m testing\u2026\niPhone widgets on CarPlay\nWidgets can now appear on CarPlay, including from third-party apps on iPhone that do not have CarPlay versions. Widgets on CarPlay look a lot like StandBy widgets on iPhone since the technology is shared.\nCarPlay widget stacks can be configured from the iPhone in the Settings app under General > CarPlay > My Car > Widgets. In addition to configuring which app widgets appear, you can toggle widgets on/off, toggle wallpaper on/off, toggle widget suggestions on/off, and toggle rotation on/off.\nIn my example, only a single widget stack is supported. However, wider screen systems can have additional stacks that can be configured independently. Apple shares an example:\nWith the addition of widgets, the default app grid moves to the third CarPlay home screen. Widgets appear on the first, leftmost home screen. Dashboard is second and immediately left of the app grid view. Then the app grid view begins on page three and extends based on how many CarPlay apps are installed.\nLive Activities in Dashboard\nSpeaking of Dashboard, the second home screen is where tiles for Live Activities will appear when active, squeezing in on the bottom right side.\nThis is the part where I would show you the Uber Eats example I screenshotted earlier today, but CarPlay screenshots are now off by default. Enable CarPlay screenshots from Settings on iPhone under General > Screen Capture > CarPlay Screenshots.\nFortunately, Apple provides an example of a Live Activity in action\u2026\nMore\nOther changes include a redesigned Music app that reflects the navigational structure of the iPhone version, Tapbacks support and pinned conversations in Messages, and more:\nCarPlay \u2014 the smarter, safer way to use iPhone while driving \u2014 is used over 600 million times per day, and now with iOS 26, it receives updates that make it even more beautiful and easy to use. The stunning design includes a new compact view for incoming calls, allowing users to see who\u2019s calling without missing key information like upcoming directions. iOS 26 also brings Tapbacks and pinned conversations to Messages in CarPlay, and with widgets and Live Activities, users can stay in the loop without losing focus on the road. These updates also come to CarPlay Ultra, which brings the best of iPhone and the best of the car together for a deeply integrated, unified experience across every screen.\nHere are more shots Apple provides that show how CarPlay in iOS 26 appears on different types of displays:\nFinally, for the Aston Martin drivers, this is CarPlay Ultra in iOS 26:\nEnhance your iPhone experience\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming to your iPhone later this year.\niOS 26 upgrades Messages with new design, group chat features, and more\nApple\u2019s Messages app is getting a handful of solid upgrades in iOS 26.\nMessages gains the new \u2018Liquid Glass\u2019 redesign that impacts the app, of course. Buttons have been updated, UI elements have a fresh look, and overall the app reflects iOS 26\u2019s aesthetic well\u2014familiar, yet new.\nGroup chats are another big area of focus for Apple this year.\nIn iOS 26, there are several changes specifically meant to improve the group chat experience, including:\n- Typing indicators: Now you\u2019ll be able to see live indicators of who\u2019s typing, not just in one-on-one threads but also group chats.\n- Polls: Use polls to get input from a group with ease.\n- Apple Cash: Now you can use Apple Cash in groups to send and receive payments.\nBackground images can be set for different conversations, and you can even generate AI-created backgrounds with a simple Image Playground request.\nLive translation is an Apple Intelligence-powered feature for communicating with friends or family members who speak a different language.\nSpam prevention via message screening should hopefully reduce spam texts:\nIn Messages, users can now screen messages from unknown senders, giving them more control over who appears in their conversation list. Messages from unknown senders will appear in a dedicated folder where users can then mark the number as known, ask for more information, or delete. These messages will remain silenced until a user accepts them.\nIt\u2019s a small change, but iOS 26 lets you copy just part of a message, rather than forcing you to copy the whole thing.\nAnd despite no official announcement yet, Apple is also expected to ship RCS enhancements in iOS 26. This should bring support for end-to-end encryption when messaging Android users, for example.\nFinally, search in Messages gets an AI upgrade that lets you search for messages, photos, and files using natural language.\niOS 26\u2019s new Messages features are also coming to Apple\u2019s other platforms, including the Mac, iPad, and more, via companion software updates like macOS Tahoe and iPadOS 26.\nWhat do you think of the new Messages features in iOS 26?

But all of a sudden, in the span of a mere month, CarPlay\u2019s future looks brighter than it has in years\u2014in part because of a redefinition of what that future will be.\nThe next generation of CarPlay is no longer just CarPlay Ultra\nCarPlay\u2019s previously announced \u201cnext generation\u201d seemed like it would never arrive.\nBut now, it\u2019s finally here\u2014with a twist. And arguably, it might be better than what Apple previously announced.\nWhen the company unveiled next-gen CarPlay at WWDC three years ago, it had a bold vision to take over more aspects of your in-car experience.\nDespite initial pledged support from many vehicle brands, with passing time, automakers have seemed more reluctant to yield their software experience to Apple.\nSo the company pivoted, and what we\u2019ve ended up with\u2014after a long wait\u2014is a two-pronged CarPlay approach that\u2019s good news for all users.\nCarPlay Ultra officially launched last month, and my first reaction was very positive. Not primarily because of any specifics about the first supported vehicle, however.\nRather, I saw CarPlay Ultra as great news because it was very clearly not meant to replace standard CarPlay.\nInstead, CarPlay Ultra arrived as a separate, more premium alternative. And I was optimistic some of its features would eventually trickle down to the standard CarPlay experience.\nJust weeks later, that\u2019s already happening.\niOS 26 brings all CarPlay users a feature-packed release\nCarPlay is getting a lot of upgrades in iOS 26.\nThere\u2019s more coming than I can remember at any point since \u201cnext-gen CarPlay\u201d was first unveiled.\nOne big new feature is widgets, which are a direct import from CarPlay Ultra.\nBut there\u2019s also a new Liquid Glass design, video support, Smart Display Zoom, and more.\nIt\u2019s a huge year for CarPlay.\nAnd Apple\u2019s rollouts of both CarPlay Ultra and iOS 26\u2019s new features tells us something very important.\nCarPlay\u2019s \u201cnext generation\u201d isn\u2019t limited to $200,000 vehicles.
