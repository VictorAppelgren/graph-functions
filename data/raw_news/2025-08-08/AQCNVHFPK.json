  "title": "Our Favorite Power Station for Home Backup is $1,000 Off as We Enter the Thick of Hurricane Season",
  "description": "This timely discount on the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 makes it even more of a no-brainer.",
  "content": "\u2022 The EcoFlow Delta Pro 3\u2014our pick for the best whole home power station and the best overall portable power station\u2014is now $1,000 on Amazon for a limited time.\n\u2022 The Delta Pro 3 is ideal both for camping and as a viable source of backup power for everyday use.\n\u2022 This is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen on the power station since Prime Day in July.\n\nWe\u2019re in the midst of hurricane season, folks, and though none of the storms so far have technically been hurricanes, that\u2019s about to change. Earlier this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) updated its forecast, and the New York Times reported that we\u2019re about to enter the busiest time for hurricanes making landfall.\n\nSo if you\u2019re prepping for potential power outages and looking for a reliable source of backup power, there\u2019s one option we recommend among the dozens we\u2019ve tested\u2014the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3. It proved its worth and then some, as the hard-working 4,000-watt output device delivered uninterrupted raw power with relative ease, enough to earn it our nods as the \u201cBest Home Power Station\u201d (for generators at large) and \u201cBest Whole-Home Backup\u201d (for power stations specifically). And better yet? It\u2019s now $1,000 off on Amazon\u2014massive savings for massive power output.\n\nOne of our writers and generator experts, Tony Carrick, put the EcoFlow to the test back in April. Using a rig with an additional expansion battery, he was able to raise its capacity to an impressive 8,096 watt hours (Wh). In fact, Carrick noted that you could continue to add battery packs for a combined 48k-Wh capacity, which can generate enough whole-home power for two to four days.\n\n\u201cThe EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 was also the most efficient power station we tested in our ,\u201d Carrick noted.\u201cDuring our evaluation, we found it could output 97 percent of its listed 4,096 watt-hours of power capacity. We combined that with an expansion battery for a whopping 8,096 watt-hours, making this setup truly capable of providing a whole-home backup without gas or solar panels. We were able to run a space heater pulling a consistent 1,300 watts for nearly 6 hours.\u201d\n\nThis EcoFlow is also versatile in that it features seven unique charging options, ranging from standard AC wall outlets to solar panels to gas generators. The only downside we found during testing, though, is that it has only four AC outlets\u2014that\u2019s relatively few for a power station this size. It does, however, have a couple of different 220-volt outlets and a smaller 30-amp RV outlet, as well as four USB outlets for small devices. Another simple solution is adding a power strip to the mix, if necessary.\n\nAnd while we like to categorize it as a portable power station, the dubbing is a bit dubious. At 113 pounds, it\u2019s not small. However, thanks to conveniently built-in wheels and an extendable handle, it\u2019s easy to transport out of storage and into your home, RV, or camper.\n\nYou can call it whatever you\u2019d like, but one thing is clear\u2014saving a full $1,000 on home backup power is nothing to scoff at. While you can certainly opt for a smaller, cheaper option, we suggest grabbing something in the sweet spot of price and power output. And the Delta Pro 3 is just that\u2014especially at its current discount.",

      "text": "Whether you\u2019re looking for a backup power source for outages, off-grid electricity for an RV, or simply want to keep your laptop and smartphone charged while working remotely, portable power stations offer an effective solution. These handy devices are effectively large bundles of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which provide a quiet, exhaust-free alternative to noisy gas-powered portable generators.\nPortable power stations come in a broad range of sizes, from smaller models capable of charging a phone and powering a laptop for a day of remote work, up to high-capacity backup units that can keep your lighting and critical appliances on during a days-long blackout. We\u2019ve tested power stations from some of the top brands to find the best models.\nThe Best Portable Power Stations\n- Best Overall: Anker F3800 Plus Portable Power Station\n- Best Value: Jackery Explorer 300 Plus Portable Power Station\n- Best Mid-Size: Bluetti Elite 200 V2 Portable Power Station\n- Best Whole-Home Backup: EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 Portable Power Station\n- Best for Remote Work: Anker Solix C300 DC Portable Power Station\nThe Experts\nTony Carrick is a freelance writer who covers landscaping, home improvement, gardening, and home security for publications like Bob Vila, SFGate, CNN Underscored, Pro Tool Reviews, and Futurism. He\u2019s used portable power stations to keep his laptop charged while working on the road, power his RV during camping trips, and keep his fridge cool when the power goes out.\nBradley Ford has been testing generators and power stations at Popular Mechanics for 5 years. In that time he\u2019s tested dozens of units, both big and small. In his rural homes, he\u2019s had to install both manual and automatic transfer switches for using power stations and generators as back-up power sources for multi-day power outages.\nWhat to Consider\nHow We Evaluated\nIn our most recent testing, we evaluated five power stations of varying size, focusing on each model\u2019s maximum output, capacity, charging time, and portability. To test max output, we connected enough electronics and appliances to each power station to meet or slightly exceed their listed max output to see how well they could operate at maximum load. We then tested capacity, using an electricity usage monitor to record the total watt hours each power station produced while running them under a consistent load from 100 percent to 0.\nOnce they were drained, we charged each power station from 0 to 100 using their AC adapters, timing how long it took to get to 80 and 100 percent capacity. Finally, we evaluated each power station's portability by attempting to carry it or roll it. Other factors that weighed into our decisions included the number and power output of each power station\u2019s inputs and its charging options.\nWe previously tested the EcoFlow Delta Pro and Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 and still recommend them among the best\u2014but don\u2019t have the same test results and numbers as the five power stations above.\nOur picks for the best portable power stations range from smaller models you can comfortably carry in a backpack for a day of remote work to full-size battery banks that can effectively function as a whole-home backup.\nFull Reviews\nWith a max wattage of 6,000 watts, the Anker F3800 Plus had no problem handling the combined load of a miter saw, table saw, blender, and space heater when we put it to the test, demonstrating its tremendous power output.\nIt has a capacity of 3,840 Wh (we recorded 3,230 actual watt hours), enough to serve as a whole-home backup for the essentials for a day or two. We ran a space heater at a consistent 1,300 watts for about 2.5 hours and a fridge for a full day.\nIf that capacity isn\u2019t enough, you can add another F3800 Plus power station using a Anker Solix Double Power Hub to double the output and capacity and also add expansion battery packs to increase its capacity to a max 53.8 kWh.\nLarge portable power stations with their 100-plus-pound weight are inherently difficult to move. And while the F3800 is one of the heavier models we've tested, weighing over 135 pounds, its upright suitcase-like design and four sturdy wheels made it easier to wheel around our homes than other large power stations with two wheels and a handle. And with a small footprint, we were able to store it out of the way in a busy kitchen by tucking it into a corner. (You can also lay it down into a horizontal position, which is useful for RVs.)\nThe Anker F3800 Plus is loaded with six AC ports (most have just four). That allowed us to load it up with various appliances and power tools without having to use a power strip. There\u2019s also an RV port for campers, and a 240-volt port for larger appliances such as an oven or dryer.\nIt took us just under two hours to charge it from 0 to 80 percent power using the included AC power cord and a standard 120-volt outlet. The F3800 Plus also comes equipped with two solar inputs for a max of 165 volts, which equates to a max 3,200 watts of solar panels. This means that, with enough solar panels, you could feasibly recharge this beast with less than two hours of direct sunlight. You can also charge the F3800 at EV charging stations or via a car charger.\nAnker F3800 Plus Power Station Review\nThe Explorer 300 Plus was light enough for us to carry in a backpack over a short hike through the trails in our tester\u2019s backyard, yet still powerful enough that we could use it to make a protein shake in a blender. That balance of power and light weight makes Jackery\u2019s newest 300-series power station an ideal option for camping trips or off-grid remote working. It pumps out just over 300 watts (we recorded a max sustained wattage of 310 watts), but weighs just over 8 pounds and is about the size of a lunchbox.\nAlong with mobility, the 300 Plus also gives you a bevy of charging options. There are inputs for charging via a power cord, car accessory port, or solar panels. It took about 76 minutes to charge from 0 to 80 percent capacity using the included AC cord.\nThe Jackery has five power ports, including a DC input, AC three-prong outlet, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port, which is similar to other portable power stations of this size. While I liked the variety, I had mixed feelings about their max wattage output. The 100-watt max output of one USB-C outlet was ideal for a MacBook Pro, but the second USB-C\u2019s paltry 15 watts was too low to fast charge an iPhone 15.\nThis new version of the Explorer is an upgrade of its previous iteration, trading a lithium-ion battery for a longer lasting LiFePO4 battery. The main difference here is its lifespan. Whereas the older version of the Explorer 300 was rated for 500 cycles before dropping below 80 percent capacity, the Explorer 300 Plus gets a whopping 3,000 life cycles.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the lower wattage of some of its output, the Jackery Explorer 300 Plus offers great power output and capacity in a lightweight package.\nBluetti manages to pack a lot of power into the Elite 200 V2's surprisingly compact size and manageable weight. It boasts a max output of 2,600 watts with 3,900 watt startup power and a 2,073.6-Wh capacity.\nWe hooked up a miter saw, blender, and space heater, all three of which it powered simultaneously, easily handling the spike to 4,000 watts to start up the saw, above its listed 3,900 rated lift power, before maintaining an even flow of around 2,500 watts.\nThe Elite 200 V2 also impressed with the quality of its battery. We recorded an impressive 92 percent of its listed 2,073.6-Wh capacity, well over the 85 percent average for most portable power stations. It also boasted a quick recharge time for its capacity, going from 0 to 80 percent in 81 minutes and to full in just 107 minutes. And since it uses a LiFePO4 battery, you can discharge and recharge it a whopping 6,000 cycles before it drops below 80 percent capacity.\nThe Elite 200 V2 gives you plenty of output and input options for its size. Four AC outlets allow you to load up multiple appliances. There are also four USB ports for charging smaller devices, a car accessory outlet, and a DC output. Along with its power cord, there\u2019s also a port for charging from a car accessory port or with up to 1,000 watts of solar panels.\nIt's also surprisingly light at a manageable 53 pounds, which made carrying it around our workshops way easier. With a great power-to-weight ratio, the latest version of the Bluetti Elite 200 V2 is a great portable power station for powering a camper or providing backup power for the essentials.\nWith its tremendous capacity, the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 is truly capable of providing a whole-home backup without gas or solar panels. Our test rig came with one expansion battery, raising its capacity to a whopping 8,096 watt hours.\nIt was also the most efficient power station we tested, putting out 97 percent of its listed power capacity, so most of that energy goes into your appliances, rather than internal functions. We were able to run a space heater pulling a consistent 1300 watts for nearly 6 hours.\nSimilar to other large portable power stations, the Pro Delta 3 has a highly expandable modular design, allowing you to add up to two batteries to increase its storage capacity. By adding battery packs and a second power station, you can create a system with a combined 48k Wh capacity.\nThe Delta Pro 3 produces a max output of 4,000 watts, or up to 6,000 watts through its X-Boost feature, which automatically turns on when your wattage demand exceeds 4,000 watts. This is especially useful for large appliances that require a lot of power when you first turn them on or when under heavy load, such as window air conditioning units and power tools. We pushed it well above 5,000 watts with no noticeable lags by simultaneously operating an air fryer, toaster, and a space heater while making intermittent cuts with a miter saw.\nThe Delta Pro 3\u2019s four AC plugs do limit the number of appliances you can plug into it. We were forced to add a power strip to add enough appliances to push its output limits. However, it does offer two different types of 220-volt outlets and a 30-amp RV outlet, along with four USB outlets for smaller devices. In addition to its power cable, you can also charge this EcoFlow with a car charger or via two solar ports for a total of 2,600 watts.\nReferring to a large power station like this as \u201cportable\u201d is a bit of a stretch: The EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 weighs more than 113 pounds. Its two wheels and extendable handle allowed us to wheel it around a living room and kitchen like a piece of luggage, but it was difficult to move over a threshold between the garage and kitchen. The expansion pack sits on top of the power station, which saves space, but pushes the whole kit to a total weight approaching 200 pounds.\nWe took the Anker Solix C300 with us for a day of remote work at a local coffee shop, easily stowing it in a backpack. Its tall, narrow shape and 6.3-pound weight makes it the smallest and lightest portable power station we tested.\nDespite its compact size, its max 300-watt output and 288-Wh capacity are comparable to larger power stations that weigh several pounds more. It kept a laptop, portable screen, and smartphone charged for the entire day with plenty of power to spare.\nThe CS 300 is limited to DC outputs, which include four USB-C, two USB-A inputs, and a DC output, but it makes up for that with high output from each of those ports. Two of its USB-C ports put out max output of 140 watts each, which allowed us to charge a MacBook Pro from 0 to 80 percent in just 75 minutes even while continuing to use it with multiple browser windows open.\nWhile the CS 300 lacks a power cable, you can use both 140-watt ports as inputs to fast charge the C300 from 0 to 80 percent, a process that took just one hour, though we needed two charging cables and power blocks to do so.\nAdd in a lamp that extends from the top\u2014allowing it to function as a lantern with three brightness settings and 28-volt input for charging via a solar panel or car accessory port\u2014and the CS 300 is the ideal small power station for camping or remote work.\nThough it's no longer EcoFlow\u2019s flagship backup power solution, the original Delta Pro is still a massive power station with an output that rivals many gas generators. The brand claims it will power nearly any appliance, and after testing, we\u2019re inclined to agree. With an output of 3,600 watts, it can handle multiple appliances, and you can bump the output to 4,500 watts with its built in X-Boost technology if you need more power.\nIn testing, running with a continuous 470-watt load for 6 hours and 57 minutes, as indicated on the Delta Pro\u2019s display. Of course, in a home back-up during a power outage situation, we would run only the bare essentials to conserve power. To that end, we used it to power a full-size, 25-cubic-foot refrigerator\u2014which it did for a remarkable 51 hours and 24 minutes.\nRecharging the power station from empty using a standard 120-volt home outlet, it recharged to full capacity in 2 hours and 36 minutes. You can also charge the system, with the included adapter, at EV charging stations, with solar panels (sold separately), a car charger, or combinations of these to speed things up.\nThe Delta Pro\u2019s display screen provides all the important information you need to manage you power consumption. We frequently checked the screen during testing to see the unit\u2019s charge level, current load, and estimated run time at the current discharge rate.\nAll of this information is also accessible through EcoFlow\u2019s app, which was the most intuitive and easy-to-use of those tested. We connected the app both locally using Bluetooth and via Wi-Fi remotely to monitor the power station from anywhere. We could also toggle outlets on and off remotely, which is helpful if you\u2019re trying to manage power station output to extend the battery life.\nWe\u2019ve also tested the brand's Whole-Home Backup Kit, which includes two of the power stations and a dual voltage hub used to connect to your home service panel, via a transfer switch. We used this set-up to power critical circuits in a Northeast Pennsylvania home in late winter.\nThe Delta Pro Whole Home Kit ran just over 24 hours, powering kitchen outlets, a full-size refrigerator, a chest freezer, a cable modem and wireless network, and a hot water boiler. The two Delta Pro power stations had been previously stored with 100 percent charge for 8 months, and maintained their full charges.\nTesting was performed under normal usage conditions\u2014run time could easily be extended by employing standard power-conservation strategies like lowering the thermostat, powering the fridge and freezer for four hours on and four hours off, and only opening the them when absolutely necessary. EcoFlow\u2019s Delta Pro Whole Home Kit is a legitimate home back-up system that can operate inside your home, with none of the risks or potential hassles of running a generator.\nA new and improved version of Jackery's extremely popular Explorer 1000, the Explorer 1000 V2 features a slightly larger storage capacity, up 70 Wh; and a much higher 1,500W output, a 50 percent jump from 1,000W of the original. This allows you to power devices with higher loads, like an electric grill or large microwave. Jackery managed this while maintaining the Explorer 1000\u2019s compact size and weight, so it\u2019s still easy to carry with you on a camping trip.\nThe Explorer 1000 V2 features three standard 120v AC outlets, two USB C ports (30 and 100W), one USB A port (18W), and one 12V DC outlet. Paired with Jackery\u2019s app, you can monitor it locally via Bluetooth, or from anywhere when it's connected via Wi-Fi. In the app you can check charge levels and estimated run time, as well as toggle any of the outputs on or off.\nPlugged into the wall, it charges in under two hours. Charging with an optional 200W SolarSaga solar panel will take much longer\u2014over seven hours\u2014but you can cut that time down if you set up multiple panels. It can also be charged from your vehicle in up to 12 hours.\nPerformance wise, the 1000 V2 did well powering a 25-cubic-foot refrigerator for 18 hours, 22 minutes, which is better performance than we've gotten from other tested 1000W models. Under a constant load of 475 watts\u2014that\u2019s a little less than a small coffee maker\u2014it ran for 1 hour and 57 minutes.\nThis power station offers a lot of bang for the buck. Sure, it isn't going to power your house through a days-long outage, but it offers a lot of nice features for the price, making it one of the better values out there, especially if you can pick it up on sale.\nFAQs\nWith Our Experts\nTony Carrick is a full-time freelance writer who specializes in technology, home improvement, DIY, home security, and outdoor recreation.

      "text": "Having a home generator to provide backup power can be helpful, no matter where you live, but it\u2019s downright essential if you live in an area prone to extreme weather and frequent power outages. Sometimes you just need a way to keep your fridge running for a few extra hours during a blackout, but a large portable generator or a permanently installed standby generator can keep your entire home powered up and operational for several days. Investing in emergency power is never a small investment, but it\u2019s also an important one.\nBest Home Generators\n- Best Overall: DuroMax 11,000-Watt Portable Dual-Fuel Inverter Generator\n- Best Value: Generac GP9500E Tri-Fuel Portable Generator\n- Best Mid-Size: Champion Power Equipment 4,750-Watt Dual-Fuel Portable Generator\n- Best Power Station: EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 Portable Power Station\n- Best Solar Bundle: Anker F3800 Plus + 400W Solar Array\nThe Expert: I\u2019m a freelance journalist and reviewer who covers all kinds of gear, from power tools to outdoor equipment and automotive products. Generators are a specialty of mine: I\u2019ve covered everything from mini solar gens to home backups for publications like Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Thrillist, and The Daily Beast. I\u2019ve used them to power homes and RVs, run appliances in converted vans and campsites, set up work sites, and even used one to power an outdoor concert.\nHow We Selected\nWe conducted hands-on testing of most of the generators in this round-up. Others were selected for consideration based on current recommendations from the Popular Mechanics test team, manufacturer trends, advice from product engineers, and consumer reviews.\nIn our hands-on tests, we considered the difficulty of unboxing, assembling, and starting each generator for the first time, because few things are as frustrating as buying a tool that turns out to be unnecessarily complicated from the get-go. Once set up, the generators we reviewed were subject to different load conditions, including things like power tools, camping equipment, an RV, and home appliances. We assessed the features that distinguish these generators from each other, including safety features, app connectivity, and portability, among other things.\nAfter testing, we looked at reviewed customer reviews and message boards to see if other generator owners identified other issues over a longer period.\nFull Reviews\nThe DuroMax XP11000iH, a brand-new dual-fuel inverter model, is a powerful, feature-rich, durable generator that is a robust mid-size generator that should provide enough power to keep most homes up for an extended time. Its 9,000W running output should supply enough power to support a medium-sized home with up to five or six inhabitants, and its built-in power inverter ensures that you can use it to run every piece of electronics in your home safely.\nHaving two fuel options\u2013gas and propane\u2013provides a big boost of convenience by allowing you to use whatever\u2019s handy. No gasoline? Just plug into the hookup for your gas grill. It\u2019s also parallel-capable, so you can daisy chain it with another generator if you need extra power.\nThe generator\u2019s enclosed in a big, sturdy plastic casing, which makes it more durable and provides a fair amount of sound dampening. Of the many gas generators I\u2019ve tested, it may be the quietest model that\u2019s capable of backing up a whole home, especially when it's running on propane, which trims it down by another few decibels. At 61 dB on a 20 percent load, it\u2019s about as loud as a dishwasher. Most comparably sized generators go up to around 80 dB\u2013about the same volume as a police siren.\nBeing brand new, the XP11000iH feels state-of-the-art. In addition to a full suite of essential modern safety features like a CO2 shutoff and low oil shutoff, it goes the extra mile with lots of little touches. For example, I\u2019m using a whole home generator because the weather outside is frightful, so I\u2019m a big fan that it comes with a remote control, so I could start it without venturing out into the storm. The integrated battery tender keeps it ready to start no matter how long it\u2019s been sitting, which can be a lifesaver, too. When you do run out to check it, an onboard display shows you key stats like hours run, current load, and voltage output.\nThe only downside I could find was its weight. At upwards of 200 pounds, it isn\u2019t easy to carry. It does have wheels and sturdy handles, though, so it isn\u2019t hard to wheel around on flat, paved ground\u2014if you can push a loaded wheelbarrow, you can push this. Not that you\u2019ll need to move it much; it\u2019s a very sturdy generator and it comes assembled out of the box, so you really can set it outside and forget it.\nTechnically, there are cheaper generators out there, but the Generac GP9500E offers an outstanding blend of capability, quality, and durability at a very reasonable price, so this is where I\u2019d steer you if you\u2019re trying to shave down your spend.\nIts 9,500W running capacity is slightly higher than the DuroMax, and capable of powering all but the largest of homes. It can get a little noisy under a heavy load, but that\u2019s common with units this size. It let out a relatively moderate purr when it was just powering the lights and a few appliances, but it became more of a roar when the heat kicked on.\nWith three fuel options\u2013gas, propane, and natural gas\u2013you get about as much versatility as you could possibly expect from a portable generator. A relatively large 7.5-gallon gas tank delivers a long runtime between fill-ups. And, while I was initially skeptical as to the necessity of the third fuel option, having natural gas support showed its value when a storm knocked out the power, and I didn\u2019t have gas or propane on hand. All I needed to do was plug it into the natural gas line, and suddenly my house was the only one on the block with lights on.\nBeyond that, though, it\u2019s a fairly basic model. It has essential safety features like low oil and CO2 shutdown, but lacks elements like a fancy digital display, remote start, or app. I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a problem: It can be helpful to get a piece of machinery that doesn't go overboard with features. Its easy-to-navigate control panel is about as straightforward as can be, and it\u2019s easy to get up and running.\nLike my top pick, the GP9500E is exceedingly heavy. It\u2019s also quite sturdy, though, which feels like a fair trade. The outlet covers don\u2019t feel as flimsy and breakable as with many other models of a similar price point. It isn\u2019t completely immobile: It has wheels and handles that make it easy to cart around short distances. Realistically, though, weight is almost always going to be an issue with any generator capable of backing up your house.\nUltimately, though, the selling point is the price. It\u2019s hard to find a quality tri-fuel generator at such a low price, and the GP9500E performs well if you don\u2019t mind losing out on some bells and whistles.\nWhile it does not offer as much power as some of the choices on our list, Champion\u2019s 4,750-watt generator has enough capacity to run three or four critical 120-volt circuits in your home during an outage. It will also power small-to-medium campers and RVs via a dedicated 30-amp, 120-volt RV receptacle. Listing at around $600, this generator gives you a lot for the price you pay.\nThis generator uses a 224cc engine with a 4.7-gallon fuel tank, enabling it to run for up to 14 hours (up to 10 hours using propane). A gauge displays a readout of the run-time hours and voltage output. There\u2019s also an automated shut-off feature if the oil starts to run low. Since it\u2019s dual-fuel, this generator can run off propane in addition to gasoline. For instance, if you are using it with an RV, you can run it off a camper\u2019s propane tank without having to pack and haul a gas can. Likewise, with the included adapter hose you can hook it up a 20-pound propane tank.\nThere are a few drawbacks. Beyond the somewhat low wattage output for whole-home backup, there are no 240-volt outlets, so if you need that many volts to power circuits in your home for something like a dryer or water heater, this model won\u2019t be right for you. But if you just need something to keep some lights on and run a few appliances, this generator will get the job done and not cost you a ton of money upfront to do it. \u2014 Reviewed by Bradley Ford\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 was also the most efficient power station we tested in our portable power station guide. During our evaluation, we found it could output 97 percent of its listed 4,096 watt-hours of power capacity. We combined that with an expansion battery for a whopping 8,096 watt-hours, making this setup truly capable of providing a whole-home backup without gas or solar panels. We were able to run a space heater pulling a consistent 1,300 watts for nearly 6 hours.\nYou can directly plug up to four appliances or devices into this generator\u2019s four AC plugs or four USB ports. It can also support higher power appliances with two 240-volt outlets or connection to a transfer switch using a 30-amp connection. You can charge it from an AC outlet or with solar panels up to 2,600 watts.\nThough it rolls on wheels, this power station weighs just over 113 pounds, so we weren\u2019t exactly moving it around the house like a piece of luggage, and it certainly takes some effort to move up and down stairs, if not two people. If you add more batteries, you\u2019ll only add to the weight. But comes with the territory of a powerful station like this one. \u2014 Reviewed by Tony Carrick\nIn our hands-on test, the Anker F3800 Plus easily handled the combined load of a miter saw, table saw, blender, and space heater, demonstrating its tremendous max output of 6,000 watts. While we did not test the solar connection, you can purchase a bundle that includes a 400-watt solar panel set, which you could use to recharge the station.\nThe F3800 has a listed capacity of 3,840 watt-hours, but in our tests, we recorded 3,230 actual watt-hours available. That\u2019s not bad; most power stations generate a bit less than the specs say. That\u2019s enough power to serve as a whole-home backup for the essentials for a day or two. We ran a space heater at a consistent 1,300 watts for about 2.5 hours and a fridge for a full day. You can increase the capacity to up to 26,900 watt-hours by adding extra batteries (six for the full amount), plus you can pair it with another F3800 and get up to 53,800 watt-hour capacity with up to six batteries attached to the second unit, too.\nThere are six AC ports (most have just four) available on the F3800 for directly connecting appliances, plus there\u2019s a 240-volt port for larger appliances such as an oven or dryer. You can also directly connect to an RV or home transfer switch using either a 30-amp or 50-amp connection. Overall, that\u2019s a versatile set of options you won\u2019t find on every generator.\nIt took us just under 2 hours to charge it from 0 to 80 percent power using the included AC power cord and a standard 120-volt outlet. The bundle we list here is for a 400-watt panel, but the F3800 Plus comes equipped with two solar inputs for a max of 165 volts, which means you can connect up to 3,200 watts of solar panel input. With an array of that size, you could theoretically recharge this beast with less than 2 hours of direct sunlight. You can also charge the F3800 at EV charging stations or via a car charger.\nThis is a hefty model at 135 pounds, but its upright suitcase-like design and four sturdy wheels made it easier to wheel around the house than other large power stations with two wheels and a handle. And with a small footprint, we were able to store it out of the way in a busy kitchen by tucking it into a corner. All things considered, this model is a workhorse power station that offers a lot of versatility and portability. \u2014 Reviewed by Tony Carrick\nHaving tested portable power stations extensively over the past few years, the Bluetti AC500 has the capacity to keep a home up and running, so long as you have the solar panels to keep it up and running, or a way to charge its batteries.\nWhat sets the AC500 apart is its expandability. When paired with one of the brand\u2019s B300K batteries, as we tested, it can hold up to 2,764.8 watt hours (Wh). But you can go further, chaining up to six batteries on a single unit to store a whopping 16,588 watt hours, which is enough to provide a home with power for several days. It features a power inverter as well, and you can use it for all kinds of electronics. In fact, it has a few USB ports so you could charge your tech directly.\nWhile charging may be tough during an emergency, it does offer a high max charging speed\u2014up to 3,000 watts via solar, or up to 8,000 watts with solar and AC combined.\nOne of the big advantages of a power station over a generator is an intuitive, tech-influenced design. Some home solar power setups can be very complicated, but the AC500 is effectively plug-and-play. That said, you should bring in an electrician to install an automatic transfer switch for your home power, though, so it can automatically take over when the power goes out.\nBuilding out a solar generator setup large enough to keep a home up and running is expensive and complicated. Realistically, you should look into a permanent solar setup with large roof-mounted panels and a large permanent power storage solution. If you\u2019re looking for something that you can bring in and hook up yourself, though, the AC500 has the bulk to handle the job.\nThe Predator 13,000W Tri-Fuel generates about as much wattage as you can get from a portable generator. For more power than that, you\u2019ll need to look into a permanent standby setup. In addition to its great output, it has every feature you could possibly ask for from a generator.\nIts standard 10,000W running output should provide enough power for even large homes, and the ability to max out at 13,000W means it can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. The noise level pushes 80 decibels, which is loud but effectively average for most large generators. Given its capacity, I think that\u2019s fairly impressive, though it did get pretty loud at night when I cranked the heat up and had several kitchen appliances going. Still, I never felt like it struggled to keep up with demand.\nTri-fuel compatibility gives you great flexibility. Its 10.7-gallon gas tank is larger than average as well, so it will run for longer than most generators, so long as you keep it under standard wattage. It also has a wider range of outlets than the generators I tested, with both 120/240 V and 120V outlets at 30 amps, which makes it compatible with just about any home or RV.\nIt also has some very helpful special features that you\u2019ll only find on larger, more expensive generators. A remote starter allows you to fire it up or shut it down from the comfort of indoors. Digital engine monitoring tools help you maximize its efficiency, and an automatic idle down reduces fuel consumption and noise when power loads drop.\nAgain, weight is the generator\u2019s Achilles heel. At just shy of 230 pounds, you need to find a place for it where you can leave it all year round. Even with handles and wheels, it\u2019s one of the least nimble portable generators to push around, especially on uneven or soft ground. On the plus side, it\u2019s built to last, so positioning it outside and leaving it in one spot all year round shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nIf you want to ensure that there\u2019s as little difference as possible between using your home power and backup power, you need to spend the extra time and money to have a standby generator installed by a professional. From what I\u2019ve researched and tested, the Briggs & Stratton PowerProtect 13,000W is a good choice for most single-home properties without extraordinary backup needs or secondary buildings.\nWith a running wattage of 13,000 watts and a starting wattage of 20,000 watts, it supplies more power than any portable generator and will keep any size home up and running. (For more power than this, you may need to look at industrial-grade equipment.) And for such a high-output generator, its volume is surprisingly moderate, purring along at roughly 65 dB under a 50 percent load, which is about the volume of an air conditioner.\nAt the same time, the physical generator has the smallest footprint of any option I\u2019ve seen with this kind of capacity. Not only is it more compact than most generators, but its smooth grey shell sort of blends into the profile of your home. I think that looks much better than a more mechanical-looking unit. On a more practical level, the design features a front exhaust port that blows in one direction, which allows you to place it closer to your home.\nAs part of the installation, the PowerProtect connects to permanent propane and natural gas lines. There\u2019s no need to worry about refueling, ensuring a steady supply of power so long as those lines are active. An automated self-testing mode checks its readiness on a weekly basis, and the companion app makes remote monitoring and adjustment easy.\nAgain, relative to my other portable recommendations, the PowerProtect 13K is a more expensive option, with more setup and preparation. You will need to have a professional come in to wire a transfer switch to your house power\u2013which is sold separately\u2013and connect it to your propane and natural gas lines. It is far and away the smoothest home backup power solution, though, and the best way to make sure you\u2019re ready for a long-term outage.\nWhat to Consider\nYou could just drive over to your local hardware store and buy a large portable generator to use as a home backup, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. You want to make sure you\u2019re getting a generator that can back up your home and power all the appliances, lights, and electronics inside. (Plus some extra watts in case you need them down the line.)\nIn addition, there are often state and local laws and/or HOA rules and restrictions around using them in residential neighborhoods. Picking poorly or setting your backup generator incorrectly could damage the generator or short your house power at best, or lead to fire, electrocution, or carbon monoxide poisoning at worst.\nHow to Choose a Generator\nPicking the best generator for your home starts with a little math. Ideally, you want to calculate how much energy you need to keep your house running, and buy a generator that can handle everything you want to power in an emergency, with room to spare.\nManufacturers provide two key specs that indicate how much power you can draw from a generator\u2013\u201drunning wattage\u201d and \u201cstanding wattage.\u201d Running wattage is effectively your generator\u2019s capacity: It tells how much power a generator can produce steadily without any possibility of an overload. Starting wattage is the generator\u2019s max output, or how much power it can produce for short, peak bursts when appliances first switch on.\nIdeally, you\u2019re looking for a generator with a running wattage that\u2019s 2,000 watts or so over what your home (or essential appliances) need to operate. I can\u2019t calculate that for you, but we can walk through a few general estimates. If you\u2019re just looking to keep the fridge, lights, and a few modest appliances going through a short blackout, you can usually get away with a generator that supplies 3,000-5,000 watts.\nYou should plan on using at least 6,000 to 8,000 watts to run all your critical equipment\u2014think fridge, heat, and hot water\u2014and up to 10,000 watts if you include large appliances like laundry machines or a dishwasher. If you\u2019re looking for full, unrestricted backup power, small to medium households can usually get away with 8,000 to 10,000 watts, though you may need a higher starting capacity. If you have an exceptionally large home or doubled up on key appliances, tack 20 percent on these estimates to be safe.\nEnergy Loads and Recommended Circuits\nIt\u2019s also important to consider that, while generators are certainly a hefty investment, they usually stand the test of time. Consumer-grade, portable generators can run anywhere from 1,000-3,000 hours, sometimes more. If you run one for 100 hours per year, it should last for 10 to 30 years.\nTypes of Generators\nFAQ\nHow can you tell if your generator is overloaded?\nWhen you draw too much power from your generator, its performance will start to decline. At home, your lights will start to dim or flicker, and appliances may turn off momentarily. The generator itself may also start to get louder, or sound like it's working extra hard to keep up.\nIf you notice these signs, start turning off and unplugging non-essential power sources immediately, or turn the generator off entirely for ten minutes or so to reduce the power load.\nThis is an urgent problem, so do not wait to take action: If you overwork your generator for too long, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it starts to overheat, produce smoke, or break down. The damage from an extended overload could permanently damage the generator or, worse, start a fire.\nHow long can a home generator run continuously?\nWith the right size for your home, a generator can run as long you keep feeding it fuel and stay within its running wattage capacity. You will get more time from each tank of gas if you draw less power, so it helps to pay extra attention to your electricity usage when you\u2019re running the generator.\nMake sure to turn your gas and/or propane generators off when it\u2019s time to refill the tank. Failing to do so could lead to a fire.\nPower stations, since they rely on electricity and/or solar power, can almost always be charged while in use.\nWhere should you position a home generator?\nNever run a fuel-based generator (gasoline, propane, natural gas) indoors. Burning fuel releases carbon dioxide (CO2), which will quickly build up to deadly levels in an enclosed space.\nSet your generator up outside, at between 5 and 20 feet away from your home and/or any garages, sheds, or other walls. Position it as far as possible from doors, windows, and vents, with the exhaust positioned away from the house, to minimize the possibility of fumes wafting in. If you keep it outside all-year-round, find a naturally covered position where snow won\u2019t naturally pile up around it.\nMy generator is situated near my home power box, which is located on a windowless side of my home. It stands about five feet from the exterior wall, with plenty of space on all sides, but close enough to sit under the roof peak overhang 20 feet above.\nNick Hilden is a writer, globetrotter, and jack-of-many-talents who has written gear reviews for the likes of Runner\u2019s World, Popular Science, Men\u2019s Health, Thrillist, the Daily Beast, the Los Angeles Times, Greatist, and the Manual, and his lifestyle, culture, and tech writing has also appeared in Scientific American, Afar, Salon, Vice, Healthline, and many others.
