      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Checklist**\n\n1. **Causal Chain & Catalyst Windows**  \n   - Explicitly link the *tariff ruling* (ID 3952FOSRQ, Aug 29) → *reduced import‑price inflation* → *Fed’s dovish stance* → *expected 25‑bp cut* (ID U21K4ALYQ, Aug 22) → *downward pressure on the 10‑yr yield* (ID 3YAQ8JUPL).  \n   - Add the *core PCE release* (ID U21K4ALYQ, Aug 30) as a catalyst that confirms the inflation outlook.  \n   - Note the *September FOMC* (Sep 16‑17) as the key decision point for the 25‑bp cut.\n\n2. **Magnitude & Levels**  \n   - State the current 10‑yr yield (~4.23 %) and the target range (4.10‑4.15 %) with a 15‑20 bp decline.  \n   - Identify 4.20 % as short‑term resistance and 4.10 % as support (term‑premium floor).  \n   - Quantify equity‑future gains (e.g., S&P 500 futures +1.4 %) to show risk‑premium compression.\n\n3. **Risk / Invalidation Scenarios**  \n   - List: (i) Fed holds/raises rates → yield up 10‑15 bp; (ii) tariff reinstated → inflation spike → yield up; (iii) equity market rally → risk premium widens → yield up.  \n   - Emphasize that any of these would invalidate the 15‑20 bp decline scenario.\n\n4. **Monitoring & Horizon**  \n   - Highlight next 0‑3 weeks: Fed minutes (Sep 16‑17), core PCE (Sep 30), any court updates on tariff policy.  \n   - Suggest watching equity futures for risk‑premium shifts.\n\n5. **Formatting & Citations**  \n   - Keep each claim tied to an inline citation (e.g., “(ID 3YAQ8JUPL)”).  \n   - Remove any stray references to “30‑year” or “0.3‑year” term premium; correct to “10‑year.”  \n   - Ensure the paragraph remains concise (≤ 200 words) and sticks to the 10‑yr yield focus.\n\n**Actionable Edit**  \nRewrite the draft to follow the above structure, tightening the narrative, correcting the term‑premium wording, and adding the missing catalyst dates. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and elevate the analysis to world‑class, actionable insight.",
