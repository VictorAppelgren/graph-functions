      "summary": "Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to the U.S. marks a significant moment in U.S.-Russia relations, as he seeks to leverage his strongman image to gain favor with President Trump, who admires him. The meeting is expected to focus on aggressive demands from Putin regarding Ukraine, including territorial concessions and military limitations, while Trump aims to project himself as a capable deal-maker. Observers express concern that the talks may ultimately benefit Putin, especially if they fail to yield a compromise, potentially enhancing his domestic and international standing.",
