  "content": "Anguilla got lucky. Really lucky. When countries were being assigned nation-specific domain names decades ago during the early days of the internet, Anguilla\u2019s \u201c.ai\u201d attracted very little attention. But fast forward 40 or so years and it\u2019s suddenly turned into a serious cash cow for the tiny Caribbean island. And it doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out why.\n\nThanks to a massive surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) that was kick-started by OpenAI with the launch of the generative-AI ChatGPT chatbot in 2022, a rush of individuals, businesses, and organizations have been paying Anguilla top dollar to register new websites with the .ai domain name, BBC News reported this week.\n\nThe BBC cites the example of U.S. tech entrepreneur Dharmesh Shah, who reportedly forked out a whopping $700,000 for the \u201cyou.ai\u201d address that at some point will showcase a new AI-focused product.\n\nWhile Anguilla gets most of its income from tourism, the hurricane season can cause serious disruption to the flow of inbound travelers. It\u2019s true that most customers purchasing a .ai domain are spending nowhere near as much as Shah, but the cumulative effect of all of the extra business \u2014 there are now 850,000 .ai registrations compared to just 50,000 five years ago \u2014 is creating useful revenue for Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory.\n\nIndeed, the BBC\u2019s report notes that last year alone, Anguilla earned 105.5 million East Caribbean dollars (about $39 million) by selling domain names \u2014 that\u2019s equal to almost a quarter of its total revenue for 2024. It\u2019s even edging toward the amount brought in by tourism, which accounts for 37% compared to the domain\u2019s 23%.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to make a fast buck yourself, you could purchase a .ai name at the regular price of around $100 a year and hope that someone comes knocking at your door later on to offer a tasty sum for it.\n\nSimilarly, Anguilla is making some big sales because it held onto what it believed were ultra-premium names \u2014 like you.ai \u2014 and later released them at auction or set its own prices.",

      "text": "How sheer luck made this tiny Caribbean island millions from its web address\nBack in the 1980s when the internet was still in its infancy, countries were being handed their own unique website addresses to navigate this nascent new online world. Such as .us for the US or .uk for the UK.\nEventually, almost every country and territory had a domain based on either its English or own language name. This included the small Caribbean island of Anguilla, which landed the address .ai.\nUnbeknownst to Anguilla at the time, this would become a future jackpot.\nWith the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), more and more companies and individuals are paying Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory, to register new websites with the .ai tag.\nSuch as US tech boss Dharmesh Shah, who earlier this year spent a reported $700,000 (\u00a3519,000) on the address you.ai.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Shah says he purchased it because he had \"an idea for an AI product that would allow people to create digital versions of themselves that could do specific tasks on their behalf\".\nThe number of .ai websites has increased more than 10-fold in the past five years, and has doubled in the past 12 months alone, according to a website that tracks domain name registrations.\nThe challenge for Anguilla, which has a population of just 16,000 people, is how to harness this lucrative bit of luck and turn it into a long-term and sustainable source of income.\nSimilar to other small Caribbean islands, Anguilla's economy is built on a bedrock of tourism. Recently, it's been attracting visitors in the luxury travel market, particularly from the US.\nAnguilla's statistics department says there was a record number of visitors to the island last year, with 111,639 people entering its shores.\nYet Anguilla's tourism sector is vulnerable to damage from hurricanes every autumn. Situated in the northeast of the Caribbean island arc, Anguilla lies perfectly within the North Atlantic hurricane belt.\nSo gaining an increasing income from selling website addresses is playing an important role in diversifying the island's economy, and making it more resilient to the financial damage that storms may bring. This is something that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted in a recent report on Anguilla.\nIn its draft 2025 budget document, the Anguillian government says that in 2024 it earned 105.5m East Caribbean dollars ($39m; \u00a329m) from selling domain names. That was almost a quarter (23%) of its total revenues last year. Tourism accounts for some 37%, according to the IMF.\nThe Anguillian government expects its .ai revenues to increase further to 132m Eastern Caribbean dollars this year, and to 138m in 2026. It comes as more than 850,000 .ai domains are now in existence, up from fewer than 50,000 in 2020.\nAs a British Overseas Territory, Anguilla is under the sovereignty of the UK, but with a high level of internal self-governance.\nThe UK has significant influence on the island's defence and security, and has provided financial assistance during times of crisis. After Hurricane Irma severely damaged it in 2017, the UK gave \u00a360m to Anguilla over five years to help meet the repair bill.\nThe UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office tells the BBC it welcomes Anguilla's efforts \"to find innovative ways to deliver economic growth\" as it helps \"contribute to Anguilla's financial self-sufficiency\".\nTo manage its burgeoning domain name income, in October 2024 Anguilla signed a five-year deal with a US tech firm called Identity Digital, which specialises in internet domain name registries.\nAt the start of this year, Identity Digital announced that it had moved where all the .ai domains are hosted, from servers in Anguilla, to its own global server network. This is to prevent any disruption from future hurricanes, or any other risks to the island's infrastructure, such as power cuts.\nThe exact cost of .ai addresses isn't publicly disclosed, but registration prices are said to start from roughly $150 to $200. With renewal fees of around the same amount every two years.\nAt the same time, more in-demand domain names are auctioned off, with some fetching hundreds of thousands of US dollars. The owners of these then have to pay the same small renewal fees as everyone else.\nIn all cases, the government of Anguilla gets the sales revenue, with Identity Digital getting a cut said to be around 10%. However, they appear to be sensitive about the topic, as both declined to be interviewed for this article.\nCurrently the most expensive .ai domain name purchase is Mr Shah's you.ai.\nA self-confessed AI-enthusiast, and co-founder of US software company Hubspot, Mr Shah has several other .ai domain addresses to his name, but the flagship you.ai is not yet operational as he's been busy with other projects.\nMr Shah says he buys domain names for himself, but will occasionally look to sell \"if I don't have immediate plans for it, and there's another entrepreneur that wants to do something with the name\".\nMr Shah believes that another person or company will soon set a new record for the highest price of an .ai domain purchase, such is the continuing excitement around AI.\nBut he adds: \"Having said that, I still think over the long-term, .com domains will maintain their value better and for longer.\"\nIn recent weeks, .ai auctions have seen major six-figure sales. In July, cloud.ai sold for a reported $600,000 and law.ai sold for $350,000 earlier this month.\nHowever, Anguilla's position is not without precedent. The similarly tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu signed an exclusive deal in 1998 to license its .tv domain name.\nReports say this granted exclusive rights to US domain name registry firm, VeriSign in exchange for $2m a year, which later rose to $5m.\nA decade later and with the internet expanding exponentially, Tuvalu's finance minister, Lotoala Metia, said VeriSign, paid \"peanuts\" for the right to run the domain name. The country signed a new deal with a different domain provider, GoDaddy, in 2021.\nAnguilla is operating in a different fashion, having handed over management of the domain name in a revenue-sharing model, not a fixed payment.\nCashing in on this new line of income sustainably has been a major goal for the island. It's hoped the increasing incomings will allow for a new airport to be built to facilitate tourism growth, as well as fund improvements to public infrastructure and access to health care.\nAs the number of registered .ai domains hurtles toward the million mark, Anguillians will hope this money is managed safely and invested in their future."

      "text": "Claude \u2014 one of the most popular AI chatbots out there and a potential candidate for Apple to enhance Siri \u2014 will soon start saving a transcript of all your chats for AI training purposes. The policy change announced by Anthropic has already started appearing to users and gives them until September 28th to accept the terms.\nWhat\u2019s changing?\nAnthropic says the log of users\u2019 interactions with Claude and its developer-focused Claude Code tool will be used for training, model improvement, and strengthening the safety guardrails. So far, the AI company hasn\u2019t tapped into user data for AI training.\n\u201cBy participating, you\u2019ll help us improve model safety, making our systems for detecting harmful content more accurate and less likely to flag harmless conversations,\u201d says the company. The policy change is not mandatory, and users can choose to opt out of it.\nUsers will see a notification alert about the data usage policy until September 28. The pop-up will let them easily disable the toggle that says \u201cYou can help improve Claude,\u201d and then save their preference by hitting the Accept button. After September 28, users will have to manually change their preference from the model training settings dashboard.\nWhat\u2019s the bottom line?\nThe updated training policy only covers new chats with Claude, or those you resume, but not old chats. But why the reversal? The road to AI supremacy is pretty straightforward. The more training material you can get your hands on, the better the AI model\u2019s performance.\nThe industry is already running into a data shortage, so Anthropic\u2019s move is not surprising. If you are an existing Claude user, you can opt out by following this path: Settings > Privacy > Help Improve Claude.\nAnthropic\u2019s new user data policy covers the Claude Free, Pro, and Max plans. It, however, doesn\u2019t apply to Claude for Work, Claude Gov, Claude for Education, APU use, or when connected to third-party platforms such as Google\u2019s Vertex AI and Amazon Bedrock.\nIn addition to this, Anthropic is also changing its data retention rules. Now, the company can keep a copy of user data for up to five years. Chats that have been manually deleted by users will not be used for AI training."

      "text": "Each time you open a browser and type in a web address, there\u2019s a hidden hand sending all the information to your PC to render the page as it should. Those middle-men of your newly loaded webpage are the internet\u2019s DNS servers.\nBut what is a DNS server exactly? To help explain, we\u2019ll walk you through the process of retrieving a web page and cover the many types of DNS servers residing between you and your favorite sites and services. We\u2019ll also show you how to change DNS settings to get the fastest, safest web browsing experience possible.\nWhat is DNS?\nDNS is short for Domain Name System. Created in 1983 at the University of Wisconsin, it\u2019s an expanding global directory for the Internet that replaces numeric addresses with alphabetic addresses. Rather than \u201cdial\u201d a string of numbers in a browser to contact Google, just type its name instead. Alphabetic addresses are simply easier to remember, even more so given there are more than 1.7 billion websites on the Internet today.\nGoogle.com is easier to remember and type than 172.217.15.110, for example.\nBut why do websites even have numeric addresses? Because computing devices communicate in binary form: Ones and zeroes. They all also have a binary identifier when connected to a network so data knows where to go. These identifiers are rather long, containing 32 numbers, hence the 32-bit reference.\nHowever, the numeric addresses we see are \u201ccondensed\u201d versions divided into four \u201coctets.\u201d In binary form, each octet contains eight numbers, though we only see three in the condensed version ranging from 0 to 255. For example, the binary address 11000000.10101000.01111011.10000100 condenses down to 192.168.123.132.\nThese addresses are divided by decimals for a reason. Each one contains two components: Network and Host. How the four octets are divided up between these two components depends on the IP address class.\nFor instance, your home network may fall under Class C: The first three octets identify the network and the fourth octet identifies your device. Google\u2019s address would fall under Class B: 172.217 identifies the network and 15.110 identifies the server. Meanwhile, Digital Trend\u2019s IP address falls under Class A. The 18 number identifies the network while 235.70.209 identifies the server.\nWhat is a DNS server?\nIt\u2019s a program or computer that handles a DNS query.\nThere are four types of DNS servers, each with one specific function: The DNS resolver (or recursor), the Root nameserver, the Top Level Domain (TLD) nameserver, and the Authoritative nameserver. The whole process is handled in mere milliseconds so all you see is a web page instantly loading in your browser once you type an address.\nHow does a DNS query work?\nThe best way to understand how each DNS server type works is to follow the DNS query trail. Again, there are a lot of steps to get a webpage loaded in your browser, but unless you\u2019re having connectivity issues, you\u2019ll only see near-instantaneous page loads.\nStep 1: The Web client\nYou open a web browser and type http://www.google.com. The query leaves your browser and is received by the DNS client built into the operating system.\nStep 2: The DNS client\nThe built-in DNS client checks its local cache to see if it has the associated numeric address already on file. If it does, it provides the address to the web client. If not, it sends a query to an external DNS resolver server residing on the Internet. It\u2019s typically maintained by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nStep 3: The DNS resolver\nThis server resides between you and all other DNS servers required to get Google\u2019s numeric address. This server essentially takes control of the DNS query, temporarily becoming the DNS client.\nStep 4: The Root nameserver\nThere are 13 of these servers maintained by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Overall, this network keeps track of all the servers that maintain a directory of each domain, like .com, .net, .org, and so on. In our example, this network responds to the query by directing the DNS resolver to the address of a server handling the .com domains.\nStep 5: The Top Level Domain (TLD) nameserver\nAgain, each TLD nameserver maintains a directory of a specific domain. They\u2019re managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is part of ICANN. When the .com TLD nameserver receives the DNS resolver\u2019s request, it responds with the address of an Authoritative nameserver that keeps Google\u2019s actual numeric address.\nStep 6: The Authoritative nameserver\nThis is the final stop for the DNS query. This nameserver receives the DNS resolver\u2019s query and pulls up the DNS A Record to retrieve Google\u2019s numerical address. However, if a domain or a subdomain has an alias \u2014 like Google.com \u2014 the DNS resolver will receive that information first, prompting it to send another request for the numerical address listed in the DNS A Record.\nStep 7: The DNS resolver\nWith Google\u2019s numerical location in hand, the DNS resolver delivers the information to your PC\u2019s DNS client. The resolver is done for now until it receives another DNS query.\nStep 8: The DNS client\nNow knowing the numerical address, the DNS client hands the address over to the web client. It will also store the numeric address in its cache for later use.\nStep 9: The Web client\nUsing the numeric address, the web browser sends an HTTP request to the server located at that Internet address, which in turn responds with the webpage you see in your browser.\nA note about DNS resolvers\nYou may see suggestions about switching DNS servers. These suggestions are typically referring to DNS resolvers. Your device\u2019s DNS client and your router defaults to DNS resolvers maintained by your ISP unless you manually change the address information. You can do so on a device-by-device basis or dig into the router and change the DNS settings so it applies to all connected devices.\nHere are a few reasons why changing your DNS settings is ideal:\nISP tracking\nYour internet service provider can see which websites you browse each time you query one of its DNS resolvers. Changing DNS server information can reduce their overall tracking, though they can still see your activity based on the IP addresses you access. The only real way to dodge ISP snooping is to use a virtual private network. Still, switching DNS resolvers helps.\nThird-party servers can unblock content\nIf you want to view region-blocked content, some third-party DNS servers can trick content providers into viewing your connection as local.\nThird-party DNS servers may be faster\nYou\u2019re likely physically closer to an ISP\u2019s DNS server which should translate to better performance than a third-party DNS query. But that\u2019s not always the case. Indeed, your ISP\u2019s servers may experience ongoing issues or are slow in general. There may even be a third-party DNS server closer to your physical location, providing better speed and reliability.\nThird-party DNS servers may be safer\nOne way to easily block unsavory content online is to use a third-party DNS server that offers parental controls, like OpenDNS. Simply change the DNS settings in your router, create and sign in to your free account, and establish filters that ignore DNS queries related to content you don\u2019t wish your device\u2019s or home\u2019s connection to have access to. You can also use filters to block malicious websites that are intent on stealing your data.\nHow to change DNS settings on a router\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t a one-guide-fits-all scenario. Backend interfaces aren\u2019t identical across all router models. Even more, some routers have broader and deeper feature sets than others. However, one universal setting across them all is altering DNS settings.\nIn our example shown below, we access a Linksys router using a browser (here\u2019s how to access yours). We can change the DNS settings by clicking Connectivity on the left-hand menu followed by the Local Network tab in a pop-up window. As shown below, we enter Google\u2019s Primary DNS address in the Static DNS 1 field and Google\u2019s Secondary DNS address in the Static DNS 2 field.\nWith those numbers inserted, we can click the Apply button to complete the change.\nNow, when any connected device on the local network sends a query via its DNS client, the query is immediately directed to Google\u2019s DNS resolvers rather than the ISP.\nHow to change DNS settings on Windows 10\nStep 1: Right-click on your internet icon located next to the system clock (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and select Open Network & Internet settings on the pop-up menu.\nStep 2: The Status category in the Settings app appears on your screen. Scroll down and click Network and Sharing Center.\nStep 3: The Control Panel appears on your screen. If you\u2019re on a wired connection, click the Ethernet link followed by the Properties button displayed on a pop-up window. If you\u2019re connected via Wi-Fi, click the Wi-Fi link instead followed by the Properties button.\nStep 4: Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) on the list and click the Properties button.\nStep 5: In the pop-up window, change the current DNS setting to Use the following DNS server addresses.\nStep 6: Enter the primary DNS server address in the first \u201cpreferred\u201d field and the secondary DNS server in the second \u201calternate\u201d field.\nStep 7: Click the OK button to complete.\nHow to change DNS settings on MacOS\nStep 1: Click the Apple logo located in the top left corner.\nStep 2: Select System Preferences in the drop-down menu.\nStep 3: Select Network in the System Preferences window.\nStep 4: The Network window appears with your current Internet connection already selected. Click the Advanced button located in the bottom right corner.\nStep 5: Click the DNS tab in the following window.\nStep 6: Click the \u201cplus\u201d symbol next to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.\nStep 7: Enter the primary and secondary IP addresses of the third-party server. In this case, Google uses 8.8.8.8 for the primary and 8.8.4.4 for the secondary.\nOptional: Here you will also see a section for Search Domains. This autocompletes hostnames when you type a single word in Safari and other network-based services. For instance, if the list contains apple.com and you simply type \u201cstore\u201d in the address field, the browser loads the webpage associated with store.apple.com.\nThat said, generally leave this section blank unless you reside on a specific domain and need quick access to a networked PC using a single word.\nStep 8: To finish, click the OK button.\nHow to change DNS settings on a Chromebook\nStep 1: Click the system clock located in the bottom right corner followed by the \u201cgear\u201d icon on the pop-up menu.\nStep 2: The Chrome settings appear on your screen. Select your Internet connection listed under Network. Unfortunately, this action only expands the list of available connections.\nStep 3: Click your network connection again.\nStep 4: Click the expand the Network setting.\nStep 5: To use Google\u2019s DNS servers, change the setting to Google name servers \u2014 you don\u2019t need to enter primary and secondary addresses.\nTo use a different DNS server, change the setting to Custom name servers, and enter the primary and secondary addresses. For instance, if you want to use OpenDNS Home, enter 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220\nFree and paid DNS servers\nIf you want to use a third-party DNS query service, there are plenty of free and paid alternatives. Here is a quick list below to get you started:\n| Service | Primary DNS |\nSecondary DNS |\nAdditional Paid Services |\n| AdGuard DNS | 176.103.130.130 | 176.103.130.131 | No |\n| Alternate DNS | 198.101.242.72 | 23.253.163.53 | No |\n| CleanBrowsing DNS | 185.228.168.9 | 185.228.169.9 | Yes |\n| Cloudflare DNS | 1.1.1.1 | 1.0.0.1 | Yes |\n| Comodo Secure DNS | 8.26.56.26 | 8.20.247.20 | Yes |\n| DNS.Watch | 84.200.69.80 | 84.200.70.40 | No |\n| Google Public DNS | 8.8.8.8 | 8.8.4.4 | No |\n| OpenDNS Home | 208.67.222.222 | 208.67.220.220 | Yes |\n| Quad9 DNS | 9.9.9.9 | 149.112.112.112 | No |\n| Verisign DNS | 64.6.64.6 | 64.6.65.6 | No |\nIPv4 vs. IPv6\nEverything provided in this guide is based on Internet Protocol version 4, or IPv4. However, you\u2019ll also see references to version 6, or IPv6. This is a newer version of the protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to replace version 4. Why? Because of the older protocol\u2019s age and limitations.\nIPv4 can only handle 32 numbers. That limitation led to the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) to completely run out of available addresses in 2015.\nThe successor, iPv6, fixes the problem by introducing addresses with 128 numbers, or 128 bits, that can support 340 trillion trillion trillion combinations (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456). Developed in 1998, the protocol finally entered deployment in 2006, but the process has been slow.\nAccording to Google\u2019s statistics, IPv6 adoption in North America currently resides at 41.71% despite deployment beginning 14 years ago. Germany resides at 49.1%, France at 42.29%, Australia at 22.68%, and so on.\nThe bottom line here is that IPv4 and IPv6 will work side by side until the newer protocol fully replaces the older. That all said, you may find DNS numbers provided by IPv6 as well, though you can\u2019t enter them in IPv4 fields. Instead, you\u2019ll need to enter them in completely separate fields.\nFor example, here\u2019s the Windows 10 method:\nStep 1: Right-click on your internet connection icon located next to the system clock (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and select Open Network & Internet settings on the pop-up menu.\nStep 2: The Status category in the Settings app appears on your screen. Scroll down and click Network and Sharing Center.\nStep 3: The Control Panel appears on your screen. If you\u2019re on a wired connection, click the Ethernet link followed by the Properties button displayed on a pop-up window. If you\u2019re connected via Wi-Fi, click the Wi-Fi link instead followed by the Properties button.\nStep 4: Select Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) on the list and click the Properties button.\nStep 5: In the pop-up window, change the current DNS setting to Use the following DNS server addresses.\nStep 6: Enter the primary DNS server address in the first \u201cpreferred\u201d field. For Google\u2019s Public DNS, this would be 2001:4860:4860::8888.\nStep 7: Enter the secondary DNS server in the second \u201calternate\u201d field. For Google\u2019s Public DNS, this would be 2001:4860:4860::8844.\nStep 8: Click the OK button to complete.\nIf you thought IPv4 numeric addresses were hard to remember, be glad DNS swaps out those long IPv6 numeric addresses for google.com and netflix.com!\nAre you even using IPv6?\nWindows 10, MacOS 10.15 Catalina, and Chrome OS support IPv6. However, load the Test My IPv6 online test and you\u2019ll see that you\u2019re probably still surfing the web on IPv4. This is why (1) you should consider switching to third-party DNS servers and (2) add the IPv6 DNS server addresses to your operating system or router. You may not even be receiving an IPv6 flow from your ISP.\nNote that while modern routers support IPv6, they may not provide means to manually enter DNS server addresses based on IPv6."
