  "content": "More than 180 years after their first development, the historic cores on Hong Kong Island \u2013 Central, Sheung Wan and Wan Chai \u2013 and in Kowloon \u2013 Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok \u2013 face an acute urban crisis.\n\nOnce-vibrant neighbourhoods have become densely packed relics defined by ageing buildings, congested streets, poor sanitation and rising . Without bold, economy-driven solutions, these \u201cold districts\u201d risk losing not only their cultural soul but also much of their economic potential.\n\nOn August 9, a group of urban renewal experts and academics convened at the Hong Kong Institute of Architects headquarters to exchange ideas on the city\u2019s evolving landscape. The discussion spanned a wide range of pressing topics, including the concept of a \u201c \u201d, the revitalisation of the Kai Tak River, the development of a research framework for cultural ecology, reforms to heritage conservation mechanisms and the financial viability of urban renewal projects.\n\nParticipants stressed the importance of integrating environmental sustainability with cultural preservation while also addressing the economic realities of redevelopment. The gathering reflected growing momentum among professionals to rethink how Hong Kong\u2019s urban spaces can be made more\n\nBy 1988, authorities had recognised that piecemeal market-led redevelopment was insufficient and established the Land Development Corporation (LDC). In its first 11 years, the LDC rolled out 30 : 16 were completed, four were under construction and 10 more were in acquisition or advanced planning. Early projects proved financially viable because low-rise predecessors allowed generous new plot ratios.\n\nBut by the late 1990s, the LDC was mired in compensation disputes, protracted acquisition battles and mounting costs. A static compensation benchmark \u2013 pegged to property valuations of seven-year-old buildings \u2013 and an 80 per cent owner-consent threshold for compulsory sale of buildings pushed many schemes into the red.",

      "text": "Urban heat island effect big factor in climate change, Hong Kong records show\nHeat from human activity a big factor in climate change, HK records show\nTemperature and rainfall are the two most basic elements in climate change. So what can we learn from a study of local temperature records and why might it be that local factors other than carbon dioxide output are the main cause of rising temperatures in our city?\nClimate change is defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as that attributable directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and is in addition to natural climate variability. This definition challenges scientists to distinguish clearly between natural and human-induced causes.\nHowever, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as changes in the state of the climate that can be identified - for example, by using statistical tests - in such features as temperature and sea levels and that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Short time periods of less than 10 years have been excluded. The changes may be due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.\nThe Hong Kong Observatory was established in 1883. Continuous temperature records have been kept since 1884 except during the seven years 1940-1946 encompassing the second world war.\nTemperature measurements at the observatory are known historically to be influenced significantly by the urban heat island effect, defined as urban pockets that are significantly warmer than their surroundings due to human activities.\nA comparative study in 1988 of temperature records from the observatory in Tsim Sha Tsui and Macau monitoring stations attributed the warmest temperatures, and a temperature increase of about 0.9 degrees Celsius at the observatory between 1884 and 1986, to heat trapping in the Victoria Harbour basin. This is best explained by the urban heat island effect resulting from rapid population growth and lifestyle changes within the basin."

      "text": "Hong Kong needs to clean up its polluted air, not just measure it\nAsmita Aarshi says while the government has improved its tracking of the quality of our air, it has to do much more to clean it up\nOne of the most prolonged environmental issues haunting Hong Kong today is the worsening air pollution. With the introduction of the air quality health index, we now have more timely information about the state of the city's air, so people can take preventive measures to protect their health, if needed.\nAt least once a month, the city reaches the \"serious\" health risk category, when people are advised to reduce their time outdoors. The government is constantly being criticised for not doing enough to tackle the issue.\nProfessor Anthony Hedley, who died recently, was one of the first to point to the lack of an effective air management system for Hong Kong, and to criticise the government for not giving priority to the protection of public health. As the creator of the Hedley Environmental Index, which links the quality of Hong Kong's air to mortality and hospital visits, as well as economic costs, he dedicated his life to creating a healthy and breathable environment for Hong Kong people.\nIt was through his relentless efforts that more people are now aware that air pollution affects our health as well as our economic prosperity. Hedley recognised that clean air, just like clean food and water, is a basic human right. There can be no doubt air pollution can lead to death and economic loss.\nThe government should promote clean air for all, just as it has taken and continues to take action to guarantee clean drinking water and food. According to the Hedley index, in 2014, 2,616 people prematurely died because of air pollution, and 4.2 million people visited the doctor. This came at an unprecedented economic cost of more than HK$32 billion.\nAs our economy has grown, so has our air pollution. Every day, new cars, new buildings and new projects are popping up that affect our lives, for the worse. Developers, however, only highlight the economic benefits to society; they do not speak of the health costs due to pollution that the community bears as a whole. It is an environmental injustice that children, adults and old people alike have to face."
