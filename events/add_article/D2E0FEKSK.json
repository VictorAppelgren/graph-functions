      "summary": "European bond markets rattled after Chinese President Xi's massive military parade, amid concerns over mounting government deficits. U.S. Treasury yields rose, Japanese 30‑year yields hit record highs, and sterling fell as gilt yields spiked. Gold surged to an all‑time high at $3,546.99, while equity futures in Europe showed modest gains. Markets are pricing in a high probability of a 25‑bp Fed rate cut this month, with weak labor data potentially boosting cut odds.",
