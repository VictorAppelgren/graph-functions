  "content": "ORLANDO, FL / ACCESS Newswire / August 11, 2025 / Unusual Machines (NYSE AMERICAN:UMAC), a leading provider of NDAA-compliant drone components, today announced Tom Mercier has been appointed Vice President of Headsets, effective September 1, 2025. In this newly created role, Mercier will lead the build-out of the company\u2019s headset production capabilities in a soon-to-be-leased facility that will expand its manufacturing footprint beyond the recently announced 17,000-square-foot site dedicated to motor production.\n\nThe new facility-central to Unusual Machines\u2019 strategy to expand U.S.-based production of critical drone components-will initially focus on assembling high-performance FPV goggles with new levels of interoperability across systems. This expansion builds on Fat Shark\u2019s standing as one of the most recognized and trusted names in immersive FPV flight, known for meeting the demands of competitive pilots worldwide.\n\nMercier brings deep technical and operational experience in developing and scaling specialty optical systems-from early prototypes through high-yield manufacturing. His leadership at Magic Leap, Google, and Broadcom demonstrates his ability to bring sophisticated hardware to market efficiently, with an emphasis on yield, quality, and operational discipline.\n\n\u201cTom brings a rare combination of optical engineering expertise and hands-on experience standing up production lines for advanced hardware,\u201d said Allan Evans, CEO of Unusual Machines. \u201cHis background in micro-displays, specialty optics, and large-scale manufacturing will be invaluable as we expand production in Orlando. This appointment directly supports our strategy to strengthen supply chain dependability, improve quality control, and bring more capability closer to home.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoining Unusual Machines during this pivotal phase is an incredibly exciting opportunity,\u201d said Tom Mercier. \u201cWith Fat Shark\u2019s heritage as a trusted name in FPV flight and a renewed focus on U.S.-based production, we can deliver headsets that combine the performance, reliability, and interoperability that today\u2019s pilots demand.\u201d\n\nInitial headset production will focus on final assembly in the soon-to-be-leased Orlando facility, with plans to expand domestic capabilities and sourcing in subsequent phases.\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expectation that we will be successful leasing a new facility and expand our manufacturing footprint and build our headset production capabilities and that we will be successful in strengthening our supply chain dependability and improving our quality control to meet our mission to deliver headsets that combine the performance, reliability, and interoperability that today\u2019s pilots demand. The words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cis likely,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect\u201d and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The results expected by some or all of these forward-looking statements may not occur. Factors that affect our ability to achieve these results include the continued availability of commercial real estate near our Orlando, Florida facilities, the availability of a satisfactory labor pool, potential supply chain issues, the impact from tariffs including inflation, and the Risk Factors contained in our Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on May 8, 2025, Prospectus Supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on July 15, 2025 and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Any forward-looking statement made by us herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\nUnusual Machines manufactures and sells drone components and drones across a diversified brand portfolio, which includes Fat Shark, the leader in FPV (first-person view) ultra-low latency video goggles for drone pilots.
