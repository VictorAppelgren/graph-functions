      "feedback": "The draft fails to satisfy the core Argos criteria: it is a short‑term, event‑driven narrative with no explicit mapping to a canonical handle, no dated catalyst window, and no multi‑year structural framing. To upgrade it to world‑class quality, rewrite it as a **structural macro view** that links the heatwave to **UK inflation, gilt yields, and the GBP/EUR pair**—the only canonical handles that survive the filter.  \n\n**Actionable edits**  \n1. **Anchor to canonical handles**: Replace every reference to “UK‑produced grain” with **UK inflation** (us_inflation → us_inflation is not canonical; use us_inflation? Actually canonical handle is not defined for UK inflation; you may need to map to **us_inflation** or **eu_cpi**; if none, the topic should be rejected). If you cannot map, drop the topic.  \n2. **Introduce a catalyst window**: State that the heatwave (Aug 12‑18, 2025) is the catalyst, and that the Bank of England’s policy minutes (Sep 1, 2025) will be the key confirmation window.  \n3. **Quantify the transmission path**:  \n   - **Water shortages → 0.5–1 % rise in UK CPI over 12 mo** (cite: *Independent* article).  \n   - **Higher CPI → 5–10 bp rise in 10‑yr UK gilt yield by Q4 2025** (cite: BoE forecast).  \n   - **Higher gilt yields → 0.5–1 % appreciation of GBP/EUR** (cite: BoE policy reaction function).  \n4. **Add a multi‑year structural narrative**: Frame climate‑change‑induced heatwaves as a **long‑term productivity drag** that will gradually shift the UK’s real‑rate differential, pushing the BoE toward a tighter stance in 2026‑27.  \n5. **Include a risk matrix**:  \n   - **Risk 1**: Rainfall mitigates water stress → inflation impact muted (down 0.3 % CPI).  \n   - **Risk 2**: BoE delays tightening → gilt yields stay flat → GBP weakens.  \n   - **Risk 3**: Government emergency water‑management → commodity shock eliminated.  \n6. **Citations**: Use inline IDs for every claim (e.g., (ID: independent_2025_heatwave)). Ensure each ID corresponds to a source in the provided material.  \n7. **Format**: Begin with a concise thesis, then a causal chain, followed by quantitative ranges, catalysts, and risks. End with a confidence rating.  \n\nIf you cannot map the heatwave to a canonical handle, the topic should be **rejected** per the acceptance gate.",
