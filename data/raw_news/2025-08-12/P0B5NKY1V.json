  "content": "A sheriff in Virginia's historic Shenandoah Valley area said the fatal home invasion stabbing of a country music singer's mother is unlike \"anything\" he's ever seen.\n\nAuthorities said an intruder killed 62-year-old Holly Hatcher, a former teacher, around midnight on Aug. 3 at their home in Rockingham County. Michael Hatcher, 65, shot and killed the intruder, who was identified by officials as 41-year-old Kevin Moses Walker.\n\nThe couple's son, 31-year-old Spencer Hatcher, an up-and-coming country singer, announced he's canceling many of his upcoming shows after his mother was killed.\n\nWalker has no known criminal history, officials added, noting he was involved in a car crash two days prior to the home invasion. Rockingham County Sheriff Bryan Hutcheson said in a video posted to Facebook that he's never seen anything like this.\n\nCOUNTRY SINGER'S MOTHER KILLED IN HOME INVASION BEFORE FATHER SHOOTS INTRUDER DEAD IN VIRGINIA\n\n\"Speaking personally, this is 31 years in law enforcement for me, I have never seen anything like this in my entire career, just the way the unusual, unique and just crazy situation that this turned out to be,\" Hutcheson said.\n\nThe sheriff said that the home invasion was random and \"highly unusual,\" adding that Walker brought a \"large knife\" into the home.\n\nAccording to investigators, Walker was renting a campsite at Endless Caverns two days prior to the attack and was seen on surveillance video at a local Walmart buying a knife and sleeping bag.\n\nHutcheson said Walker was killed in the driveway when Michael Hatcher grabbed a loaded pistol from his car and fired one shot.\n\nIn a video posted by the sheriff's office, Michael Hatcher thanked the community for supporting his family.\n\nTEACHER ACCUSED OF ARKANSAS HIKING MURDERS BOUNCED BETWEEN 4 DISTRICTS IN 3 STATES\n\n\"I've heard a lot of you say that there are no words to explain this, and there aren't \u2013 and there's going to be questions that will never be answered,\" Michael Hatcher said. \"But all I can tell you is, we've cried, we've hurt, we've hugged, and we have found more love than we have ever known has existed between us and between you. Thank you.\"\n\nThe Rockingham County Public Schools, where Holly Hatcher taught, said in a statement that she worked there for 19 years and will be remembered as a \"beloved\" colleague.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Spencer and his brother Connor have already become like family to us, and we couldn\u2019t be happier to officially welcome Spencer to Stone Country Records. When Spencer first came onto my radar, his style and sky-high potential reminded me of a young George Strait, so I knew we had to sign him. He feels like the right artist arriving at just the right time in country music,\" Brown said.\n\nSpencer Hatcher said in an Instagram post that his planned performances at the VOA Country Music Fest in Ohio and the Rockingham County Fair in Harrisonburg, Virginia are canceled.\n\n\"I hope to make these dates up to my fans in the future,\" Spencer Hatcher wrote. \"I appreciated everyone that has lent their support to me and my loved ones.\"",

Their 31-year-old son Spencer Hatcher, an up-and-coming country crooner, canceled several upcoming shows as his family deals with his mother's death.\n\"Speaking personally, this is 31 years in law enforcement for me, I have never seen anything like this in my entire career, just the way the unusual, unique and just crazy situation that this turned out to be,\" Rockingham County Sheriff Bryan Hutcheson said in a video posted to the department's Facebook page.\nARKANSAS HIKING MURDERS: TIMELINE REVEALS TEACHER SUSPECT\u2019S ROUTE FROM CLASSROOM TO COURTROOM\nThe Rockingham County Sheriff's Office identified the deceased suspect as 41-year-old Kevin Moses Walker of Pikesville, Maryland, who had no known criminal history, violent or otherwise, aside from a bizarre car crash just two days before the home invasion.\nHutcheson, who said he's known the family for years, revealed a personal connection to Holly Hatcher.\nNEWLYWEDS' HONEYMOON TRIP ENDS IN FIERY CRASH THAT KILLS HUSBAND AND BABY DAUGHTER\n\"My oldest son had Holly as a teacher in school, absolutely loved her, and I'm sure I can speak for many, many other children she taught over the years as to what a wonderful, wonderful teacher and influence on their life that she was,\" he said.\nWalker entered the home with a \"large knife\" in a seemingly random and \"highly unusual\" crime, the sheriff said. Details about what happened inside remain hazy \u2013 but Walker fatally stabbed Holly Hatcher before a life-and-death fight with her husband, who had visible wounds when deputies arrived and was wearing a large bandage on his forearm during a public appearance days later.\nIDAHO VICTIMS' FAMILIES TO ADDRESS KILLER DIRECTLY AT KOHBERGER SENTENCING\nThe struggle ended in the driveway, where he retrieved a loaded pistol from his vehicle and fired a single shot, killing Walker, Hutcheson said.\nA potential motive remains under investigation.\nInvestigators said over the weekend that Walker had rented a campsite at Endless Caverns, a landmark cave system that attracts tourists from around the world, two days before the attack. He also paid for and took a tour of the caverns before buying a sleeping bag and knife at a Walmart in town, where police saw him on surveillance video.\nEarly on Aug. 2, state police found Walker's vehicle abandoned and disabled near the park, Hutcheson said. They found damage to a nearby store consistent with having been rammed by a motor vehicle. Nothing was stolen.\nWalker had no known history of violence or crime at the time, Hutcheson said.\nA house fire on Aug. 3, about five hours before the murder, had no connection to the suspect and was accidental in nature, he added.\nIn the aftermath, Michael Hatcher said both the sheriff's office and local community had been pillars of support for his family.\nAMERICANS AT RISK 'ANYWHERE' AFTER 6 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE CHARGED IN MOTHER'S MURDER: CONGRESSMAN\n\"I've heard a lot of you say that there are no words to explain this, and there aren't \u2013 and there's going to be questions that will never be answered,\" Michael Hatcher said in a video posted by the sheriff's office. \"But all I can tell you is, we've cried, we've hurt, we've hugged, and we have found more love than we have ever known has existed between us and between you.
