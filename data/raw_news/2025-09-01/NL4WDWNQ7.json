  "content": "WHOOPING cough is a serious bacterial infection affecting the lungs, which can be particularly dangerous to babies.\n\nThirty-three babies have died of the illness in the UK between 2013 and June 2025, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).\n\nOne of these deaths was reported at the end of last month, in a baby whose mum wasn't vaccinated against whooping cough.\n\nThe tot was the first baby to die of whooping cough in the UK this year, UKHSA said.\n\nVaccination for pertussis - as the illness is also known - is given to babies as part of the 'six-in-one' jab at eight, 12, and 16 weeks.\n\nBut mums-to-be can also get vaccinated against whooping cough, to pass on protection to their babies until they can receive the jab.\n\nThe programme was first rolled out in October 2012.\n\nOf the 33 babies who died of whooping cough between 2013 and 2025, 27 were born to mums who weren't vaccinated while they were pregnant, according to UKHSA.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said: \u201cSadly, we are again reminded how severe whooping cough can be for very young babies.\n\n\u201cVaccination is the best defence.\n\n\"It is vital pregnant women and infants receive their vaccines at the right time, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks.\n\n\u201cThis passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest data there were 502 cases of whooping cough reported between January and June this year.\n\nOf these, eight included infants aged under three months old, who are most at risk of complications.\n\nThis is a big drop from the 2,793 cases reported in the same period last year.\n\nBetween January and April 2024 there were 181 confirmed pertussis cases in infants aged under three months.\n\nEleven children in England died after an outbreak of whooping cough last year.\n\nExperts say that whooping cough tends to surge every five years or so.\n\nUKHSA last year warned: \"The current increase is coming at a time when there has been a steady decline in uptake of the vaccine in pregnant women and in children.\"\n\nThe health watchdog issued similar warnings over falling vaccine rates among pregnant women for whooping cough this year.\n\n\"Although for the first few years of the programme, vaccine coverage was around 70 per cent, uptake has fallen below this level year on year since 2020,\" it said.\n\nThe vaccine has been shown to offer 91 per cent protection from whooping cough to babies aged less than three months, and 93 per cent protection for babies younger than eight weeks.\n\nWhooping cough gets its name from the characteristic sound people make when infected - a gasping \"whoop\" as they suck in air between coughs.\n\nIt is otherwise known as the \u2018100-day cough\u2019, as it can cling on for several weeks or months.\n\nHere we reveal how symptoms of whooping cough develop from day one to day 100.\n\nThe bug, known as pertussis, is a fast-spreading bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes.\n\nDr Simon Theobalds, a GP from Manchester, said: \"Most viral infections [like whooping cough] last one to two weeks, but for some people it may be longer.\n\n\"There are various reasons for this, including the different levels of immunity against infections.\"\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the notoriously long illness progresses through three stages.\n\nThe symptoms usually start five to 10 days after you catch the bug.\n\nAt first, symptoms are often similar to the common cold, but after about a week, patients will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night.\n\nYoung babies may also make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing.\n\nThe cough can bring up thick mucus, which can cause people to be sick.\n\nYoung children or babies might turn blue or grey because of difficulty breathing, while adults might become red in the face.\n\nIf you or your child\u2019s lips, tongue, face, or skin suddenly turns blue or grey, call 999 or go to A&E immediately.\n\nThe condition spreads very easily and can sometimes cause serious problems, including rib fractures, pneumonia and seizures.\n\nBy week eight, the violent cough will usually have developed into something milder.\n\nBut for some, it can last several months, so it is often dubbed the '100-day cough'.\n\n\"If symptoms persist or worsen and you feel more unwell or have high fevers, we recommend a GP appointment to have a full assessment and rule out more serious conditions such as pneumonia or sepsis,\" Dr Simon added.\n\nAsk for an urgent appointment or call NHS 111 if:\n\u2022 Your cough is very bad or gets worse very quickly\n\u2022 The side of your neck feels swollen or painful\n\u2022 You find it difficult to breathe\n\nIf you do have whooping cough, antibiotics can help - but only if you start taking them within three weeks of your symptoms starting, the NHS says.\n\nThe best way to protect your family from it is by getting vaccinated.\n\nIt was reported last year that uptake among pregnant women had fallen to a seven-year low.\n\nIt dropped from over 70 per cent in September 2017 to around 58 per cent in September 2023.\n\nHowever, vaccination rates rose slightly for the 2024 to 2025 financial year to 65 per cent, according to UKHSA.\n\nParents have been urged to check that their child is protected, and the UKHSA is reminding mums-to-be to get the jab so their babies are protected at birth.\n\nIt is offered as part of the six-in-one jab when babies are eight, 12 and 16 weeks old.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, UKHSA consultant epidemiologist, previously said: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young infants, it can be particularly serious.\n\n\"However, vaccinating pregnant women is highly effective in protecting babies from birth until they can receive their own vaccines.\n\n\"Parents can also help protect their children by ensuring they receive their vaccines at the right time or catching up as soon as possible if they have missed any.\n\n\"If you're unsure, please check your child's red book or get in touch with your GP surgery.\"\n\nUKHSA warned last week that vaccination rates for primary school children were at the lowest levels for 15 years.\n\nAlmost one in five children starting primary school this week in England are not fully protected from diseases including whooping cough, polio, tetanus and diphtheria.\n\nFrom next year the NHS will begin vaccinating all babies against chickenpox by combining it with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nUptake of both doses of the MMR jab has fallen to its lowest since 2009-10, with only 83.7 per cent of five-year-olds fully protected.\n\nIn England childhood vaccination rates have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly a decade, and the UK is below the World Health Organisation's 95 per cent threshold for herd immunity across all five vaccines.\n\nHow to tackle whooping cough once you have it\n\nThere is usually no need to see a GP if you have a cough, according to the NHS.\n\nBut you should rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid contact with others.\n\nPainkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen can also be taken, as well as hot lemon and honey drinks and herbal medicine called pelargonium (if over the age of 12).\n\nPharmacists can also advise on the best cough syrups, medicines, sweets, and supplements.\n\nYou should see your GP if a cough has lasted longer than three weeks, you are losing weight for no reason, or you have a weakened immune system.",

  "summary": "The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported that between 2013 and 2025, a total of 33 babies have died of whooping cough in the UK from birth to death, with 27 of these babies born to mums who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. The agency's Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam emphasized the importance of vaccination for pregnant women and infants to pass on protection to their babies until they are born. The vaccine for pertussis, which is also known as the illness, is given to babies as part of the'six-in-one' jab at eight, 12, and 16 weeks. According to the latest data, there were only 502 cases of the illness reported between January and June this year, a significant drop from the 2,793 cases reported in the same period last year. Experts warn that whooping coughing tends to surge every five years or so due to surges in whooping activity every five. The UKHSA has issued warnings about falling vaccine rates among pregnant women, highlighting the steady decline in uptake of the vaccine.",

The increase in coverage may be partially explained by improved data flows [Note 1]\nNote 1. A new point of care app developed by NHSE to record vaccination events was introduced in September 2024. The Record a Vaccination service (RAVs) has improved dataflows into general practice which may partially account for the increase in coverage reported in recent months.\nIntroduction\nThis report presents data for pertussis vaccine coverage in pregnant women in England for the period January to March 2025, updating the previous data reported for October to December 2024 (1); it also presents annual coverage data for the whole of the 2024/25 financial year.\nThe pertussis vaccine has been offered to pregnant women since 1 October 2012 (2) following increased pertussis activity in all age groups, including infants under 3 months of age, and the declaration of a national pertussis outbreak in April 2012 (3),\nIn June 2014, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised it should continue for a further 5 years (4). In February 2016, the JCVI considered new evidence demonstrating that vaccination earlier in pregnancy would increase opportunities during pregnancy for vaccination, without detrimentally affecting the protection afforded to the infant (5, 6). Based on this, JCVI advised that vaccination could be offered from gestational week 16, although for operational reasons vaccination should ideally be offered from around 20 weeks, on or after the foetal anomaly scan (7).\nThis advice was implemented from April 2016 as was offering the vaccine through general practice as well as some maternity services. In 2019, following the JCVI recommendation, the prenatal pertussis vaccine became a routine programme in England (8).\nThe prenatal pertussis vaccination programme aims to minimise disease, hospitalisation and deaths in young infants, through the intra-uterine transfer of maternal antibodies, until they can be actively protected by the routine infant programme with the first dose of pertussis vaccine scheduled at 8 weeks of age (9).\nMethods\nGeneral practice level pertussis vaccine coverage data is automatically uploaded via participating GP IT suppliers to the ImmForm website each month. ImmForm data is validated and analysed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to check data completeness, identify and query any anomalous data and describe epidemiological trends. Since April and May 2016 (implementation date varied by GP IT supplier), the following monthly data has been collected:\n-\ndenominator: number of women who delivered in the survey month, excluding miscarriages and stillbirths, regardless of gestational age\n-\nnumerator: number of women receiving pertussis vaccination between week 16 of pregnancy and delivery\nFor accurate denominators to be extracted from GP IT systems by the automated survey and precise coverage estimates to be calculated, it is important that the medical records of all women who have given birth have the following fields completed:\n-\nthe date of delivery\n-\nthe date of receipt of a pertussis-containing vaccine at or after week 16 of pregnancy, regardless of the setting where the vaccine was administered\n-\nwhere relevant, fields indicating stillbirth or miscarriage\nCoverage by NHS commissioning region (based on the 2019 NHS England configurations), ICB and Sub ICB are reported in the data tables associated with this report.\nAnnual vaccine coverage for England was calculated by summing the 12 monthly numerators and denominators for the financial year (April 2024 to March 2025). This is different from reports showing annual data on, and prior to, the 2018 to 2019 financial year, where a separate annual extraction (based on the same coding specification) was used to report the annual coverage.\nFor ethnicity, monthly data was collated for the annual period and coverage calculated by ethnic group according to ONS 2011 census categories. For the ethnicity analysis in this report, we excluded those registered patients without an ethnicity code. In total, we excluded 61,980 of the total 460,833 (13.4%) women recorded as having delivered in the 2024 to 2025 financial year. Coverage in excluded women was 61.7% (38,211 out of 61,980).\nParticipation and data quality\nAll GP IT suppliers provided data for the January to March 2025 period. National GP practice participation was at 99.1% (January 2025), 99.0% (February 2025) and 99.0% (March 2025).\nResults\nCoverage in the 2024 to 2025 financial year\nThe main findings for the 2024 to 2025 financial year were that:\n-\nannual coverage was 65.6%.

Monthly pertussis vaccination coverage (%) in pregnant women (England), 2016 to 2025\nFigure 2. Monthly pertussis vaccination coverage (%) in pregnant women by NHS commissioning region, April 2019 to March 2025 [Note 1]\nNote 1. Data from the smallest IT supplier was excluded between November to December 2019.\nDiscussion\nThis report evaluates pertussis vaccine coverage data for women who delivered in the period January to March 2025 (quarterly data) and between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025 (annual data).\nMonthly prenatal pertussis vaccine coverage in the fourth quarter of financial year 2024/25 was 69.8% in January, 71.8% in February and 72.6% in March. From January to March 2025, the difference in monthly coverage between the highest and lowest ICB was 40.6 percentage points.\nAnnual vaccine coverage was 65.6% in the 2024/25 financial year. By ethnicity, coverage was highest in White British women (73.0%) and lowest in Black or Black British Caribbean women (39.0%).\nLimitations to the data presented in this report may explain the observed variability in coverage at the local level and over time. First, completeness of data is reliant on the recording of delivery dates in the mother\u2019s medical records and a recent study in England suggests that maternity notes regarding pregnancy (10) and delivery are often scanned or archived, rather than coded in an extractable format. Furthermore, a comparison of this denominator data with national data on live births (11) indicates that in 2021, this data represented about 71% of the population of pregnant women.\nContinued support in the delivery of this important programme has been sought from:\n-\nservice providers (GP practices and maternity units)\n-\nscreening and immunisation teams\n-\nhealth protection teams (HPTs)\nScreening and immunisation teams and HPTs should continue to update service providers on the current epidemiology of the disease and the need to maintain and improve coverage achieved thus far.\nIf coverage, and ultimately the impact of the programme itself, is to be accurately monitored, it is essential that GPs and practice nurses continue to ensure that vaccination and date of delivery are recorded in the patient\u2019s GP record. In areas that have commissioned maternity units to offer pertussis vaccines in pregnancy, it is important that providers ensure doses of vaccines given to individual women are also communicated to the woman\u2019s GP. Maternity units not offering pertussis vaccines to pregnant women should continue to discuss its importance, make use of available resources (12), and signpost women to their GP to receive the vaccine.\nGPs, practice nurses, obstetricians, and midwives should continue to encourage pregnant women to receive the pertussis vaccine \u2013 ideally between weeks 20 and 32 of their pregnancy (but up to term) \u2013 so as to optimise protection for their babies from birth (7).\nReferences\n1.

  "argos_summary": "Thirty\u2011three babies in the UK have died from whooping cough between 2013 and June 2025, with 27 of those deaths linked to mothers who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. The latest data show 502 cases in the first half of the year, a sharp drop from 2,793 the same period last year, yet infant deaths continue to rise. Vaccination coverage for pregnant women has fallen below 70% since 2020, though it rose modestly to 65% in the 2024\u201125 financial year. The UK Health Security Agency stresses that maternal vaccination between weeks 20 and 32 of pregnancy is the most effective protection for newborns until they receive their own shots.",
