  "content": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 Browns quarterback Kenny Pickett took questions from reporters on Thursday with regard to his hamstring injury, returning to play his former team, Shedeur Sanders\u2019 oblique injury, and more.\n\nBelow is the transcript as provided by the Browns media relations department:\n\nKenny, you\u2019ve obviously gone against Quinyon (Mitchell) and Cooper (DeJean) plenty last season. Where have you seen them over these last two days make the biggest advancement in their game?\n\n\u201cYeah, I was talking to Q (Quinyon Mitchell) a little bit in between some of the periods. Just his understanding of the defense now being a year in, having a full year of experience, and then kind of understanding what offenses are trying to do attacking the defense that they play. So, I think he\u2019s done a great job. He obviously was phenomenal last year for them. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how he does this year.\u201d\n\nHow are you coming along with the hamstring and where are you at and what\u2019s the outlook?\n\n\u201cYeah, I feel like I\u2019m turning the corner a little bit this week, which is really positive. I was able to run, you know, a little bit more yesterday, so I\u2019m getting there. Just taking a day at a time. You know, obviously it\u2019s extremely frustrating. I\u2019m only being able to get like seven-on-sevens lately and some 1-on-1s, but just focused on trying to take advantage of those as much as I can.\u201d\n\nDo you feel like next week you should be able to, knock on wood, be able to get out there?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that yet. It\u2019s\u2026 you know, it\u2019ll be close.\u201d\n\nHave they told you, \u201cHey, you know, anything can still happen and keep your head in this competition because it\u2019s not over yet\u201d?\n\n\u201cIt was never even mentioned. I think, you know, we\u2019re all just going a day at a time. You know, going through camp, you know, they\u2019ll make that decision whenever they want to make that decision. But I\u2019m just trying to put my best foot forward on the reps that I do get right now.\n\nHow did it feel being back here?\n\n\u201cIt was great. It was great. You know, you have a special season like that, you kind of build a bond with people for life. So being able to see everyone that I played with last year, coaches, trainers. I went in the cafeteria and saw all the, you know, all the people back there, and got to give some hugs. So, it was great. You know, it holds a special place in my heart for that year, really glad we were back here for this camp to go see everybody.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to you really, since the Super Bowl. What did it mean to you to be out there late in that game?\n\n\u201cYeah, it was awesome. You know, the five-year-old in me would have been going crazy back in the day. I remember watching Donovan McNabb, all those old days when he was making his runs and, you know, to be able to be a part of that team was awesome. Having my parents there, my family, my wife, it was really cool.\u201d\n\nYou were obviously a big part of that quarterback room last year, especially with Tanner McKee. What have you noticed in his development? Do you still talk to him like, you know, just, how\u2019s the relationship?\n\n\u201cYeah, we just talked a little bit yesterday and today. You know, I think the system \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changing or a little different. Just kind of talking through some of those things, talking again about our defense that he was playing out there today. Tanner\u2019s (McKee) an awesome guy, man. I know he\u2019s going to do a great job for them. You know, he\u2019s prepared for it. He\u2019s a true pro, goes about his business the right way. So really happy for him.\u201d\n\nKenny, how bizarre is it or I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s the right word, but after you get injured, then Dillon (Gabriel) gets injured, now Shedeur (Sanders) is injured. And just this whole four-way quarterback competition took these unexpected twists.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a wild game. You know, it\u2019s football. You know, everyone \u2014 I got my own problems to worry about. I\u2019m just focused on my recovery. You never want to see anyone go down. We all want to be out there competing, so it\u2019s a tough deal, but I know each guy is trying to get back out there and be 100%.\u201d\n\nKenny, I don\u2019t know if frustration is the right word, but I know you mentioned it a couple of times, so just managing that part of dealing with the soft hamstring injury?\n\n\u201cI try to give myself 24 hours to be as angry as I could be and then just turn the page, you know, every day doing as much as I can. It truly is a 24/7 grind to try to get back 100%. So, I\u2019m doing absolutely everything I can. Hopefully I can push it to get out there. I want to be smart, but at the same time I want to be out there competing. So, you\u2019re kind of like walking that fine line.\u201d\n\nI think you talked about this back in the offseason, but just the experiences you had last year in Philly (Philadelphia), what ways have you brought that to this team, this locker room, this quarterback room?\n\n\u201cYeah, I think\u2026 I talked to Tommy (Rees) a lot about what we did last year, and I think he does a great job of looking at, you know, what other teams do, what other systems and concepts have been really successful for other teams. And he asked me a lot, he\u2019ll be like, \u2018what were your favorite five from Philly, favorite five from Pittsburgh.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done the same with Joe (Flacco). He\u2019s just always looking to make the system better and put our guys in the best places to succeed. So, you know, I think we go back and forth on a lot of the things that we did. We pull up tape, we kind of go through it that way. So, we have a quarterback room with a lot of knowledge and experience, you know, with Joe (Flacco) and Deshaun\u2019s (Watson) played a lot of football too, so, I try to add as much as I can, so I think that\u2019s probably the main way.\u201d\n\nWhat were you really excited about in terms of your progress in those first four practices? It seemed like you were really coming along there.\n\n\u201cYeah, I felt, I think I touched on it before the five weeks at home, I really just dedicated to studying the playbook and going through it on the field, you know, training hard, being in the best shape that I felt like I have been in my life for the competition. So, I came back ready to go. You know, obviously the injury is unfortunate, but I kind of, I feel like I\u2019m keeping that same thing in the seven-on-seven reps that I get, just trying to be as accurate as I can be, make the right read and move on to the next play. So that\u2019s really my mindset right now.\u201d\n\nKenny, I\u2019m sorry if they asked you this. I just walked in. But you know this (Philadelphia) Eagles defense better than anybody. From your vantage point, watching the offense, your offense these two days, how do you think they did overall?\n\n\u201cI thought they did a great job. I thought, you know, there\u2019s positives, there\u2019s negatives, there\u2019s always going to be that. We definitely want to clean up the pre-snap stuff, something the coaches are harping on, you know, that we need to get cleaned up as an offense. But I thought it was a good battle for both days. I think there was highs on both sides. You know, there were some lows on both sides, but the competitiveness, the want to, was there. I really liked the way we competed. Guys were going at it, so it was a positive.\u201d\n\nEspecially in a setting like this, how much are you staying involved in the conversations with the other quarterbacks?\n\n\u201cHeavily. Yeah, as heavily as I can be because I\u2019m not getting those reps. I kind of stand in the back and go through the checks, go through the cadence, trying to steal as much as I can. And then when those guys come off, I try to help them out too, you know, tell them what I saw, ask them what they saw and kind of talk through the play. Then you have the meetings again to go over that and kind of have that open dialogue. So, it\u2019s been good from that standpoint.\u201d\n\nI know you have your own issues to deal with, but did Shedeur (Sanders), you know, seek you out a little bit just for any kind of consolation or did you have any words of advice for him for the oblique thing that happened yesterday?\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, yeah, we\u2019re in the training room together and we just talked about it. I mean, he\u2019s awesome. He\u2019s got a great attitude about it. You know, he\u2019ll be back out there as soon as he can be just like I can. So, I really like his attitude and how he\u2019s going about his business.\u201d\n\nKenny, Harold Fannin (Jr.) had a big day today especially. He had a drop early, kind of came back from it. How have you seen him progress? And just having two big targets like him and (David) Njoku, how does that help a quarterback?\n\n\u201cI think we have an unbelievable tight end room. Obviously with Dave (David Njoku), everyone knows what he can do, but Harold\u2019s (Fannin Jr.) really stepped up. You know, I\u2019m really impressed with the intensity that he practices. He\u2019s such a quiet guy. And then he goes in there and really competes hard and he\u2019ll take on a MIKE backer and run plays and a defensive end one-on-one. He\u2019ll take them on with no problem and then go out there and run great routes. So, I\u2019m really impressed with Harold (Fannin Jr.) and what I think he can bring to this team, if he stays on the track that he\u2019s on right now.\u201d",

      "text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 There was only one way for the Browns and Eagles offensive lines to end their second and final joint practice on Thursday: by throwing back a couple of cold ones.\nBrowns Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio and the rest of the starting O-line were greeted by a couple of Eagles Pro Bowlers. right tackle Lane Johnson and injured left guard Landon Dickerson, between two of the practice fields at the NovaCare Complex.\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage\nDickerson brought out a green soft cooler with Miller Lite emblazoned on the side. The group stood chatting, laughing and drinking, jerseys rolled up as the sun beat down.\n\u201cIt looked like a Gatorade can to me,\u201d Bitonio said with a laugh, keeping up some plausible deniability. \u201cBut no, it was a nice gesture.\n\u201cThe O-linemen suffer together sometimes, so it\u2019s always a bond. Even on other teams. We respect each other\u2019s games and stuff, so it was a nice gesture.\u201d\nStories by Ashley Bastock\nIt\u2019s peak O-line culture. And the respect and commiseration between the two units is understandable after the last two days.\nDuring each practice, feels-like temps were hovering around 100 degrees. Both units also expended a ton of energy containing some of the top D-lines in the game.\nFor the Eagles, it was all about trying to limit star edge rusher Myles Garrett and rookie DT Mason Graham.\nGarrett created the most havoc throughout the two days of practice, getting at least 2.5 sacks on Wednesday and another one on Thursday.\n\u201cMyles is a freak,\u201d said Philadelphia left tackle Jordan Mailata (who quipped that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get that invite\u201d when asked about his teammates sharing some beers with the Browns). \u201cBut like I said, man, when you go up against the best ... you\u2019re able to learn from the next rep.\u201d\nThe Browns, meanwhile, struggled against Eagles DTs Jalen Carter, Jordan Davis and Moro Ojomo in coordinator Vic Fangio\u2019s five-down front.\nOn Wednesday, the group really got the best of the Browns in the run game in particular.\n\u201cAll three of those guys are great players,\u201c Bitonio said. \u201dThey play hard. I think Jalen Carter obviously was one of the best D-tackles in the game last year, and Jordan Davis has slimmed down and is playing hard, so it\u2019s a good challenge.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s great to do it in a practice where you can try something if it doesn\u2019t quite work right here, you know not to try that in the game.\u201d\nWhen the Browns went back and watched Wednesday film, Bitonio said some of the biggest issues in getting the run game going were due to missed assignments along the line.\nIt was something that became a priority to fix on Thursday morning ahead of the second session.\n\u201cI think we had 70 some plays (on Wednesday) and there was a lot of MAs and we were like, \u2018Hey, if we\u2019re not going to even give ourselves assignments correctly, we\u2019re not going to have a chance here,\u2019\u201d Bitonio said. \u201cSo just playing a new defense, seeing a few looks that we hadn\u2019t seen on film yet, and just understanding, hey, we can communicate up there and find a way to pick it up correctly.\u201d\nThis kind of battle was to be expected considering both teams pride themselves on being built in the trenches, and find so much identity and star power there.\nIn fact, arguably the biggest star sighting on the field Thursday was Cleveland Heights native and former All-Pro Eagles center Jason Kelce \u2014 fresh off his wildly popular interview with brother Travis Kelce and his girlfriend Taylor Swift on the Kelce Brothers\u2019 New Heights Podcast \u2014 who stood between fields chatting with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam prior to the beginning of practice.\nThe two teams also know one another well and have similar philosophies when it comes to winning up front.\nHead coaches Kevin Stefanski and Nick Sirianni are friends and have worked well through two previous sets of joint practices in 2022 and 2023. Browns DC Jim Schwartz is a former Eagles defensive coordinator and won a Super Bowl in Philadelphia in 2017. Browns GM Andrew Berry had a previous stint in Philly working under GM Howie Roseman, and his twin brother, Adam Berry, is the Eagles VP of football operations and strategy. Browns assistant GM Catherine Hickman also had a previous stop working in the Eagles front office under Roseman.\nSo while neither unit was perfect in either day, in many ways it was to be expected.\nEveryone knew what they were getting into in these joint practices because they\u2019ve done them before and they knew the opponent well. These sessions are about trial and error, and picking the brains of some of the other best players in the league that you won\u2019t have to see in the regular season.\nThe point is not to be perfect, but to learn from the struggles in a controlled environment.\nIt\u2019s a lot of work to get done in a short amount of time, so unwinding with a couple of cold \u201cGatorades,\u201d as Bitonio called them, was the perfect button.\nFootball Insider newsletter free trial: Take a minute and sign up for a free trial of our Football Insider newsletter, featuring exclusive content from cleveland.com's Browns reporters."

      "text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett took a quick break before a team period on Thursday, standing under the goalposts and chatting someone up. His teammates, getting ready to line up, started calling his name.\nGarrett politely finished his conversation, slid on his helmet while he hustled to his spot on the right side of the Browns defensive line and resumed terrorizing the Eagles, like he did for much of the two joint practices here.\nThe Browns\u2019 $40 million per year man looked worth every penny during these practices and it led to a simple question after the second session ended: How do you stop him?\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata said. \u201cNot because I don\u2019t want to. I just don\u2019t really know the answer.\u201d\nSurely going against Garrett for two days must teach you something, right?\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one like Myles,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cYou can\u2019t apply what Myles does to anyone else. He\u2019s just a freak.\u201d\nGarrett signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension in March after requesting a trade following the Browns\u2019 3-14 season. It was the richest contract ever for a non-quarterback at the time and the type of market-setting contract a player like Garrett can command.\nBrowns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz challenged Garrett to take his already dominant game to another level during the spring.\n\u201cI really think Myles is going to have the best season of his career and has to, right?\u201d Schwartz said during OTAs. \u201cI\u2019ve told him before \u2026 what\u2019s that Spider-Man quote? \u2018With great power comes great responsibility,\u2019 right? That\u2019s with the big contract, with the notoriety that came along with that, with the process that took to get him to that point. There\u2019s always pressure in this league, but probably a little bit more so. That brings out the best in players, and I know that\u2019ll be the case with Myles.\u201d\nGarrett has responded by having a dominant camp, making life miserable for new Browns left tackle Dawand Jones and then anyone he faced from Philadelphia this week.\nMailata, a second-team All-Pro in 2024, was dumbfounded on what to do against Garrett, particularly with his ability to stay low and bend the edge like no one else in the game.\n\u201cI\u2019m just standing, like, \u2018What the (expletive),\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI did my job. And yet, I still got beat. How is that even possible? How is he still down around one of my knees and he\u2019s still bending the corner? He starts the rush in a four-point stance, and by the time he\u2019s four yards up-field, he\u2019s still at that same height. It\u2019s kind like, \u2018What am I supposed to do there? Just jump on him?\u201d\nEven jumping on him probably wouldn\u2019t work.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just carry me to the QB,\u201d the 6-foot-8, 365-pounder said. \u201cMyles is a freak.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Mailata has seen Garrett\u2019s work up close. He had three pressures in the Week 6 matchup between the two teams and jumped over the long snapper on a field goal attempt near the end of the first half to block a kick, resulting in a game-tying touchdown return by safety Rodney McLeod.\nThis week, Mailata got to work against Garrett in a setting with much smaller consequences, something he values, even if it\u2019s hard to take what you do against Garrett and transfer it to other players.\n\u201cAny time you get an opportunity to go up against the best, he truly is the best at that position, you\u2019ve got to take advantage of those opportunities, especially if it\u2019s a training rep,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s gotten me better. I\u2019ve got a lot of film to go off now and watch and see how I can refine and sharpen and learn from yesterday and today. Good for me.\u201d\nThere is a relentlessness to facing Garrett in practice, and it\u2019s not for the mentally weak.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of just like this lose-win-lose-lose-lose-win-lose-lose. That\u2019s how it felt like,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cI just kept on saying I have to keep pushing for the next play. Keep trying to just do your job and we\u2019ll fix it up later.\u201d\nGarrett had 14 sacks last season, his seventh in a row with double digit sacks and he is the only player in NFL history to record at least 14 sacks in four consecutive seasons. The 2023 Defensive Player of the Year is the Browns\u2019 all-time sacks leader with 102.5. He joined Lawrence Taylor as the only other player to record 12 or more sacks in five consecutive seasons and was the fourth-fastest player in NFL history to reach 100 career sacks.\nFor Mailata, the real benefit isn\u2019t as much about going against Garrett but picking his brain and sharing what he knows. It\u2019s good for the young Eagles pass rushers, too.\n\u201cProbably the cues that he looks at in tackles,\u201d Mailata said. \u201cEven just in between different plays we would exchange like, \u2018Why\u2019d you do that?\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Why\u2019d you do that?\u2019 And we just go back and forth and give each other a little of amount of, \u2018OK, this is why I did that.\u2019 You talk after practice and we trade information about what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nActually going against a freak like Garrett might not offer much when it comes to other edge rushers, but at least Mailata can laugh about it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a giggle,\u201d he said about going back and watching. \u201cI\u2019ll get a giggle out of it. I\u2019ll be honest.\u201d\nFootball Insider newsletter free trial: Take a minute and sign up for a free trial of our Football Insider newsletter, featuring exclusive content from cleveland.com's Browns reporters."
