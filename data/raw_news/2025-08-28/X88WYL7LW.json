  "title": "Get a Google Pixel 10? You need to change this display setting immediately",
  "description": "The Pixel 10 is one of the best base model Pixels we've ever seen. However, there's a display setting you need to change to really enjoy it.",
  "content": "There\u2019s a lot to like about the Google Pixel 10. The triple-camera system on the back is one of the most impressive we\u2019ve seen for a non-Pro Pixel. Magnetic Qi2 charging is a fantastic addition, the Tensor G5 is a significant upgrade, and the Indigo color this year is oh-so-pretty.\n\nGoogle has also been at the top of its display game for a while now, and the Pixel 10 is no exception. With a 6.3-inch OLED panel, a 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, it\u2019s a fantastic screen for the $799 starting price.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s just one problem. I\u2019ve been using the Pixel 10 for a little while now, and as impressive as it is, there\u2019s a critical setting you need to change if you want to use the display to its full potential.\n\nHow to enable your Pixel 10\u2019s 120Hz display\n\nI was excited to get my hands on the Pixel 10, but almost immediately after booting the phone up, I noticed something grating: the display was set to a 60Hz refresh rate. Animations looked laggy, scrolling felt bad, and it\u2019s not at all the first impression I had hoped to get.\n\nOnce you do this, the Pixel 10\u2019s display starts refreshing at up to 120Hz, just as God intended. Google warns that enabling Smooth Display \u201cincreases battery usage,\u201d though I\u2019ll take slightly less battery life in favor of a 120Hz refresh rate any day of the week.\n\nSome people may not notice the difference between 60Hz and 120Hz, and if you\u2019re one of those people, you may be fine leaving the 60Hz refresh rate as is. But for those of us who can tell a difference, this is the very first thing you\u2019ll want to change on your Pixel 10.\n\nGoogle, why do you keep doing this?\n\nIf you\u2019ve used a base model Pixel before, you\u2019ll know this isn\u2019t a new issue for Google. Although Google has offered 120Hz refresh rates on its base model Pixels since the Pixel 8 (and 90Hz refresh rates since the Pixel 4), Google has long kept faster refresh rates disabled on its more affordable phones out of the box.\n\nWhy? The reason likely comes down to Google\u2019s non-Pro phones not using LTPO panels. The Pixel 10 Pro does have an LTPO screen, and as such, it can go up to 120Hz and down to just 1Hz (and anywhere in between). By comparison, the base Pixel 10 can only switch between 60Hz and 120Hz. That means its display isn\u2019t as power-efficient as the Pixel 10 Pro\u2019s, and because of this, using the 120Hz refresh rate draws more power.\n\nExplained this way, it makes a little more sense why Google still keeps the 120Hz refresh rate disabled on the Pixel 10. However, I think most people would rather have the 120Hz setting enabled by default with the option to turn it off. Or, at the very least, Google should let you make this decision for yourself during the setup process.\n\nI am glad that unlocking the Pixel 10\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate is as easy as it is, but that doesn\u2019t mean this is the right approach. Either enable the faster refresh rate out of the box or let people know about it while they\u2019re setting up their phone. It really should be that simple.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro is the wrong Pixel to buy this year\nAugust 26, 2025\nThe dust has settled from the latest Made by Google event, and the Pixel 10 family is as good as ever. It builds on the hardware upgrades that Google introduced on the Pixel 9 series and packs more new AI-powered features than I could have dreamt when I first put my SIM in a Pixel device. And I, for one, cannot wait to move my SIM into yet another brand-new phone by Google \u2014 but not the one you might expect.\nThere are reasons to go Pro\u2026 but not quite as many\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 the Pixel 10 Pro will be a great phone. Everything about it suggests that Google\u2019s top-end flagship will continue in the right direction, especially if you splurge on the XL model with its pumped-up speakers and Qi2.2 support. However, I struggle to see how this year\u2019s extra features make it worth that much more than Google\u2019s more approachable Pixels.\nYes, it\u2019s easy to point at the new 100x Pro Res Zoom and say it\u2019s worth the upgrade alone. After all, this is the first time Google has gone past 30x zoom, and it\u2019s coming right for the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s crown. The Tensor G5 chip should help the Pixel 10 Pro process those punched-in images nicely, too, but I still expect a fair share of problems with rendering small details.\nIf you're in a charging rush or love 100x zoom, buy the Pixel 10 Pro. Otherwise, there's a lot to love at lower price points.\nI spend most of my time between the 2x and 10x \u2014 or maybe 15x \u2014 zoom ranges. That\u2019s where I feel most premium flagships are at their best, as the telephoto sensors are usually chipping in with some optical quality and AI processing hasn\u2019t completely taken over. With Google\u2019s 100x zoom, I already know that will be all AI, all the time. It\u2019ll probably be fine for subjects like far-off buildings, but it won\u2019t be so essential for soft subjects like people or pets, which take up about 95% of my camera roll.\nOutside of that extra camera punch, the biggest reason to grab a Pixel 10 Pro model is probably its faster charging, but once again, you\u2019ll have to drop extra cash on the XL model. After leaving its Pixel 9 behind the Pixel 9 Pro duo in terms of charging speed, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are now perfect matches with up to 55% charge in just half an hour, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL offers 70% charge in the same amount of time. It\u2019s a nice upgrade to have, I suppose, but I\u2019m not sure that it goes quite far enough to justify the extra $400 coming out of your pocket.\nAs Google shrinks the gap, its more affordable models look better and better\nWhen you decide you\u2019re not quite ready to drop $1,000 on your next Pixel, it\u2019s time to turn your attention to a pair of options: The $800 Pixel 10 and the $500 Pixel 9a. And, if you ask me, they\u2019re both perfect examples of the grass being greener \u2014 and cheaper. They\u2019ve closed the gap on the Pro models in quite a few ways, and they\u2019ve done so without losing sight of the fact that not everyone needs every last Pro feature.\nGranted, the Pixel 10 is no longer the all-star value at $800 that the Pixel 7 was at $600, but it\u2019s also a much better phone. It charges faster (matching the Pixel 10 Pro), offers better camera magnification of up to 20x zoom thanks to the new 5x telephoto sensor, and is still in line for enough software updates to last until the Olympics are held in Brisbane, Australia, in 2032. The Tensor G5 should dance circles around the old Tensor G2, and Google\u2019s 12GB of onboard RAM should be more than enough for day-to-day needs.\nGoogle's base Pixel 10 is shaping up to be my favorite non-Pro phone ever.\nTo me, the Pixel 10 is easily the most exciting member of Google\u2019s 2025 flagship lineup, and it\u2019s not just because of the gorgeous Indigo finish. It\u2019s also, at least partly, because Google has done a brilliant job of not adding what\u2019s unnecessary. I\u2019m perfectly happy with a 10.5MP selfie camera over a 42MP one because I know it\u2019ll still look plenty sharp on a 6.3-inch Actua display, and I don\u2019t have to shake my head at the temperature sensor because it\u2019s just not there. It\u2019s just the right balance of fun with no nonsense and safely under $1,000.\nThen again, maybe the better reason not to buy a Pixel 10 Pro is that Google has created the best $500 phone I\u2019ve ever tested in the Pixel 9a \u2014 and I\u2019ve tested a lot of $500 phones. And yes, I know that typically a mid-range Pixel is for a different type of buyer than a top-end flagship, but we\u2019re here to talk about value. When we do, there\u2019s an awful lot that the Pixel 9a gets right, or at least gets close enough to flagship-grade, to give me pause about picking up a Pro.\nNo, it won\u2019t beat any of the Pixel 10 models in terms of camera zoom, nor will it sniff the flagship tier in terms of RAM or charging speeds. However, when you can buy two Pixel 9as for the price of one 10 Pro, the massive battery, long-term software support, colorful finishes, and access to almost the full range of Gemini features (except for Pixel Screenshots) make your dollar go incredibly far.\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be picking up a Pixel 10 just about as soon as I can, and I\u2019d encourage you to take a long, hard look at what your dollar gets you, too.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nIncredible camera\nAll-day battery\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI've used the three Pixel 10 slab phones, and I'll say this: Don't judge a book by its cover\nAugust 20, 2025\nIt\u2019s hard to believe we are on the tenth generation of Pixel phones. Not only is it hard to believe because the OG Pixel launched nine years ago (seriously; I\u2019m so old), but also because it\u2019s so rare for Google to actually stick with any kind of product for that long. Regardless, here we are with the Google Pixel 10 series \u2014 and it might just be the company\u2019s most important launch ever.\nI had the opportunity to go hands-on with all the devices launched at the 2025 Made by Google event, but here I want to focus on the core products: the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 the three \u201cslab\u201d phones in the lineup. Despite how they appear, there is actually a ton of stuff to talk about with these devices, so let\u2019s get right into it.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nBest specs and AI features\nPixel 10 series designs: An acceptable rehash\nIn August 2024, I was led into a room at a Google-run building in Manhattan to get my first-ever look at the Pixel 9 series. This year, I was led into that exact same room by the exact same people and found myself looking at\u2026the exact same phones. Seriously, the Pixel 10 series looks so much like the Pixel 9 series that it almost felt a bit deflating touching them for the first time. This was especially notable for me, personally, considering the Pixel 9 Pro has been my daily driver since it launched. Everything felt so immediately familiar, almost to a negative extreme.\nNot much at all has changed with the Pixel 10 designs \u2014 and that's totally OK.\nHowever disappointing it might be to hold a Pixel 10 and feel like nothing has changed, we need to give Google some credit here. Ever since the Pixel 6 series, Google has been steadily tweaking how Pixels look and feel. Literally every year since 2022, we\u2019ve seen a new Pixel phone that\u2019s looked way different from everything that came before it. Just look at the progression in the images below:\nIn 2024, I believe that Google struck gold. The Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL are some of the best-designed phones I\u2019ve ever seen or held. After four years of incredibly hard work, I feel like Google deserves a rest year. In other words: if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nNow that I\u2019ve said all that, it\u2019s not like these phones are exactly the same. There are quite a few differences once you go looking for them. One of the most significant ones \u2014 here in the United States, anyway \u2014 is the removal of the physical SIM card slot. Previously, you\u2019d find this on the bottom right of the phone, opposite a speaker grille. Now, it\u2019s gone, replaced by a second speaker grille. In some areas of the world, the SIM tray still exists, but you\u2019ll find it on the top of the phone. Here in the US, though, it\u2019s simply not there.\nOne of the most significant changes this year is the removal of the SIM tray, although this only affects certain countries, including the US.\nI know this change will ruffle some feathers. However, the full-on removal of SIM trays in favor of eSIM is a bygone conclusion at this point. Like it did with the headphone jack, Apple had the \u201ccourage\u201d to remove the SIM tray from iPhones and saw that sales didn\u2019t suffer in the slightest, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before Team Android follows suit. In other words, Google might be the first major Android phone maker to remove the SIM tray on its premium flagships, but it certainly won\u2019t be the last.\nThere are other, less drastic changes for the Pixel 10 slab phones as well. The camera bar is a little bit larger than before, and the overall thickness of the phones has increased by a tenth of a millimeter. All the phones are heavier, too, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL seeing the highest increase by a solid 11g.\nAre you pre-ordering a Pixel 10 phone?\nHowever, these are things you\u2019d only notice with thorough examination. The phones all have the same display sizes as last year (6.3 inches for the Pixel 10/10 Pro and 6.8 inches for the 10 Pro XL) and the standard design elements carry over, too, such as with the Pixel 9 having matte aluminum rails and the Pro models having polished rails. To the casual observer, there will be no distinct differences between this year\u2019s models and last year\u2019s. I barely noticed a difference, and it\u2019s my job to notice those differences, so take that as you will.\nThere are some new colors, though, which are nice to see. For the standard Pixel 10, the only color that carries over from the Pixel 9 series is Obsidian, the usual black colorway. New for this year are Indigo (a deep blue throwback to the original Pixel), Frost (a classy silver), and Lemongrass (a pale yellow). Meanwhile, the Pro models come in four colors: the usual Obsidian and Porcelain (off-white), the new Moonstone (bluish gray), and the quite stunning Jade (pale green).\nBut what\u2019s going on with the cameras and processor?\nI had about two hours with the entire Made by Google lineup, which also includes the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a. In other words: I had very little time. Even if I would have had enough time, Google is being pretty strict about what we can investigate at the moment. The gist here is that I\u2019m not going to be able to give you camera samples, thorough examinations of new camera features, or any benchmark charts. What I can do, though, is give you a rundown of what\u2019s new and a basic summary of what I saw.\nFor the Pro models, almost nothing has changed for the cameras.\nLet\u2019s start with the cameras. For the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, this is easy to summarize: nothing major has changed. The camera setups are still exactly the same across both devices and they still feature pretty much the same hardware as last year\u2019s model. This means a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, a 48MP periscope telephoto with 5x optical zoom, and a 42MP selfie camera within a display cutout on the front. There are some very minor \u2014 but welcome \u2014 differences here, including double the range for the optical image stabilization (OIS) system, which should result in smoother video footage with the primary lens. But really, outside of the new fancy AI features and a 100x zoom trick (which I\u2019ll get to in a bit), you should expect a very similar camera experience on these models as you saw on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Granted, that experience is one of the best smartphone camera systems you can get, so no complaints here.\nFor the standard Pixel 10, though, there have been some very significant changes. The biggest one is easy to notice by looking at the image above: there are now three rear camera lenses. The new third lens is a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. Considering the phone also has an ultrawide camera on the back \u2014 a 13MP shooter \u2014 that makes this the first standard Pixel to have both a telephoto and ultrawide, which is pretty cool.\nThe standard Pixel 10 get a new telephoto lens, which is great, but the rest of the system has been nerfed to compensate.\nThe unfortunate bit is that Google is reducing the overall quality of the rear camera setup to fit in this new telephoto lens. The telephoto, for example, is nowhere near as good as the one on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. The ultrawide is a significant downgrade from the 48MP one on the Pixel 9, and the primary lens is also downgraded from the 50MP one on the Pixel 9 to the 48MP wide lens we saw on the Pixel 9a. In other words, Google decided to nerf the entire rear camera setup to make room for a third lens. Depending on your needs, this might be good news or bad news.\nFinally, the selfie camera on the Pixel 10 remains the same as the one on the Pixel 9: a 10.5MP lens with a 95-degree field of view.\nNow, let\u2019s move on to Tensor G5, the new processor powering all the phones in the Pixel 10 series. This is the most notable processor upgrade for Pixels since the original introduction of Tensor in the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. For the first time, Tensor G5 is designed from the ground up by Google itself and produced by TSMC, the same company that makes Apple, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm silicon. This means Google has finally stepped out of Samsung\u2019s Exynos shadow and is playing with the big boys.\nI'd love to tell you all about Tensor G5, but outside of some simple info and vague chest-beating, Google isn't giving us much.\nI would love to tell you all about how Tensor G5 performs or even give you a concrete list of specs. However, Google is being coy with details for Tensor G5. For example, I don\u2019t know anything about the CPU or GPU IP. Google isn\u2019t supplying industry standard benchmarks nor letting us run our own yet. What it has told us has been vague Apple-esque grandstanding, like \u201cthe CPU is 34% faster than Tensor G4 on average,\u201d or \u201cthe TPU is up to 60% faster than Tensor G4.\u201d In what scenarios do these things apply? How are these modules constructed? Where is the data? For now, Google is just not giving out any of that information.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nAs I experienced it, though, Tensor G5 didn\u2019t feel any different than Tensor G4. Swiping around the Android 16 interface \u2014 which comes with Material 3 Expressive out of the box \u2014 felt smooth and snappy. Apps launched quickly, animations looked nice, and nothing seemed to be out of place. However, with Tensor G5 being such a huge shift for Google \u2014 it\u2019s a 3nm build, so it could have the same energy efficiency as the Snapdragon 8 Elite! \u2014 it\u2019s wild that it\u2019s not giving us any concrete info yet. All I can say for now is stay tuned to Android Authority, because as soon as we can give you the info you want, you\u2019ll get it.\nF***ing magnets, how do they work?\nBack in June, Android Authority broke the news about Pixelsnap, a new line of magnetic accessories from Google. For the record, that leak was part of our Authority Insights branding, which is where all our exclusive discoveries about Android, smartphones, and general tech live. I highly recommend bookmarking that page, as we post new discoveries there every day. We also have a podcast hosted by Mishaal Rahman (and guest-starring me) as well as a newsletter, which you can subscribe to in the box below. Get connected so you stay on top of all the latest news!\nAnyway, when we found information about Pixelsnap, we were excited but also hesitant to get too pumped on it. The evidence we had about the accessories clearly pointed to being able to snap things magnetically to Pixel phones, but it wasn\u2019t clear if that would require a special phone case or if the magnets would actually be built into the phones, similar to MagSafe on iPhones.\nAll four Pixel 10 phones have magnets on the pack, finally bringing Android to parity with iPhones in this regard.\nWell, I can 100% confirm now that not only were we correct about Pixelsnap, but all four Pixel 10s \u2014 including the Pixel 10 Pro Fold \u2014 have the necessary magnets built right into the backs of the phones themselves. Finally, Android phones are catching up to iPhones when it comes to magnetic accessories!\nAt the Made by Google event I attended, I was able to try out two accessories: a magnetic wireless charger and a magnetic ring stand. The ring stand, seen above, was really nice. It props your phone up either in landscape or portrait mode. It didn\u2019t add much weight to the phone and the curvature of the whole kit made it feel very comfortable to hold even in its folded state.\nMeanwhile, the magnetic charger is a two-parter. First, you can buy the charger puck by itself. As with a MagSafe-capable charger, you simply hover the back of the phone closely over top of it and then SNAP \u2014 the charger connects and starts giving the phone juice. This happens at Qi2 speeds, so roughly 15W (we\u2019ll need to test that for ourselves, but that\u2019s what Google says for now). The second part of this charger is a stand. You can buy the stand and the charger or just the charger, but in either kit, the charger is the same. The charger folds into the weighted silicone stand, making it a two-for-one system: a stand when you need it, and a puck when you don\u2019t. Also, the stand supports both landscape and portrait connections, and Google will have screensavers and other nifty features for this soon that will trigger automatically when you connect the phone to the stand.\nThe magnets support Qi2 charging, which means faster wireless charging. All Pixel 10 phones also charge faster with a wire and have bigger batteries.\nIn either case, the magnets were strong. Not so strong that it was difficult to disconnect things, but strong enough that I wasn\u2019t worried about the accessories falling off without some intentional tugging.\nAs a quick aside, since we\u2019re talking about charging, wired charging on all three devices has increased. The Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro jump from 27W to 30W and the Pixel 10 Pro XL jumps from 37W to 45W. Also, the batteries in all the phones are slightly bigger, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL now boasting a 5,200mAh cell. That makes it the Pixel with the largest battery ever \u2014 and the fastest-charging Pixel, too.\nAI all the things\nThis is a Google launch, so of course AI features are going to take center stage. There are so many new features \u2014 way more than I could have ever experienced in my brief time with the phones. As such, I am only going to tell you about the features I actually got to try (or at least witness someone else trying).\nVoice Translate is an incredible feature that translates your calls \u2014 but also mimics the speaker's voice!\nThe coolest and craziest new feature is called Voice Translate. This feature lives in the Phone app. What it does is translate conversations you\u2019re having in real-time, enabling you to have a natural discussion with someone even if you don\u2019t speak their language. The kicker, though, is that the translations it creates are delivered to the person on the other end in the sounds of their voice. Believe me, this was wild to experience. In my demo, I spoke with a Google employee who was speaking to me in German. When he spoke German, I could hear his same voice speaking on the phone to me in English. When I responded in English, I could hear my own voice speaking German back to him. I don\u2019t speak German at all (unless you count reciting the lyrics to some Rammstein songs).\nSo, the first thing you\u2019re probably thinking here is that this is ripe for some deep faking. However, it wasn\u2019t that accurate. It was more uncanny valley than deep fake. It sounded like me, but it clearly wasn\u2019t me. Let me put it this way: if someone used this tech to call my partner and try to scam her, she would have not believed it was me she was hearing.\nMagic Cue is a promising new AI feature that proactively suggests phone actions for you. It's limited right now, but could be a big deal eventually.\nAnother AI feature I tried was Magic Cue. For right now, this feature is mostly focused on text messages you receive in the Messages app. What Magic Cue does is \u201cread\u201d your messages (it all happens on-device, so it\u2019s secure) and then it preemptively gives you helpful material based on the conversation. For example, if you get a message from someone asking for a particular photo, Magic Cue will see that, find the photo(s) the person is requesting, and give you a button that takes you straight to Google Photos to grab them. This also works for things like suggesting phone calls, should someone in a chat ask you to call a restaurant to make a reservation, for example.\nThere were also two AI-powered camera features I tried. The first is called Auto Best Take, which is the logical evolution of the popular Best Take feature. As a reminder, Best Take pores through the multiple group photos you\u2019ve taken, analyzes them, and then stitches them together to make one ideal image where everyone\u2019s eyes are open, looking at the camera, smiling, etc. Auto Best Take doesn\u2019t require you to take multiple shots. Instead, AI immediately determines that you\u2019re taking a group photo, switches on Best Take, and then captures up to 150 photos when you press the shutter button. It then examines all the photos and either a) finds the photo that was the best take naturally, or b) does the usual stitching to make one best photo.\nFinally, the Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL support 100x zoom. Notably, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold do not \u2014 they both max out at 20x zoom. With the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, though, 100x zoom is possible thanks to AI \u2014 but it\u2019s a controversial usage of AI.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL support 100x zoom, but they use a controversial implementation of AI to do it.\nFirst, you take a photo like you usually would. You can zoom past the usual 30x limit and go all the way to 100x or any stop between. Once you\u2019ve got the shot you want, you take a snap. That\u2019s when the AI kicks in. What it does is analyze the 100x photo and then use AI to \u201caugment\u201d it. In other words, it generates an image using an on-device diffusion model that is based on the image you captured. In the best of cases, this will result in a 100x image that looks OK, rather than like the hot garbage we usually see from smartphone cameras that zoom to any point past 20x or so.\nThe inherent problem, though, is that this AI-augmented image is not real. It\u2019s not a photo you took \u2014 it\u2019s an AI-generated image based on a photo you took. Thankfully, Google saves the original photo, so you can choose to use the real one if you wish. Once again, this all happens on-device, too, so you don\u2019t need an internet connection for it to work.\nIn anticipation of the backlash this feature would receive, Google is also rolling out C2PA integration within Google Photos. This attaches hidden metadata to any photo you take with your Pixel 10 phone. If you just take a picture, the metadata will say it was shot with a camera. If you edit that picture using non-AI tools, it will say that. And, if you use AI to edit or augment the photo, it will say that, too. This should give people a quick and easy way to determine the trustworthiness of a photo \u2014 assuming, of course, it was created with a Pixel 10.\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL impressions: Innovation disguised as iteration\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations: you\u2019ve just read 3,000 words about only three of the four Pixel 10 phones. Hopefully, this illuminates that even if the Pixel 10 series looks like barely an iteration over the Pixel 9 series, it\u2019s actually got a lot of really, really cool stuff going on.\nOf course, it\u2019s not all hunky dory. The nerfing of the Pixel 10\u2019s rear camera system might be a tough pill to swallow for folks out there who liked having the same camera system as a Pro model, just minus a telephoto. The fact that we know barely anything of substance about Tensor G5 is concerning, to say the least. The removal of the SIM tray in the United States will also cause some nasty comments to appear below, I\u2019m sure. Google has made some controversial decisions surrounding this launch and only time will tell how that shakes out.\nGoogle has made some controversial decisions here that could deter sales from Pixel skeptics. But Pixel fans are probably already frothing at the mouth for these phones.\nFor Pixel devotees, though, I can\u2019t imagine them responding with anything but utter glee at this release. The continuation of the stellar design ethos of the Pixel 9 series is here alongside Pixelsnap magnets. There are AI features that feel tangibly useful to daily life, increases in both battery size and charging speeds, and much more. There\u2019s also the potential right now for Tensor G5 to be a game-changer. Oh, and all this without prices going up.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nBest specs and AI features\nThe vanilla Pixel 10 ($799 at Amazon) still starts at $799, and the Pixel 10 Pro ($999 at Amazon) stays at $999. In both cases, they come with 128GB of internal storage for their introductory prices. Meanwhile, Google has eliminated the 128GB model of the Pixel 10 Pro XL ($1199 at Amazon), leaving the 256GB model as the base, which has the same $1,199 price as the Pixel 9 Pro XL with the same 256GB. So other than a shake-up for what\u2019s offered with the XL model, pricing stays consistent in 2025 \u2014 even with tariffs and market uncertainty abounding all around.\nGoogle still has plenty of competition to worry about, though. The iPhone 17 series is just around the corner, and rumors suggest a cool new look for them. The Galaxy S25 series is still going strong, and Samsung is almost certainly going to launch a Galaxy S25 FE model in the coming weeks \u2014 offering a cheaper alternative to the Pixel 10 series.\nRegardless, I think the Pixel 10 series is incredibly exciting. It truly represents Google coming into its own as a hardware creator. It has a unique design ethos, its own silicon, a reputation for having one of the best camera experiences in the industry, the fastest Android upgrades, and is the market leader when it comes to AI. Really, the only way I see Google going is upward \u2014 and there\u2019s no telling how far it could go.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nRefresh rate explained: What does 60Hz, 90Hz, or 120Hz mean?\nMay 5, 2025\nHigh-end smartphones increasingly boast blazing-fast 90Hz, 120Hz, and even faster refresh rate displays. This sounds great on paper, and it\u2019s yet another way that smartphones attempt to differentiate themselves from one another. Should you buy a phone because of this latest display tech trend? It honestly depends on where your priorities lie.\nThe benefits of high refresh rate phones and even how they work are not always well understood. While games and content can look much smoother, whether it\u2019s worth the extra battery consumption depends greatly on the user and the handset. With that in mind, here\u2019s everything you need to know about display refresh rates.\nWhat is refresh rate?\nDisplays aren\u2019t static. Content and motion appear smooth on your phone\u2019s screen because every pixel constantly updates to display the latest content from your handset\u2019s processor. But this doesn\u2019t happen randomly. Panels update their content at regular intervals, which we refer to as the refresh rate.\nThe refresh rate measures the period of time between a phone\u2019s display updates. In other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display fully refreshes every second. A 60Hz display refreshes 60 times per second, 90Hz is 90 times per second, 120Hz is 120 times per second, and so on. So, a 120Hz display refreshes twice as fast as a 60Hz panel and 4x faster than 30Hz.\nFaster update times also mean lower latency because the pixels refresh more often. For example, it takes 16.6 ms to entirely refresh a 60Hz display, 11.1ms for 90Hz, and just 8.3ms for a 120Hz rate panel. The refresh rate isn\u2019t the only factor in round-trip display latency; it is the most significant contributor.\nThe refresh rate measures the period of time between a phone's display updates.\nYour smartphone\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t refresh all at once each cycle, though. Instead, each horizontal row of pixels refreshes in turn until the whole display updates at the required rate. You can see this in action if you film a display in slow motion, and it\u2019s the reason why displays flicker if you view them through your smartphone camera\u2019s viewfinder. In other words, your display is constantly updating and refreshing, but it takes the cycle time to complete one full refresh. Check out this demo if you want to see how frame rates affect smoothness and motion blur.\nA quick note on \u201ctouch sample rate\u201d \u2014 a related but different metric. Also measured in Hz, the sample rate tells you how many times per second the touchscreen looks for input from the user\u2019s finger. A higher touch sample rate means less lag between input (touch or swipe) and action, which is especially important for fast-paced games.\nWhat does 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz mean on my phone?\nHigher refresh rate displays make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Facebook\u2019s UI or your web browser can look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate. Although that\u2019s not a game-changer for day-to-day smartphone use, it\u2019s undoubtedly nicer to look at, and there are also more meaningful benefits to be found in fast motion content, such as video and gaming.\nHowever, most films play at the industry standard of 24 frames per second or 24Hz (though this is changing now). As such, display processing needs to either adapt the frame rate to the content or upscale the content to the frame rate. 120Hz displays are great because they can playback content at 60Hz, 30Hz, and 24Hz with even frame divisions. Other refresh rates require processing when scaling 24Hz video. Poor quality processing can induce judder into your videos, which obviously isn\u2019t good.\n120Hz displays look silky smooth and feel more responsive at the cost of some battery life.\nFaster displays make a big difference when it comes to gaming, too. Higher frame rates and quicker response times can have a noticeable impact because visual latency is lower, and gameplay appears smoother. PC gamers regularly swear by 120Hz and even 144Hz displays. Now, mobile gamers can benefit, too, albeit on a much smaller screen. However, high frame-rate gaming requires a beefy, energy-hungry processor, too. This ensures that the graphics frame rate keeps up with the high display refresh rate. The game you\u2019re playing also needs to support high refresh rates. A 120Hz display won\u2019t benefit from a game capped at 30 frames per second.\nUnfortunately, high refresh rates reduce battery life. We once looked into this with the OnePlus 7 Pro, and we noted 200 fewer minutes of browsing time when using the 90Hz mode versus the more standard 60Hz. We also recorded a 9% drop in battery life when switching the Galaxy S20 Ultra between 60Hz and 120Hz modes. However, newer handsets with more efficient displays provide decent battery life, thanks to adaptive 90Hz and 120Hz refresh rates. This is helping to lessen the trade-offs associated with early high refresh rate panels.\nSmartphone variable refresh rates: What is LTPO?\nHigher refresh rates negatively impact screen-on time, but manufacturers have come up with some clever technologies to limit their impact on battery life. Variable refresh rate AMOLED panels powered by low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) backplane technology are leading this revolution.\nFlagship phones pack LTPO displays to save battery while still offering high refresh rates.\nImplementations vary, but a combination of LTPO and software changes allows for dynamic refresh rates actively ranging from 120Hz down to 1Hz, although in reality, lowering refresh rates to 60, 24, and 10Hz is more common. The idea is simple in principle: reducing the number of display updates when viewing static content, such as images and web pages, improves battery life while still benefiting from the smoothness of very high refresh rates when scrolling through content.\nExamples of LTPO variable refresh rate phones that can hit 10Hz and lower include the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro, and the OnePlus 12. Samsung also employs a novel technology in its Galaxy S23 and S24 series phones. The display refresh rate drops as low as 48Hz, but communication between the processor and display falls as low as 10Hz to save on some more power.\nShould I buy a high refresh rate phone?\n120Hz displays are now a mainstay in modern smartphones, not just in the ultra-premium market. These panels are increasingly available in affordable mid-tier handsets, as well as some budget options.\nThat said, refresh rate is a small part of a smartphone\u2019s display specifications. You shouldn\u2019t buy a fast display if the color is awful. Ultimately, aspects like color gamut, contrast, white point, and color temperature, HDR capabilities, and resolution significantly impact your phone\u2019s screen quality. That said, high refresh rates are now a big selling point in modern mobile displays and are increasingly hard to ignore when picking up a new phone.\nIf you have your heart set on a lightning-fast display, here are just a few of the latest and greatest phones rocking a quick panel that we recommend.\nGreat phones with high refresh rates:\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1299.99 at Amazon): Samsung\u2019s flagships continue to run 120Hz displays, but we also love the brightness of the company\u2019s displays.\n- Google Pixel 9 series ($1099 at Amazon): Google offers 120Hz refresh rate screens across its Pixel 9 devices.\n- Google Pixel 8a ($499 at Amazon): The Pixel 8a is the first Pixel A-series phone to pack a 120Hz display.\n- ASUS ROG Phone 8 ($1099 at Amazon): A 165Hz panel is the star of the ROG Phone 8, but you may not find too many games able to take advantage of that refresh rate.\n- Samsung Galaxy A55 5G ($387 at Amazon): Samsung\u2019s mid-range phones now regularly feature high refresh rate 120Hz AMOLED panels.\nNearly all smartphones on the market support higher than 60Hz refresh rates these days, so you won\u2019t have to look very far. Exceptions are very rare now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

  "argos_summary": "The Google Pixel\u202f10 offers a solid camera, bright OLED display, and new AI features, but its default 60\u202fHz refresh rate forces users to manually enable 120\u202fHz for smoother motion, a setting Google disables to save battery on the non\u2011Pro model. The Pixel\u202f10\u202fPro uses an LTPO panel that can vary from 1\u202fHz to 120\u202fHz, improving power efficiency, while the base model only toggles between 60\u202fHz and 120\u202fHz. Overall, the Pixel\u202f10 line delivers strong performance and design, yet the refresh\u2011rate limitation and some camera downgrades on the base model may deter buyers who want flagship\u2011level features without the higher price.",
