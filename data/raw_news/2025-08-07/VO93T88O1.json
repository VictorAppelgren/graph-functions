  "content": "The first competition of its kind in the country, slated for later this month, has been organized on the orders of President Vladimir Putin\n\nContenders from nearly a dozen nations will compete against each other in a sports drone tournament in the Russian capital later this month, Moscow authorities have announced.\n\nIn a statement on their website on Wednesday, authorities in the Russian capital said that the first-ever official international drone contest in Russia will be held from August 7 through August 17. Vying for the 5 million-ruble ($63,000) jackpot will be drone operators, some of whom hold international titles, from Australia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Spain, Russia, South Korea, T\u00fcrkiye and France.\n\nThe event will take place as part of a broader forum devoted to civilian UAVs which was organized on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe competition will include several distinct disciplines, including a 50-lap first-person-view (FPV) obstacle race.\n\nAccording to Ilya Galaev, the president of Russia\u2019s Drone Race Federation, the contest will see the strongest Russian pilots and those from abroad lock horns, and will be a major boost for the discipline as a whole.\n\nBack in 2023, President Putin ordered Russia\u2019s Agency of Strategic Initiatives to create special educational programs to promote the manufacturing and use of UAVs in the country.\n\nIn late May, Russian authorities also approved a drone school course.\n\nLast June, Russia\u2019s Higher Education and Science Minister, Valery Falkov, announced that multiple universities across the country were developing drone programs. Officials estimated at the time that Russia needed approximately one million UAV operators, engineers and other specialists in related fields.",
