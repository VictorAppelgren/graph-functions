      "feedback": "Overall: solid scaffolding and credible cross‑topic framing, but the piece drifts from a tight, first‑principles, regime‑driven thesis into scattered cataloguing of numbers and partially off‑topic assertions. To reach world‑class quality, tighten horizon clarity, sharpen the causal chain, anchor every number to a source, and deliver a crisp watchlist linked to decisive signals.\n\nActionable edits I’d implement in one pass:\n- Horizon and regime mapping: define near-term (0–12m), medium (1–3y), long (3–5y) and map each to a single, testable regime transition (A→B→C) with explicit policy milestones (Jackson Hole comments, wage/persistence data, semicon capex cadence) and a probabilistic weight; ensure Regime A/B/C descriptions are consistent across all referenced sources (OGK8WLL69, Y6SQOEK69, JPAIHPA4N, SGB2PAZGK). \n- First‑principles causal chain: articulate the core mechanism “inflation trajectory and policy path set discount rates and risk premia; that reprice crypto/AI infra and equities; flows (RWA/tokenization) feed credit/valuation; oil and USD path modulate volatility and cross‑asset risk appetite.” Tie every step to a source ID; avoid ad‑hoc statements (e.g., Pixel/Gemini references) unless grounded in the sources.\n- Quantification discipline: convert all numeric claims into explicit ranges tied to sources (ETH 4k–5k; BTC 110k–125k; 2030 RWA ~16T; tokenized Treasuries ~$4.2B in 2025; Ford EV metrics vs. sector baselines; oil/regime ranges for Brent/WTI); ensure units, timeframes, and context are clear; replace ambiguous “≈” with precise intervals where possible.\n- Coherence of transmission channels: present a concise, end‑to‑end map from macro (inflation path) → policy stance → discount rates/risk premia → asset prices (crypto, equities, AI infra) with explicit sensitivity to regime shifts and a short list of numerical breakpoints.\n- Watch-list is precise and decisive: list 5 triggers with explicit thresholds (e.g., CPI YoY prints, wage growth pace, Jackson Hole statements, semiconductor capex cadence readings, crypto inflow/tokenization milestones, RWA uptake) and define what constitutes a de‑risking/invalidation signal.\n- Source discipline and conflicts: verify every claim against the cited IDs; remove or reframe assertions lacking a source (e.g., non‑source tech anecdotes); explicitly note and reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., oil regime probabilities) and present a base‑case with clearly stated sensitivities.\n- Alignment with SECTION FOCUS: foreground cross‑topic drivers (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) in a single syntheses paragraph, then a compact, bullet‑style watch-list; end with a concise, testable forecast and the key deciders to watch.\n- Presentation integrity: ensure every assertion references an ID from the SOURCE MATERIAL; eliminate any content that cannot be anchored; consider a short supplemental table or line‑item matrix for regime impacts to improve readability without lengthening the paragraph excessively.",
