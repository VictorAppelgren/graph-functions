It turns out that phones are, too, because flip phones are so back.\nGone are the days of clunky phones that don't fit in tiny pockets. Samsung has just released its brand new Z Flip 7, an AI-full upgrade to one of its most unique smartphone models.\nAlso: T-Mobile will give you the iPhone 16e for free with no trade-in - here's how to get yours\nHowever, Verizon is now offering the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 for free when you trade in a qualifying Apple, Google, Motorola, or Samsung phone through their Unlimited Ultimate plan.\nThere are some stipulations to cash in on this offer. First, the free phone is paid out through a 36-month billing cycle. Therefore, you will use this phone for three years and pay for its service. You will also have to pay for any taxes and fees required to purchase the device. Also, because you must be on the Unlimited Ultimate plan, you must pay its service fee of $55 a month per line, which is a little pricey.\nThe Z Flip 7 does something many other smartphones can't -- its touchscreen folds, so you can fit the device in your purse, pocket, backpack, and more without taking up as much space as usual. Plus, when the screen is folded, an outside FlexWindow allows you to stream media, use widgets, and even reply to messages, so you can get full function out of the phone even when it's not in full screen.\nThe cameras offer competitive options as well. They may not stack up to iPhone Pro or higher-end Samsung models, but the 50 MP wide and 10 MP ultra-wide camera holds its own. It comes in the three fun colors: Blue Shadow, Jetblack, and Coral Red.\nThe new phone also boasts a larger battery capacity than ever before. Samsung advertises 31 hours of battery life, compared to the 23 hours of battery life the Z Flip 6 had.\nZDNET expert Sabrina Ortiz went hands-on with the phone and concurred that the Z Flip 7 had better battery life than before.\n\"Throughout my daily usage, I have had no issue with having it last an entire day. In fact, I have been ending my days with a lot more juice than I typically would -- hovering around the 30% mark. Overall, Samsung upgraded the Z Flip 7's specs in almost every way, addressing most of the users' complaints about the predecessor and making it a strong competitor in the flip phone market,\" she said.\nRead the review: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\nFlip phones like the Z Flip 7 have gone viral on the internet, with many users pointing out they wish they had switched sooner, even from an Apple device. There is a lot of consensus that the phones bring back the nostalgia of the 2000s, and the device's novelty makes it more approachable. One Reddit user said they switched and \"didn't look back.\"\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is another great smartphone option for those who want to try something new (or nostalgic), but still have the everyday workings of a smartphone with all the features you could need.\nDon't forget, you can get the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 for free when you trade in any qualifying phone to Verizon through the Unlimited Ultimate plan. Plus, view more Verizon deals here.\nLooking for the next best product?

      "text": "What if your passkey device is stolen? How to manage risk in our passwordless future\nPart of the \"passkeys are more secure than passwords\" story is derived from the fact that passkeys are non-human-readable secrets -- stored somewhere on your device -- that even you have very limited access to.\nOK, so what happens to those passkeys if your device is stolen?\nOver on Spiceworks.com, ZDNET's sister site for IT professionals, a community member posed some insightful passkey edge case questions regarding my ZDNET story about the industry needing to get its passkey story straight if the relatively new authentication technology is to stand any chance of fulfilling its ambitions to replace passwords.\nAlso: How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\nIn one of those questions, Spiceworks member GMXOasked, \"What if the device is stolen? How do I prevent the thief from exploiting [any passkeys that are stored on it]?\" Code98765, another member, noted that \"these edge cases don't get talked about enough.\"\nIn most circumstances, once you've enrolled a passkey to work with a certain website or app, your device has everything it needs to sign into that site or app. It's not much of a leap, then, to regard a passkey's relationship to your device as if it were a keyfob to your car. So, for anybody just starting out with passkeys, \"what if the device is stolen?\" is a pretty obvious question to ask. But unlike the keyfob to your car, which gives the thief everything needed to steal the car, there are a variety of obstacles that should prevent a thief from using your \"stolen\" passkeys to access your accounts.\nSpiceworks member m@ttshaw, who self-identifies as a solution architect from the UK, correctly responded that it's \"dependent on the security used to protect the passkeys on that device.\"\nAnother member from the UK -- itskieran -- chimed in that \"if you can remotely wipe your phone and/or it's protected by a strong PIN or password and set to auto-wipe after a certain number of attempts, then you should be safe. Also, at least on Android, you have to authenticate with your biometrics a second time to allow the passkey to be used.\"\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\nI'd like to expand on these great answers while also providing additional detail: There is more you can do to give yourself additional peace of mind.\nHow are passkeys stored on your device?\nAs described in Part 4 of ZDNET's six-part series on how passkeys work (and why they're more secure than traditional credentials), passkeys are typically stored in encrypted form. You cannot browse your device's filesystem, see where they are listed, and do anything with them -- except use your password manager to see a list of them, delete them, and, in some cases (depending on the password manager), rename them.\nFor example, in most cases where you've opted to create a non-synchronizable passkey that is stored on the device itself, that passkey will be generated in non-human-readable form, encrypted, stored, and protected with the help of the device's on-board security hardware such as a trusted platform module (TPM) or secure enclave. Like all end-user interactions that involve data stored in a TPM or secure enclave, retrieval of that data requires the user to supply a biometric, secret PIN, or a passcode. In other words, whether it's you or a malicious actor, discovery and retrieval of your passkeys from where they are securely stored is nearly impossible.\nAlso: Passkeys won't be ready for primetime until Google and other companies fix this\nFor those passkeys that are synchronizable (and not tied to any specific device or its security hardware), the passkey is managed and protected by whichever password manager you use (e.g., 1Password, Apple Passwords, BitWarden, Dashlane, Google Password Manager, LastPass).\nWhen a password manager is used to manage synchronizable passkeys, other credentials (user IDs and passwords), and other secrets, it typically encrypts and stores them in a secure software container using a process that essentially emulates the capabilities of a TPM or secure enclave. The password management industry often refers to these containers as \"vaults\" -- although not all password managers use this nomenclature.\n(As a side note, keep in mind that the phrase \"password manager\" is a misnomer. To the extent that these so-called password managers manage non-password-oriented credentials (i.e., passkeys), they deserve to be classified more broadly as \"credential managers.\")\nRegardless of whether you're relying on synchronizable or non-synchronizable passkeys (or both), it's important to configure your device in a way that requires some form of local authentication -- a pin, a biometric, or passcode -- to not only access the device, but also to access your vault when the time comes to authenticate with a relying party (a website, app, etc.). For example, a thief shouldn't be able to pickpocket your phone, unlock your phone, go to your bank's website, and login without first encountering a roadblock to authenticate with your phone and then again with your password manager.\nAlso: Biometrics vs. passcodes: What lawyers say if you're worried about warrantless phone searches\nWhere possible, you may want to consider non-biometric forms of security due to the apparent lack of protections that are legally available during a smartphone shakedown.\nAll of this said, as the old Boy Scouts saying goes, \"Be Prepared.\" There are important additional preparations that end-users should consider to further protect themselves from the possibility of device theft. The first batch of these preparations concerns basic device and account security.\nDevice security matters\nFor starters, all users should be familiar with the various options for manually and automatically locking their devices. There are a multitude of options, some of which are discussed in Dan Patterson's 7 ways to lock down your phone's security.\nAlso: 7 ways to lock down your phone's security - before it's too late\nFor example, consider automatically locking your device after some period of inactivity, when it is not within proximity of a Bluetooth-connected accessory like a smartwatch, or after a device detects that it might have been snatched. Additionally, users should know about the options available to them for remotely or automatically wiping their devices. Through Apple's Find Devices and Google's Find My Device, devices can not only be located (when they are online), but they can be remotely locked or wiped. As Spiceworks member itskieran noted, devices can also be configured to automatically wipe themselves after a certain number of failed unlock attempts.\nWhat if the thief has access to your unlocked device?\nLet's move on to another scenario: a thief has somehow managed to gain access to your unlocked device.\nBe sure to protect any authenticator apps with a password or pin (biometrics, too, but consider the aforementioned legal rights you could be sacrificing). This will prevent thieves from accessing any accounts that depend on authenticator-based multifactor authentication.\nAlso: How to sync passkeys in Chrome across your PC, Mac, iPhone, or Android\nAdditionally, Android has a feature called Private Space that essentially sets up a secure, password or biometric-protected partition separate from your other apps. Once you've created this so-called Private Space, you can install apps from the Google Play Store almost as though it's another smartphone. The data that goes with those apps stays in that private partition as well.\nAlthough iOS doesn't have a corresponding feature to Android's Private Space, it can be configured to similarly obfuscate app access through a feature that allows you to lock apps, hide them, or both (requiring a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to gain access). This is above and beyond any security that's built into the app itself.\nIn either case, consider obfuscating and securing your most sensitive apps with these features.\nShould you delete 'stolen' passkeys?\nWhat about the passkeys that were on the stolen device -- either the non-synchronizable ones specific to the device or the ones that were synced to it with the help of a password manager? Should you delete those?\nThat depends.\nDo you feel there's still a chance the thief could somehow gain access to your password manager and sign into a website or app as though they are you? If you've set your password manager to require some form of password, passcode, or biometric authentication before it supplies whatever credentials are necessary to sign into a site or app, then you should be safe.\nAlso: Want to change or delete your passkey? It's complicated\n\"I don't think there is a need to reset all of your passkeys or credentials for each relying party,\" FIDO Alliance User Experience Working Group co-chair James Hwang told ZDNET. Hwang is also a senior product designer in Microsoft's Identity Standards group. (Microsoft is one of the chief proponents of passkeys.) \"It would be kinda crazy to do that for each one as there could be hundreds of credentials,\" Hwang noted.\nBut if you want to go the extra mile regarding \"stolen\" passkeys -- for no reason other than exceptional credential hygiene -- you can implement a strategy that makes it easy to identify and unenroll those passkeys from their associated relying parties, as described in, Want to change or delete your passkey? It's complicated. Like many other passkey-related activities, this requires a bit of forethought and planning.\nFirst, as suggested in ZDNET's 10 Passkey Survival Tips, give meaningful names to any passkeys that you have enrolled with any relying parties. For example, if you have created a passkey for some website that's specific to your iPhone, give that passkey a new name like \"iPhone passkey.\"\nSome relying parties offer users the capability to rename the passkeys you've enrolled with them. Unfortunately, others provide a default name (e.g., \"Passkey #1\") that cannot be changed. This capability is typically offered through a website's or app's security preferences section. The partial screenshot below shows the security settings for Microsoft's Live.com, where two passkeys have been enrolled and, at the user's option, have been given meaningful, user-provided names: Non-Syncable Passkey on Yubikey and Synced Passkey for BitWarden (see red-boxed callouts).\nIf you cannot rename your passkeys, you should make a note somewhere that tracks which passkeys with default names go with which devices (if you set them up to be device-specific, which is not a requirement). As shown in the next screenshot of Shopify.com's security settings, two passkeys have been enrolled with default names that cannot be changed. However, Shopify offers other clues about how the passkeys were created, including which browser on which operating system was used to generate the passkey and when the passkey was enrolled. Basically, these serve as additional clues as to what device(s) a passkey is associated with.\nOnce you're organized to know which passkeys go with which devices, you're prepared for easier passkey removal in the event that your device is stolen. If you're really worried about a potential compromise to certain accounts, then sign in to those accounts and remove (unenroll) any passkeys that are specific to the stolen device, or synced to it with your password manager. If it's a synchronizable passkey that's been synced with your password manager to multiple devices, you should probably delete it from your password manager as well, since it's of no use once you've unenrolled it from the relying party.\nAlso: Going passwordless with public key cryptography\nA technical gap in the passkey ecosystem\nAll this said, the need to manually remove any trace of a passkey from both your password manager and the relying party speaks to a technical gap in the passkey ecosystem that the FIDO Alliance is aware of: the lack of an API where removal of one triggers removal of the other. For example, if you delete a passkey from your password manager, you shouldn't have to take the additional step of deleting the corresponding component (the public key of the public/private key pair that constitutes a passkey) on the relying party's server.\nAlso: How to set up and use passkeys across your iPhone, iPad, and Mac\nUntil the FIDO Alliance addresses that gap, users who want to delete passkeys have to manually (and painfully) cover the bases. As Microsoft's Hwang told me, going to the trouble of doing this manually could end up being a lot of tedious work for marginal gain. Hwang thinks the idea of remotely \"revoking the session for the credential manager\" might make more sense. This advice largely applies to situations where synchronizable passkeys are being synchronized across multiple devices, each of which is signed into the same credential management account. Any one of those multiple devices can be used to deactivate an active credential management session on one of the other devices.\nBut when I inquired with the various password manager solution providers -- including 1Password, BitWarden, Dashlane and NordPass -- it became clear that the implementation of this remote session deactivation capability, where it exists, varies from one credential manager to the next (and in some cases from one license type to the next).\nWhereas some password managers can remotely decommission sessions at the device level (where all active password management sessions on the device are simultaneously deactivated), others make it possible to more surgically target a specific session (i.e., a browser- or app-specific session) for such revocation, while others don't offer the capability at all. Also, the password managers differ in how they aggregate a history of sessions from all devices and any last known end-user activities.\nAlso: The best password managers: Expert tested\nThe Spiceworks post that inspired this article included other questions deserving of answers. For example, how does one use a passkey with a borrowed device? (This use case is akin to signing into your Netflix or YouTube account with the smart TVs found in today's hotel rooms.) I plan to explore this and other questions in future articles.\nStay ahead of security news with Tech Today, delivered to your inbox every morning."

The Roku OS also accompanied a C/C++ based software development kit (SDK), for its media player, in order to provide a development environment supporting Windows, Mac, or Linux-based hosts.[13]\n2014\u20132017: Extension to smart TVs\n[edit]According to a news report in August 2014, The Roku OS featured on a Hisense TV model.[15] Later, in June 2015, it was reported that the operating system powered an Insignia TV model.[16] In October 2015, Roku announced the release of Roku OS 7. This release allowed television viewers using Roku\u2019s streaming devices to \"follow\" actors, directors, as well as TV shows and films.[17] In June 2016, Roku OS 7.2 was launched,[18] followed by a Roku OS 8 release announcement in October 2017. The latter operating system release featured single sign-on for paid TV customers and integration of TV programming from over-the-air TV, among other updates.[19]\n2018\u20132021: New features, vulnerabilities\n[edit]In June 2018, WIRED wrote that Roku devices running Roku OS 8.0 or lower were found to be vulnerable to a type of web attack known as DNS rebinding.[20] The WIRED article also cited Roku as saying that it had created a software patch in response, and was rolling out the patch to its customers.[20]\nApril 2019 saw the release of Roku OS 9.1 adding \"automatic account linking\" (sparing users from re-entering login credentials previously entered on a Roku streaming device or TV), genre search, smarter voice control and other features.[21]\nIn April 2021, Roku announced the release of Roku OS 10, which featured \"instant resume\" for streaming channels, automatic configuration for gaming consoles, AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support to Roku HD streaming boxes and TVs etc.[9] In May 2021, Engadget reported on an \"exploit\" which took advantage of two vulnerabilities, in Roku OS versions lower than 10, to enable a \"persistent root jailbreak\" on Roku devices. The exploit gave users control over what channels they installed. Roku stated in response that it had mitigated the vulnerabilities by updating Roku OS 9.4.[22]\n2022\u2013present: Usage growth\n[edit]In March 2022, Roku announced Roku OS 11, adding new audio options, custom photo screensavers and more.[23]\nIn March 2023, the Roku OS was reported to have 70 million active accounts[24] and to have led the US smart TV and streaming device sector in 2022.[4][5] In October 2023, Roku announced Roku OS 12.5, which focused on sports, live TV, and easier content discovery.[25]\nIn April 2024, the Roku OS was reported to be the TV operating system with the largest share of TVs sold in the U.S. and Mexico during January-March 2024, accounting for approximately 40% of sales in each country.[26] In the same month, Roku OS 13 was released. The OS update was announced for all Roku TV models and many Roku streaming players. The update was said to offer enhancements to content discovery, browsing and other features including auto-adjusted picture modes and personalized \"backdrops\".[27]\nIn September 2024, Roku announced the release of Roku OS 14. This update featured a new \"Kid & Family zone\" added to the home screen, an ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to content and an option to use voice commands to update smart TV settings, among other changes.[28][29] Starting on 29-Sep-2024 when OS 14 was deployed, many Tablo 4th Generation DVRs either could no longer play at all, or after settings adjustments, would play but without any audio.[30] As of 1-Nov-2024, this issue remains unresolved.[31]\nIn January 2025, Roku said that the Roku OS was the leading TV OS in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, reaching over 90 million streaming households.[32][6] That some month, a new update to the operating system was rolled out, bringing Roku OS to version 14.1. This update included bug fixes and performance enhancements, but was described as potentially \"underwhelming\" for users expecting new features or a visual overhaul.[33]\nFeatures\n[edit]The Roku OS is a Linux-based streaming platform which runs \"free channels\" and \"subscription channels\". The operating system powers Roku TVs, streaming devices and smart speakers.[7][8][14] According to Roku, the operating system is able to run on \"low power chips\" using small memory footprints.[34] The operating system has been reported to be simple and easy to set up and use, yet powerful.[9][10][11][12]\nRoku Channel Store\n[edit]The Roku OS includes the Roku Channel Store, featuring a collection of apps Roku calls \"channels\".[35] The operating system allows users to browse streaming channels available, displayed in a grid format.[8][36] According to mobile app analytics company 42matters, there were over 26,000 apps available in the Roku Channel Store in 2023.[37] Examples of \"free channels\" available in the store are The Roku Channel, Amazon Freevee, Xumo, NBC, ABC, Tubi, PBS, CBS, Pluto TV and Kiddoodle.tv, whereas the \"subscription channels\" include Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hayu, Paramount+, BET+, Curiosity Stream, Eros Now, AMC+, Acorn TV, Shudder, DAZN, Mubi, HBO Max, Discovery+, Crunchyroll, SonyLIV, ZEE5, Hotstar, Disney+, Hulu, Hallmark+, Peacock, Kidoodle.TV and iWant.[7][8]\nRoku Media Player\n[edit]Roku Media Player, which is part of Roku OS, is built to play local media content streamed from a DLNA server, such as Twonky or Windows Media Player, or (for compatible models) content from an inserted USB device, such as a pen drive.[38][39]\nUser features\n[edit]The Roku OS offers content search, voice control, parental controls, and custom photo screensavers. It also features a \"guest mode\", \"private listening\" (using Bluetooth headphones), \"continue watching\", and \"screen mirroring\" which allows to mirror a smartphone or computer screen to the Roku device, supporting both Miracast and AirPlay protocols.[40][41][8][42][43] The operating system also includes \"Roku City\", a screensaver Roku utilizes for advertising.[44][45]\nDeveloper tools\n[edit]According to Roku, the Roku OS integrates tools which allow the company's channel publishers and advertisers to measure the effectiveness of online video advertisements delivered by the company.[46] Roku OS 10.5 or higher supports an \"independent developer kit\" (IDK), built for Roku devices, which Roku says allows developers to create not only streaming channels but also other applications.[47][48]\nCompatibility\n[edit]Consumer products running the Roku OS include:\n- Roku's streaming devices such as the Roku Express[49]\n- Roku-branded TVs from Aiwa, Daewoo, Element Electronics, Haier, Hisense, InFocus, Insignia, JVC, LG, Magnavox, Philips, Polaroid, RCA, Roku, Sansui, Sanyo, Sharp, TCL, Walmart's Atvio and Onn, Westinghouse,[50][51][52] Hitachi,[53] HKPRO,[54] Metz,[55][56] and Toshiba[57]\n- Roku-branded home entertainment devices, including smart speakers[14]\nSee also\n[edit]- Fire OS, a mobile operating system developed by Amazon for its streaming devices, smart TVs and other devices\n- Google TV (operating system), from Google, co-developed by Intel, Sony and Logitech\n- tvOS, an operating system developed by Apple for its streaming device Apple TV\n- Tizen, a Linux-based operating system from Samsung Electronics for its smart TVs and other devices\n- webOS, a Linux-based multitasking operating system from LG for its smart TVs and other devices\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ RokuCommunity (September 2023). \"A package manager for the Roku platform\".

While many of these have flopped, I have a list of favorites that I simply can't let go of. As such, I thoroughly recommend them for anyone looking to expand an established smart home or start setting up one for the first time.\nA smart home setup can sound intimidating for newbies, but I can promise you it's not as hard as it seems -- you'd be surprised at how little is required. As long as you have something that works as a centralized hub (like an Amazon Echo device, an Apple HomePod device, or a Google Hub, for example), you can simply build upon that.\nHere are my favorite smart home devices.\nThis is, by far, my favorite video doorbell ever. I've tested many different offerings from different brands, yet I always keep this one on my front door. The reasons I love it so much include the dual cameras, 2K resolution, Delivery Guard to watch your packages, and the fact that it doesn't require you to pay monthly fees to access these features.\nThe Eufy Video Doorbell E340 can be set up with existing wired connections or wirelessly with the built-in rechargeable battery. It has 8 GB of built-in storage, which roughly covers about two months of footage. You can get a HomeBase S380 for expanded local storage and AI features. The HomeBase also works as a chime, but you can use an Echo device as one as well. Eufy also features a Minibase Chime for it, purchased separately.\nThe front-facing camera gives you a full view of visitors at your front door, while the downward-facing camera keeps track of your packages. The doorbell alerts you when a package is delivered, and when you open the live view, you can tap on each package to see what time each one arrived. You can set up the Eufy E340 video doorbell to ring an alarm when someone approaches or picks up your packages, or even alert you if they're left outside past a certain time.\nAlso: This video doorbell camera successfully replaced my Ring with no subscription\nThe Aqara T2 E26 is one of the most reliable smart bulbs I've tested. It supports Zigbee and Thread, and is compatible with Matter when you pair it with an Aqara hub. The LED bulb can go up to 1,100 lumens and features a broad spectrum of white shades, from 2,000K to 9,000K.\nI use my Aqara smart bulb on a lamp in my bedroom, and it turns on at dusk on a schedule. It's also part of my routines so I can ask Siri to turn off all the bedroom lights each night, or say, \"Alexa, bedtime.\"\nHaving tested many brands of smart bulbs, the Aqara stands out because it's dependable. It never randomly disconnects on me, like other smart bulbs do, and hasn't presented me any issues in operation. It's definitely become my favorite because of its consistency.\nAs you can see from this photo, I love using the Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini 15A for my Christmas tree and holiday lights. This smart plug is perfect to work with different plug-in devices, adding the convenience of automation and remote control.\nI also use smart plugs for other devices, such as older lamps, fans, and even my flat iron, so I can always make sure I've turned it off from wherever I am.\nOne of the Kasa smart plug's best features is that it's very compact, so it doesn't take up as much space as other popular smart plugs. Its small size means it leaves enough real estate so you can plug in other devices right next to it.\nThis Kasa smart plug is pretty affordable at $10, but you can also buy a four-pack for only $30.\nThe Lockly Visage Zeno Series is the best smart lock I've tested. It features facial recognition, so it unlocks your door as soon as you come into view, making it much more secure than entering a passcode. Lockly ensures your facial recognition data is encrypted and stored in the smart lock, so it doesn't get sent to cloud servers.\nAnd if you still want to use a keycode for entry, this smart lock features Lockly's PIN Genie technology, which scrambles the numbers on the keypad so onlookers can't guess your passcode.\nThis smart lock earned ZDNET's Editor's Choice award for outstanding performance, and also supports Apple Home Key, fingerprint, physical key, and remote unlocking without a hub or subscription.\nAlso: I switched to a Wi-Fi enabled smart lock with facial recognition\nThe only problem with this smart lock is that you have to be willing to splurge. It's priced steeply at $350, and it's so good that it rarely goes on sale, though you can save $30 for a limited time on the Lockly website.\nHowever, the $350 price tag gets you the best smart lock I've tested and two rechargeable batteries, so you can swap them out when one is drained.\nThe Ting Smart Sensor is such a simple and effective device that I can't help recommending it, especially if you have an older home. You simply plug in your Ting and connect it to the mobile app, then wait some time until your device learns your home's patterns.\nA Ting sensor can detect scintillations, or miniscule sparks in wiring damaged by construction, old age, or incorrect installation. The sensor detects these early warning signs and alerts you of them so you can correct them before they become a bigger problem, like a tripped breaker or a fire.\nAside from giving me insights into my home's electrical safety, I also love the Ting device because it alerts me immediately when there is an outage and gives me valuable insights on nearby outages and risks for them. I have a full EcoFlow home backup system, yet the Ting app is much quicker at sending me outage notifications than the EcoFlow app.\nWhen I've been out of town and checking on my home, Ting notifies me if there's a severe thunderstorm warning that could affect our power, and shows me a detailed history of when the power went out and when it was restored.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI'm a smart home tech reviewer who covers a lot of devices that automate daily tasks, including robot vacuums, robot mowers, and other smart device categories. Notably, not all of these devices are worth your hard-earned money, so I only recommend the ones I've tested that have proven to meet or exceed expectations.\nFor this story, I chose only the smart home devices that have become my personal favorites, especially having tested dozens of these types of gadgets.\nWhat is a smart home hub?\nA smart home hub is the central command center for your smart devices. Smart home hubs connect to your network either via Wi-Fi or ethernet and then connect to multiple smart home devices via other connectivity protocols, like Matter, Thread, Zigbee, or Z-Wave.\nYou could connect 20 smart bulbs to your Wi-Fi network, which may slow it down due to congestion. With a smart home hub, you can connect the single hub to your Wi-Fi, then connect the 20 smart bulbs to the hub via Zigbee.\nHaving a smart home hub also potentially means local control for your smart devices, depending on the hub, so you could still control your smart home devices even if your internet connection goes down.\nDo you need a hub for a smart home?\nA hub isn't always required for a smart home setup, but having one ensures your different devices are able to communicate with each other without congesting your Wi-Fi network.\nMany smart devices work without a hub and connect directly to your Wi-Fi, like the Lockly Visage Zeno Series smart lock, while others let you use a hub to connect to, like the Aqara T2 smart bulb."

      "text": "I changed 6 settings on my Roku TV to instantly improve the performance\nFew things ruin the joy of watching a good show more than suddenly seeing that rotating asterisk symbol or swirly icon that tells you your TV is buffering. Or maybe it's stuttering, or altogether freezing. If this is happening on your Roku TV, don't give up on it just yet.\nAlso: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)\nLike phones and computers, Rokus have caches that accumulate temporary data, which inevitably slows them down over time. There are simple ways to clear up this hidden clutter and get your Roku TV behaving like its normal, healthy self.\nHere are a few methods to clear your Roku's cache, improve its speed, and make shows play smoothly again.\n1. Start by unplugging it\nThis one almost sounds too easy to bother with, but it's commonly the first step tech troubleshooters take when fixing fussy devices. Sometimes it even does the trick. Unplug the unit, walk away for a few minutes to let all those electronic pulses fizzle out, and plug it back in.\n2. Restart via settings\nThis isn't a factory reset, but you won't want to do it in the middle of watching \"Yellow Jackets\" because your regularly scheduled program will definitely be interrupted. Follow these steps, and your TV should restart in about 30 seconds.\n- From the Home screen, go to Settings (at the end of the list).\n- Select System, then Power.\n- Choose System Restart and confirm by clicking Restart.\n3. Restart via remote\nIf issues persist after that quick fix, try this hidden function by using the Roku remote.\n- Go to the Home menu, ensuring the Home option on the left is highlighted.\n- Press the Home button five times.\n- Press the Up arrow once.\n- Press the Rewind button twice.\n- Press the Fast Forward button twice.\n- Wait for your Roku to restart.\n4. Uninstall and reinstall apps\nIf you're having extra trouble with a particular app that you suspect might be causing problems, it's a good idea to uninstall and reinstall it. You can do this for any number of apps, but keep in mind that reinstalling the app will erase all user data and settings, requiring a complete setup afterward.\nAlso: Which Roku streaming stick should you buy in 2025? My choice is obvious\n- From the Home screen, highlight the problematic app (do not open it).\n- Press the * button on your remote.\n- Select Remove Channel from the pop-up menu.\n- Reinstall the app, and take the time to set it up again.\n5. Reset your network connection\nYour Wi-Fi signal may be strong, but there could still be a hiccup in your device-to-network interface. There's no harm in giving it a shot, although the process will reboot your Roku and you'll need to reenter your Wi-Fi password after it's done. This will remove all network details, Wi-Fi passwords, and settings for both wired and wireless connections.\nKeep in mind that if you have any other devices connected to your Roku TV (such as a soundbar or streaming stick), you may need to reconnect those devices as well after doing a network connection reset.\n- Go to Settings from the main menu.\n- Select System, then Advanced System Settings.\n- Choose Network Connection Reset, then Reset Connection.\n- Wait for your Roku to restart.\n- Go back to Network, then select Set Up Connection.\n- Select Wireless and choose your Wi-Fi network from the list.\n- Enter its password using the on-screen keyboard and select Connect.\n6. Reset the whole Roku TV\nDoing a factory reset for any device is a lot like treating a back injury with surgery -- a last resort -- and nobody wants to go through with it. It will erase all your personal settings, user profiles, login credentials, and installed apps. If the above steps haven't panned out, here's how to return your Roku to its original state.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your TV (and why it makes such a big difference)\n- As above, go to Settings.\n- Select System, then Advanced System Settings.\n- Choose Factory Reset. A confirmation code will appear below the number pad on the right.\n- Enter that number, then select Start Factory Reset.\n- Your Roku will initiate the hard reset process, and it will take a few minutes to fully reboot.\nHopefully, it won't come to this (the dreaded factory reset), but it will definitely work if needed. By trying some of the prior methods above, you have a good chance of making your Roku fun to watch again."

      "text": "Your Roku TV just got 5 useful updates for free - including a Roku City shortcut\nYour Roku TV is getting a slew of updates to make finding something to watch easier -- including one for your favorite purple city.\nAlso: Should you buy a Roku streaming stick in 2025? Here's my buying advice after testing one\nAt an event in New York City last month, Roku introduced its new TVs and streaming devices, smart home products, and TVs, but it also announced some new additions that will be coming to all existing Roku TVs.\nHere's what's on the way.\nWhat's coming to all Roku TVs\nRoku understands the struggle of finding something to watch, it says, so it's rolling out several ways to make content more personal. These include:\n\"Coming Soon to Theaters,\" a row that shows you what's currently in theaters. If you'd rather wait until you can watch it at home, you can add a movie to your saved list and Roku will alert you when it's available.\nShort-form content rows are headed to the All Things Food and All Things Home tabs, letting you browse videos like recipes, home cleaning hacks, and more one after the other (essentially TikTok or Reels for your TV).\nA personalized highlight row in the Sports Zone lets you follow the latest action from your favorite teams and players. You can also get notifications when it's gametime for your favorite teams.\nIf you want to see the best of the best, watch for Roku's new badges that will identify award-winning films.\nMissing your favorite purple-hued cityscape? Instead of having to wait for your set to go idle to visit, you can now head to Roku City with one click with a dedicated tile. This fake city, complete with its own mass transit, homes, restaurants, and even a city hall, has become a fan-favorite over the past few years, and now it's even easier to pay a visit.\nAlso: CNET survey shows Americans spend over $1,000 a year on subscriptions, and they're sick of it\nHardware updates\nOn the hardware side, new versions of the Roku Streaming Stick and Roku Streaming Stick Plus are on the way. The new models are so power-efficient, Roku says, that they are powered directly by your TV -- meaning no more hanging cables. The new sticks are also getting a sleek redesign that ensures they don't block neighboring HDMI ports. The classic Roku Streaming Stick is also getting a voice remote.\nTwo battery-powered outdoor/indoor security cameras, the Roku Battery Camera and Roku Battery Camera Plus, are also on the way. You can view them remotely with the Roku Smart Home Mobile App or Roku Web View or directly on your Roku TV.\nAnd speaking of TVs, the new Roku TV lineup is getting a new massive 85\" option, improved visuals and improved sound, the company explained, with improved contrast and color accuracy and deeper bass that brings your favorite movies and shows to life.\nThe Roku Plus series of TVs is getting Smart Picture Max, which automatically adjusts picture settings on a scene-by-scene basis, mini-LED backlighting, a new remote finder button on the TV itself, and the integrated cable management system that was included with last year's Pro Series.\nAlso: How to clear your TV cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\nThe higher-end Roku Pro series is getting custom factory calibration that the company promises will deliver a stellar picture right out of the box.\nLastly, all Roku-made TVs will now have Bluetooth Headphone Mode, which allows you to pair headphones directly with the TV."

      "text": "First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nIn a series of rare events, the iPhone 17 Pro has seemingly appeared in public ahead of its expected September launch. Late Monday, X user @Skyfops shared two images of what can be assumed to be an Apple employee handling a test-development iPhone.\nAlso: You can download iOS 26 public beta right now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nWhile the iPhone is encased in a security cover, typically used to hide the device's final design, there's a dead giveaway that the model in question is the unreleased iPhone 17 Pro: the right-aligned LiDAR sensor and flash. Even Bloomberg's Mark Gurman thinks the images look legit.\nLeaks and rumors have long pointed to the upcoming series of iPhones featuring a redesigned camera bar, with the same arrangement of cameras in the upper-left corner as previous models, flanked by additional sensors on the right side -- all upheld by a protruding module. For phone enthusiasts, think Poco M4 Pro design.\nThe rumored horizontal camera bar, considered one of the more significant iPhone hardware changes in recent years, will be a welcome change. It suggests that Apple will give the upcoming iPhone models a noticeable upgrade in camera optics. (It also tells me that the iPhones will rock a little less when set on a table.)\nJust yesterday, Jon Rossignol of MacRumors shared a tip that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a new telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom (up from 5x on the existing iPhone 16 Pro). The outlet also mentioned the possibility of an additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the device, which is indiscernible in the X post.\nWith regard to the iPhone 17 Pro, the extra-thick security cover in the shared images is likely in place to hide the new camera bar. A second image in the X post shows the test-development device covered with a privacy screen protector, hence the darker shade when viewed at an angle.\nAlso: You can download iOS 26 public beta right now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nAs for why exactly the Apple employee is out in public testing the iPhone, your guess is as good as mine. Outdoor applications can span from 5G signal testing, screen brightness, camera quality, and more. What's certain is that this is the first time an employee has been captured in public using an unreleased iPhone, one that we're expecting to learn more about in months' time.\nZDNET has reached out to Apple to try to get more details on the matter and will report back with any new information.\nSign up for our News Alerts to never miss an update."

      "text": "Your Roku device is getting a free HD software upgrade - and so is your favorite city\nWhile Roku is renowned for its user-friendly streaming devices, it's equally famous for its now-iconic cityscape screensaver. The next time your Roku device goes idle, you might notice that your favorite fictional city looks a little sharper.\nSince it debuted in 2018, Roku City, the purple-tinted, animated cityscape has been in standard 720p HD. Now, not only is it getting upgraded to 1080p HD, it's getting more lively -- and it's getting mass transit.\nAlso: Changing these 5 soundbar settings made my living room feel like a movie theater\nIn an email to users, Roku explained that in addition to the definition upgrade to make it look more crisp and vibrant, the fictional city will be \"buzzing with even more activity, including new Easter Eggs and the launch of the Roku City train station.\"\nRoku also explained that billboards across the city are getting a new star button that lets you learn more about content -- something called \"Roku Zones\" -- and other features.\nRoku offers several screensavers in its settings menu, including a clock, a gallery of 4K landscapes, a national parks series, a \"Backdrops\" theme that shows iconic artwork, and a space theme. But the most popular by far is Roku City.\nAlso: The best 50-inch TVs of 2024: Expert tested\nOver time, Roku City has become a fan favorite. The city has a bustling skyline with both real-life and movie-inspired buildings. You'll see diners, mansions, a city hall, landscapes like volcanoes, bodies of water, and even vehicles traveling its roadways. The city updates to change with the seasons, show easter eggs from famous movies and run advertisements for current content.\nThe Roku City update began rolling out a few weeks ago, and should be widely available at this time.\nThis is just the latest in a series of upgrades Roku has introduced this year. A free 24/7 sports channel with live baseball, classic boxing, and sports talk debuted several months ago, and a weekly trivia game rolled out over the summer."
