  "title": "Best cooling mats for dogs in 2025, tested by my dogs",
  "description": "To find out if they work, I got five of the most popular and tested them. I sat on them, had my dogs sit on them and ran controlled experiments to find the best.",
  "content": "If the summer heat is slowing your pet, consider using one of the best dog cooling mats or pads to help them regulate their temperature. Cooling mats are either filled with water or a unique gel that absorbs the heat of your furry friend and then dissipates it to keep your dog cool.\n\nTo find out if these cooling mats truly do work, I called in five of the most popular and tested them over a few weeks. I sat on them myself, had my dogs lie on them and even ran a few controlled experiments to find which cooling mats are worth buying. One emerged as the best for most dog owners (and dogs).\n\nThe best cooling mat I tested was the Green Pet Cool Pet Pad. It strikes the perfect balance of cooling power, portability and ease of use. While the water-based mats I tested performed better in my cooling tests, they\u2019re a pain to fill up, use and transport. That\u2019s why this mat from Green Pet, which utilizes a nontoxic gel to help absorb excess heat from your pup in the summer, easily won out over its competitors.\n\nWhile some might like the increased cooling power of a water mat, I don\u2019t think dealing with the intense prep of them is worth it, unless you\u2019re going to leave them in a semipermanent spot like a back porch that\u2019s next to a hose for easier filling.\n\nThe Green Pet mat, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t be simpler to use. All you have to do is unfold it and place it on the ground. There\u2019s no need to fill it with water since the gel inside can immediately start lowering your pup\u2019s temperature, and moving it from your porch to your family room is a breeze, thanks to its lightweight design. Even though it didn\u2019t work as well as the mats filled with cold water, I thought that skipping the five- to 10-minute setup process was a huge perk.\n\nThe Green Pet mat, like all the other mats, had a respectable cooling score. All the pads I tested scored about the same in one of my two temperature tests, where I stuck a bottle of hot water on the mats before measuring how much it cooled off after 15 minutes. I performed this test with both K&H mats filled with room-temperature water, and they had similar cooling scores as the gel-filled mats (although I\u2019m sure if I filled them with cold water, they\u2019d have performed better).\n\nIn my other temperature test, I prepped each mat (this time using cold water for the fillable mats) and set them out in direct sunlight. The thinner gel mats quickly heated up after 15 minutes, which meant they wouldn\u2019t be much help for your dog. The water-filled ones, on the other hand, stayed cool much longer, thanks to the cold water inside. This is an extreme test since you likely won\u2019t always be using a cooling pad in direct sunlight.\n\nDespite the increased cooling capabilities of water-filled pads, I think most people will enjoy the simplicity of gel mats, which is why the Green Pet Cool Pet Pad is my winner. What you miss out on in cooling efficiency is more than made up for in its simplicity and portability. As long as you use the Green Pet pad inside or in a shaded area, it can help bring your dog\u2019s body temperature down to prevent them from overheating. If you have no choice but to put your dog\u2019s cooling pad in direct sunlight, you may want to consider a water pad, despite how difficult it can be to use.\n\nBeyond the Green Pet mat\u2019s ease of use, I also loved how durable the mat proved to be in my tests. Can it hold up against super chewers? Probably not. But it is strong enough to hold up to some digging and nibbling. And if your dog does get through the outer fabric, the gel inside is nontoxic.\n\nAfter all my tests, the Green Pet Cool Pet Pad stood out as the best option to buy. It\u2019s extremely easy to use, has enough cooling power for most situations, comes in five different sizes to fit whatever breed of dog you have and even has extra color options just in case you hate blue. If your dog needs help cooling down after their midday walks this summer, the Green Pet Cool Pet Pad is an easy pick.\n\nTo find the best dog cooling mats, I got my hands on five of the most popular and put them through a series of real-world tests. I ran multiple cooling trials, weighed them and also let my dogs relax on each of them to find the best. Here\u2019s every test I ran.\n\nHow to choose the best cooling mat or pad for dogs\n\nDog cooling mats and pads help cool down your dog with some simple science. \u201cThere are different types of cooling mats based on how they accomplish the goal of heat transfer. Some mats contain a gel material that acts like a heat sink, trapping heat from the dog\u2019s body and then transferring it to the environment, creating a cool, refreshing surface to lie on,\u201d said Dr. Brian Collins, a veterinarian with the Cornell Richard P. Riney Canine Health Center.\n\nFrom my product testing, I found that water-filled mats get colder, since you can fill them with ice-cold water from your faucets, but they\u2019re much harder to set up and use than their gel-filled counterparts. However, it\u2019s important to think about when and how you want to use your cooling mat before buying one. If you intend on leaving the pad in a semipermanent spot and have easy access to a hose, water-based mats might be the better pick. On the other hand, if you know you want to bring your cooling mat around town or on road trips, the superior portability of gel mats is hard to beat.\n\n\u201cYou should try to find a style and model that your dog will use, is effective for your situation, is easily cleaned and [is] safe,\u201d Collins said. \u201cMost cooling mats will not contain products that are toxic to your dog, but since some dogs love to chew or dig, it\u2019s important to confirm that whatever you choose doesn\u2019t contain anything harmful.\u201d\n\nCollins also said that some dogs may like the feel of one type of pad over another, and in my testing, I found that to be true. The water-filled mats were not only harder to set up but they also felt like a water bed, which my dogs didn\u2019t find very comfortable.\n\n\u201cCooling mats can be a great extra tool to help keep dogs comfortable in warm weather, but it is also important to consider other means of cooling as well, such as shade when outdoors, fans (inside or out), a cool house or air-conditioning,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBe aware of the signs that dogs exhibit when they become too warm, undertake measures to cool them off and when to seek veterinary attention.\u201d\n\nThe Arf Pets Cooling Mat is extremely similar to our winner, having similar performance and portability scores. And that makes sense because Arf Pets is an authorized licensee of the cooling technology patented by Green Pet. If our winning mat is ever sold out, or if this one is on sale, it\u2019s a great buy to help your pup stay cool in the heat.\n\nI liked the feel of this mat a lot, and while it performed similarly to the thinner gel mats in my temperature tests, to me, it felt slightly cooler because of the larger pockets of gel. However, those gel pockets were quite soft, which made them a slipping hazard in my house. I unsuspectingly stepped on the mat a couple of times while walking around and almost lost my balance. For this reason, this mat fell in my rankings, but it might be a good option if you use it in a low-traffic area.\n\nBoth water-filled mats I tested were a pain to fill up. They need too much water to fill with a pitcher, but it\u2019s difficult and awkward to fill them up in the tub. However, if you can actually get them filled with cold water, they can cool your dog a lot faster than gel mats in general. I liked this one more than the K&H Pet Products Cooling Mat because it has an air valve that lets you squeeze all the air out before using it.\n\nThis bed is similar to the Cool Bed III, except it doesn\u2019t have an air valve, which makes it harder to remove any excess air before use. When filled with cold water, it outperformed the gel mats, but it gets so heavy when it\u2019s full that it\u2019s a pain to move around. Plus, my dogs didn\u2019t like the unsteady feeling when lying on any of the water mats.\n\nThe following FAQs have been answered by Dr. Brian Collins, a veterinarian with the Cornell Richard P. Riney Canine Health Center.\n\nFor this article, we consulted the following experts to gain their professional insights.\n\nCNN Underscored thoroughly tests the products in our testing guides and provides full transparency about how we test them.

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\nAs a heat wave covers southern Arizona to the Florida coast, bringing triple-digit temperatures and extreme humidity to more than 55 million people\u2014and their pets.\nKeeping cool in hot weather is challenging for humans. What about our pets?\nThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the British Veterinary Association recommend taking the following steps to ensure your dog, cat or other pet is safe during hot weather.\nWhat not to do\nDon\u2019t walk your dog in the heat of midday. Dogs can struggle to keep cool in high temperatures and are vulnerable to overheating. This is because they can\u2019t sweat and rely on panting to cool their body temperature. Flat-faced breeds such as English or French bulldogs and pugs are at even greater risk, as they have a short muzzle that can make breathing difficult. Stick to early morning or late evening walks.\nNever leave a dog, or any animal, in a car, trailer, conservatory or shed on a hot or even warm day. Being locked in a car for just a few minutes can be fatal to a pet.\nDon\u2019t put hutches or cages in direct sunlight at any time of day. Rabbits and guinea pigs cannot sweat or pant to regulate their body temperature and cool down.\nWhat to do\nA tarmac test. Place the palm of your hand on the ground for five seconds before taking a dog out for a walk. If it feels too hot for you, it\u2019s too hot for a dog\u2019s paws.\nMake sure your pet has adequate shade. Provide extra shade to guinea pigs by covering the top of wire mesh runs with damp towels.\nGive all pets constant access to fresh water. They can get dehydrated very quickly. You can even put ice cubes in their water bowl.\nProvide a cool place to rest. This can include damp towels to lie on, although don\u2019t place a damp towel over your dog as this can trap in heat.\nUse sunscreen. Some breeds of cats and dogs, particularly those with lighter-colored or finer fur, may also benefit from sunscreens, especially on the ear tips, which are prone to sunburn.\nThe British Veterinary Association \u201crecommends avoiding sunscreens with zinc oxide to avoid zinc toxicity. If pet-safe products are hard to find, hypoallergenic or baby human products may be suitable instead. It\u2019s a good idea to consult a vet to make sure you are applying the right sunscreen correctly and in the right place,\u201d Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, wrote on the association\u2019s website.\nWatch out for early signs of heatstroke. In dogs, these include heavy panting, drooling, restlessness, bright red or very pale gums, and lack of coordination. Signs of heatstroke in rabbits include drooling, salivating, lethargy, short and shallow breaths, red and warm ears, wet nose and seizures.\nIf you suspect heatstroke or any other heat-related condition, take your pet to a cool, well-ventilated place. Give it small amounts of cool (not ice-cold) water to drink, and pour room temperature water over it to cool it down. Seek immediate advice from your vet.\nCheck sheds, greenhouses and summerhouses before closing them up. Cats like cozy spots but they risk getting too hot or dehydrated if they get trapped.\nDon\u2019t allow unsupervised pets around a pool. Not every dog is a good swimmer, and many need to be trained around water. Dogs should also be rinsed off after swimming to remove salt or chlorine. Also, it\u2019s safest to have pets wear flotation devices when on boats.\nGroom your cat or dog regularly. Regular grooming in warmer weather can help brush away any dead or excess hair, leaving your cat or dog with a less thick coat, which will help them stay cool.\nStick to your dog\u2019s regular diet. Fruits like watermelon and blueberries are OK as a one-off treat, the British Veterinary Association said in response to a question from CNN, but rinds could be a choking risk.\n\u201cWe would strictly advise against sharing ice cream or other human foods on grounds of pet and human health. Obesity is currently one of the biggest health issues that vets see in practice. \u201d\nThis was updated from a 2022 story."

      "text": "Description\nKeep your pet cool with Green Pet\u2019s revolutionary self-cooling beds for pets.\nOur best-selling, award-winning Cool Pet Pad is a pressure-activated pet cooling mat that kicks in once your pet lays on it. The Cool Pet Pad cools and soothes up to 3 hours. After that, it recharges itself automatically with just 15-20 minutes of non-use.\nOur mats keep cool with an eco-friendly foot forward. The Cool Pet Pad conserves energy with our cooling technology that requires no water, refrigeration or electricity. It\u2019s one-of-a-kind. Or as our lawyers like to call it: patented.\nWe recommend using the Cool Pet Pad indoor in a cool, dry environment. While it's designed to work on all types of surfaces and dog beds, the pad is NOT recommended for use in direct sunlight or hot air, as the technology works by absorbing heat from the highest heat source. It's best if this source is your pet, not the environment!\nUSAGE REMINDER \u2013 READ BEFORE USE\nThis product is pressure-activated and works best indoors or in shaded, temperature-controlled environments. It will not cool effectively if it has been exposed to direct sunlight, a hot car, or any warm environment. The pad will absorb the heat around it, making it ineffective until cooled down.\nDO NOT leave it in:\n- A hot car\n- Direct sunlight\nIf you're using it in a car that\u2019s been parked in the heat, place a towel or blanket on the seat first before setting the pad down. This prevents it from immediately absorbing heat from the hot surface. If you're camping or traveling in an RV, we recommend storing the pad in an air-conditioned area or cooler kept in the shade to help maintain its effectiveness when needed.\nTo reactivate cooling: Always bring it indoors and let it return to room temperature. It will naturally reset\u2014no water, fridge, or electricity needed.\nFor a jump start on cooling, you can put it in the refrigerator or even the freezer!\nWhy you'll love it:\n- Fits standard size beds and crates\n- Perfect for air-conditioned cars\n- Folds easily\n- Durable\n- Wipes clean\n- Non-toxic\nU.S. Pat.
