  "description": "The future Hall of Famer dabbled in off-field entertainment endeavors leading up to the 2024 NFL season.",
  "content": "Travis Kelce will be the first to admit the last two NFL seasons have not been his finest.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging GQ interview about his career and relationship with Taylor Swift, the three-time Super Bowl champion with the Chiefs expressed how the \u201cpast two years haven\u2019t been to [his] standard\u201d as he dabbled in entertainment endeavors off the field.\n\n\u201cI think it might have slipped a little bit because I did have a little bit more focus in trying to set myself up. And opportunities came up where I was excited to venture into a new world of acting and being an entertainer,\u201d Kelce, 35, said in the September issue of the publication.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say this as \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u2019 I\u2019m just saying that my work ethic is such that I have so much pride in how I do things that I never want the product to tail off, and I feel like these past two years haven\u2019t been to my standard.\u201d\n\nAhead of the 2024 season, the future Hall of Fame tight end was tapped to host the Amazon game show \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Celebrity\u201d and dabbled in the TV dramatics of Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d\n\nHe also appeared in \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d which premiered on Netflix in July.\n\nWhen the Chiefs officially kicked off their 2024 campaign last fall, Kelce \u2014 who failed to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards the previous season (984), a feat he had accomplished every year since 2016 \u2014 became a non-factor on offense, triggering an onslaught of criticism about whether his focus was elsewhere.\n\nAlthough Kelce showed he had plenty left in the tank in January, when the Chiefs punched their ticket to a third straight Super Bowl, the defending champs were rattled by the Eagles on the NFL\u2019s biggest stage in February with a lopsided 40-22 defeat.\n\nThe fallout has only fueled Kelce\u2019s fire as he prepares for his 13th season.\n\n\u201cI just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys,\u201d he said.\n\nKelce has put in the work this offseason, and the team has taken notice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s svelte right now,\u201d coach Andy Reid said at the start of training camp last month. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s 20. He\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019s in great shape.\u201d\n\nKelce, who tallied 97 receptions for 823 yards and three touchdowns in the regular season last year, will visit Brazil in the Chiefs\u2019 season-opening clash against the Chargers on Sept. 5.",

      "text": "Just call him Travis \u201cSvelte\u201d Kelce.\nThe Chiefs\u2019 All-Pro tight end received high praise Thursday from head coach Andy Reid, who told reporters the 35-year-old Kelce is in great shape and looks half his age at training camp\n\u201cHe\u2019s svelte right now,\u201d Reid said during his media availability. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s 20. He\u2019s doing a good job. He\u2019s in great shape.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure he didn\u2019t come in first during the whole conditioning thing, he was right up front. You can see he\u2019s been working out. You saw him yesterday on the long run where he had the burst. He\u2019s done a nice job. He\u2019s worked hard to get to this spot.\u201d\nKelce, who is entering his 13th NFL season and quite possibly his last, previously said he lost some weight in the offseason.\n\u201cEach year is different man, you gotta rebuild it,\u201d Kelce told reporters last month. \u201cThis year, I got some time to really focus on some things in the offseason that I just didn\u2019t have time for last year. I\u2019m certainly feeling good and I think it will pay off man.\u201d\nWhen asked about rumors that he lost 25 pounds, Kelce said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet, guys.\u201d\nKelce, who will turn 36 in October, posted a career-low 823 yards and 97 receptions in 2024.\nThe future Hall of Famer still finds ways to be productive in the Chiefs\u2019 offense, but he\u2019s at the end of his career and not as quick as he once was.\n\u201cYou hope he plays forever, but that\u2019s probably not gonna happen to any of us,\u201d Reid said. \u201cSo whenever he decides to hang it up, he\u2019s built a great legacy here. And if he decides this is it, it\u2019s it. If not, more power to him.\u201d\nKelce trained in Florida this offseason after confirming his NFL return in the wake of the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl defeat to the Eagles in February.\nThe 10-time Pro Bowler was a non-factor in the 40-22 blowout loss with four catches for 39 yards.\nKelce, a three-time Super Bowl champ, has 1,004 career receptions for 12,151 yards and 77 touchdowns.\nThe Chiefs open the 2025 campaign against the Chargers on Sept. 5 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."

      "text": "Travis Kelce is going to have a different look this summer as training camp nears.\nWith the Chiefs set to start mandatory minicamp next week, ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler reported Saturday that Kelce is going to have a different look this summer \u2014 a 25-pound-lighter look, to be exact.\nKelce, who was listed at 250 pounds last season, did not attend voluntary OTAs \u2014 and was even spotted Thursday at Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final with girlfriend Taylor Swift \u2014 but is expected to be at practice Tuesday.\n\u201cHe will debut a bit of a slimmer look,\u201d Fowler said on \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on Saturday morning.\n\u201cHe\u2019s told people close to him that he\u2019s lost about 25 pounds this offseason. Played a little bit heavier in 2024, sort of a thing. He vowed to change it, and he has.\u201d\nFowler added that this season could be Kelce\u2019s \u201clast dance.\u201d\nKelce and the Chiefs were thumped by the Eagles in Super Bowl 2025, and questions lingered for the early part of the offseason about whether the tight end would retire.\nHe was named to his 10th Pro Bowl in 2024, but he produced the lowest full-season receiving yard total (823) of his career with just three touchdowns.\nBut on Feb. 27, Kelce texted Pat McAfee that he would indeed return for a 13th NFL season.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back, for sure,\u201d Kelce told McAfee in a text that was read on the air on the ex-punter\u2019s show on ESPN. \u201cGonna try and get to the best shape I\u2019ve been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop. Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and how I got the guys ready for battle. I can\u2019t go out like that!!!!\u201d\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes said at the end of May that if this is the last go-around of Kelce, it wasn\u2019t apparent in how he was going about his business.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the last ride, you would never know,\u201d Mahomes told reporters. \u201cThe way he\u2019s talking about football, the way he\u2019s talking about working and trying to be even better this year than he was last year, he doesn\u2019t seem like a guy like it\u2019s his last ride, like he\u2019s tired of the job.\u201d\nThe Chiefs will start their AFC title defense in Brazil on Sept. 5 against the Chargers."

      "text": "Travis Kelce\u2019s slow start to the 2024 season continues to dominate sports media talk following his third straight underwhelming performance, a 30-yard, four-reception outing in Sunday night\u2019s 22-17 win over the Falcons.\nWhile NBC\u2019s Cris Collinsworth called out the lack of \u201cmagic\u201d between Kelce and star Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, former ESPN personality Todd McShay zoned in on other elements surrounding the All-Pro tight end\u2019s highly publicized life.\n\u201cEvery show I watch, every pregame show, halftime show, postgame show, weekday show, every broadcast I watch for the last few weeks, it\u2019s like are we not allowed to say that he\u2019s out of shape, that he\u2019s been partying all offseason? He\u2019s been jet-setting around with the most famous person probably in the entire world, that he\u2019s drinking, going to the U.S. Open,\u201d McShay said Monday on \u201cThe Ryen Russillo Podcast,\u201d referencing Kelce and girlfriend Taylor Swift\u2019s escapades earlier this month.\n\u201c\u2026 What I do know is, I want you to take a picture from preseason 2022 and then take a picture preseason 2024, they\u2019re barely the same human being, Ryen, and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018We got to get him the ball, why isn\u2019t he part of the offense?\u2019 The defense is double-covering.\u2019 Here\u2019s the thing, bottom line with Kelce: The coverage and the respect he gets is the same, the athlete is not. Now, is he going to work himself into shape during the season? Yeah, I\u2019m sure he will. He\u2019s an unbelievable competitor, he\u2019s one of the best to ever do it and he still finds a way to make a play or two here and there and shows up in some clutch moments, but he\u2019s not the same guy right now.\u201d\nKelce, now in his 12th NFL season with the Chiefs, has tallied eight receptions for 69 yards and zero touchdowns to open the year \u2014 one season after he failed to amass 1,000 total yards for the first time since 2015.\nAlthough the three-time Super Bowl champ recently expressed that he stopped getting caught up with stats long ago, McShay pondered why some are dancing around certain critiques.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the same explosiveness, I see him wearing down a little bit in games, it\u2019s OK, he\u2019ll work himself back into shape, it\u2019s not the first guy ever who\u2019s not quite in the elite shape that he was,\u201d said McShay, who is nearing a deal to join The Ringer full-time after being laid off by ESPN last year.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sitting here and you\u2019re defending him, too. Is there some kind of message I\u2019m not getting from the league that you\u2019re not allowed to say he\u2019s not in the same shape, he\u2019s not able to produce at the highest level right now? And he\u2019ll probably work himself back into shape by Week 8, 9, 10 this season. Are we not allowed to say that?\u201d\nAs McShay called attention to Kelce\u2019s off-field endeavors, he added, \u201cYou can\u2019t be doing all of those things and still be the same person physically as you were in 2022.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not blaming it on Taylor Swift, I\u2019m not blaming anything, all I\u2019m saying is when you win two Super Bowls, you got that whole tour that happens after the Super Bowl, he\u2019s the most commercialized guy, there\u2019s no one else doing more commercials I don\u2019t think in the league, he and Mahomes are up there, I think Kelce\u2019s doing more commercials and things, he\u2019s been at more events, doing more things socially. It\u2019s impossible to carry that schedule and still put in the same amount of time for football,\u201d McShay said.\nEven as the heat turns up on Kelce \u2014 who looked miserable on the bench Sunday in Atlanta \u2014 Mahomes has his back, with the quarterback elaborating on the tight end\u2019s minimal presence on offense thus far.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because teams still \u2014 the respect factor they have for Travis is just unreal. It\u2019s well-deserved,\u201d Mahomes said as the Chiefs improved to 3-0. \u201cWe\u2019re calling a lot of plays for Travis and it\u2019s like two or three people are going to him. He understands \u2014 that\u2019s the great thing about him is he wants to make an impact on the game but he wants to win at the end of the day.\u201d\nThe Chiefs face the Chargers (2-1) in Los Angeles on Sunday."

It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of \u2026 It happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\u201d\nFollow Taylor Swift live updates from Page Six for the latest news, photos, fan theories and more\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion, 35, was first linked to Swift, also 35, in the summer of 2023, when he expressed interest in connecting with her at an Eras Tour stop in Kansas City, hoping to pass along a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it.\nSwift, who had been touring throughout the US that year, made her first Chiefs appearance in September 2023, and fans \u2014 not to mention the dads, Brads and Chads \u2014 have not been the same since.\nKelce joined Swift on tour during the 2024 offseason, even making his Eras Tour debut in Europe, while the 14-time Grammy winner has attended various Chiefs games, including their Super Bowl 2025 loss to the Eagles in February.\nDespite the heightened attention on their every move, at the end of the day, Kelce says, he and Swift are simply two regular people.\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It just kind of took the f\u2013k off.\u201d\nSwift, who spent the offseason with Kelce as he prepares for his 13th season in the league, even made a pitstop on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast to tease her upcoming 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d"

      "text": "In a dimly lit dining room in Miami, a waiter places a course of hamachi crudo in front of Travis Kelce. \u201cWe don\u2019t get fresh fish like this in Kansas City,\u201d Kelce says. We are sitting in a horseshoe-shaped booth, and Kelce\u2019s voice can just be heard over that of the young woman on the restaurant\u2019s stage, covering Sade\u2019s \u201cThe Sweetest Taboo\u201d and other quiet storm standards. Kelce did not encounter fish like this\u2014raw, finely sliced, opalescent\u2014growing up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, either. \u201cRed Lobster was the nice spot for us to go to as a kid. We used to go there, see the lobsters in the tank like we were at an aquarium. We put on pants for that shit.\u201d\nKelce is here, in the swank, lean-protein-and-rich-people capital of the world, not just because it is a comfortable off-season home for a 35-year-old multimillionaire. Kelce is here in South Florida to get back to his roots, to reunite with Fort Lauderdale\u2013based speed-and-agility coach Tony Villani. Villani trained Kelce for his NFL combine more than a decade ago and has worked with Kelce during the summers for most of his professional career. Kelce took a hiatus from Villani a few years ago, when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end moved his off-season operations to Los Angeles, near his burgeoning second career in film and television. Now, though, Kelce has come back east to regroup from last season\u2019s lopsided defeat in the Super Bowl.\n\u201cWin a Super Bowl is the only goal,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only goal. It\u2019s every goal.\u201d It\u2019s been nearly four months since that defeat, and Kelce is still hard on himself about it. \u201cI think it might have slipped a little bit because I did have a little bit more focus in trying to set myself up. And opportunities came up where I was excited to venture into a new world of acting and being an entertainer,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t say this as \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u2019 I\u2019m just saying that my work ethic is such that I have so much pride in how I do things that I never want the product to tail off, and I feel like these past two years haven\u2019t been to my standard.\u201d He adds, \u201cI just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys.\u201d\nHis past 24 hours have been ridiculous. Yesterday he woke up at five to drive to the Everglades for this story\u2019s photo shoot. He spent 12 hours trudging through swamps and cradling alligators and riding airboats. From there he drove to the airport to catch an evening flight to Kansas City for a children\u2019s hospital charity event that night. The next day, he drove to the airport, caught a flight back to Miami, and came right to dinner. At some point in this itinerary, Kelce got in a workout. And, after he\u2019s done with me, he\u2019s due to interview Shaquille O\u2019Neal for an episode of New Heights\u2014the podcast he cohosts with his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, which was licensed by Wondery last year in a deal reportedly worth $100 million. Beside the plate of hamachi is a cup of coffee, the only hint that he might be experiencing some fatigue.\nKelce is not, to be clear, letting his squandered shot at a historic Super Bowl three-peat or his punishing off-season training stop him from having fun. His unapologetic zest for life is one of his superpowers, and it\u2019s key to his popularity, the sense that he knows what a lucky schmuck he is, can\u2019t believe it any more than you can, and damn if he isn\u2019t going to enjoy every second while it lasts. The impression he gives off lately is of unrepressed joy\u2014squint-smiling through his newly long hair and the glare of paparazzi flashes as he goes to dinner or a Stanley Cup game with his partner, Taylor Swift. And, besides, brooding self-pity is simply not in his nature. \u201cI love being the happiest guy in the world all the fucking time,\u201d he says.\nKelce is famously bad at hiding his emotions. One story he tells me is of when he was 23 years old, preparing for his NFL draft, and had the opportunity to meet with Rob Chudzinski, then head coach of the Cleveland Browns, the team the Kelce brothers zealously rooted for growing up: \u201cI cried in Chud\u2019s office and said, \u2018I will fucking die for this city!\u2019 \u201d Kelce tells me. \u201cI literally was in tears. I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m getting emotional. I grew up down the street. I would fucking do anything to play for the Cleveland Browns.\u2019 He looked at me like I was insane. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever had somebody just pour out their emotions.\u201d\nThe Browns passed on Kelce. So did every other team until the third round of the 2013 draft, when he was selected by the Chiefs, where ultimately Kelce turned out to be a perfect complement to the incoming future MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes. On the other end of so many of Mahomes\u2019s scrappy schoolyard plays, there was Kelce, improbably open, commemorating a completion with a wider array of dance moves than a junior high mixer. \u201cWhen I was younger in the league,\u201d he says, \u201cI used to have some of the older players come up to me and be like, \u2018Man, you celebrate after every fucking catch!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m in the NFL, dude! I love this shit! I finally get the ball in my hands and I have millions of people watching me, this shit is exciting!\u2019 \u201d\nFive Super Bowl appearances and three rings later, and having surpassed Jerry Rice for the all-time lead in postseason and Super Bowl receptions, Kelce has made a strong case to be considered the greatest tight end ever. \u201cThere will be arguments about him versus Gronk, versus Tony Gonzalez,\u201d says Jason Kelce, who, as New Heights listeners know, is more prone to giving his brother shit than praise. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been as unique of a player in that spot.\u201d Yet age and success have not tempered Travis\u2019s intensity. Not toward opposing players, not toward referees, not even toward his head coach, Andy Reid, whom Kelce infamously and heatedly confronted on the sideline in the 2024 Super Bowl. (He would later apologize and say the two men had laughed about it.) \u201cI get all my negative energy out when I play football,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there on the field, I can hit somebody, I can talk shit. That\u2019s where the meaner side of me is or the asshole side of me.\u201d\nStill, the Travis Kelce I spend time with is different from the Travis Kelce I expected. Though no less ebullient, he is more introspective. \u201cThat football is shaped funny,\u201d Kelce says with Yogi Berra\u2013like sagacity. \u201cThat thing can bounce your way, and it can not bounce your way. There\u2019s a lot of fortune that goes into playing this game.\u201d It\u2019s this slightly philosophical bent that complicates the carefree, club-hopping Midwestern bro persona that has made him so relatable and beloved. \u201cI\u2019m starting to phase out of wanting to be known as the party guy,\u201d says the guy who emcees a namesake music festival in Kansas City that draws 20,000 spectators to see the likes of Diplo and Lil Wayne, the guy whose post-playoff victory routine is a guttural rendition of \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!).\u201d\n\u201cWhen you see me hanging out at the US Open with Taylor, it may look like the two of us are partying,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cBut I\u2019m just enjoying the fun of being at this really cool event that I always wanted to go to with the person that I love.\u201d Put another way, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people.\u201d Later during our time together he tells me, \u201cI have a good understanding of how I want to be portrayed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a new interest, exactly. In college, when Kelce was suspended from the University of Cincinnati team for a marijuana violation, his brother, Jason (who also played for UC), advocated for his reinstatement, and Travis was given another chance, but only if a number of conditions were met. Some of these have been well documented in the brothers\u2019 Amazon Prime and ESPN documentaries\u2014no missed classes, a grade point average of 3.0. A lesser-known condition was, as Kelce tells me, \u201cI had to sit down with a shrink for an hour a week. He got me to look at my life way more strategically. He got me to understand that you go through these emotions, and your reaction can either help you or hurt you or be indifferent. He walked me through all these different phases of my life. \u2018How did this make you feel? How did you react?\u2019 I started to understand and process these emotions completely differently. You start to control it and not let it get too crazy.\u201d\nI\u2019m curious how the media scrutiny\u2014increased exponentially since he started dating Swift\u2014affects him. Does he pay any attention to it? \u201cYou can\u2019t block that out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone says something that they don\u2019t like about you, you have to be able to understand how you are portraying yourself for them to say that. I\u2019m a guy who doesn\u2019t want anyone to say anything negative about me. Some people don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m someone who does care.\u201d\nIt requires a certain amount of vulnerability and bravery for someone of Kelce\u2019s renown to admit what Kelce is admitting here. Even with all his professional accomplishments, all his money and the luxury it buys, all his romantic prosperity, he still cops to the desire to be liked by strangers. He\u2019s willing to keep working to make you like him. Kelce continues: \u201cI do want people to look at me like I\u2019m doing good in the world, I\u2019m influencing and using my platform for the better, being a role model, being somebody that has done it the right way.\u201d\nWe\u2019re wrapping up dinner so Kelce can get some much-deserved sleep before his morning speed workout when the restaurant singer approaches our table, holding a wireless microphone. She starts to sing again, serenading us and only us with Lauryn Hill\u2019s \u201cEx-Factor.\u201d I feel my face go red and try to suppress an uncomfortable chuckle. This is way too intimate. I glance over at Kelce, expecting to catch his eye and exchange some recognition of the awkwardness. But Kelce has been quick to understand what I have not. The singer is simply doing her job, our table one mandatory stop in her nightly loop around the room. So he treats her with the same respect he has shown every other employee in the restaurant thus far, making eye contact with and thanking the waitstaff who bring our food and fill our water glasses and clear our plates. He watches her attentively for the full minute she croons away at us, until she slinks off to the next table.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to win your fourth Super Bowl, you don\u2019t go to a \u201cstudio\u201d with eucalyptus-scented towels, an apparel shoppe, and a coworking space. You go to a gym. XPE Sports in Fort Lauderdale is a windowless warehouse-size space situated in a commercial complex, between a shooting range and an escape room, and immediately upon entering you understand you\u2019re not here to film TikToks and grab-ass.\nKelce has shown up in a hat with \u201cCincinnati\u201d in minimalist block type, a logo-less black tee, black Nike shorts, and vintage LeBrons. He prefers basketball shoes for training. \u201cI don\u2019t find that much power in the shoes that are meant for more speed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the low-tops, that\u2019s just what you get: the lighter fabrics. Everybody wants to feel like they\u2019re out there almost barefoot.\u201d\nI watch him spend an hour cycling through a series of high-tech, data-yielding drills: 15-yard flies measured by Brower Timing Systems lasers, split squats calculating bar-speed acceleration with a Vitruve velocity app, standing jumps on the Hawkin Force Plates, Shredmill sprints, resistance work on the OHM Run Delta-Kinetic Trainer. He is not doing this alone but in rotation with a few other XPE clients.\n\u201cI like being part of the action,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people doing it with you that motivate you.\u201d One of them is a kid who can\u2019t be more than a high school senior and who impresses me by how chill he is getting in reps with a future Hall of Famer who has more than 6 million Instagram followers. Both of us manage to resist the urge to retrieve Kelce\u2019s hat when it flies off during each of the sprints.\nThe session concludes with a half hour of legs: dumbbell box step-ups, single-leg RDLs. You don\u2019t ever get to see them, hidden by game pants and socks, but his legs are tremendous, real Bernini shit. And to witness him perform a Nordic hamstring curl is something I will never, ever forget. On his knees, his ankles held by a trainer, his arms at his sides, Kelce slowly, methodically lowers his torso toward the artificial turf, the angle steadily collapsing from 90 degrees to 45 degrees to still lower, inconceivably lower, to the point where his chest is nearly parallel to the floor and seems to be levitating. Only when his nose is practically touching the turf does he extend his hands to brace himself. Then he pushes himself back up and does it a few more times.\nAfter Kelce finishes, he lingers nearby as Tony Villani, his baseball hat curved and low like we\u2019re at a World Series of Poker final table, explains his approach to Kelce\u2019s speed training. \u201cI started to realize that when you got too fast, you couldn\u2019t decelerate,\u201d Villani explains. \u201cAll Travis is trying to do to the linebacker or safety is make him chase him. Once that linebacker or safety chases him and runs, he\u2019s out of control\u2026. Travis plays between 12 and 16 miles per hour. That\u2019s it. If he goes past his zone, then he turns into a track athlete and can\u2019t change direction. He caught a pass in the Super Bowl three years ago and he jumped it up to 19 miles an hour, the fastest speed he hit in three years.\u201d\nKelce recalls and says, \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny? During that run, I felt how out of control I was and the guy had the angle on me. I just didn\u2019t even have a move.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s set every tight end record known to man without ever really being above 19,\u201d Villani says with the contented look of a teacher praising their star pupil. \u201cThis is what he\u2019s an artist at. This isn\u2019t just, Did he go from A to B as fast as possible, which he knows how to do, but he also knows how to be an artist creating illusion with agility.\u201d\nVillani draws my attention to two whiteboards. Using a dry-erase marker, he covers them with fractions, percentages, decimal points, arrows, triangles, triangles within triangles, and a house-shaped polygon. His arcane formula amounts to shaving a few tenths of a second off Kelce\u2019s movements so that he can gain an extra half-yard of separation from a defender\u2014so that there\u2019s a higher probability of a catch than a deflection. I nod along and pretend I know what the hell he is talking about. \u201cI haven\u2019t released all this yet, but you\u2019re going to make me,\u201d Villani says.\nNothing to worry about, I think. I couldn\u2019t report on Villani\u2019s proprietary theorem even if I wanted to. Kelce, however, is clearly not confused. It all makes perfect sense to him.\nIn our conversations, Kelce is ambivalent about the meathead jock stereotype that he sometimes seems to wear (like when, shortly after we speak, he goes viral for this comment about his experience guest hosting SNL: \u201cThe table reading, for a guy that can\u2019t really read that well, it was kind of a fucked situation\u201d). \u201cI find it funny,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI joke about it. It is what it is. I\u2019m just out here living life,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want everyone to think that I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d But he\u2019s earnest about his belief that it\u2019s more powerful to know what you don\u2019t know. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to learn. Acting like you\u2019re the smartest one in the room just isn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\nTwice over dinner the night before, Kelce told me stories that began with him missing school. The first came after his Red Lobster quip. His dad once worked as a waiter there. Ed Kelce had a lot of jobs. His main job was sales for a company that made insulation for factory furnaces and kilns. He also picked up part-time jobs around the holidays. One of those was at the See\u2019s Candies kiosk at Beachwood Place mall.\n\u201cHe never told me,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI found this out when I was skipping school one day and saw him there. I got right out of there.\u201d\n(When I speak to Ed and tell him this story, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this one! He must have turned and ran because he would have definitely caught hell, no question about that.\u201d)\nThe other story was about his mom\u2019s work. Donna Kelce got her college degree in communications, with the aspiration to go into radio or television. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t go to waste!\u201d she tells me, shortly before it is announced that she will appear in the next season of the reality competition show The Traitors. Those industries, she says, \u201cwould put up with [women] but didn\u2019t see us as anything serious.\u201d So she entered the field of banking, eventually landing at KeyBank, based in downtown Cleveland.\n\u201cWhen I would get kicked out of school for fighting,\u201d Travis said, \u201cI would sometimes have to go with my mom to work and hang out with her.\u201d Over the years, and with each successive suspension, he was able to witness his mother\u2019s ambition realized. \u201cIt went from cubicles to a really nice office in the back, to all of a sudden the offices are getting bigger and bigger and now she\u2019s got a name tag on her office. I literally saw my mom go through it by being a little bad-ass kid.\u201d\n(Donna contends her son wasn\u2019t sent home for fighting: \u201cSometimes he went above and beyond overboard trying to make the other kids laugh. He just loved attention. Which he still does, God bless him!\u201d)\nNow, Kelce didn\u2019t tell me these stories to show how crappy he was at school. He told them to show how he gets his work ethic from his parents, how determined they were to give their two sons a chance to find and pursue their dreams, and how much he loves them for that, among so many other reasons. Still, I also knew from my research that he\u2019d been ineligible to play football his sophomore year of high school because he failed French class, and that he didn\u2019t get his college degree until 2022. So: How is a guy like that\u2014a guy who during a live taping of New Heights at the University of Cincinnati chugged a beer in cap-and-gown while belatedly receiving his diploma\u2014able to look at Tony Villani\u2019s graffitied whiteboards and easily decipher all those complex diagrams seemingly straight out of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory?\n\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly intelligent,\u201d says Jason Kelce. \u201cBut he never really cared enough about school to be in AP courses. I was always in AP courses and then we\u2019d take the same proficiency test, and he\u2019d get a higher grade. It\u2019s like, \u2018How are you getting a better math grade when you haven\u2019t even taken algebra yet?\u2019 \u201d\nJason then tells me a story of how one Christmas when he was eight and Travis was six, they both got the same Erector set. They sat at the kitchen table with their father putting them together. Ed and Jason carefully read the instructions before beginning the assembly. When they were done reading, they looked up to find Travis had already finished.\n\u201cTravis has always had these moments that we refer to as \u2018Travis Moments,\u2019 \u201d Ed says when I ask him about the story. \u201cHe will suddenly surprise you by doing something or knowing something or seeing something.\u201d\nEd provides another example. \u201cWhen Travis was in grade school, we were called in to discuss some problems he was having: his teacher and a counselor and Donna and me. I wasn\u2019t buying that there was anything wrong with him. But I shut up, listened to them, let them do their spiel. And the teacher said, \u2018Travis, I want you to write your name so that I can read it.\u2019 Travis was sitting across the table from her. He wrote his name upside down and backwards.\u201d\nAlex Smith also had his share of Travis Moments. Smith was the Chiefs\u2019 starting quarterback for Kelce\u2019s first five years in the NFL, before he was succeeded by Patrick Mahomes. Most people credit Mahomes with helping Kelce achieve his full potential, including Kelce himself. But Kelce also acknowledges how crucial Smith\u2014\u201cone of my favorite teammates, favorite people in my entire career\u201d\u2014was in his development. The Chiefs offense favored wide receivers. As tight end, Kelce would often be by himself on one side of the field. So he started tweaking his routes, tinkering and freestyling, just to see if he could get open.\n\u201cI like to play to the rhythm, if you think of it as a piano player,\u201d Kelce says. One hand provides the structure for the song, while the other hand crafts the melody your brain can\u2019t help but follow. \u201cBut I\u2019m always on the quarterback\u2019s timing. I\u2019m always making sure that I\u2019m not screwing up anybody else\u2019s route. But at the same time, I\u2019m going to manipulate the defense\u2026. I\u2019m nonstop trying to get in those guys\u2019 heads. One, keeping them in a reactionary position. But two, if I understand what this guy is being taught on this play in terms of leverage, in terms of when I threaten him, I can move him, now I can move guys to open up windows. Now I can attract attention to open up somebody else.\u201d\nIn Kelce\u2019s third season, with the Chiefs\u2019 offense struggling, Smith and then quarterbacks coach Matt Nagy sat down to watch film from their most recent game.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget,\u201d says Smith. \u201cEvery single pass play, wherever I was going, whatever the concept intended for me to throw, whatever defensive look I was getting, it didn\u2019t matter: Travis was open. He was supposed to turn out, but on this one he flipped in, and he was open. He always put his little twist on it, and it worked. The number one insight for us coming out of that meeting was that we needed to get the ball to Travis way more. When in doubt, throw Travis the ball.\u201d\nSoon after, they were playing the Denver Broncos. Kelce had already caught one pass on a fake shallow cross that he turned back out. They ran it again. This time the defensive end didn\u2019t bite on the fake.\n\u201cAs a quarterback,\u201d says Smith, \u201cI have to generally know where you\u2019re going to be. It\u2019s part of accountability and timing. I\u2019ve got to trust that when I throw it, you\u2019re going to be there. Travis instinctively did this weird little hesitation and then just kept running the shallow [cross]. This is an NFL game! We had never talked about this! This was not remotely a possibility for him when we installed this play! It turned into a 35-yard gain. This is the brilliance of Kelce. He did the Randy Moss\u2014put his hand up. There aren\u2019t many guys you can trust when they put their hand up. I trusted him and he made it right\u2026. It\u2019s pretty savant what he\u2019s been able to do.\u201d\nKelce and I are supposed to spend an afternoon playing nine holes of golf. But rain is forecast, so we sit in a rooftop lounge area at the golf club and talk. He wears a Kith for USA Basketball collared long-sleeve and sips an iced coffee.\nI ask him about his hallmark first down gesture\u2014one of the all-time athlete celebrations. So simple, so cocky, so devastating to opposing fans. Across from me, Kelce chuckles, raises both hands, points his fingers in the same direction, though not as emphatically as in games. It\u2019s the slight dramatic pause followed by the assertive point that makes it so savage.\n\u201cWhen did that start?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat was the inspiration?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI know Tay picked it up and she did it in New Orleans.\u201d\nLast October, on a Louisiana stop of her Eras Tour, Swift worked the first down point into her choreography. And the internet went crazy, as it always does over anything having to do with the pair. I\u2019ve been looking for the right way to ask Kelce about Swift, without reducing him to a sidekick. As it turns out, taking turns being a sidekick sits just fine with him.\n\u201cI get to be the plus one,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I\u2019m a fan of music. I\u2019m a fan of art. And it\u2019s so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field\u2026. I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\u201d A few weeks after we speak, Swift will join Kelce in Nashville at Tight End University, a training camp and charity fundraiser Kelce cofounded with George Kittle and Greg Olsen, and put on an impromptu performance. \u201cI sort of made her a football fan,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cShe is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short\u2014all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.\u201d\nKelce says he and Swift have a lot in common, entertaining sold-out stadiums. \u201cI hadn\u2019t experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions. That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows. She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I\u2019ve seen what she goes through. I\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s training regimen of singing her entire set while running on the treadmill has been widely covered; what Kelce emphasizes is the conditions in which she performs. \u201cTo go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours. The [Eras Tour] floor is literally\u2014I\u2019ve seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer. You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the computer and you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the sun and you\u2019re doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she\u2019s doing it three, four, five days in a row.\u201d\nKelce talks about Swift freely, with the confident adoration of a sturdy relationship, and with obvious pride. Not macho pride in his having attained the seemingly unattainable, or the overprotective possessiveness so often confused for chivalry. Kelce expresses selfless pride. Immaculate pride. The kind he, of traditionally Midwestern stock, has been unwilling to express about his own accomplishments when I\u2019ve raised them. I think of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe\u2014how when she returned from entertaining troops in South Korea, she said, \u201cJoe, you never heard such cheering.\u201d To which he replied, \u201cYes I have.\u201d There is no such ego when Kelce speaks of Swift, praising the creative purposefulness of the Eras Tour.\n\u201cHave you learned anything from her about how to hold a crowd\u2019s attention or harness its energy?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cPeople gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her. She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it\u2019s an intimate situation. I think that alone\u2014there is so much calm and coolness. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s up there making everyone feel at ease.\n\u201cWhenever I get in front of a crowd, I feel like I\u2019ve got to be like, Woooo! Like, excited, bringing the energy. Then I saw that coolness and that calmness and that relatability that she is so good at presenting. I really grabbed that. Like, Man, I can use that side of entertainment as well. It\u2019s not just always being the guy that brings the energy and creates these exciting moments.\u201d\nI remind him of an interview he once did in which he said his ideal partner would share some of the same qualities as his mom.\n\u201cAre there any similarities between the two of them?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cTheir kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir ability to show love and support no matter what. And on top of that, their work ethic. I saw my mother reach goals that she had set for herself, go from being a teller to working all the way up in the KeyBank building.\u201d\nHere, thinking of his mom\u2019s determination and perseverance, Kelce gets a bit emotional and pauses briefly to collect himself. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Taylor do the exact same thing of setting goals for herself and exceeding the expectations and really captivating the world in that regard.\u201d\nIn documentaries about the Kelce brothers, the family has been open about how Donna and Ed kept their marriage together for the sake of Travis and Jason, finally divorcing after 28 years when Travis was in college. \u201cThey were always the ultimate partners in terms of being there for us as kids,\u201d Kelce had told me. \u201cThere was no division in terms of anger at each other. I think the romance of it all might\u2019ve just kind of faded, being so focused on their careers and raising a family. It\u2019s probably hard for parents to keep that romance, especially when you\u2019ve got kids that are into fucking everything, you know? My brother was into so much more stuff than me\u2014he was a musician, he was doing all this theater stuff\u2014outside of just sports. I\u2019m doing all these sports\u2014two sports every season. So there\u2019s so much shit going on.\u201d\nI had asked Kelce how visible the strain in his parents\u2019 marriage was growing up, and he recalled just one, small moment. \u201cWe always had the calendar on the refrigerator of everything, and it said \u201825th anniversary\u2019 on it. Might have been 15. I don\u2019t want to get this wrong.\u201d More so than at any other point in our conversation, Kelce deliberated, scrupulously, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure whether he should reveal this memory, and if he was going to do so then he wanted to be certain he wasn\u2019t mischaracterizing it in any way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get this wrong,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt had to be around 20. Let\u2019s say 20. I remember seeing it and I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s their anniversary. I wonder what they\u2019re going to do.\u2019 And it was kind of just another day almost. Another day of knocking out things for the kids.\u201d\nKelce was quick to explain that his parents\u2019 wedding anniversary was not overlooked out of neglect. \u201cI\u2019m sure my father probably did something, \u2019cause he\u2019s always been very good at making sure we celebrate our mother when it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and all that. He still to this day will text, like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s your mom\u2019s birthday coming up. Don\u2019t forget about it,\u2019 \u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut at the same time, I never saw the romance of it all. A lot of friends I grew up with shared that. The handful of my friends whose parents are still together and still thriving\u2014those are situations I would love to have. Not that I think my parents dealt with it the wrong way or anything like that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more so, if we\u2019re gonna start this and do it, why not try and do it to last forever? Not just in a \u2018It\u2019s just for the kids\u2019 aspect.\u201d\nNow, sitting with him in the golf club lounge, its windows streaked with rain, I remind him of this story and ask how he and Swift\u2014also two very career-oriented people with unrelenting schedules\u2014manage to keep their romance from waning.\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m with her, it feels like we\u2019re just regular people,\u201d he says, not exactly answering the question. It might not need answering yet; they are only two years in. But he goes on: \u201cWhen there is not a camera on us, we\u2019re just two people that are in love. It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of\u2026. It happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\u201d\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.\u201d\nTalking about Swift, Kelce brings up the question of his legacy. Early in his career, he says, he was motivated by the stats and records that would be attached to his name but, \u201cnowadays, I just want to be respected and loved by the people that I\u2019m surrounded by in my work. I want to leave it better than where it was when I started. And I see her having those same values.\u201d\nWhile Kelce does not discuss the timing or terms of his NFL exit, he says he has been thinking about what his life looks like when he\u2019s done playing. He\u2019s now in the last year of his contract, but, unlike many who have been in his position, he does not necessarily need to take a team-friendly deal or grind it out in a new city. He has built his own media enterprise, one that benefits from the fascination with his relationship with Swift but is in no way dependent on it. Whatever he does next, he will begin from the starting point of, roughly speaking, the largest pop cultural platform in modern American history. What will it be?\nKelce describes a process not of relentlessly upward ambition, but of a curious searching, an improvisational trial and error similar to how he mastered route running. \u201cI know to stay away from a few things that I dabbled in early,\u201d he says. There are still a couple years on the New Heights agreement. He\u2019s got an investment in some Missouri car washes, family businesses that invest in their local communities. \u201cThe whole \u2018teaming up\u2019 aspect is something that I\u2019ll always kind of desire,\u201d he says. He\u2019s enjoyed acting, and finds developing his on-camera skills satisfying. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know if I\u2019ll take it and run with it when I\u2019m done playing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know that I want to stay around the football world as a profession and then dabble in other areas as well.\u201d When he looks around at his fellow former players, he admires people like ESPN\u2019s Pat McAfee, who are \u201cmaking it fun.\u201d\n\u201cI think there is a happy medium,\u201d he says. Kelce seems to be looking for the pieces of a life that will satisfy his abundant passion and drive but also allow him to remain being the happiest guy in the fucking world all the time. The secret, he thinks, is balance. \u201cI do want to have free time. I do want to have the ability to be around my family. I don\u2019t want to get too busy to where I\u2019m traveling all over the world and I\u2019m not present at home.\u201d\nA lot of players take years to figure this out after they\u2019ve hung it up, if they ever do. Kelce is way ahead. Quietly wise. Consider it yet another Travis Moment: What he\u2019s experienced of fame and influence so far, he explains, just makes him appreciate where he comes from all the more. \u201cThere is an easier and a better way of life,\u201d he says. \u201cA more fun way to live.\u201d\nSean Manning is the publisher of Simon & Schuster.\nA version of this story originally appeared in the September 2025 issue of GQ with the title \u201cHow Travis Kelce Spent His Summer Vacation\u201d\nThis story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can\u2019t-miss story every weekday.

      "text": "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.\n\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\nThe suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.\nA spokesman for Balelo\u2019s agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.\n\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\nOhtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team.\nA five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.\nInvestment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn.\nIt called Ohtani \u201cJapan\u2019s Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.\n\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\u201d\nThe suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\u201d\n\u201cThis partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\u201d the investment brochure said. \u201cWe see Shohei Ohtani\u2019s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\u201d\nThe suit said Balelo \u201cquickly became a disruptive force,\u201d threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren\u2019t made.\n\u201cKingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo\u2019s every whim,\u201d the suit said. \u201cOver time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\u201d\nLast month, in what the suit called \u201ca coordinated ambush,\u201d Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.\n\u201cKingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\u201d the suit said. \u201cPlaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\u201d"

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in.
