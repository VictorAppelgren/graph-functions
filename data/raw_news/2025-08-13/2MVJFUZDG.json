      "text": "Bless this house: are empty churches ripe for residential conversion?\nWhen Cristiana Pe\u00f1a and Nick Porter began house-hunting in New York State in 2021, they were open-minded about their prospects. Pe\u00f1a has a background in historic preservation, and both expected to be able to work from home.\n\u201cBut at every turn we were just getting priced out,\u201d explained Pe\u00f1a, the director of social media for CIRCA Old Houses, the media company affiliated with Cheap Old Houses, which is a popular newsletter and HGTV show, among other things.\nFinally, they had an epiphany. \u201cWell, if we're taking the \u2018handcuffs off\u2019 geographically speaking, if I'm going to live in the middle of nowhere, I want it to be my dream house,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cAnd I'd always dreamed of living in a non-traditional something, whether it used to be a schoolhouse or a general store or a fire station or a church. So I was like, if we're gonna really go for it, I\u2019m all in.\u201d\nFour years later, the couple are the proud owners of \u201cWelsh Hall,\u201d a former church that dates back to the 1790s and which had been vacant for a few decades. It\u2019s been a \u201clearning curve,\u201d Pe\u00f1a told USA TODAY, and an expensive one \u2013 but the beauty of the building and its historical significance have been worth it.\nAs church attendance declines and the housing market gets tighter, Pe\u00f1a and Porter\u2019s path may seem increasingly promising. There are plenty of vacant houses of worship around the country, but there\u2019s also a lot to consider before taking the leap (of faith).\nA 'tipping point' for vacant churches\nAs recently as 1999, 70% of Americans responding to a Gallup poll said they belonged to a church, synagogue, or mosque. But by 2020, that number had fallen to just 47%. One estimate suggests that as many as 100,000 houses of worship could be closed over the next several years.\nStephen Ferrandi is the founder and broker of PraiseBuildings, a Maryland-based religious building brokerage.\n\u201c20 years ago when we first started, I said there's going to be a tipping point and you're going to see a lot of churches hit the market, but I didn't know what it was going to be,\u201d Ferrandi said in an interview. \u201cTurns out it was COVID.\u201d\nThe majority of the houses of worship PraiseBuildings brokers are sold by one congregation to another, primarily newer immigrant groups. Ferrandi describes what may be a long path before congregations get to that point:\n\u201cIt's just not sustainable,\" he said. \"Honestly, they probably should have closed 30 years ago when they first started having the problems. The problem that everybody ran into was nobody wanted to make the decision to close the church.\u201d\nDespite the opportunity these vacant churches represent, there are plenty of potential pitfalls, as anyone familiar with fixer-uppers may expect.\n\u201cAll the pieces have to come together,\u201d said Bill Skubik, founder of Michigan-based Religious Real Estate.\nCan churches and other religious buildings be residences?\nMost older churches for sale have one extremely wide-open space and exceptionally tall ceilings. In many cases, houses of worship have few bathrooms \u2013 and perhaps none of them full \u2013 and either a small, rudimentary kitchen, or a giant commercial-scale one.\nThere can be some charm in that: Glen Jackson, who owns two churches in the metropolitan Pittsburgh area, likens the blank slate of a historic church to the industrial loft buildings made into cool residences a few decades ago.\nAnd as Elizabeth Finkelstein, co-founder of CIRCA Old Houses, puts it, \u201cyou will have the coolest house in town.\u201d\nStill, many of them may require drastic overhauls to make them feel more like homes, and many will need expensive updates to plumbing, heating and electrical work, and perhaps a new roof.\nFinancing a church renovation\nNo matter the specific circumstances, buying a church that needs to be renovated to serve as a home will likely require nontraditional financing, according to people who spoke to USA TODAY.\nPe\u00f1a and Porter got a traditional mortgage for the purchase of the church, and are taking out construction loans for renovations as they go. Churches can often be bought for far less than houses: Jackson is currently selling one of his for only $60,000. So other owners have paid cash for the building, as it can be challenging to take out small mortgages, and then borrowed funds for the rehab work.\nIn many cases, church buildings may have a separate building on the grounds, such as a minister\u2019s home, which can be occupied while the construction work is ongoing, and may also be rented for income later on, once the main building is habitable.\nNotably, sources caution that it may take work to get appraisals and homeowners insurance because of the lack of comparable properties. Skubik offers another consideration: if the church is in an area of lower property values, you may want to consider how much work you put into the renovations so the completed property doesn\u2019t have a drastically higher value that's completely out of place in its neighborhood.\nFinally, if you\u2019re counting on financial assistance from the community or a nonprofit or the government, make sure you have it nailed down \u2013 a lesson Glen Jackson, who believed local government officials had the same goals he did, learned the hard way.\nBuying a home with spirit\nIn some suburban or rural areas, churches may sit on land that\u2019s surrounded by cemeteries. Consider how you\u2019ll feel if people come to visit, but more importantly make sure you have a plan for construction projects or infrastructure that has to enter the building through that land.\nOn a more positive note, you may find that your neighbors and others in the community can share stories about the history of your home. It may even be an anchor of the community.\n\"You kind of become a local hero because you've preserved an anchor of the town,\" Finkelstein said. \"A building like that, really (is) kind of the centerpiece of the community.\u201d\nEmbrace the challenge of converting a church\nPerhaps the best advice comes from Pe\u00f1a, who says anyone buying a \u201cnon-traditional building\u201d for a home should embrace its essence.\n\u201cI get it that changes need to happen to make it livable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the way that we're making our mark is as minimal as possible, so that hopefully it will forever be the thing that attracted us to it in the first place. So I would encourage people, if they're going to look for a church, be prepared to keep it churchy.\u201d"

      "text": "Ready to enroll in Medicare? Here's why you may want to wait on Social Security.\nSitting tight a little longer could work to your benefit.\nMany Americans get health insurance through their employers. So when they retire, they're forced to find another solution. And for a lot of older Americans, that solution is Medicare.\nMedicare eligibility typically begins at 65. You can actually enroll a few months ahead of your 65th birthday to ensure that you have coverage in place at that point.\nYou may be aware that if you're old enough to get Medicare, it means you're also old enough to sign up for Social Security. But here's why you may want to wait on Social Security if you're signing up for Medicare at 65.\nYou don't want to slash your monthly benefits\nMany people end up kicking off retirement with limited savings. If that's you, you may end up pretty reliant on Social Security to cover your expenses.\nAnd even if you have decent savings, your money could run out. So it's important to try to get as much Social Security as you can.\nTo that end, you may not want to claim Social Security at 65 if you're signing up for Medicare at that point. If you were born in 1960 or later, your full retirement age for Social Security purposes is 67. Claiming benefits ahead of full retirement age will reduce them permanently, leaving you with less retirement income for life.\nThe earliest you can file for Social Security is at age 62. In that case, you're looking at about a 30% reduction in your monthly checks compared to waiting until full retirement age.\nIf you file for Social Security at 65 in conjunction with your Medicare enrollment, you're looking at a smaller reduction -- about 13.34%. But remember, that's a reduction you'll face every single month you collect Social Security. So you may be better off enrolling in Medicare at 65 but waiting at least a bit longer before filing for Social Security.\nYou don't need Social Security to get Medicare\nOne big misconception about Medicare is that you have to be enrolled in Social Security to get that health coverage. If you're getting Social Security, you'll have your monthly premiums for Medicare Part B paid directly out of your benefits. But that doesn't mean you must be on Social Security to get Medicare.\nIf you're not collecting monthly benefits, all it means is that you'll have to pay your Medicare premiums another way. And you can set up automatic payments so you don't have to think about them.\nYou may even want to claim Social Security past full retirement age\nNot only might 65 be premature to claim Social Security, but you should also know that delaying your filing beyond full retirement age could result in a huge reward. For each year you hold off on Social Security past that point, up until age 70, your benefits get an 8% boost.\nThat boost is a permanent one. And the extra money could do you a world of good once you're no longer actively earning an income.\nAll told, it's important to understand how Medicare and Social Security work together before signing up for either. But you should know that being on Social Security is not a requirement for Medicare enrollment. And if you're signing up for Medicare at 65, waiting on Social Security could mean setting yourself up for less financial stress throughout your retirement.\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

      "text": "Capital One $425 million class action settlement reached: See if you qualify\nIf you had a Capital One 360 savings account between Sept. 2019 and June 2025, you may be eligible to receive payment as part of a $425 million settlement.\nAccording to a notice filed in the United States federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Capital One customers filed a class action lawsuit against the bank in 2024. Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) also sued Capital One, alleging the company froze its rate at a low level for years, despite increasing national rates. As a result, customers were cheated out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments, according to the Bureau.\nIn a statement, the Bureau said Capital One marketed its 360 Savings account as \u201chigh interest\u201d with a variable rate that was \u201cone of the nation\u2019s best,\" and that consumers would earn much more interest than the average savings or money market account. The Bureau called these representations \"false or otherwise misleading.\"\nThe CFPB dropped the lawsuit in February, but Capital One has agreed to pay $425 million in a separate class action lawsuit settlement.\nHere's what you need to know about the class action settlement.\nCapital One accusations\nCapital One advertised its 360 Savings account as its high-interest savings account, Kiplinger, a finance news outlet, reported, adding that it later froze interest rates on that account at 0.3%. At the same time, rates on its newer account called \"360 Performance Savings\" increased to a peak of 4.3% in 2022 after the Federal Reserve did a rapid series of rate hikes.\nCustomers of the older savings account, the Capital One 360 savings account, allegedly weren't notified of the new and higher-earning account.\nWho qualifies for payment?\nCurrent and former customers who maintained a Capital One 360 Savings account between Sept. 18, 2019, and June 16, 2025, qualify for payments.\nHow much will customers receive?\nAccount holders will receive payments totalling what they \"would have earned if their 360 Savings account(s) had paid the interest rate then applicable to the 360 Performance Savings account,\u201d according to the settlement.\nThe remaining payments will go towards customers who still have a 360 savings account. Their accounts will earn an interest rate that is \"at least two times the national average rate for savings deposit accounts as calculated by the FDIC,\" the settlement stated.\nThe settlement awaits court approval, with a hearing slated for Nov. 6. The deadline to submit a claim or write to the court objecting to the settlement is Oct. 2."

      "text": "Spirit Airlines could go out of business. What would that mean for travelers?\n- Spirit Airlines disclosed in an SEC filing that it may not be able to continue operating within the next year.\n- The airline cited \"adverse market conditions,\" including increased domestic capacity and weak demand, as contributing factors to its financial struggles.\n- Experts warn that the loss of Spirit Airlines could lead to increased airfares in the markets it serves.\nSpirit Airlines is warning investors that it could be forced to go out of business in the next 12 months as it struggles to regain profitability after emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year.\nExecutives wrote in the airline's quarterly filing on Aug. 11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company is unsure if it will be able to meet minimum cash-on-hand requirements put in place as part of the end of its bankruptcy.\n\"The Company has continued to be affected by adverse market conditions, including elevated domestic capacity and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a challenging pricing environment. As a result, the Company continues to experience challenges and uncertainties in its business operations and expects these trends to continue for at least the remainder of 2025,\" the filing said.\nThe document went on to note steps that Spirit Airlines is taking to try to boost profitability, including restructuring its route network and adding more premium seating onboard because premium leisure travel continues to see relatively high demand across the airline industry.\nSpirit last month announced a plan to furlough 270 pilots in an effort to maintain its liquidity. The company said it is considering other efforts, including selling some of its aircraft and gate capacity to other airlines.\nStill, the airline warned, these steps may not be enough to keep it afloat.\n\"While it is the Company\u2019s goal to execute on these initiatives, there can be no assurance that such initiatives will be successful,\" the filing said. \"Management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued.\"\nFor travelers booked on Spirit, there is no immediate danger that their flights will not operate, but those with longer-term travel plans should, at least, consider buying travel insurance if their itinerary includes Spirit flights.\nExperts have said that the loss of Spirit Airlines in the U.S. aviation market would be a bad thing for travelers across the country \u2013 even those who never have or never will travel with the airline.\n\u201cThe (ultra low cost carriers) collectively are the fare leaders. It\u2019s in consumers\u2019 best interest for the budget airlines to stay in business and be successful businesses,\" Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research, a travel industry analytics firm, previously told USA TODAY. He and other analysts have repeatedly pointed out that low-cost, low-fare airlines typically drive down ticket prices when they enter a new market, meaning even full-service airlines often reduce their prices to compete for customers.\nIf Spirit goes away, experts warn, it's very likely that ticket prices could rise in the markets it serves.\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Is college worth it? See which majors offer the highest return on your investment.\nAmericans currently owe nearly $1.8 trillion in student loan debt, but despite rising costs, going to college is a decision that can give you one of the best returns on your investment.\nThe size of that return, however, can depend on what you major in. Degrees in engineering, math and computers, and business and economics provide the largest annual return, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nOn average, a college graduate earns $32,000 more in a year than a worker with only a high school diploma, according to a new report from Federal Reserve economists.\nThe payoff on a college degree stands near its all-time high, the economists report in an April 16 post from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If you think of college as an investment, the return on that investment has held steady over the last three decades at 12% to 13% a year.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to get that return on my savings account,\u201d said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, a nonprofit that represents college leaders.\nThis year's graduates are eager to earn, with 62% reporting the most important aspect of a job is a good salary, according to Monster\u2019s 2025 State of the Graduate Report. Of 2025 graduates surveyed, only 12% said they'd be willing to accept an unpaid internship and 49% said they would never accept a job that doesn't come with a competitive salary and benefits, up 5% from last year.\nThe majority of new graduates surveyed plan to pursue careers in some traditionally lucrative fields including business, healthcare, computer technology, and finance.\nHowever, their ability to land jobs in those industries and earn a high paycheck can depend on what they studied and how long they stayed in school. Career experts agree dream jobs and large salaries don't always come right away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard world out there for a lot of people who are not just highly educated, but have built these careers and have a trusted resume of previous experience. It\u2019s hard for them to get a job,\u201d Emily Levine, executive vice president at recruitment firm Career Group Companies, told USA TODAY. \u201cIf you want to get a job somewhat quickly and start contributing and earning money, it most likely won\u2019t be your dream job. And that\u2019s okay.\"\nThe college salary boost rises throughout a career\nIf the goal of college is to earn more money, then the New York Fed report suggests academia is doing a good job. The analysis found that a typical college graduate earns about $80,000 a year, compared with $47,000 for a worker with a high school diploma. The college wage premium tends to grow throughout a career.\n\u201cJudging the value of a college degree is not about your first job. It\u2019s about the advantage you get over your working life,\u201d said Jaison Abel, head of microeconomics at the New York Fed.\nCollege isn\u2019t worth it for everyone. The return on investment is lower for students who take more than four years to finish, the economists found. Some majors yield a higher annual return than others: Around 18% for math, computers and engineering; 14% for health sciences; and 8% for liberal arts.\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost no wage premium for the bottom 25% of graduates,\u201d those with the lowest lifetime earnings, said Richard Deitz, an economic policy advisor at the New York Fed.\nMany Americans feel college is too expensive. A 2024 report from the New America think tank found that more than 80% of Americans think the cost of college is the biggest factor that stops students from enrolling.\n\u201cI think that when people talk about, \u2018Is college worth it?\u2019, what they\u2019re upset about is the cost,\u201d said Phillip Levine, a Wellesley College economist who studies college pricing. \u201cThey have this impression in their head of skyrocketing college costs, and they don\u2019t have an impression of skyrocketing benefits.\u201d\nA crisis of confidence in higher education\nThe New York Fed report comes at a moment of crisis in higher education. The Trump administration is threatening billions of dollars in federal funding to elite universities over their policies on diversity, equity and inclusion.\nTrump officials also accuse the higher education sector of abusing the student loan system, invoking perennial complaints about runaway tuition and spiraling debt. In a April 21 Wall Street Journal op-ed, new Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the industry of \u201chiking tuition and piling up multibillion-dollar endowments while students graduate six figures in the red.\u201d\nThe DEI broadsides resonate with Trump\u2019s base. Half of Republicans have \u201clittle or no\u201d confidence in higher education, compared with 12% of Democrats, according to Gallup polling.\nAmong those who lack faith in academia, the most common complaint is that colleges harbor political agendas. Concerns run from liberal bias to rising costs to lackluster career preparation.\nA 2024 report from Pew Research Center found that only 22% of Americans believe college is worth the cost for a student who must take out loans. Only 1 in 4 said a college degree is very important for getting a good-paying job.\nCollege 'sticker shock' scares many Americans\nAcademic leaders say Americans focus too much on the sticker price of college, which now exceeds $70,000 a year in tuition and fees at the priciest schools.\n\u201cThe sticker price is a number that every college and university needs to post on their web page by law. It\u2019s the easiest number to find,\u201d Levine said.\nBut few students pay the sticker price. The actual price of college for most students is much lower.\nThe average net price in tuition and fees for an in-state student at a four-year public college plummeted by 40% in a decade, after inflation, from $4,140 in 2014-15 to an estimated $2,480 in 2024-25, according to a recent report from the College Board.\nAt private nonprofit colleges, average tuition and fees have dwindled from $18,680 in 2014 to an estimated $16,510 in 2024, after accounting for inflation and aid.\nAs for student loans: Roughly half of students at public universities completed their degrees without debt in the 2022-23 academic year, compared with about two-fifths of students a decade earlier, the College Board found.\nAmong all graduates with loans, the balance averaged $29,300 in the 2022-23 academic year, down from $34,800 a decade earlier, adjusted for inflation.\n\u201cThe student loan crisis is overblown,\u201d Mitchell of the American Council on Education said.\nColleges need to communicate better on price\nMitchell, Levine and others say colleges need to do a better job of communicating with the public about price.\nFor many years, Levine said, academic leaders have been reluctant to share the sort of data compiled by the College Board: The actual price of attendance for a typical student, based on family income and wealth.\nThat stance is changing. Consider Princeton University: Annual tuition, fees, housing and food at Princeton averages $82,650. But the average student receives $72,000 in grant aid. Thus, the average net cost of a year at Princeton is $10,650.\nPrinceton offers those numbers in plain-spoken fashion on its website. Many other colleges do not.\nAnother selective school, Washington University in Saint Louis, has partnered with Levine to offer an \u201cInstant Net Price Estimator,\u201d which gives a ballpark estimate of college costs based on household income and siblings attending college. Levine provides similar estimates for other schools on a site called MyinTuition.\n\u201cWe need somebody smarter than I to figure out a way to communicate price that is encouraging rather than discouraging,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t gotten there yet.\u201d\nContributing: Rachel Barber"

      "text": "These are the wealthiest suburbs of America's biggest cities\nNew York\u2019s wealthiest suburb is Scarsdale, a name long linked to affluence. Wellesley, the most well-heeled Boston suburb, is known for academia. McLean, a high-earner enclave outside the nation\u2019s capital, houses diplomats and spies.\nFewer Americans might recognize the name of Hinsdale, Chicago\u2019s wealthiest suburb. And some non-Texans might struggle to differentiate between University Park and West University Place, the most affluent suburbs, respectively, of metropolitan Dallas and Houston.\nA new report from the personal finance site GOBankingRates identifies the wealthiest suburbs of America\u2019s 50 largest metropolitan areas in 2025. It\u2019s a spinoff from an earlier analysis, which listed the wealthiest suburbs in America.\nSome of the names are familiar. The nation\u2019s wealthiest suburb is Scarsdale, a storied suburb in New York\u2019s leafy Westchester County. New York state, California and Texas are home to eight of the 10 wealthiest suburbs in America, Census data show.\nOther affluent suburbs attract little attention outside their own regions. A \u201cJeopardy!\u201d contestant might be hard-pressed, for example, to identify Alamo as the wealthiest suburb of San Francisco.\n\"I wasn't really familiar with Milton, Georgia, until the survey,\" said Rudri Patel, a senior financial expert at GOBankingRates, referring to the wealthiest Atlanta suburb.\n\"I think affluence is moving beyond stereotyped geographic regions,\" such as Beverly Hills, she said. \"It doesn't need to be 90210.\"\nTo compile the report, researchers found the suburb with the highest mean household income for each of the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Communities of fewer than 5,000 households were omitted.\nHere are the wealthiest suburbs of the largest cities\nHere, then, are the wealthiest suburbs of the 20 largest U.S. metropolitan areas.\nNew York: Scarsdale.

      "text": "Iconic US film company Kodak warns it may go out of business\nThe American company credited with revolutionizing amateur photography is warning it could go out of business after more than 130 years.\nThe Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak Co. offered a bleak picture of its financials in earnings reports and filings, tracking a second quarter loss and sending shares tumbling in early trading Tuesday, Aug. 12.\nThe iconic brand said in Monday, Aug. 11 government filings that there is \"substantial doubt\" about the company\u2019s ability to continue, as it faces more than $470 million in debt and slashes its pension plan in an attempt to remain afloat.\n\"Kodak has debt coming due within twelve months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,\" the company said in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nKodak became one of the most iconic American companies in the late 19th century with the introducton of the Kodak #1 camera in 1888, credited with making photography accessible to the everyday person. Though it rose to prominence for its film photography products, it struggled to adapt to the changing industry as digital imaging took over, with the company filing for bankruptcy in 2012. In recent years, it has pursued specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals.\nTariffs had no 'material impact'\nIn its most recent earnings report, Kodak said its consolidated revenues were $263 million at the end of the quarter on June 30, a decrease of $4 million since the same period last year. Gross profit decreased 12% compared to last year's second quarter end, Kodak disclosed, and its cash balance sits at $155 million, marking a loss of just under 23% since the end of December.\nJim Continenza, Kodak\u2019s Executive Chairman and CEO, said tariffs have not had a \"material impact\" on its businesses, noting the domestic production of many of its products such as printing plates, film, inkjet presses and inks and pharmaceutical ingredients.\nWhat's next for Kodak?\nKodak's chief financial officer David Bullwinkle said in the company's Aug. 11 statement it plans to focus on its advanced chemicals and materials sector moving forward, and said the cut to its retirement program is going toward paying down its debt.\nHe said the company expects to \"have a clear understanding\" by Friday, Aug. 15 of how it will meet its debt obligations.\n\"For the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on reducing costs today and converting our investments into long-term growth,\" Bullwinkle said.\nThe company was founded by George Eastman in 1889 and renamed a few years later to the Eastman Kodak Company. Eastman's Kodak Brownie camera introduced in 1900 made photography accessible to everyday Americans, later introducing color versions in the 1920s and 1930s, and offering the world's first digital camera in 1975.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Are you being \u2018quiet fired\u2019? Here\u2019s how to spot the signs\nYou might not be fired outright \u2014 but your employer could be quietly pushing you out. Quiet firing isn\u2019t a myth; it\u2019s a real and common phenomenon. A 2025 HRTech survey of more than 1,000 U.S. managers revealed that 53% of employers admit to using quiet firing tactics, and nearly half of 20,000 people surveyed on LinkedIn in 2022 had seen it in action or experienced it themselves.\nQuiet firing is when an employer deliberately makes a job so unrewarding, isolating or stagnant that the employee feels pressured to quit, rather than being formally terminated.\n\u201cQuiet firing is not new; it\u2019s just getting more attention,\u201d explains Edwin Aiwazian, the managing attorney at Lawyers for Justice.\nWe spoke with six HR and career experts to break down the five most common signs of quiet firing and how to protect your career if it\u2019s happening to you.\n5 clear signs of quiet firing\nQuiet firing might start as being excluded from meetings you were once a key member of, cutting responsibilities or stalling promotions with no explanation.\n\u201cYou will have responsibilities pulled back, the support that may have been there disappears, your career growth will stall, and the hope is that you will eventually quit,\u201d says Jason Walker, Psy.D., Ph.D., the program director and an associate professor of Industrial-Organizational and Applied Psychology at Adler University.\nExclusion from meetings\nSuddenly uninvited from meetings you were once a key member of? This is one of the most common signs of quiet firing, and one many of our experts report as a serious red flag that you are being passively let go.\nThis may be as obvious as being excluded from meetings, but you may also notice projects being carried out without you or abandoned communication threads that were previously active daily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s avoidance masked as management,\u201d Walker explains.\nShifting responsibilities\nIf your workload suddenly changes \u2014 whether you\u2019re overloaded with unrealistic goals or sidelined with meaningless projects \u2014 it could be a sign of quiet firing.\n\u201cSimilar to bullying behaviors, you may be assigned unreasonable workloads or left with unclear expectations that feel like a setup,\u201d says Walker. \u201cWhile this is a more aggressive form of quiet firing, it does happen.\u201d\nWende Smith, head of people operations at BambooHR, agrees: \u201cShifting responsibilities isn\u2019t always a sign of quiet firing, but how your manager goes about it can be telling.\u201d She says if you ask for the reason behind the shift and get vague or no answers, that\u2019s a red flag.\nSupport diminishes\nA quieter tactic is pulling back on support. This diminished support may leave you feeling abandoned or alone, making it more challenging to complete your projects.\n\u201cIt can feel like whiplash for the employee who is suddenly left with the weight of an unreasonable workload and feeling like they just can\u2019t hack it in their role,\u201d says Smith. When that environment becomes unbearable, the employee leaves.\nDevelopment stops\nDid your one-on-ones once discuss your future at the company, but are now quick and pointless? A pause or change in your career development is a clear sign of quiet firing. You may receive vague responses or no response at all when inquiring about career growth or promotion timelines.\n\u201dYour career growth comes to a standstill, and you are passed over for promotions and raises for no apparent reason,\u201d says Walker. Sometimes, this can drag on for years.\nPolicy-driven quiet firing\nReturn to office (RTO) has been used as a form of quiet firing. As employees are expected to return to the office, many decide to leave the company instead. While many believe this was an unexpected result, it may have been more targeted than not.\nWhen looking into quiet firing, \u201ca troubling trend that our research uncovered is using RTO as a quiet-firing tactic.\u201d The data that Smith\u2019s team at BambooHR uncovered showed that 37% of managers, directors and executives believe that layoffs occurred because fewer employees than expected quit during the RTO process, and 25% of VP and C-suite executives and 18% of HR professionals hoped for voluntary turnover during RTO.\n\u201cThe danger here, like any other quiet firing trend, is that it can have a bad ripple effect, damaging morale and culture, which is key to retaining your top talent,\u201d says Smith. Further research showed that nearly 45% of employees who have been through an RTO report losing valuable colleagues.\nWhy quiet firing happens\nQuiet firing often stems from a desire to avoid costs and risks. \u201cIt\u2019s either small in an attempt to weed out low performers or larger to avoid layoffs,\u201d says Wende Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s gained more prominence lately due to the rise in quiet quitting.\u201d\nAvoiding formal termination also helps companies sidestep severance packages and legal risk. \u201cBecause employers operate under increased legal and reputational scrutiny, they take the easy way and push employees out,\u201d adds Arianny Mercedes, the founder of a career and workplace strategy firm Revamped.\nRemote and hybrid work have also made quiet firing easier to execute. Joe Galvin, the chief research officer at CEO peer network Vistage Worldwide, Inc., says, \u201cManagers can now avoid direct interaction with employees, making disengagement and subtle exclusion simpler to execute.\u201d Without daily in-person contact, it\u2019s easier for employees to fade into the background.\nNot all quiet firing is malicious. Some managers simply lack the training or resources to have honest performance conversations. Mercedes notes that many leaders \u201cfeel uncomfortable initiating honest conversations\u201d and are unsure of the best way to address performance or strategic fit \u2014 so they default to letting employees drift out.\nI\u2019m being quiet fired, what can I do?\nQuiet firing doesn\u2019t always mean your job is over, but it\u2019s a clear sign to reassess your situation. \u201cEmployees need to advocate for themselves,\u201d says attorney Aiwazian. \u201cYou are always within your right to ask questions and open that channel of communication with your leaders.\u201d\nStart by voicing your concerns directly. Ask for clear expectations, define your goals with your manager, and align on what success looks like. \u201cIt\u2019s only over if you choose to stay silent,\u201d adds Brandon Dawson, the chairman and co-founder of 10X Health System. \u201cIf you\u2019re sensing signs of quiet firing, don\u2019t retreat. Lean in.\u201d\nAt the same time, protect yourself. Quiet firing isn\u2019t always illegal, but it can be \u2014 especially if tied to discrimination or retaliation. Keep detailed records: save emails, track changes to your role, and request feedback in writing. Store all documentation on your personal computer so you have access if you need to take further action.\nFinal thoughts: Quiet firing is not a result of your performance\n\u201cQuiet firing speaks more to a failure of leadership and toxic workplace culture \u2014 not performance,\u201d says Walker.\nQuiet firing is a well-known phenomenon, but according to Walker, not one that is well studied. With more stories and shared experiences, hopefully, more researchers will begin to study this trend and find a worthy solution. Until then, our experts advise that the best defense is to identify the signs early and take action before your options become limited.\nWhat is USA TODAY Top Workplaces 2025?\nDo you work for a great company?
