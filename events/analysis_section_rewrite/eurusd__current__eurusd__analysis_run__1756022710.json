      "feedback": "Overall: decent 0–3 week framing but it needs a tighter, fully sourced causal chain, explicit levels, and a concrete monitor list anchored to the five critical IDs. Edits to reach world‑class: (1) tighten the causal chain by tying Powell’s Jackson Hole dovishness (73G2X5JK2) to immediate risk‑on repricing, i.e., markets pricing a Sept 25bp cut and a softer dollar, with the two‑year yield/yields and the Russell 2000 reacting as observed (73G2X5JK2); explicitly label this as the immediate driver and show the direction if data stay data‑dependent. (2) Quantify near‑term catalysts with exact signals from sources: the tariff/IEEPA debate and court actions (47020006) and payrolls/JOLTS data (46817802) as the reinforcing/contending forces for the Sep move; also note the Trump‑Putin dynamic (K8PPBLI93) as a geopolitical risk overlay. (3) Add explicit monitoring thresholds drawn from sources: S&P 500 up ~1.5% on Powell day and near record highs; Russell 2000 +~4%; Dow moves around ±0.5–0.8% on tariff news (47020006); payroll prints: July payrolls +73k, unemployment 4.2%, wages 3.9% (46817802); gold/Bitcoin relief trades and a weaker dollar (73G2X5JK2). (4) Integrate the hardware/tech‑cycle thread with concrete knobs from HG440LJN4: Ryzen Z2 Extreme delivered only a modest uplift versus Z1 and €999 price signaling limited near‑term upside in the high‑end handheld cycle; note MSI Claw A8/Z2 Extreme as a potential drag to hype/semis sentiment if expectations aren’t met, and the Lunar Lake/Intel AI+ previews (HG440LJN4) as downstream catalysts. (5) Reconcile conflicts by framing a two‑path scenario: if Powell’s dovish path holds and tariff policy stabilizes, risk assets stay bid; if tariff/the court path reverses or geopolitics worsen (Trump‑Putin), expect a quick risk‑off unwind; cite (73G2X5JK2)(47020006)(46817802)(K8PPBLI93). (6) Elevate structure to a crisp, monitor‑driven narrative: base case, upside, and downside with explicit gating events (SEP FOMC, IEEPA ruling, payrolls). (7) Use precise, sourced “levels” rather than generic statements: anchor every claim to the cited IDs, and avoid extrapolations beyond what the articles show (e.g., avoid level forecasts not present in the sources). (8) Improve coverage: ensure the full set of critical sources is referenced in the body (73G2X5JK2 for Powell, 47020006 for tariff/news flows, 46817802 for jobs, HG440LJN4 for Claw A8/Z2 Extreme dynamics, K8PPBLI93 for Trump‑Putin context). (9) Remove any duplicative or hedged language and replace with crisp predicates: what moves where, when, and why, then what to watch next (monitor SEP decision, tariff court, payroll revisions, and next wave of AI/SoC news). (10) Deliver as a single, compact read: sequence the 0–3 week drivers, then catalysts, then levels/monitor list, then invalidate/invalidations, all tied to the five IDs. This will tighten causality, sharpen actionable inferences, and align fully with the SECTION FOCUS.",
