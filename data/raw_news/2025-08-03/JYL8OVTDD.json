  "title": "1 Reason to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE)",
  "description": "The original meme coin has a feature not everybody knows about.",
  "content": "\u2022 Dogecoin has a fixed issuance of 5 billion new coins per year.\n\u2022 Its inflationary system may prevent hoarding and encourage the use of Dogecoin as a payment method.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Dogecoin \u203a\n\nThanks to the recent bull market, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is up 49% over the last month. And even though most meme coins don't have much staying power, Dogecoin is one of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, more than a decade after its launch.\n\nThe reason meme coins usually don't last is that they have no real value or use case. As surprising as it may sound, Dogecoin has a unique feature that could make it useful.\n\nDogecoin has a fixed amount of inflation. Every year, 5 billion coins are released as block rewards for Dogecoin miners. There's no maximum supply, but the inflation rate gradually decreases because the number of coins created per year stays the same while the existing supply grows larger.\n\nFor example, the current circulating supply for Dogecoin is about 150 billion coins. The inflation rate this year will be a little over 3%. In 10 years, the supply will be up to 200 billion, and the inflation rate will be 2.5%.\n\nThe diminished inflation rate means that for the next several decades, Dogecoin will have a fairly normal, healthy amount of inflation. New coins won't flood the market and lower the value. But since the supply is still increasing, there's less motivation to hoard Dogecoin, like there is with some big cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) being the most famous example. With a fixed maximum supply of 21 million, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that people hold because they expect the value to increase.\n\nDogecoin's website argues that this gives it a more \"utilitarian and practical place in the economy than other cryptocurrencies.\" It's well-suited to work as a legitimate currency, and not just a store of value. Some big names in the crypto community seem to agree, as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have both expressed support for Dogecoin as a payment method.\n\nWhile Dogecoin could theoretically work as a digital currency, there are downsides. It's volatile, and it's only accepted at about 2,000 merchants right now. If you decide to buy Dogecoin, only invest what you'd be comfortable losing to avoid taking on too much risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dogecoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dogecoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dogecoin wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",

      "text": "When you first hear about cryptocurrency mining, it sounds too good to be true. By using your computing equipment to verify transactions on a blockchain, you'll earn crypto rewards. It doesn't require much effort on your part, so once you get it set up, it's passive income for you.\nBut there are some potential issues to know about, most notably that mining could cost you more than you earn if you don't plan ahead. To help with that, we're going to cover how to mine cryptocurrency and if it's still profitable in 2022.\nWhat is cryptocurrency mining?\nWhat is cryptocurrency mining?\nCryptocurrency mining is the way that proof-of-work cryptocurrencies validate transactions and mint new coins. It was the first method used that enabled cryptocurrencies to be decentralized. They function without a central governing body confirming their transactions.\nUnder the proof-of-work model, which was introduced with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), miners check transactions using computing devices that solve complex mathematical equations. By providing the correct answer, the miner has shown proof of doing work.\nThe first miner to get the correct answer wins the right to confirm a block of that cryptocurrency's transactions. When the block is confirmed, it's added to the cryptocurrency's blockchain, a distributed digital ledger of all its transactions.\nThe lucky miner also receives a block reward for the trouble of confirming the transactions. The block reward is a set amount of the cryptocurrency they're mining. The rewards usually come from new coins that have been minted and the cryptocurrency's transaction fees.\nTypes of cryptocurrency mining\nTypes of cryptocurrency mining\nThere are many ways to mine cryptocurrency. Here are the different types of cryptocurrency mining you can choose from:\n- ASIC mining: Mining using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). This type of device is made to mine a specific cryptocurrency. It's expensive, but it also typically provides the highest hash rate, meaning it offers more mining power.\n- GPU mining: Mining using one or more advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), commonly known as graphics cards. These also provide considerable mining power but at a somewhat high up-front cost.\n- CPU mining: Mining using a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Although this is the most accessible way to mine crypto, CPUs don't have nearly as much mining power as ASICs and GPUs. For that reason, profits from CPU mining are minimal.\n- Mining pools: Groups of miners who work together to mine crypto and share block rewards. Miners pay a small percentage of those block rewards as a pool fee.\n- Solo mining: Mining on your own. It's much harder to earn block rewards this way, so mining pools are often the better choice.\n- Cloud mining: Paying a company to mine crypto on your behalf with its own mining devices. Cloud mining requires a contract, and the terms almost always favor the company and not the miner.\nThe right type of mining depends on the type of cryptocurrency and how much you can afford to invest. In most cases, your best bet is to go with either ASIC mining or GPU mining and to join a mining pool.\nHow to mine crypto\nHow to mine crypto\nOnce you're ready to start mining crypto, here are the steps to follow.\n1. Choose a cryptocurrency to mine\nThere are many cryptocurrencies you can mine, but not all of them use this method to verify transactions. Specifically, you'll want to look for cryptocurrencies that use proof of work. Here are some suggestions:\n- Kadena (KDA 6.41%) is a cryptocurrency built for businesses and powering global financial systems. It's one of the more profitable cryptocurrencies when you mine it with an ASIC.\n- Ergo (CRYPTO:ERG) is a platform designed to provide an efficient way to implement financial contracts on blockchain. Because Ergo is resistant to ASIC mining, you can mine it using a GPU.\n- Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) is a meme coin. Although it started as a joke, it became extremely popular in 2021, and it's possible to make a profit mining it with an ASIC.\nOne notable cryptocurrency that I wouldn't recommend mining is Bitcoin. Because it's so popular and there are so many miners competing to earn rewards, it's extremely difficult to make a profit with Bitcoin mining.\n2. Buy your mining equipment\nAfter you've picked a cryptocurrency, start looking at ASICs or GPUs you can use to mine it. A CPU won't cut it in terms of mining power since you'll almost certainly make far less than $1 per day.\nTo compare mining devices, use a profitability calculator for the cryptocurrency you'll be mining. These calculators let you plug in a machine's hash rate and your electricity cost to see how much you'd make per day. Then you can use that information to estimate how long it would take to pay off the cost of the mining device.\n3. Set up a crypto wallet\nAs you mine cryptocurrency, you're going to need a crypto wallet to receive your rewards. Fortunately, this isn't hard to find.\nThe cryptocurrency's website will probably have recommendations on compatible wallets. For most cryptocurrencies, there are plenty of digital wallets that are available free of charge. When you've set up your wallet, you'll be able to generate an address where you can receive and safely store your cryptocurrency.\n4. Configure your mining device\nOnce you have your mining device, there are a couple of things to do to get it ready. First, download the mining software for the cryptocurrency. You should be able to find the software on the cryptocurrency's website.\nMake sure you set up your mining device in a safe location with the proper cooling. Mining devices can generate quite a bit of heat, and they can be a fire risk if you're not careful.\n5. Join a mining pool\nIt's possible to mine cryptocurrency on your own, but that's rarely a good approach. Earning block rewards is much harder when you're mining alone.\nFor that reason, most miners opt for mining pools. Since a mining pool has a group of miners who are combining their efforts, it's more likely that the pool gets chosen to validate a block and earn block rewards.\nIs cryptocurrency mining worth it?\nIs cryptocurrency mining worth it?\nCryptocurrency mining isn't worth it for the typical investor because it's so difficult to make a profit. For crypto enthusiasts, mining may be worthwhile as a hobby and a way to possibly earn some extra money.\nTo make reasonable money from crypto mining, you need an ASIC or a GPU. Many of the most popular choices cost $1,000 or more. Depending on the cryptocurrency you mine and how its price changes, breaking even on your mining device can take six months, a year, or longer. And these devices eventually become obsolete or break down.\nElectricity costs are another important consideration. Crypto mining is usually energy-intensive, and you won't make much money without cheap power.\nYou're probably better off using the money you planned to put in a mining device on a good cryptocurrency investment. That could be something as simple as buying the cryptocurrency you were planning to mine or checking out cryptocurrency stocks.\nIf you want to support your favorite cryptocurrency or you're willing to spend a lot of time maximizing profitability, mining is a viable option. However, most investors will likely find that mining just isn't worth the hassle."

      "text": "Meme coins have carved out a peculiar niche in the cryptocurrency market. Some blockchain networks don't have much of a business plan or long-term plans for usability in the real world. Instead, they sidestep traditional financial valuations almost entirely, deriving value from market messages or outright jokes.\nUnderstanding meme coins\nUnderstanding meme coins\nMeme coins are cryptocurrencies that originate from internet memes or have a humorous or viral aspect. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), which are backed by robust blockchain technologies and have clear utility in digital transactions and decentralized applications (dApps), meme coins often lack a specific purpose beyond the community and cultural value they hold.\nBlockchain\nThe first and most famous example, Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), was created as a joke in 2013 but has since gained significant popularity and market capitalization. It is based on the same blockchain code that runs the larger, more sincere Bitcoin cryptocurrency but with technical tweaks that make it less useful for real-world payments and storage of monetary value.\nMany newer meme coins don't run their own blockchain networks at all. Rather, they function as tokens supported by existing cryptosystems, such as Ethereum or Solana (CRYPTO:SOL).\nThis strategy makes it even easier to create a new token with a suitably silly marketing message wrapped in the data security and transaction efficiency of the underlying parent network. The technical details can be somebody else's problem.\nWhy meme coins matter\nWhy meme coins matter\nMeme coins spotlight the power of community and sentiment in the digital age. Their value is largely driven by social media, celebrity endorsements, and the broader meme culture that thrives on the internet.\nThis phenomenon underscores a shift in how value is perceived and created in the cryptocurrency space. While traditional assets are evaluated based on fundamentals or utility, meme coins thrive on collective belief and the communal desire to be part of a shared (but speculative) financial journey.\nIt doesn't hurt if your favorite project has a cute mascot, a funny name, or a controversial philosophy. Well-known celebrity backers with millions of social media followers can make a big difference, too. The most popular meme coins often have all of these headline-inspiring qualities.\nMeme coins also serve as an entry point into the cryptocurrency world for many investors. They frequently come with very low dollar-based prices, often paired with viral stories of dramatic gains in the early going. These qualities can attract a whole new demographic of investors looking not just for profits but also for participation in a cultural movement.\nThis idea has important implications for understanding market dynamics, where narrative and hype can significantly influence digital asset prices. One social media post from the right influencer can send a meme coin skyrocketing in a hurry -- or pop a meme coin's inflated valuation just as quickly.\nHave a meme coin? Now what?\nSo, you've got a meme coin on your hands. Now what?\nVenturing into the world of meme coins is like stepping onto a roller coaster with your investment portfolio in tow. Can it be exciting? Absolutely. Is this thrill ride predictable? Not in the slightest. But you should be fine as long as you know what you're getting into. So, here's how you should strap in for the meme coin ride.\nDo your research\nJust like you wouldn't buy a car based solely on its color, diving into meme coins requires a peek under the hood. What's powering its popularity? Is the engine (community support and social media buzz) robust enough to sustain a long journey, or is it running on mere fumes?\nManage your risks\nInvesting in meme coins should be like placing a side bet in an unpredictable casino game rather than betting the farm on a so-called \"sure thing.\" Cryptocurrencies should comprise a moderate portion of your properly diversified investment portfolio, and meme coins can occupy a small sliver of the larger crypto collection.\nMake sure you're comfortable with seeing your meme coin values fluctuate wildly -- sometimes in the blink of an eye and not always for any obvious reason.\nStay informed\nThe meme coin market is as dynamic as a chat room meme war. It pays to keep abreast of trends, news, and shifts in sentiment that can turn today's laughing stock into tomorrow's golden goose -- or vice versa.\nA Dogecoin example\nLet's check out Dogecoin, for example\nPerhaps the epitome of meme coin success, Dogecoin began as a lighthearted parody of Bitcoin but quickly grew into a symbol of the crypto community's playful side. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has seen substantial price increases from time to time, usually fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from influential figures like Tesla (TSLA -1.69%) CEO Elon Musk.\nIts journey from a pure meme to a solid staple of the crypto market highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins and their potential for unexpected success. Dogecoin's rise underscores the importance of community in the crypto market, a factor that can turn a simple joke into a billion-dollar asset.\nThe ride down to smaller market caps can be just as quick and unexpected when the early backers stop promoting the meme coin on social media channels. In the cryptocurrency sector, value is not only defined by utility but also by the shared belief and enthusiasm of its holders.\nRelated investing topics\nPerception often becomes reality, for better or worse. Giants like Bitcoin are not immune to this volatility-boosting effect, but meme coins like Dogecoin are always exposed to these unpredictable winds of change. Some go beyond simple jokes and prove to be outright scams in the long run.\nSo, be careful with those adorable meme coins and watch out for pump-and-dump schemes known as \"rug pulls\" in the crypto world."
