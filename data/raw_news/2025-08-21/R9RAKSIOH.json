  "content": "Let\u2019s not forget, US equities flirted with a bear market earlier this year. There were concerns that China\u2019s DeepSeek artificial intelligence would bring down US technology titans. There were the tariffs.\n\nYet, here we sit in the third quarter of 2025 with the Morningstar US Market Index up nearly 8% for the year and the Morningstar US Core Bond Index having returned more than 3%.\n\nAhead of us lie multiple pathways. Economic data and earnings announcements will provide direction, but there are also \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d that could alter our course.\n\nHere are three investment principles to keep in mind.\n\nPrinciple 1: Where the market goes, nobody knows\n\nComing into the year, how many pundits talked about AI out of China challenging US tech stocks? Did anyone expect tariffs to be such a factor?\n\nThough 2025 has had its plot twists, changes in market direction are hardly unusual.\n\nConsider thatstocks came into summer 2024 on a tear, beforesentiment turned. A series of releases\u2014jobs, inflation, and earnings\u2014compounded fears of a narrow and pricey market. Somehow, both an unexpected interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan and an expected rate cut by the Fed triggered selloffs.\n\nSo, w here we go from here is anyone\u2019s guess. But I\u2019ll cite a story about how dead investors outperform living ones because they don\u2019t trade. Buy-and-hold has been a great strategy for long-term investors.\n\nSome think you don\u2019t need to own anything other than US equities. But I\u2019llnote that the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Index has trounced its US equivalent so far in 2025.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the turnaround? The dollar weakening against many other currencies is part of the story. But markets in many regions\u2014Europe, Latin America, and India\u2014have roared to life this year.\n\nTo me, global investing is about casting the net as widely as possible. So, just as some argue that US-based multinationals provide American investors with global exposure, you could also argue that they\u2019re not fully exposed to the US, from a revenue perspective, with a purely domestic portfolio.\n\nThe equity market\u2019s extreme volatility in 2025 makes bonds look like steady-Eddies.\n\nWhile US stocks were in free fall from late February through early April, the Morningstar US Core Bond Index gained 1.3%. Bonds diversified equities, serving as portfolio ballast.\n\nBonds face a lot of \u201cheadline risk.\u201d There are debt and deficit concerns. And the shadow of 2022\u2019s \u201c worst bond market ever \u201d lingers.\n\nWhile the risks are undeniable, fixed income is also the victim of fearmongering. Not only have bonds diversified stocks, they\u2019re also providing above-inflation income streams. Thanks to the painful interest rate hikes of 2022-23, yields on fixed income are at levels not seen since the mid-2000s.\n\nWe\u2019re likely to see more twists before 2025 is out.\n\nShort-term asset-price fluctuations are driven by a complex interplay of variables\u2014macro and micro, fundamental and technical.\n\nLonger term, valuation can be a useful guide. According to my Morningstar Equity Research colleagues, the US stock market looked a bit pricey coming into the second half of 2025\u2014not in dangerous bubble territory, but \u201ctrading at a slight premium.\u201d The bargains cluster on the value side of the market and in smaller-cap stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, my colleagues in Morningstar Investment Management continue to see upside in bonds and international equities. As always, a buy-and-hold mindset and a diversified portfolio remain sensible investment tactics.\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

  "summary": "The US equity market has seen significant changes in its direction, with the Morningstar US Market Index up nearly 8% for the year and the US Core Bond Index returning more than 3%. However, these developments have not been foreseen, with concerns about China's AI and potential tariffs impacting US tech stocks. The author suggests that while economic data and earnings announcements will provide direction, there are also \"unknown unknowns\" that could alter our course. He suggests that long-term investors should consider buying US equities as a good investment strategy. The article also notes that the MorningStar Global Markets ex-US Index has outperformed its US equivalent so far in 2025. Despite this, analysts continue to see potential upside in bonds and international equities.",

  "argos_summary": "The article notes that despite early 2025 concerns over AI, tariffs, and market volatility, the Morningstar US Market Index has risen nearly 8% and the US Core Bond Index over 3% so far. It stresses that market direction is unpredictable, advocating a buy\u2011and\u2011hold strategy and broad diversification, especially into international equities where the Morningstar Global Markets ex\u2011US Index has outperformed the US equivalent. Bonds are highlighted as a stabilizing ballast amid volatility, offering above\u2011inflation yields thanks to high rates. The author concludes that while valuations are slightly premium, value and small\u2011cap stocks present bargains, and a diversified, long\u2011term approach remains prudent.",
