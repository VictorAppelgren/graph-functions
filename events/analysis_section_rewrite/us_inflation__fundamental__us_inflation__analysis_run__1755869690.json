      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how specific tariff impacts translate into inflationary pressures and labor market dynamics, using concrete examples and data points from the sources. Additionally, ensure that the discussion of structural regimes includes a more detailed exploration of potential transitions and their implications for market pricing. Incorporate quantifiable metrics where possible, such as specific inflation rates or employment figures, to support claims and avoid generalizations. Lastly, improve citation density by integrating more direct references to the sources throughout the text, ensuring that all critical data points are backed by appropriate citations. This will enhance the credibility and specificity of the analysis, aligning it more closely with world-class standards.",
