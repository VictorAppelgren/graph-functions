      "feedback": "Your draft is too broad and contains several off‑track statements that do not tie directly to the multi‑year structural view of the asset you’re supposed to analyze (e.g., the “Trump Accounts” policy, short‑term mortgage‑rate chatter, or the ICJ climate opinion). For each sentence that does not explicitly link back to the asset’s long‑term pricing dynamics, either delete it or rewrite it to show a clear causal chain: e.g., “The $1 k federal deposit in Trump Accounts will increase the domestic savings rate, shifting the U.S. money‑market curve and tightening the 2‑year Treasury yield by 5–10 bp over the next 3 years (ID 1ZRJSOWD9).” Add inline citations for every substantive claim (use the article IDs). Ensure every paragraph ends with a concise, actionable view: direction, magnitude (bp/%), horizon, catalysts, and risk flags. Re‑align the narrative to the pillars—growth/inflation, monetary policy, and credit/term‑premium—so the analysis remains within the structural horizon and the canonical handles (e.g., ust2y, dxy, spx). Remove any mention of local or micro details that cannot be mapped to a canonical handle, and replace them with cross‑asset implications (e.g., how the policy affects the UST 10y curve, the DXY, or the S&P 500).",
