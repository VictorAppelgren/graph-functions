  "title": "Don't Plug These Things Into Your USB Ports",
  "description": "Curiosity killed the computer.",
  "content": "The whole point of USB or Universal Serial Bus technology is that you can plug any two USB things together, and as long as the plug fits, you're good to go\u2014but are you really?\n\nThere are millions of USB devices out there, and just because your laptop or phone has a USB port doesn't mean it's a good idea to plug all of them in there. In these four cases, it's probably best to avoid them.\n\nYou might think of malware as some clever software that infects your computer over a network or otherwise uses a sophisticated trick to get you to run it, but it's way easier than that. Just load up a USB drive with malware, leave it lying around near the computer systems you want to compromise\u2013and wait.\n\nSoon some poor dope is going to pick up that drive, wonder what's on it, and just plug it in. From there the malware might auto-execute if the computer isn't properly configured to prevent that, or some of the files might actually be disguised scripts or executables. For extra effectiveness, name them things like \"Confidential Meeting Minutes\" or \"Naughty Photos\"\u2014gets 'em every time.\n\nYou can also use a flash drive with the right company logo to make it look more legit, or otherwise dress the drive up to make it more likely someone will plug it in.\n\nThat's before we get to so-called \"USB killers\", which are devices made to look like flash drives, but they are actually designed to slowly store up a huge amount of power using an internal capacitor, and then blast the computer with so much voltage the whole computer is destroyed. Yes, the motherboard, CPU, RAM, SSD\u2014all of it.\n\nOn a totally unrelated note, if you see a USB flash drive just lying around, like someone accidentally dropped it, don't plug it into your computer...\n\nIn theory, every USB device has to conform to USB standards and specs so that it's always safe to plug something in. In practice, many no-name cheap accessories and, in particular, cheap USB chargers don't bother with all that safety stuff. It's not just USB specs either;there are industry certifications in Europe, the USA, and other parts of the world that ensure devices like charges have overvoltage protection and won't spontaneously combust.\n\nWhat's really insidious is that some knockoff chargers will even have counterfeit markings declaring they are compliant with those safety standards. Remember all those hoverboards that burned people's houses down? Yeah, this sort of thing can be very serious.\n\nWhat can you do? Don't just plug any random charger into your devices. If you bought it from some flea market store, and it costs a buck, it's not safe for your MacBook or Android smartphones. Try to buy from reputable dealers and take reasonable steps to make sure your USB device isn't counterfeit.\n\nIt used to be much more common, but there are still lots of novelty USB gadgets floating around. Think everything from USB fans to USB coffee warmers. These devices might be cute and funny, and make for a good conversation piece around the office (not really), but there's always the chance you're getting more than you bargained for.\n\nThe only thing I'd ever plug these devices into is a USB port that only provides power, and not data. Such as a disconnected USB hub, or a USB charger. The risk that there's some sort of silent spyware like a keylogger snuck into these mass-produced devices from, goodness knows where, is just too high, even if it is in fact very low.\n\nWhile most people just carry around their own backup power in the form of power banks these days, sometimes you may be in a position where you need to take advantage of a public charging station. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but hackers can compromise these chargers so that they can unlock and infect your smartphone or other devices without you being any the wiser.\n\nIt's probably not that common, but places like airports or other mass transport stations are just too juicy a target. So, what can you do? For one thing, you can simply top up your power bank instead of your phone. Most power banks don't have anything to infect, and can't carry any data through their USB ports anyway.\n\nAlternatively, you can buy a secure USB charging cable. They are known by different names, like \"data blocker\" or \"power-only\" cables, but basically they lack the physical data lines of a normal USB cable. This means there's literally no way for them to be a source of infection.\n\nYou can also use a data blocker adapter to convert any existing cable into a secure cable. These are sometimes jokingly referred to as \"USB condoms\".\n\nUSB is an awesome invention, but it's that very universal nature that has turned the typical USB port into a high-value target, and so you should treat your USB ports with the same care as you do the doors on your house.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nComputer virus: Those two words instantly make us sweat---and for good reason. Since the 1980s, viruses have wreaked havoc on everything from our inboxes to industrial facilities. While cybersecurity has improved, the damage done by viruses throughout history is a reminder of what these bugs can do.\nPicture it: It's 1986, and you see a message on your Windows PC saying your computer is infected with a virus. To remedy the situation, you're instructed to call brothers Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi. At that moment, as you pick up your phone and start to dial, you immediately regret pirating the brothers' software (as you should).\nThe virus was known as Brain, the first PC virus. It was technically built for the protection of software. However, the good intentions didn't last. Soon, viruses were malicious in nature, resulting in billions of dollars of damage, identity theft, wrecked hardware...the list goes on.\nMillions of viruses have existed since Brain in 1986. However, some have been considerably worse than others.\nMelissa - 1999\nIn 1999, computer viruses were still a relatively new concept. However, the Melissa virus, known as the fastest-growing virus of that time, quickly highlighted them as a growing concern for all.\nIt all started when a man named David Lee Smith used an AOL account to upload a file to the internet that, when downloaded, would hijack early versions of Microsoft Word. If a user also had Microsoft Outlook, the virus would send itself via email to the top 50 people in a user's address book.\nWhile that may not seem like that big of a deal, it was. According to the FBI, many corporate and government email servers became overloaded and had to be shut down. In addition, internet traffic slowed to a trickle.\nThis virus did have a happy ending. A few months after David Lee Smith was sentenced for his crime, the FBI developed its Cyber Division, which still investigates cyber crime to this day.\nILOVEYOU - 2000\nWho doesn't want to find a love letter in their inbox? Unfortunately, many Romeos and Juliets in 2000 fell victim to a virus after clicking what looked like a love letter in Microsoft Outlook.\nThe ILOVEYOU virus (known as Love Bug back then) was technically a worm and started as a seemingly innocent email. The subject line, \"ILOVEYOU,\" drew email users to click. Inside, a text file titled \"LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS\" was waiting.\nOnce the text file was opened, the worm would go on to permanently damage files such as photos and critical documents on a user's computer. Even worse, it would attach itself to all the addresses in Microsoft Outlook, spreading like wildfire.\nAs a worm, no further human intervention was required to keep ILOVEYOU moving. As a result, millions of computers became infected in only a matter of days.\nCode Red - 2001\nOne of the more ominous-sounding viruses on our list, Code Red took over corporate IT in 2001. In fact, it's regarded by many as the first severe attack on a corporate system.\nThe Code Red worm specifically targeted systems running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows Server. As described in a Microsoft Security Bulletin, the attacker could use an unchecked buffer, establish a server session, conduct a buffer overrun, and execute code on the web server.\nThe result? Important websites would display \"Welcome to http://www.worm.com! Hacked by Chinese!\" and nothing else. The worm was also the cause of various dangerous denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\nBut that ominous-sounding name? It was inspired by the drink the security employees were sipping when they found the worm: Mountain Dew Code Red.\nNimda - 2001\nNimda struck just a few months after Code Red and just a short time after the September 11th attacks that left us in shock. As a worm, Nimda was similar to ILOVEYOU and Code Red in that it replicated itself.\nHowever, Nimda was particularly damaging as it was able to spread in various ways, including via email and compromised websites. Nimda affected Windows operating systems and was able to modify system files and even create guest accounts.\nDue to Nimda, millions of machines were infected, and many large corporations had to shut down their networks and operations. The actual cost of Nimda has yet to be fully estimated. But trust us when we say it's a lot.\nSobig - 2003\nWhile opening an email may not lead to infection, email attachments are a whole other can of worms (pun intended). Opening weird attachments from email addresses you don't recognize is a big no-no. And while many email users today know this, things were different in 2003.\nThe Sobig worm infected millions of Microsoft computers via email. The threat would arrive in your inbox with a subject line like \"Details\" or \"Thank you!\" And inside, there would be an attachment just begging for a click.\nWhen clicked, Sobig would infect the computer, search for other email addresses in various computer files, and then quickly replicate by sending itself to those addresses.\nWhat's worse, Sobig had multiple variants, including A, B, C, D, E, and F. The \"F\" variant was by far the worst of the group. In August of 2003, it was reported that one out of every 17 emails was a copy of the Sobig.F virus.\nDue to its spreading capabilities, Sobig overwhelmed networks worldwide and resulted in billions of dollars in damages.\nMydoom - 2004\n\"I'm just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry.\"\nThis was the email message sent by the email worm, Mydoom, first discovered in 2004. And a job it did, indeed. Mydoom quickly became the fastest-growing email worm in history. In fact, it still holds the title.\nSimilar to Sobig and other worms on this list, Mydoom was primarily spread through email attachments. If the attachment was opened, the worm would send itself to other email addresses found in the user's address book or other local files.\nThe fast growth of Mydoom slowed internet traffic worldwide. At the time, it was reported that some websites were experiencing response times 8 to 10% lower than the average. Mydoom was also behind multiple DoS and DDoS attacks, including attacks against the US and South Korea.\nZeus - 2007\nZeus, also known as Zbot, is trojan malware infecting Microsoft Windows. The malware most commonly targets financial or banking information. The first sighting of Zeus was in 2007, when the malware was found stealing information from the US Department of Transportation.\nZeus works by developing a botnet, which is a network of remote-controlled computers or bots that have been infected by malware. As a result, an attacker can control multiple computers at once. Zeus often infects a computer after a user clicks a malicious link in an email or downloads an infected file.\nWhy is Zeus so dangerous? For example, the malware can use keylogging to capture sensitive information such as online banking passwords. In fact, in 2010, the FBI busted a crime ring that used the Zeus trojan to steal around $70 million from its victims.\nStuxnet - 2010\nStuxnet made headlines in 2010 as the first worm developed to target industrial control systems. The worm inflicted physical damage on Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly centrifuges. How? By exploiting vulnerabilities found within Windows to gain access to the software used to control the industrial equipment.\nStuxnet was also unique in that the worm was first introduced to computers using infected USB drives. Yes, physical USB drives. Even now, Stuxnet is hailed as the world's first cyberweapon.\nPoisonIvy - 2011\nPoisonIvy does more than make its victims itch. Known as a backdoor trojan or remote access trojan (RAT), PoisonIvy is used to gain access to a victim's computer. While PoisonIvy isn't a virus but a type of malware, it deserves a place on our list nonetheless.\nPoisonIvy was first identified in 2005. However, one of the most notable attacks using the trojan occurred in 2011. Known as the Nitro hacking attacks, PoisonIvy was used to steal critical information from chemical manufacturers, government agencies, and other organizations.\nPoisonIvy is dangerous because threat actors can access a computer for keylogging, screen capturing, and more. The trojan is also used to steal passwords and other critical personal information.\nWannaCry - 2017\nThe WannaCry ransomware attack took place in May 2017. The goal was simple: to hold a user's files hostage and get paid in Bitcoin.\nThe WannaCry attack used a leaked hack known as EternalBlue to gain access to computers running Microsoft Windows. Once in, WannaCry would encrypt the computer's data. Then, users would see a message demanding a Bitcoin payment for the release of their files.\nUnfortunately, WannaCry did have its victims. In 2017, the damage was estimated to be in the billions. Even today, WannaCry still exists, highlighting the importance of protecting ourselves from ransomware.\nThe Computer Virus Is Alive and Well\nAs technology evolves, so does the work of cybercriminals. While you may see the years listed above and get the impression that viruses are a thing of the past, that couldn't be further from the truth.\nSerious threats such as ransomware are alive and well. The best thing you can do? Protect yourself. Even the most basic security practices can help prevent viruses from infecting your devices."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nReliable and up-to-date antivirus software is your best defense against keyloggers. You can also use tools like Windows Task Manager to look for unusual or unexpected apps and processes that could be hiding the spyware.\nKeyloggers can get onto your computer and mobile device in a variety of ways and for several different reasons. Knowing how to detect and remove keylogging software is important for retaining your digital privacy and protecting your sensitive data from being stolen and misused.\nWhat is a Keylogger?\nA keylogger, also known as a keystroke logger, is a type of spyware that can be installed on a computer, phone, or tablet to monitor and record keystrokes and touches. Some keylogging software can also record mouse movements, screen images, clicked website links, and other user input actions.\nWhen a keylogger is active, everything from typed passwords and account information to personal emails and website searches you make is recorded in a log file, which can then be retrieved and read by whoever has backend access to the keylogger.\nKeyloggers are often associated with infection by other types of malware, but not always. A keylogger could also be deployed by parents, suspicious husbands/wives, a rival business, or just about anyone who wants to sneakily track what is being typed or input on a particular device.\nKeylogging software is not illegal, but how they are used can be. Some corporations use keyloggers openly to ensure employees are not using company time and equipment for personal tasks such as browsing social media or chatting with friends.\nKeylogging Software vs. Hardware\nThere are two main types of keyloggers: software and hardware. Outside the corporate world, you are much more likely to encounter a software keylogger than a hardware version.\nSoftware keyloggers are installed invisibly on the device to be monitored, often alongside other malware. You won't see any app icon or settings to show that it is installed, although some keylogging software hides in plain sight by using another seemingly innocuous app icon. Keystroke logs can then be automatically sent over the network or emailed without you knowing. This can happen on almost any schedule, perhaps several times a day.\nHardware keyloggers need to be physically attached to the computer. This sometimes means a specialized USB device is connected to a spare USB port, but often between the wired keyboard and the computer. A hardware keylogging device could quite easily go undetected if you don't check the back of the PC regularly (and who does?)\nHardware keyloggers usually use onboard storage. This means that the keylogging device will need to be retrieved by whoever placed it there before the logged data can be downloaded and read.\nHow to Detect Keyloggers on Your Computer\nHardware keyloggers are usually easy to detect. Just look at the back of your computer and check for any unusual devices in your USB ports or connected to your keyboard cable. Just be sure that you aren't removing a legitimate USB adapter by mistake.\nDetecting a software keylogger can take more time and effort, but it can be done if you know what to look for.\nLook for Unusual Processes in Task Manager\nFor Windows users, the first place to look for keylogging software is in the Task Manager. Expand the Task Manager to show details, and add columns to show publisher names. You can then scroll through the list of processes to find any unusual entries.\nDo a web search for any suspicious process names to learn if they are associated with keyloggers. You can also try typing in a text document while watching the activity in the Task Manager. If the activity of an unknown process spikes when typing, investigate it.\nCheck Your Software List for Unexpected Apps\nCheck your installed software list for any apps or programs that look out of place. It is extremely unlikely that a keylogger will be named as such, so look for apps that you don't remember installing.\nIf you are unsure about the legitimacy of an app, do some online research to find out if it could be a keylogger in disguise.\n4 Common Signs Your PC Has a Keylogger\nFew of us randomly check the back of our computers or scan through the Task Manager for unexpected processes, but thankfully there are several common signs that a keylogger is at work on your computer.\n- A slow or strangely behaving browser, such as delays when you click a link or use the search function.\n- Input lag when you type or click your mouse/trackpad.\n- The mouse pointer disappears for a few moments during use.\n- Unexpected or more frequent app and system crashes.\nWhile it is true that some or all of these can also be a sign of different computer problems, they should at least be a prompt to investigate further, particularly if you are experiencing them all at the same time.\nHow to Remove a Keylogger\nIf you find the keylogging software during the inspection of your running processes or apps you should be able to delete or uninstall it manually. Unfortunately, keyloggers are often disguised as legitimate software, which can make identifying and removing them more difficult.\nThe most reliable way to remove a keylogger is by using your antivirus software. Run a full or deep scan using up-to-date software, and if the software includes a dedicated keylogger scanner, use it. When a keylogger is found, you will be given the option to remove it.\nYour Temporary Files folder is often a cluttered and easily forgotten place, ideal for keylogging software to hide. Clearing your Temporary Files, and then repeating the process regularly, will mean one less place for the spyware to lurk.\nIf all else fails, resetting your computer should remove even the most stubborn keylogging software. This is clearly quite a drastic solution, but as long as you back up your files properly, a full reset isn't as time-consuming and difficult as it used to be.\nPreventing Future Keylogging Attacks\nThe best ways to prevent keylogging attacks in the future are choosing reliable antivirus software and keeping it updated, along with your system software. Most well-known antivirus software will give you at least some protection from software keyloggers.\nIf your current antivirus doesn't offer real-time protection, consider switching to something that does, like BitDefender Total Security or Norton 360.\nBeing vigilant and knowing the tell-tale signs of active keylogging will also help to keep your device safe from this type of spyware. Be wary of offers to install \"bonus\" apps or browser extensions when installing seemingly safe software. And avoid the usual actions that can lead to malware infection, such as clicking links in emails from unknown senders or browsing unsecured websites."
