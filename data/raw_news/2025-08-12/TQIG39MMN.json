(NYSE: PSQH) (\"PublicSquare,\" or the \"Company\"), today reported financial results for the second quarter 2025 and announced a strategic repositioning to accelerate the growth of its Fintech segment. Three key initiatives comprise this repositioning, including: (1) Focusing the PublicSquare organization on a bundled offering including payments, credit, and digital asset solutions to drive scalable, capital-efficient growth as a Fintech-forward business, (2) Monetizing the Brands segment business through the pursuit of a sale of EveryLife and the pursuit of a sale of its Marketplace segment business or a strategic repurposing of the marketplace IP to complement its fintech offering, (3) Advancing of the long-term vision to embrace and implement cryptocurrency and decentralized finance solutions as part of its fintech offerings that enhances economic liberty for consumers and merchants while providing high-margin revenue streams. Anticipated proceeds from the monetization efforts of the EveryLife and Marketplace segment business are expected to fuel the next phase of PublicSquare\u2019s fintech innovation and growth.\n\n\"PublicSquare\u2019s performance in the second quarter of 2025 underscores the momentum within our expanding fintech segment and affirms our commitment to a market of merchants and customers who value high-performing technology and economic liberty,\" said Michael Seifert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PublicSquare. \"With today\u2019s announced initiatives, we are charting a bold path forward, one defined by meaningful innovation and strategic focus.\"\n\nPublicSquare is embarking on a strategic repositioning of its business to accelerate the growth of its Fintech segment. While our mission of building a financial ecosystem that protects economic liberty remains unchanged, our strategy has evolved to ensure the Company is directionally focused and well-positioned as a leader in the dawn of a new era of financial technology.\n\nThe Company is sharpening its strategic focus to deliver best-in-class, purpose-driven financial technology solutions as a bundled solution that serves and supports values-aligned merchants and consumers\n\u2022 Credit and Payments: Rapid adoption of our bundled checkout solution among values-driven merchants has validated the Company\u2019s approach to financial services that reflect a commitment to security, cancel-proof technology, and financial freedom\n\u2022 Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs): PublicSquare is actively pursuing the acquisition of MTLs to accelerate growth and margin in our payments services\n\u2022 Alternative Payment Methods: PublicSquare is developing cryptocurrency-based payment options that position the company strongly for a market moving rapidly away from traditional payment rails and networks\n\nPublicSquare plans to monetize its Brands segment business through the sale of EveryLife and monetize its Marketplace segment business through a sale or strategically repurpose the marketplace IP to complement its fintech offering\n\u2022 Value Creation: The Company is engaging with potential buyers and working with financial advisors to maximize shareholder value for each segment\n\u2022 Capital Reallocation: Anticipated proceeds and cost savings are expected to support a leaner operating model, fund fintech product innovation, and accelerate the development of our bundled payments, credit, and consumer financial tools\n\u2022 Timeline: The Company expects to complete these efforts by the end of the fourth quarter 2025\n\nPublicSquare is advancing a long-term vision to embrace and implement cryptocurrency and decentralized finance solutions as part of its fintech offerings that enhances economic liberty for consumers and merchants while providing high-margin revenue streams\n\u2022 Productization of Crypto: Tokenized assets, blockchain-powered innovation, and alternative payment rails offer resilient infrastructure to combat a traditional financial environment encumbered by debanking and cancel culture\n\u2022 Merchant Treasury Solutions: PublicSquare is in the early stages of implementing digital treasury tools to optimize liquidity across the digital assets ecosystem\n\u2022 Leadership: The recent appointment of Caitlin Long, a renowned bitcoin and crypto finance expert, to the Company's Board of Directors adds deep expertise to guide the rollout of these initiatives\n\n\"Over the past two years, we\u2019ve built a dynamic and diversified business spanning marketplace, consumer products, and fintech,\" said Michael Seifert. \"As we looked toward the future, it became increasingly clear that an intentional focus on our bundled fintech offering, including payments, credit, cryptocurrency and decentralized finance solutions, represent the most scalable, high-margin avenue for sustainable growth. This strategic repositioning enables us to double down on these strengths, operate with greater capital efficiency, and drive long-term value for our shareholders. With a streamlined structure and concentrated investment in fintech innovation, we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver outstanding results in the months and years ahead, all to satisfy the original mission of creating an economic ecosystem for a previously unaddressed audience of American customers and merchants who value financial freedom.\"\n\nNote: Beginning with the third quarter 2025 reporting period both the Brands and Marketplace business segments will be shown as discontinued operations in the Company\u2019s financial statements until the monetization activities for each segment is concluded.\n\u2022 As of June 30, 2025, PublicSquare had $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $0.3 million of restricted cash\n\u2022 During the second quarter 2025 the Company invested $0.5 million in the application process to obtain MTLs to further enhance payment processing options.\n\u2022 The Company had an outstanding principal balance of $4.0 million on its $10.0 million revolving line of credit as of June 30, 2025\n\u2022 Approximately $1.1 million of cash was utilized in the second quarter 2025 as part of the Company\u2019s balance sheet strategy where the Company holds certain consumer receivables from its consumer finance business on its balance sheet to increase revenue potential instead of immediately monetizing them to third parties\n\nThe Company\u2019s 2025 outlook and guidance has been updated:\n\u2022 As a result of the Company\u2019s planned monetization of its Brands segment business through the pursuit of a sale of EveryLife and the pursuit of a sale of its Marketplace segment business or a strategic repurposing of the marketplace IP to complement its fintech offering, the Company is removing full year revenue guidance and the Company\u2019s previous 2025 revenue guidance, reiterated on May 8, 2025, should no longer be relied upon\n\u2022 Operating expense guidance remains unchanged. Operating expense (defined as general and administrative, sales and marketing, and research and development expense) is expected to be lower than 2024, reflecting foundational investments and the full impact of organizational changes made in late 2024\n\nPublicSquare plans to hold an analyst and investor meeting in September 2025 to further discuss its fintech initiatives and provide greater detail around its long-term plans related to digital assets. Further information, including details regarding participation and the location of this event, will be provided in a separate market communication.\n\nManagement will host a teleconference and webcast to discuss its second quarter 2025 results today, August 12, 2025 at 4:30 p.m. ET.
