      "summary": "The pan‑European STOXX 600 rose 1.40% as investors anticipate lower U.S. borrowing costs, setting a positive backdrop for European penny stocks. The article highlights three under‑the‑radar companies: Tractial, a €12.97 m payment‑solutions firm that is unprofitable but has a seven‑month cash runway; Uniphar, a €1.06 bn diversified healthcare services group with strong recent earnings growth and manageable debt; and Exasol, a €90 m data‑warehousing specialist that is debt‑free, recently turned profitable, and shows robust earnings expansion. A broader screener of 343 penny stocks is also referenced, underscoring the potential upside of low‑priced, high‑growth opportunities in Europe.",
