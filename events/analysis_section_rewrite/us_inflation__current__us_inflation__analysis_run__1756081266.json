      "feedback": "Your draft hits the right players (labor market fragility, tariff pass‑through, AI upside, central‑bank independence, and cooling costs) but needs sharper structure, tighter sourcing, and explicit 0–3 week test‑and‑respond logic. Actionable edits in one paragraph: (1) Anchor every claim to a source ID and replace vague or overlapping phrases with concrete data points (e.g., 1) continued unemployment claims 1,972,000 in the week ended Aug 9; 2) initial claims ~235,000 mid‑August; unemployment 4.2% from the Fed/BEA/DOL context as cited in GZ9VV1RV0; 3) core PCE inflation about 2.9% y/y and total PCE 2.6% as the near‑term inflation backdrop from the Fed speech in Scraped Source 4). (2) Replace the D4 shorthand with explicit IDs (e.g., cite Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks via GZ9VV1RV0 or the Aug 22, 2025 Fed speech) and remove non‑ID placeholders to satisfy “only IDs present” constraint. (3) Turn the causal chain into a testable near‑term transmission: tariffs raise input costs → marginally lift core PCE toward 3% (risk if persistence of tariff regime) → Fed posture remains data‑dependent but constrained; AI investment could offset growth and productivity but its durability is uncertain (cite 218AGGUXB for Krugman’s framing). (4) Build a short, defensible 0–3 week scenario with explicit triggers and invalidation: if continued claims move above ~2.0 million and core PCE stays near 3% or higher, expect limited downward wage/price relief and higher odds of policy restraint remaining in restrictive territory; if AI investment accelerates and inflation expectations stay anchored, policy stance could remain flexible; if tariff uncertainty feeds into inflation expectations, risks to the upside rise. (5) Quantify levels and thresholds rather than qualitative statements: give ranges (e.g., unemployment 4.0–4.4%, core PCE 2.7–3.0% in the near term) and tie each to a source. (6) Reconcile conflicts by flagging that RawStory pieces (e.g., Krugman/Trump‑era narratives) are opinion; treat them as sentiment signals rather than primary data, and weight Fed/BEA/DOL numbers and the official Fed framework changes (U6HXAJR4J; Q/coverage in Scraped Source 4) more heavily. (7) Strengthen the monitoring list: add next prints ( payrolls, CPI/PCE, tariff developments) and Jackson Hole communications as near‑term catalysts, plus the Fed’s framework stance on flexible inflation targeting and the higher neutral rate as per the 2025 framework (cite the 2025 Fed framework excerpts). This will convert the piece from a descriptive snapshot into a rigorously testable, source‑dense 0–3 week briefing with explicit levels, invalidation points, and a clear reaction function.",
