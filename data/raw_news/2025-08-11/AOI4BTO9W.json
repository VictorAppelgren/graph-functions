  "title": "Take the guesswork out of what to make for dinner with these prepared meal delivery services",
  "description": "Prepared meal delivery services can take the stress and time spent huddled in a corner at the grocery store out of your weekly routine.",
  "content": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\n\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\n\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n\u2022 Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n\u2022 Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n\u2022 Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n\u2022 Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\n\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\n\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\n\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\n\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\n\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\n\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\n\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\n\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\n\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\n\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\n\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\n\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\n\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\n\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\n\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\n\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\n\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\n\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\n\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\n\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\n\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\n\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select?

Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "If your weekly routine consists of struggling with dinner recipes or feeling overwhelmed by meal prep times, you may want to consider exploring a meal delivery service. These services send either pre-made meals or perfectly portioned ingredients with step-by-step recipes directly to your door. It can decrease the amount of money you spend on groceries, make meal planning less stressful and help improve your cooking skills \u2014 all while catering to dietary needs like pescatarian or gluten-free, experts say.\nTo determine the best one for you, I spoke to chefs, nutritionists and recipe developers about what to look for in a meal delivery service. I also highlighted NBC Select editor favorites that we\u2019ve tested and reviewed, plus expert-recommended options.\nI consulted with our experts about which features to consider when shopping for meal kit delivery services. Here are the most important ones to remember:\n- Serving size: Keep in mind how many people you\u2019re looking to feed, and make sure the service offers multiple servings (if you need). A single-serve pre-prepared meal is likely best if you\u2019re only feeding yourself. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, look for a customizable plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings).\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, look for services that offer a variety of options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Customizability: Are you a picky eater or someone who gets easily bored of eating the same meals? Look for meal delivery services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several meal options, as well as customizable features like portion size and the amount and type of protein in each meal.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services is based on the quality of meals and ingredients, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the specific meal plan. Keep in mind that more budget-friendly services may not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your kit. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed.\nWe\u2019ve tested nearly a dozen meal delivery services, many of which are listed below. To pick the best ones, we looked at the following factors:\n- Serving size: We considered how many people we\u2019re feeding, and whether the service accommodates multiple servings. For example, a few editors are feeding themselves plus a partner or families, while others are only cooking for one.\n- Prep time: We looked at how long it took to cook or heat up meals, and whether it was worth it for a busy schedule (all of the services we recommend have easy-to-follow recipes and take less than an hour to make, or under 10 minutes to heat up).\n- Price: We tried options across various price points, though most fall within the $10-$12 per meal range.\n- Dietary restrictions: We tried services that catered to different diets, including gluten-free and pescatarian, and how that food actually tasted.\n- Shipping and packaging: We considered how meals are packaged, how that packaging helps (or hinders) meal preparation and whether the shipping is quick, easy and painless.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nBelow, I included NBC Select staff-favorite services that we\u2019ve tried and loved. The chefs and nutritionists I spoke to gave us their recommendations for the best meal kit delivery services to try across a variety of budgets, tastes and diets. I included both meal kit services (which send out individual ingredients) and pre-made meal services.\nBest prepared meal delivery service overall\nCookUnity is a favorite among several members of our NBC Select staff. You can choose from multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive per week, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals. The service provides a rotating menu of ready-made options each week, or you can let CookUnity pick them out for you based on your preferences (like your choice of protein) or any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free. You can also flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu.\n\u201cI started using CookUnity because I felt like I was spending so much money on groceries but still eating boring food everyday like sandwiches and salads,\u201d says former NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri. \u201cNow, I can enjoy a variety of delicious meals while still spending about the same amount I\u2019d spent on groceries before.\u201d\nNBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown is also a CookUnity fan and gets six meals delivered each week, so dinner is taken care of most days. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a time in my life when I am able to cook dinner every night but that\u2019s not the case right now \u2014 I\u2019ve tried switching up how I shop, rearranging my kitchen and meal prepping, all in hopes of cutting down on how much I spend on takeout but nothing worked until I got CookUnity,\u201d she says. Brown loves browsing and picking her meals each week: \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s also a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin: \u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 the meals show up at my door at the beginning of the week, and knowing all I need to do to cook dinner is pull the wrapper off a meal and warm it up makes my evenings totally stress-free,\u201d she says. However, Malin notes there is some more prep work involved than other services she\u2019s tried. \u201cI did have to take out some components of meals before I microwaved them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was a bit tricky and caused me to do more dishes \u2014 normally, I\u2019d reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in,\u201d she says.\nThe meals also come in a small reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals come fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days.\nBest meal kit overall\nHome Chef\u2019s rotating weekly menu includes more than 30 meals to choose from. You can also select from a variety of menu options catered to your preferences, including 15-minute meal kits, grill- and oven-ready kits and special occasion meals. Before ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your tastes, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to make. The customizability makes this a standout service for our experts, who emphasize that you can easily choose the amount and type of protein in each meal. Ben Leonard, a chef and food educator with more than 15 years of experience, says the service is best for \u201cfamilies, kids or people with any dietary restrictions\u201d due to its variety of meal selections and customizable features.\nBest with variety\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor is another favorite of mine that I\u2019ve used regularly and love for its varied meal options, quick and easy prep time and detailed nutritional information cards. The service provides a rotating weekly menu of over 30 pre-made meals and caters to a number of dietary needs and preferences, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals to 18 meals per week. Factor also lets you schedule a complimentary consultation with a registered dietitian to answer nutrition questions or determine if a Factor subscription is the right choice for you.\n\u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. She especially likes that chefs design the meals but dietitians approve them, and the fact that they don\u2019t cater to just one special diet. \u201cI think a lot of people want to try eating plans like keto and vegan, but don\u2019t know where to begin \u2014 meal options like this let them explore something new without overcommitting and discover if a diet suits their taste preferences, their individual dietary needs and their budget before diving too deep,\u201d she says.\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon offers over 50 healthy ready-made meals and snacks that include smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes \u2014 and everything is gluten-free. Your cart automatically fills with the service\u2019s bestsellers, or you can manually swap in your favorites.\n\u201cI recommend Splendid Spoon for anyone who wants healthy meals in a flash \u2014 they taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out. She says she enjoys the selection of juices and smoothies and the convenience of thawing one at a time. Although you can\u2019t pick the number of meals you get per plan like most other delivery services, Splendid Spoon lets you customize the frequency of your meal deliveries: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for families\nHelloFresh is one of my favorite no-frills meal kit delivery services \u2014 the recipes are easy to follow (which, as a non-cook, is key for me), the meal options are varied and the food ends up tasting great. The popular service offers a great mix of dishes in its weekly rotating menu, which can appeal to everyone in the family (including kids), says Leonard.\nYou can customize your weekly meal settings by selecting from six preferences: Quick & Easy, Pescatarian, Family-Friendly, Fit & Wholesome, Veggie and Chef\u2019s Choice/Meat & Veggie. The service appeals to several dietary restrictions, which impressed our NBC Select editors. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised by how many HelloFresh meals fit my gluten-free and pescatarian diet, although you definitely have a lot more options if you don\u2019t have dietary restrictions,\u201d says Malin, who tried the service for a week. \u201cOverall, cooking the meals was straightforward and the portion sizes were filling.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll automatically receive meals that fall under your specific preferences, or you can choose the meals you want each week. You can also swap proteins and sides if the weekly recipes don\u2019t quite fit your preferences. The service also offers 14 veggie meals (including up to two vegan meals) in its Classic Plan each week.\nBest gluten-free\nSunbasket offers both ingredient-based meal kits and pre-made meals, all of which consist of high-quality ingredients and organic produce, according to the service. You can choose from 10 meal plans, including chef\u2019s choice recipes and pre-made Fresh & Ready meals, as well as paleo, gluten-free, vegetarian and diabetes-friendly options. The Fresh & Ready option lets you receive single-serve meals to heat in the oven or microwave in just a few minutes. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to a single plan, the service lets you mix and match with over a dozen meals from its weekly rotating menu.\n\u201cSince I follow a gluten-free and pescatarian diet, I can usually only eat one or two offerings off a meal delivery service\u2019s weekly menu. But that wasn\u2019t the case with Sunbasket: There were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy to follow recipe,\u201d says Malin, who tried Sunbasket for a week. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals \u2014 they taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBoth Resnick and Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommend Sunbasket as their top choice for healthy meal kits. \u201cIt has a variety of options that can be modified for carnivores and strictly plant-based eaters alike,\u201d says Moskovitz. Most of Sunbasket\u2019s packaging is also recyclable or compostable, using sustainable material like recycled and virgin craft paper and 100% shredded recycled paper filling, according to the brand.\nBest for beginners\nBlue Apron has a number of weekly menu items based on your selected meal plan. Meal plan options include a signature plan that comes with the service\u2019s top chef-favorite recipes, a vegetarian plan and a wellness plan that offers nutritionist-approved, carb-conscious recipes. The prices will also depend on the plan you choose. While Blue Apron does require some cooking chops based on the difficulty level of its recipes, Leonard recommends the service for beginner cooks who hope to \u201clearn from the beginning and hone their basic skills.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re strapped on time, Blue Apron also offers over 30 pre-made meal options per week. I tried the brand\u2019s Prepared & Ready meals for a week and was impressed by how easy they are to prepare \u2014 the meals were ready in under five minutes when I heated them up in the microwave. Plus, there were plenty of meals to choose from, and they tasted so good that it felt like I was eating a homemade meal. Keep in mind, however, the brand does not cater to many dietary restrictions or specific dietary plans like gluten-free and keto.\nBest budget-friendly\nTry Everyplate at $1.49 per meal and $1 steak with code NBCSELECT149 on EveryPlate\u2019s website.\nEveryPlate was my introduction to preparing real home-cooked meals when I got my first apartment, and at a great price point. The service has a weekly rotating menu with over a dozen options, including vegetarian, low-calorie and even quick meals that you can prepare in 30 minutes or less. The service then delivers a kit complete with ingredients and recipe cards for your selections. To me, EveryPlate\u2019s meal options offer variety and fulfill most of my cravings for the week. And as someone without much cooking experience, the recipes are easy to follow.\nWhen choosing your plan, you can highlight your specific dietary and meal preferences, including veggie, quick and easy, and family-friendly. Based on those preferences, the service will show you the most relevant recipes first (though you\u2019ll still have access to all of the recipes on the weekly menu).\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nIf you\u2019re looking for healthy, ready-to-eat meals, BistroMD lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. \u201cBistroMD prides itself on being \u2018doctor-designed\u2019 and therefore is more medically therapeutic than most other companies,\u201d says Moskovitz.\nYou can choose from seven plans: signature (which includes chef-prepared meals for those with limited dietary restrictions), gluten-free, heart healthy (which offers meals containing less than 600 milligrams of sodium and 3.5 grams of saturated fat), keto, vegan, diabetic-friendly and menopause-friendly. Once you choose your plan, BistroMD gives you multiple selections for the number of meals you get per week. The service also offers an EATS (Essential and Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for an additional charge.\nBest vegan\nResnick calls Purple Carrot\u2019s meal kits a \u201cwonderful blend of familiar and innovative.\u201d Because the meals are fully plant-based, the service can be an easy way for people to \u201cadd more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d she says. Purple Carrot offers both prepared meals and meal kits, so you can choose whether you want to cook or simply heat up your dinner or lunch. In addition to plant-based meals, Purple Carrot provides several gluten-free recipes to choose from, as well as gluten-free pre-prepared meals. After selecting whether you want meal kits or pre-made meals, you can customize the number of dinners you get per week \u2014 these range from two to four meal kits and six to 10 pre-made meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for adventurous cooks\nTechnically, Hungryroot isn\u2019t a meal kit service. Instead, the NBC Select editor-favorite service is a grocery delivery method that offers a lot of the same benefits and customizations as other meal kits on this list \u2014 you take an initial quiz on your preferences and dietary needs, and Hungryroot creates a personalized grocery plan. In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries you order. You can also edit your delivery every week in case you want a specific ingredient or food item.\nWith the ability to choose the type of meal you want (breakfast, lunch or dinner) and to customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot essentially \u201callows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,\u201d says Leonard.\nThe biggest factors to consider when shopping include the price per meal/serving, the quality of the ingredients, the amount of time you\u2019re willing to dedicate and your own cooking ability.\nPricing\nThe price of meal kit delivery services varies based on several factors, including the quality of meals and ingredients you\u2019re getting, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the meal plan you choose. More budget-friendly services like EveryPlate and Dinnerly will typically cost around $5 per serving, while most other popular services like HelloFresh will cost anywhere between $8 and $11 per serving. If you\u2019re looking at more premium or diet-specific services like Sunbasket and Green Chef, they will cost you approximately $12 to $15 per serving.\nTake advantage of trial offers, says Daniel Shumski, a recipe developer and cookbook author. \u201cSo many meal kits and delivery services offer great introductory prices \u2014 it\u2019s worth trying around to find one that fits your taste and budget,\u201d he says.\nTime\nThe time you\u2019re willing to allocate to preparing, cooking and plating your food can help determine which meal delivery service is right for you. If you\u2019re choosing a plan that sends you all the ingredients, you should be prepared to take the time needed to prepare each dish, says Christine Wansleben, owner and culinary director at Mise En Place, which offers cooking classes, private events and more. You\u2019ll also need to ensure you\u2019re cooking the meals as soon as possible since the ingredients can be easily perishable, she adds.\nFor those who don\u2019t have as much time during the week, ready-to-eat meal delivery services are typically the best option.\nQuality of the ingredients\nGenerally, meal delivery services have specific rules and procedures in place to ensure their ingredients are high-quality and trustworthy, according to the experts we talked to. But if you\u2019re extremely particular about the freshness and origin of your ingredients, you should likely skip these services and shop on your own.\nFor those looking to meet specific nutritional goals, Moskovitz recommends paying attention to the individual ingredients in each meal plan, the nutrition facts and the portion sizes. \u201cDon\u2019t just assume that because it\u2019s homemade or marketed as \u2018healthy\u2019 that it\u2019s the healthiest option for you,\u201d she says.\nDietary restrictions\nCertain meal delivery services will offer a variety of options for those with dietary restrictions. However, Resnick notes there\u2019s one caveat: Those with medical issues, such as shellfish allergies or celiac disease, should be mindful of possible cross-contamination.\n\u201cCompanies are usually forthright about shared equipment, but eaters with food intolerances should exercise caution,\u201d she says. \u201cThat said, for special diets that are usually choice-based, such as veganism or low carb, I think these services are an excellent choice.\u201d\nDelivery dates and times\nBefore committing to a specific plan, you should consider when you\u2019ll be able to receive these meals to avoid ingredients spoiling or not getting delivered, according to Resnick. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery \u2014 if you know you won\u2019t be there, most services will let you skip a week (but keep in mind there is usually a cutoff time to select this option).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "Because I have a few dietary restrictions, I often get stuck in what I call the \u201csafe zone\u201d when it comes to cooking \u2014 I have the tendency to make the same dishes over and over again because I know they align with my gluten-free, pescatarian diet. Even when I\u2019m sick of them, I\u2019ll revert back to the handful of recipes I know best, especially because it makes grocery shopping easy. Meal delivery services always seem like an ideal solution, but I was discouraged after trying a few and feeling limited by their two or three \u201cspecial diet\u201d options. That is until I tried Sunbasket.\nSunbasket develops its dishes for people with dietary restrictions like me \u2014 it has over a dozen gluten-free, paleo, vegan, dairy-free and soy-free meal kit options to choose from each week. I tried the meal delivery service for a week and found myself feeling empowered to cook with flavors I do not typically gravitate toward, plus I was less stressed about cooking dinner overall.\nBelow I\u2019ll share my experience trying Sunbasket, including what to know about pricing, delivery schedules and menu options.\nSKIP AHEAD What is Sunbasket? | How much does Sunbasket cost? | How I tried Sunbasket | My experience with Sunbasket | Who is Sunbasket best for? | How does Sunbasket compare to competitors?\nSunbasket is a meal delivery service that caters seasonal-ingredient focused meals to those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes friendly. The company offers meal kits and prepared meals (which it calls fresh and ready meals), both of which you can add to your weekly delivery. You aren\u2019t tied to hitting a quota for either \u2014 for example, there\u2019s no rule about choosing at least one meal kit per delivery. The meals ship fresh inside a box with ice packs so they stay fresh in transit.\n- Meal kits serve two or four people, depending on which ones you select, and include options like seared salmon with artichoke-olive tapenade and fettuccine bolognese with garlic-sauteed baby broccoli. Meal kits come with pre-portioned ingredients, including some organic produce and seasonings, and recipes that walk you through the cooking process.\n- Fresh and ready meals are single-serve prepared dishes you pop in the microwave or oven before eating them. Options include huevos rancheros with spiced pinto beans and brown rice, and beef and cheddar chili mac, for example.\nSunbasket Meal Delivery Service\nSunbasket also somewhat functions as an online grocery store. It sells a la carte products like meat, seafood, pre-packaged snacks, soups and bottled smoothies you can add to your order, helping you cross a few items off your grocery list that you might usually shop for at your local market.\nSunbasket operates on a subscription-based model. It delivers meals weekly and most customers can schedule delivery on any day from Sunday to Thursday, but there may be restrictions based on your zip code. By Wednesdays at 3 p.m. ET, you have to select the meals \u2014 either meal kits, prepared meals and/or a la carte grocery items \u2014 you want to receive for the upcoming week.\nYou also can skip weeks at any time or change your delivery address from one week to the next. For instance, if you want to have meals delivered at your home one week and a family member\u2019s home while you\u2019re there for the holidays, you just have to update your delivery address before the Wednesday deadline. It\u2019s free to cancel your subscription at any point.\nMeal kits start at $11.49 a serving, and fresh and ready meals start at $9.99 per serving, but each one is priced differently. That means instead of paying a flat fee each week, you\u2019re charged based on the individual prices of the meals you choose \u2014 each order has a $45 minumim. Meals with meat or seafood are typically a few dollars more than vegetarian and vegan meals. Shipping is free for your first box, but costs $9.99 per box for subsequent orders.\nTo try Sunbasket, the brand sent me three meals: two meal kits, salmon with pistachio-herb dressing and warm potato salad and blackened sole with turmeric cauliflower and artichoke-spinach dip, and one fresh and ready meal, sichuan glass noodle bowl with plant-based Impossible beef. I tried everything over the course of a week. I cooked the meal kits for dinner in my small New York City apartment kitchen. I warmed up the premade meal for dinner in my microwave. Since I don\u2019t have a dishwasher, I hand-washed all my dinnerware, cookware and kitchen utensils by hand.\nI follow a gluten-free, pescatarian diet and chose Sunbasket dishes that align with it. I live alone, usually just cooking for myself, and am confident in the kitchen from my many years of cooking experience. I typically meal prep a low-effort dinner for the work week on Sunday or Monday nights, and cook something a bit more elaborate at least once during the weekend.\nFrom start to finish, or, in other words, from selecting my meals all the way through cooking and actually eating them, my experience trying Sunbasket was seamless. Here are some of my main takeaways from each part of trying the meal kit delivery service.\nSelecting meals\nThe week prior to receiving my Sunbasket shipment, I chose what meals I wanted to receive via the company\u2019s website. As someone with dietary restrictions, I expected this process to take a while. With other meal delivery services, I usually have to scroll through the menu, click on each meal individually and read through its ingredient list to make sure it didn\u2019t include any meat or gluten. This was a straightforward process thanks to the website\u2019s detailed filters. I selected \u201cgluten-free\u201d from a dropdown menu so I only saw meals that matched the specific diet I follow, and I could easily tell which ones had seafood or were vegetarian based on the pictures and names of each dish. I also used the \u201cunder 20 minute\u201d filter to find dishes that don\u2019t take much time to cook, which helped me identify options I could quickly whip up after a work day.\nI browsed through the two dozen-or-so options, and I clicked on ones that looked appealing to get a summary of how many people it serves, how many calories it contains and how long it takes to prepare. All of these details helped me select my meals quickly.\nDelivery\nMy Sunbasket box arrived on a Wednesday afternoon, just as I expected it to. The box was insulated and packed with dry ice, so all the food inside was cold to the touch when I opened it. Meal kits came packed in individual labeled brown paper bags with recipe cards. The bags made Sunbasket\u2019s meal kits easy to store and organize in my refrigerator, and it kept the ingredients for each dish separate so I didn\u2019t mix them up. I appreciated that the seafood for each meal kit was not included inside the bags. Instead, it came packed underneath the bags, closest to the dry ice, keeping it the coldest out of everything in the box. Sunbasked packed my fresh and ready meal separately from the meal kits \u2014 it looked like a prepared meal I\u2019d grab from the grocery store.\nMeal kits\nCooking usually feels like a production since it can involve so many steps and pans, including prepwork and cleaning. But Sunbasket\u2019s meal kits made cooking feel hassle-free and doable even after a long day.\nThe recipe cards each meal comes with have specific directions for every step of the process, and I found them easy to follow. It felt like they were written for home chefs of all levels \u2014 Sunbasket recipes didn\u2019t use technical language or ask me to do any complex slicing and dicing. There\u2019s also a section of the recipe cards that told me what ingredients I\u2019d need to grab from my pantry (usually just salt, pepper and olive oil) and what kitchen gadgets I should have handy. This served as a checklist for me and I made sure I put everything on my counter prior to cooking so I didn\u2019t have to go searching for it later on. Recipe cards also provide estimated cook times for each dish, which I found to be accurate for both dishes I made.\nThe ingredients that came in my meal kits were fresh and in great condition. Everything was pre-portioned, so I didn\u2019t have to measure a single ingredient, which was one of my favorite parts of the Sunbasket experience. Not having to use measuring cups or a kitchen scale saved me time and reduced the number of dishes I had to clean afterward. It also meant I could cook with ingredients I love but don\u2019t always want to buy a full container of at the grocery store. For example, the salmon dish I made came with just enough capers for the dish but didn\u2019t leave me with extra that would go to waste. Some of the ingredients I used came pre-prepped, too. The salmon dish, for instance, came with roasted pistachios so I didn\u2019t need to roast them myself. This eliminated a step of the cooking process, saving me a lot of time and making the recipe much simpler. Fresh and ready meals\nBoth dishes I cooked were delicious, flavorful and were filling \u2014 each one was portioned for two servings. The particular recipes I chose forced me to use ingredients that aren\u2019t in my regular rotation, like turmeric and artichoke dip, and make foods that aren\u2019t typically top of mind for me, like potato salad. I live alone, so I ate one portion the night I cooked and saved the second portion to eat the next day. The meals I made reheated well, plus not having to cook two days in a row was an added bonus.\nFresh and ready meals\nI didn\u2019t know much about Sunbasket\u2019s prepared meals prior to trying the meal delivery service, and they ended up being what I was most surprised by. Their main perk is convenience \u2014 all I needed to do to get dinner on the table was peel off the container\u2019s lid, transfer the prepared food to a bowl and microwave it. My meal was ready in less than five minutes, and knowing that it was waiting for me inside my refrigerator made me less stressed about the evening ahead. I did not dread coming home, standing over a pot for half an hour and then spending double the amount of time cleaning up like I sometimes do.\nThere\u2019s a smaller selection of fresh and ready meals for customers to choose from compared to the meal kits, but still plenty of options for those with varying dietary restrictions. I opted for a noodle bowl with Impossible Beef, which in the past I\u2019ve felt intimidated to try because I do not know how to cook with it. Since Sunbasket did the cooking for me, it felt more accessible and allowed me to try a food I probably wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.\nMy noodle bowl came in what looked like a paper takeout container with a sealed lid. It wasn\u2019t greasy, heavy or oily like some prepared meals can be, and felt better than ordering takeout because its container had a detailed nutrition label on the back, ensuring I knew exactly what ingredients it was made with. The label also directed me to eat the dish within three days; knowing this was helpful so I could plan when to eat it. While I ate the noodles for dinner, I could have easily thrown the container in my lunchbox and microwaved it at the office for lunch.\nBased on my experience, Hands down, Sunbasket is best for individuals or two-person households with dietary restrictions. You can easily filter meals by your specific dietary preferences, which makes choosing options quick and easy. Since the dishes are largely centered around seasonal produce, anyone looking for a meal delivery service that has healthy options and hassle-free cooking would benefit from a Sunbasket subscription.\nIf you\u2019re just feeding yourself, you can go with the single-serve prepared dishes or select meal kits that make two servings so you have leftovers for the next day. If you\u2019re feeding yourself and one other person, the meal kits make enough food for two filling portion sizes. You can double up on meal kits if you need to feed four people instead of two, but that makes your weekly delivery double the price.\nWhen it comes to cost, Sunbasket pricing can be on the more expensive side compared to competitors like Purple Carrot, Blue Apron and HelloFresh. The price per serving for meal kits is about $11.00 for Purple Carrot, $10.99 for Blue Apron and $9.99 for HelloFresh \u2014 with Sunbasket, the price per serving for meal kits can be anywhere from $11.49 to $24.49. If you\u2019re shopping on a budget, you can be particular about which dishes you choose by paying attention to the price listed under each meal\u2019s name on the menu.\nZoe Malin is an associate updates editor at NBC Select who covers the food and beverage space, including stories on chocolate, salt, olive oil, honey, nonalcoholic wine, nonalcoholic spirits and coffee subscriptions. For this article, she tried Sunbasket\u2019s meal delivery service for a week. The brand sent her three meals to try.\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date."

      "text": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "Whether you\u2019re eating at a restaurant or shopping for groceries, there\u2019s usually no shortage of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. Meal delivery services are no exception: Many popular meal kits and ready-made meals offer flexible plans to fit most dietary restrictions, including vegetarian, gluten-free and dairy-free diets. Meal delivery services that include vegetarian and vegan plans can provide you with easy-to-cook or ready-made meat-free meals and prevent you from having to sprint to the supermarket each week.\n\u201cNowadays, there are meal delivery services specifically catered towards more challenging dietary restrictions \u2014[they] can make it easier to find meals you can safely tolerate when you can\u2019t always rely on unfamiliar restaurants,\u201d says Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group.\nIf you\u2019re ready to sign up for a meal delivery plan but don\u2019t know where to start, I spoke to nutritionists and recipe developers about services that they think are worth considering and compiled their favorite ones that include vegetarian and vegan plans. I also rounded up meal delivery services I and other NBC Select staffers have tried and love.\nSKIP AHEAD How I picked the best vegan and vegetarian meal delivery services | Best vegan and vegetarian meal delivery services | Why trust NBC Select?\nWhen shopping for a vegan- or vegetarian-friendly meal delivery service, our experts recommend keeping in mind the following factors:\n- Plant-based plans: Look for services that offer plant-based or fully vegan meal plans. Many services will offer several vegan and vegetarian options within their weekly menu, and you can update your preferences to automatically show these meals.\n- Serving size: If you\u2019re feeding multiple family members who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, you\u2019ll want to consider meal kits with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings). If you\u2019re just feeding yourself, it\u2019s probably best to select a single-serve prepared meal.\n- Customizability: Browse services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several vegan and vegetarian options that you can select or swap in.\n- Delivery dates and times: Many services will offer customizable plans to choose which days (and sometimes times) you want to receive your kit. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed.\nEach of the following meal delivery services was recommended by our food experts and/or NBC Select editors. All of them offer either completely plant-based vegetarian or vegan services, or they offer specific plans to fit one of these lifestyles. To make your browsing easier, I note the starting price, serving size and number of meals provided by each service.\nBest overall: Sunbasket\n- Both meal kits and pre-made\n- Nine meal plan options\n- Good vegetarian variety\n- Additional shipping fee\nSunbasket has both meal kits and pre-made, non-frozen meals (although you can freeze some of them to cook later, in line with the brand\u2019s cooking instructions). NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin tried Sunbasket for a week and loved how varied the options were for her gluten-free and pescatarian diet. \"I can usually only eat one or two offerings off a meal delivery service\u2019s weekly menu. But with Sunbasket, there were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from,\u201d she says. Malin also loves the service's pre-made meals, which taste like homemade meals without needing to put in the work, she says.\nSunbasket has a variety of options that you can, depending on whether you eat meat or strictly follow a plant-based diet, says Moskovitz. One of the service\u2019s nine meal plans is the vegetarian plan, which comes with a variety of meal kits to choose from that are focused on protein, good fats and fiber, according to the brand. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to just one type of plan, Sunbasket lets you mix and match its Fresh & Ready plan with over a dozen meal kits from its weekly rotating menu.\nCost: starting at $12 for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: single-serve, 2 or 4 for meal kits | Number of meals: 4 to 10 per week\nBest for beginners: Blue Apron\n- Good for beginners\n- Single-serve available\n- Good variety\n- Not for very large families\nBlue Apron has a number of weekly menu items based on your selected meal plan. Its vegetarian plan offers nutritionist-approved recipes made with fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds and more, which can be created with or without dairy products, honey and eggs, according to the brand. The plan serves two people and includes two to five meat-free recipes per week (depending on your plan preferences), most of which you can prepare in 25 to 35 minutes, according to Blue Apron.\nCost: starting at $8 per serving with an additional $10 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week\nBest budget-friendly: HelloFresh\n- Budget-friendly\n- Ability to swap proteins\n- Easy to follow recipes\n- Nothing to note at this time\nI recently reviewed HelloFresh and it quickly became one of my favorite services \u2014 I love that the recipes are easy to follow (which, as a non-cook, is key for me) and the meal options are both tasty and varied. \u201cHelloFresh offers quick and easy chef-curated recipes, they use fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients and [they] offer vegan and vegetarian options,\u201d says Lisa Young, adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.\nThe meal kit service has over 30 recipes to choose from each week, and you can customize your plan with protein-specific preferences: beef-free, pork-free, seafood-free and veggie. Though choosing the veggie preference doesn\u2019t change the weekly rotating menu HelloFresh provides, it does ensure that you automatically receive meat-free meals for that given menu week.\nThe brand offers 10 veggie meals (including one vegan meal) within its Classic Plan each week \u2014 vegetarian recipes can also be made vegan by opting to remove certain ingredients like cheese or yogurt, according to the brand. The veggie and vegan meals are labeled under each recipe, so you can see which recipes fit your dietary needs when crafting your menu each week.\nCost: starting at $9 per serving with an additional $11 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 | Number of meals: 2 to 6 per week\nBest health-conscious: Splendid Spoon\n- Healthier options\n- Snacks available\n- Has smoothies and detox shots\n- Additional shipping fee\n- Vegan only\nSplendid Spoon has a menu of more than 50 healthy, ready-made vegan meals and snacks to choose from, including smoothies, soups and entrees, all of which have no meat, dairy or animal byproduct. You can order subscription boxes of five meals or more. The service also offers a five-day detox program, in which you get five days worth of meals.\n\u201cI recommend Splendid Spoon for anyone who wants healthy meals in a flash \u2014 they taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The brand sent me a few options of their smoothies, entrees, detox shots and soups to try out, and I loved the variety of flavors. The soups and entrees are also easy to prepare, and I can freeze them to eat later (which is great if I'm traveling that week). The smoothies, which come in more than a dozen delicious flavors, kept me full throughout the day, so I didn't find myself binging on unhealthy snacks in the afternoon. The soups were my favorite part of the service: Not only did they taste great, but they also come in fairly large portions, so they were filling and served as a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner.\nSplendid Spoon lets you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, biweekly, every three weeks or monthly.\nCost: Starting a $10 with $13 shipping (free if you order 10 or more meals) | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 5, 10 or 15 per order\nBest all plant-based meals: Purple Carrot\n- Plant-based\n- Ready-to-serve meals\n- Can't choose delivery day\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, both of which are fully plant-based and vegan. The meals are a perfect mix of familiar and innovative, says Resnick, who adds that, \u201cit\u2019s an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism.\u201d You can customize the number of prepared dinners you get per week \u2014 which range from six to 10 frozen meals \u2014 or choose three or four recipes from its weekly rotating menu for meal kits each week. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nCost: starting at $11 per serving for meal kits and $13 for prepared meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 2 to 4 for meal kits and 6 to 10 for pre-made meals\nBest ready-made vegetarian meals: Factor\n- Quick and easy\n- Pre-made meals\n- Choice of 5 plans\n- Options can be overwhelming\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 27 pre-prepared meals designed by dieticians \u2014 you can choose the service\u2019s Veggie + Vegan plan for plant-based recipes that are free of all animal products, including meat, fish, eggs and dairy, according to the service. I tried Factor for a week and found it quick, convenient and tasty, which is great for busy weekdays when I don't have time to cook. Young also recommends this service specifically because it caters to a number of diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nCost: starting at $11 per serving with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 6 to 18 per week\nBest splurge: Sakara\n- Goal-specific programs\n- Multi-day plans\n- Plant-based and gluten-free\n- Expensive\n- Can't choose delivery day\nAll of Sakara\u2019s ready-made meals are vegan, plant-based and gluten-free, as well as organic and dairy-free, according to the service. \u201cSakara is very popular among my clients because of [its] varied menu, top-quality ingredients and delicious taste,\u201d says Moskovitz. Programs include the Signature Nutrition Program, which comes with up to three meals per day and your choice of two, three or five days, and the Metabolism Reset, a one-, four- or eight-week program that sends you a specifically curated menu for up to five days per week. You can choose to do a one-week trial program if you\u2019re just getting started, or you can pick a recurring subscription program that automatically renews each week with a set menu of meals that rotates weekly and seasonally.\nCost: starting at $28 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 2 to 15 meals per week\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure that all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and with no undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.\n- Lisa Moskovitz is a registered dietitian and the CEO of NY Nutrition Group.

      "text": "The definition of a pantry staple varies from person to person. A baker like myself never lets their jar of rainbow sprinkles get dangerously low, while pasta lovers likely keep multiple jars of red sauce at their disposal. That said, there are a few key ingredients that are true, inarguable essentials, like salt, vinegar and olive oil. You can cook or bake with them constantly, recipes frequently call for their inclusion and not using them would lead to a flavorless, unappetizing meal.\nSince we so heavily depend on them, it\u2019s worth putting in the time and effort to find the best versions of these everyday staples you probably don\u2019t think twice about. To help you do so, I talked to chefs, bakers, recipe developers and restaurateurs about the staples you should always have at home and how to decide which brands to add to your grocery cart, plus some key storage tips and hacks that\u2019ll help you get the most out of your items.\nSKIP AHEAD Olive oil | Salt | Honey | Chocolate | Why trust NBC Select?\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nOlive oil\nIs there a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil sitting next to your oven or stove right now? If so, you better move it. Heat is one of olive oil\u2019s biggest enemies, in addition to light and moisture \u2014 these elements alter olive oil\u2019s quality, flavor and longevity over time. After you buy a bottle or two you love, experts recommend storing them in a cool, dark place, like a cabinet. And whatever you do, don\u2019t decant your EVOO into a clear drizzle bottle \u2014 the darker the vessel, the more protected that liquid gold is.\nSalt\nSalt was once considered so valuable that Roman soldiers were often paid in it \u2014 the term \u201csalary\u201d is derived from this very practice. It\u2019s still a treasured ingredient because it brings out flavor, and there\u2019s numerous types to choose from, like sea salt, kosher salt and table salt. So how do you decide which one to use for your dish? Experts say it comes down to two main factors: what you\u2019re cooking and what stage of the cooking process you\u2019re salting your food in.\nHoney\nHoney won\u2019t cure your seasonal allergies, but it will sweeten your oatmeal, tea or toast. The sticky stuff mainly gets its flavor from the types of flowers and plants bees collect nectar from, which are different across the country. That\u2019s why honey made in New York tastes different from a batch made in Georgia. But where honey comes from isn\u2019t the most important thing to think about while shopping \u2014 first, you need to weigh the differences between filtered and unfiltered options, and whether it matters if you see \u201corganic\u201d on the label.\nChocolate\nWhen it comes to the difference between milk, dark, white and ruby chocolate, it\u2019s a numbers game \u2014 each type is defined by a ratio of ingredients, like cocoa and milk. Even then, there\u2019s variation among categories, so the best way to figure out what you prefer is to try lots of options. As you bring home chocolate to conduct your taste tests, pay extra attention to what you\u2019re storing it next to in your cabinets, experts say. Chocolate easily absorbs odors, and the last thing you want to do is bite into a bar that tastes like garlic.\nI\u2019m a reporter at NBC Select who\u2019s covered food, beverages and kitchen tools for five years, including topics like non-alcoholic wine and spirits, dinnerware sets and cookie-making supplies. I also frequently test related products. For this ongoing pantry staples series, I compiled recent food-related articles I\u2019ve written and rounded up some of our favorite items in each category.\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date."

      "text": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select?

Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes.

Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "Meal kit delivery services have a variety of benefits: They can be a great way to prepare fun and flavorful meals without having to sprint to the grocery store each week. But when it comes to specific dietary restrictions like a gluten-free diet \u2014 which limits the intake of wheat, barley and several other grains \u2014 it can be hard to pinpoint the ones that fit your needs. Fortunately, many meal kits and pre-made meal delivery services offer gluten-free menu items and plans for tasty, creative and easy-to-prepare meals when you\u2019re in a rush.\nTo determine the best meal delivery services with gluten-free options or entirely gluten-free menus, I spoke to nutritionists and dietitians about the best services to try out and highlighted each individual service\u2019s pricing, delivery frequency and meal options.\nSKIP AHEAD How I picked the best gluten-free meal delivery services | Best gluten-free meal delivery services | Why trust NBC Select?\nI spoke to experts about important features to consider when shopping for gluten-free meal delivery services. Here are the most important ones they suggest keeping in mind:\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free or follow any other restrictions, such as a vegan or vegetarian diet, look for meal services that offer a variety of options to fit your dietary needs.\n- Serving size: How many people are you looking to feed that follow a gluten-free diet? If you\u2019re only feeding yourself, it\u2019s likely best to select a single-serve prepared meal. But if you\u2019re also feeding a gluten-free family or partner, browse customizable plans with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings).\n- Customizability: Having a sensitivity or intolerance to gluten, or choosing to follow a gluten-free diet for other personal or health-related reasons, doesn\u2019t mean you have to constantly eat the same meals. Look for services that provide a weekly rotating menu with several gluten-free options that serve you and your needs.\n- Pricing: The price of gluten-free meal delivery services are based on the quality of meals and ingredients, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you\u2019re cooking for and the specific meal plan. However, seeking gluten-free meals shouldn\u2019t mean paying more for your meal plan. While not all services on the market cater to every dietary restriction or need, I\u2019ve selected services that don\u2019t increase the price for gluten-free restrictions.\n- Delivery dates and times: Most services will offer customizable plans to choose which days (and sometimes times) you want to receive your kit, so consider when you\u2019re available to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most will also let you pause plans or skip weeks as needed, which allows you to be more flexible with these services.\nI spoke to experts about their favorite meal delivery services that either provide gluten-free options or have an entirely gluten-free menu. I highlighted their specific recommendations below \u2014 all of which offer pre-made meals or a combination of meal kits and ready-made items \u2014 and noted their costs, serving sizes, and the number of meals they deliver per week.\nBest overall: Sunbasket\n- Gluten-free options\n- Single-serve available\n- Weekly rotating menu\n- Not for larger families\nSunbasket offers both ingredient-based meal kits and pre-made meals, all of which the brand says consist of high-quality ingredients and organic produce. One of Sunbasket\u2019s 10 available meal plans is the Gluten-Free Friendly meal plan, which has five to eight gluten-free options each week. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who follows a pescatarian and gluten-free diet, tried Sunbasket for a week and loved the service's variety of meals and delicious pre-made options. \"The particular recipes I chose forced me to use ingredients that aren\u2019t in my regular rotation, like turmeric and artichoke dip, and make foods that aren\u2019t typically top of mind for me, like potato salad,\" says Malin.\nBoth Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist, and Lisa Moskovitz, CEO of NY Nutrition Group, say Sunbasket is their top choice for healthy meal kit deliveries. \u201cIt has a variety of options that can be modified for carnivores and strictly plant-based eaters alike,\u201d says Moskovitz.\nThe Fresh & Ready option, which comes with single-serve meals you can heat in the oven or microwave in just a few minutes, also has several gluten-free options to choose from. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to a single plan, the service lets you mix and match with over a dozen meals from its weekly rotating menu.\nCost: Starting at $12 for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals, with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 for meal kits, single-serve for Fresh & Ready meals | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week\nBest health-conscious: Splendid Spoon\n- Snacks available\n- Choose frequency of meals\n- Healthier\n- Vegan only\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy, ready-made meals and snacks that include smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and larger dishes\u2014 and everything is gluten-free. You can select a box size of seven, 14 or 21 meals and choose your meals for the week. Your cart will automatically fill with Splendid Spoon\u2019s bestsellers, or you can manually swap in your favorites.\nResnick recommends the service for anyone who wants \u201chealthy meals in a flash.\u201d \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others.\u201d she says. The large selection of juices and smoothies and the convenience of thawing one at a time is also a big plus, says Resnick.\nCost: Starting at $10 per meal and $85 for the plan, with an additional $13 for shipping (free if you order 10 or more meals) | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 5 to 20 meals per order\nBest budget-friendly: Purple Carrot\n- Plant-based\n- Pre-made meals and kits\n- Can't choose delivery day\nPurple Carrot offers both prepared meals and meal kits, so you can choose the level of effort that you want to put into your meals. The meals are all fully plant-based, and Purple Carrot provides several gluten-free recipes to choose from, as well as gluten-free pre-prepared meals.\n\u201cThe meal kits are a wonderful blend of familiar and innovative \u2014 think kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats,\u201d says Resnick. And because the meals are fully plant-based, Purple Carrot can be an easy way for people to \u201cadd more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d she says.\nYou can customize the number of dinners you get per week, which range from two to four meal kits and six to 10 pre-made meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nCost: Starting at $11 per serving for meal kits and $13 per serving for pre-made meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 2 to 4 for meal kits or 6 to 10 prepared meals per week\nBest for beginners: Epicured\n- For multiple dietary needs\n- Snacks and desserts available\n- Expensive\nEpicured allows you to choose from a rotating menu of over 50 pre-made meals spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. All Epicured meals are entirely gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t feature certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest. \u201cThey\u2019re a great option for those with SIBO, IBS or a generally sensitive tummy,\u201d says Moskovitz.\nIf you don\u2019t want to choose individual meals, Epicured also offers several pre-selected programs, including an omnivore, pescetarian and vegetarian program, that helps you ease into a low-FODMAP diet, according to the brand.\nOnce you select your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed \u2014 if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, orders are locked in on Friday afternoons with the same meals you previously selected.\nCost: The average price for each meal is around $15 and shipping is free if your total weekly order is over $100 (if not, the shipping cost depends on the delivery location) | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: As many (or as little) as you want\nBest chef-prepared: Cookunity\n- Multiple plans available\n- For multiple dietary needs\n- Reusable packaging\n- Pre-made only\nHaving a gluten-free diet doesn\u2019t mean you need to sacrifice the joys of dining out. Cookunity offers chef-prepared meals with a wide range of gluten-free options for you to enjoy at home, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week, Resnick says this service is one of her favorites: \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses.\u201d NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri also enjoys it because she can get a variety of delicious meals while still spending about the same amount she\u2019d spent on groceries, she says.\nYou can also filter meals by other dietary restrictions, like dairy-free, high protein, vegan, vegetarian and more.\nCost: Starting at $11 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 4 to 16 meals per week\nBest for multiple dietary restrictions: BistroMD\n- Snacks available\n- Goal-specific plans\n- Meets most dietary needs\n- High shipping cost\nBistroMD offers a specialized gluten-free plan that lets you choose from over 100 gluten-free meals each week, according to the service. The Gluten-Free program provides breakfast, lunch and dinner for your choice of five days or seven days. The service also offers an EATS (Essential and Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for an additional charge. \u201cBistroMD prides itself on being \u2018doctor-designed\u2019 and therefore is more medically therapeutic than most other companies,\u201d says Moskovitz.\nCost: Starting at $7 per meal for the full program 7-day plan and $8 per meal for the full program 5-day plan | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: Five to seven meals per week\nBest splurge-worthy: Sakara\n- Goal-specific programs\n- Plant-based\n- Multi-day plans\n- Expensive\n- Can't choose delivery day\nAlthough Sakara is on the pricier side for a meal delivery service, it offers a large selection of ready-to-eat meals, all of which are gluten-free, organic, dairy-free and plant-based, according to the service. You can choose to do a one-week trial program if you\u2019re just getting started, or you can select a recurring subscription program that automatically renews each week with a set menu of meals that rotates weekly and seasonally. Sakara Life also lets you choose the number of days you want to receive meals (three or five days) as well as which type of meals you would like to receive (breakfast, lunch and/or dinner).\nThe full five-day gluten-free meal plan is a great way to jumpstart your wellness journey, according to Moskovitz. \u201cSakara is very popular among my clients because of [its] varied menu, top-quality ingredients and delicious taste,\u201d she says.\nPrograms include the Signature Nutrition Program \u2014 which comes with up to three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner, depending on your location) and your choice of two, three or five days \u2014 and the 30-Day Reset, a four-week program that lets you choose at least two meals (breakfast, lunch and/or dinner) for up to five days per week.\nCost: Starting at $28 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 2 to 15 meals per week with the brand\u2019s signature plan\nBest guided program: Provenance\n- Goal-specific programs\n- Snacks available\n- Six days of meals\n- Expensive\nProvenance offers ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks that are entirely gluten-free and dairy-free. \u201cThese organic prepared meals are great for those with intolerances, and most of the ingredients are also locally sourced and sustainable,\u201d says Moskovitz, adding that the meals taste as good as they look, based on her personal experience.\nThe service also offers a Provenance Detox program, a six-day nutrition program where you can choose either an omnivore or vegan and plant-based plan.

When you take the initial quiz about your preferences and dietary needs, Hungryroot creates a personalized grocery plan to meet those needs. In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries in your order, and you can edit your delivery every week in case you want a specific ingredient or food item.\nWith the ability to choose the type of meal you want and customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot \u201callows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,\u201d says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan cookware..\nCost: Starting at $65 for three two-serving meals (about $11 per serving), with an additional $7 for plans under $70 | Serving size: 2 to 4 per recipe | Number of meals: 3 to 8 recipes per delivery, in addition to other grocery items\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts.

You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "I used plastic food containers for most of my life \u2014 they\u2019re affordable and accessible at most of the grocery stores I frequent. But, in recent years I\u2019ve learned more about the potential dangers plastic food containers and microplastics pose to my health and the environment. Leaching, which is the process of microplastic getting into food, is one of many reasons I recently turned to non-plastic food containers and cooking utensils.\nHarmful chemicals from some plastic food storage containers, like bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates, can get into our food, especially when heated, according to Tracey Woodruff, an associate professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco. \u201cThere are a lot of different chemicals that are used in the making of plastic or that are in plastic-related materials and these chemicals can leach from the plastic into people\u2019s food,\u201d says Woodruff.\nThese chemicals can lead to an increased risk of infertility, reproductive health issues, cardiovascular disease and more, according to Woodruff. Additionally, researchers have found microplastics in several parts of the human body, including blood and the brain, according to Woodruff.\nWith this in mind, I spoke with experts about how to find a good plastic alternative and what you should look for.\nThe main factor in deciding the best alternatives to plastic food containers is finding a material that doesn\u2019t leach and is safe to put in the microwave and dishwasher. Here\u2019s everything our experts recommend I keep in mind when making this list:\n- Alternative materials: The best and most common non-toxic alternative to traditional plastic is glass, according to Woodruff. Unlike plastic, glass food containers aren\u2019t susceptible to leaching microplastics, making them safer to heat up, eat out of and prepare food in. Most of the food containers on this list are made of borosilicate glass, which is highly resistant to heat, thermal shock and cracking (though not shatterproof). Additionally, I also curated options that have ceramic coatings, which makes them stain resistant and nonstick, as well as containers made from stainless steel. While every container on this list is made from either glass or stainless steel, some of the included lids are made of BPA-free plastic and/or come with a silicone lining to prevent leaking, so some of the sets aren\u2019t entirely plastic free.\n- BPA and PFAS free: BPA and PFAS (sometimes called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d) are molecular chemical additives found in microplastics that some manufacturers use to give plastic durability, heat, oil and stain resistance, according to Paul Anastas, a professor of chemistry and director of the Center for Green Chemistry at Yale University\u2019s School of the Environment. As I mentioned above, chemicals found in microplastics are linked to an increased risk of adverse reproductive health issues in both men and women, lung and colon cancer, metabolic abnormalities, birth defects and more, according to Woodruff. With this in mind, I only included plastic food container alternatives that explicitly mention being BPA and PFAS free and/or 100% plastic free.\n- Use case: In making this list, I tried to find non-plastic food container options that you can use for a variety of purposes, including microwaving, baking, freezing and putting in the dishwasher. While not every option on this list is compatible for all four methods, most of them are dishwasher safe and microwave safe. I noted which purposes each one is best suited for.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the products below are either direct recommendations from NBC Select editors and/or have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon.\nAll of the food containers below are entirely plastic free, including the lids.\nI tested and reviewed Anyday\u2019s microwavable cookware bowls, which are available in multiple sizes and are similar to this set of frosted borosilicate glass containers designed specifically for food storage, instead of cooking (though they\u2019re also oven- and microwave-safe, too.) You\u2019ll get two 2-cup rounded dishes and two 2.5-cup square dishes. The dishes, including the lids, are entirely plastic free, according to the brand, and you can also microwave and bake with the lids, which have vents on top that act as a handle.\nThis set from Urban Green has a 4.1-star average rating from 2,031 reviews on Amazon and comes with five containers: a 0.5-cup, 1.5-cup, 2.6-cup, 3.8-cup and 6.25-cup. They\u2019re entirely plastic free, according to the brand \u2014 the containers are made of heat-safe borosilicate glass and the lids are bamboo. They\u2019re safe to use in the microwave and oven (without the lids) and they\u2019re dishwasher and freezer safe, too, according to the brand.\nThese wraps are made of beeswax, organic cotton, plant oil and tree resin, according to the brand, making them entirely plastic and silicone free. These wraps have a 4.5-star average rating from 10,862 reviews on Amazon and they work in the same way you\u2019d use plastic wrap or aluminum foil, except they\u2019re reusable. The set includes a small, medium and large wrap, which are best for using with solid foods, like sandwiches, loaves of bread and produce. You can also use the wrap as a lid for a bowl with salad. That said, the wraps aren\u2019t suitable for heating and you can only wash them with cold water, according to the brand.\nAll of the food containers below are plastic free, however some of the lids or accessories have BPA-free plastic.\nThis popular set from Caraway comes recommended by NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who loves how well they seal. \u201cI\u2019ve used these containers for over a year almost every day,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re super sturdy and don\u2019t stain, even when I use them to store pasta with red sauce or curry made with turmeric.\u201d It\u2019s made of glass and coated in ceramic, similar to the brand\u2019s cookware. The 9-piece set, includes one large 10-cup square container, ideal for prepping multiple servings of food, two medium, rectangle 6.6-cup containers for individual meals, two small 4.4-cup containers for salads or sides, two small rectangular inserts with a 9-ounce capacity for snacks and two small square inserts with a 4-ounce capacity, compatible for dips and dressings. The set also comes with storage racks you attach to the inside of your cabinet and straps that hold the lid and container together.\nNBC Select editor Mili Godio got this set of glass food containers as a wedding gift and says she can\u2019t \u201cever go back\u201d to her usual plastic Tupperware. \u201cThey\u2019re super durable and stack really nicely on top of each other,\u201d she says. The set comes with 10 containers of different sizes, so there\u2019s one to fit practically anything you need. The lids seal well and protect from spills, too, according to Godio.\nThis set of glass food containers comes recommended by NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinwotiz, who likes the many shapes and sizes included in the set and that the lids seal securely. Plus, the containers themselves are durable and can handle high heat and travel without cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about throwing them in my backpack, in the sink with other pots and dishes, or in the oven and microwave,\u201d says Rabinowitz. The set includes one large 6.3-cup container, two 3.5-cup containers and one 1.6-cup container in both round and square shapes.\nI\u2019ve had this glass set for about two months and I love everything about them. While the lids have plastic on them that isn\u2019t oven safe, the containers themselves are extremely durable \u2014 I\u2019ve baked multiple foods in them (rice, poultry and pasta) all at once in the oven around 400 degrees and they don\u2019t have a single crack. Plus, I baked them with the silicone cover on the bottom (to protect them from damage) and it didn\u2019t melt at all. The lids snap closed and don\u2019t spill, especially when I\u2019ve used them for foods with sauce. I\u2019ve also put both the container and lid in the dishwasher and they\u2019ve fared well and don\u2019t have any damage, even when I use hot water. Since the lids have plastic, I make sure not to microwave or bake with them on.\nThese food containers are made of stainless steel and have food-grade silicone lids. The set has a 4.7-star average rating from 39 reviews at Klean Kanteen and includes a 1.25-cup, 2.8-cup and 6.8-cup container. The smaller containers fit on the inside of the largest container, so you can keep food separated, similar to a bento box, or simply use the largest one as is. Unlike many stainless steel food containers, this set is microwave- and oven-safe since its texture prevents sparking or arcing, according to Klean Kanteen. Aside from the removable divider, the containers are entirely plastic free, according to the brand.\nThis small insulated container is ideal for warm foods since its stainless steel body helps maintain heat. With that said, it isn\u2019t microwave safe. It has a 4.2-star average rating from 2,334 reviews on Amazon and its lid has a top handle, which twists to lock and prevent spills. While it\u2019s best for warm food, you can still use it to store things like salad and vegetables.\nMany plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:\nChoose a material\nGlass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.\nUse case\nIf you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.\nRecycle\nIn addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

      "text": "Admittedly, meal prepping (and cooking in general) was never my strong suit. Figuring out what to cook during the week usually turns into placing an online takeout order. Not to mention I find it almost impossible to find time to cook after a full day of working at the office, running simple errands and going to the gym. To solve my cooking woes, I tried Factor (formerly known as Factory 75), a meal delivery service that offers low-effort, pre-made meals, for a week. Below, I outline my experience with Factor, including what to know about pricing, preparation, delivery schedules and menu options.\nSKIP AHEAD How I tried Factor | My experience with Factor meal delivery | Who is Factor best for? | How does Factor compare to meal delivery service competitors?\nFactor is a meal delivery service that sends prepared meals that you can heat up in 10 minutes or less right to your doorstep. Instead of providing individual ingredients you need to prepare and cook yourself, Factor\u2019s meals come pre-made and ready-to-eat \u2014 all you have to do is heat them up in your microwave or oven. In fact, at just 2 minutes in the microwave and about 7-10 minutes in the oven, the heat-up time is faster than any other prepared meal service I\u2019ve tried. It also has one of the most vast menus I\u2019ve seen in a service. Since the meals are fresh, not frozen, you can store them in your fridge and eat them within seven days, according to the brand.\nThe service has a rotating weekly menu of 35 meals you can choose from, and menus are available to view online whether you have a subscription or not. The meals cater to a number of dietary needs and preferences, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high protein.\nTo try out the service, Factor sent me six meals that I chose from its weekly rotating menu (that changes every week):\n- Shredded Chicken Taco Bowl\n- Smoky BBQ Chicken Breast\n- Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Risotto\n- Shredded Chicken Thigh Cacciatore\n- Herb Cream Cheese Salmon\n- Fusilli and Ground Pork Tomato Ragu\nSince I don\u2019t have any dietary restrictions, choosing my meals was easy and straightforward. I received my meals on a Tuesday and tried them over the course of one week and heated them up in the oven (though you do have the option to heat them in the microwave, which cuts the cooking time by more than half). I placed two meal trays on a sheet pan (since each pre-made meal is a single serving, I made one for myself and another for my partner). At 350 degrees Fahrenheit, the dishes were ready to eat in 10 minutes, which cut my normal cooking time by over 30 minutes to an hour.\nSince I was splitting the meals with my partner \u2014 which meant preparing two meals for dinner a day \u2014 I had enough meals for three nights.\nThe week before my Factor shipment, I chose six meals from the brand\u2019s menu, which is readily available online. The meal selection process is straightforward; the options are varied and range from very basic meals like a shredded chicken taco bowl to more intricate dishes like Louisiana-style shrimp.\nSince I do not have any dietary restrictions or allergies, and I\u2019m generally not a picky eater, I found it a bit overwhelming to choose just six meals from more than 30 meal options, especially when they all looked and sounded good. Not to mention there\u2019s over 60 add-ons, which include snacks, breakfast items like pancakes, drinks like smoothies and additional proteins like salmon and sausage. On the flip side, the sheer number of offerings would be helpful for those who are picky eaters \u2014 there are a good variety of proteins, sides, veggies and meatless options.\nWhen browsing the menu, I like that you can click on a meal and see detailed nutritional information like calories, cholesterol and sugar, any allergens, heating instructions and more. Seeing these details laid out, before I locked in my meals for the week, made the selection process easier, especially since I\u2019m looking to meet specific health goals and intake a certain amount of protein and calories per day.\nI live in a building that doesn\u2019t have a package room or front desk, so perishable deliveries are typically tough for me. Most times, meal delivery boxes cannot get delivered when I\u2019m not at my apartment, or they are placed in the wrong location (like on top of the heater, or in the building next door). However, that wasn\u2019t the case with Factor at all \u2014 delivery was easy and stress-free; it arrived the day after I got the shipping notification, and the Factor box was delivered in good condition directly to my door rather than a random spot at my building\u2019s entrance. This is something I\u2019ve never had happen with any meal delivery I\u2019ve tried before.\nThe meals are packed into an insulated, lunchbox-like container with an ice pack the size of my forearm, so the meals were cold when they arrived. (It helps that I tried this service during the colder winter months, but I could see this packaging holding up in the hot, summer months, too.) They came neatly stacked in the insulated box, which comfortably fit all six meals, so they did not fall over or move around during transit.\nEach meal comes in a plastic container that looks like a combination of a to-go platter and a meal prep container. The main dish and sides are separated, which I appreciate so they don\u2019t accidentally combine while I\u2019m heating it up. To prepare the meals, I removed the film and placed them in the oven for 10 minutes, depending on how hot I wanted them. Admittedly, the meals didn\u2019t look the prettiest in their container \u2014 though they aren\u2019t frozen, they still look like they\u2019ve been sitting for a while through the delivery process. However, when I actually tried the meals, any fears about the taste were entirely dispelled.\nSimply put, the meals taste great. I was initially worried that because they\u2019re pre-made, they would end up tasting like thawed airplane food. But the meals I tried actually tasted fresh, not old, stale or rubbery like other ready-to-eat meals I\u2019ve tried in the past. The herb cream cheese salmon and the caramelized onion and goat cheese risotto, specifically, were my favorites, and they tasted like I had just cooked them myself.\nThe portions for each meal were perfect, in my experience; I found that there was more than enough food for my partner and I to split meals without leaving us feeling uncomfortably full. This is especially great for me since I struggle with portion control if I\u2019m cooking meals on my own \u2014 since each meal comes with exactly a single-serving, I have a lot more self control when eating.\nPerhaps most importantly, I wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with what to make for dinner and consequently spent much less money on takeout orders. Though the service is on the more expensive side in terms of prepared meals (more on that below), it still beats paying for a $20 dish and delivery and tip.\nFactor\u2019s meals last for up to seven days in the fridge, and there is an \u201cEnjoy By\u201d date printed on each of the meal sleeves. Since the food isn\u2019t frozen, I made sure to stay within that time frame, and the meals tasted fresh whether I prepared them on the first day I received them or on the seventh day.\nThe most obvious appeal of Factor is how much time and effort it saves. Those who are on a time crunch throughout the week will definitely benefit from the service since the meals are ready to eat in under 10 minutes, and it\u2019s also great for those who simply don\u2019t like to cook or aren\u2019t too savvy in the kitchen.\nWhat makes Factor work for most people is its range of weekly choices. As long as you\u2019re diligent about checking the online meal cards, picky eaters and those with allergies should have an easy experience with Factor \u2014 each allergen is listed at the very top of the ingredients section for each meal.\nIf you have multiple mouths to feed, it may not be the best option \u2014 the meals are single-serve, so it\u2019s ideal for a single-person household, in my opinion. If you have others in your household, Factor offers 12-, 14- and 18-meal weekly plans, but keep in mind you\u2019ll be paying more per week. If you are just feeding yourself, the lowest number of meals per week you can receive is six, so you\u2019ll be eating Factor meals for the majority of the week if you\u2019re reserving them for dinner.\nI\u2019ve tried multiple pre-made meal delivery services and most are hit or miss \u2014 unlike meal kits, which send you ingredients for each recipe and you cook them yourself, prepared meal delivery services send them pre-made and ready to eat. Factor is one of the better prepared meal services I\u2019ve tried because the food actually tastes fresh when I heat it up, rather than like it\u2019s been sitting for a while.\nIn terms of pricing, Factor ($11 per meal) is consistent with some competitors like Cookunity ($11 per meal), but on the more expensive side compared to other services that offer prepared meal options, including Sunbasket ($10 per meal), Home Chef ($10 per meal) and Blue Apron ($10 per meal).\nFactor was one of the only services that not only gave me no problem with delivery, but also arrived at the exact expected delivery date.\nMost meal delivery services let you skip a week, and Factor is no different \u2014 you can easily skip deliveries via the service\u2019s website as long as it\u2019s before the weekly cutoff (noted on the \u201cmy menu\u201d page when you\u2019re signed into your account). It\u2019s a handy feature if I\u2019m traveling, going out to eat or simply have a different meal plan for the week.\nOne aspect that makes Factor unique is that it lets you schedule a complimentary 20-minute consultation with a registered dietitian to answer questions about your nutrition and diet, including weight management, bulking up and diet revamps.\nUltimately, after trying Factor for a week I found myself less stressed about cooking and I spent significantly less money on takeout. It\u2019s also great for my healthy eating resolution for the year: Each meal lets me track my protein intake, daily carbs and calories, and other health aspects for every meal, so I was eating healthier and feeling better throughout the week.\nMili Godio is an updates editor at NBC Select who covers meal delivery extensively, including prepared, gluten-free and vegetarian meal delivery services. Godio tried Factor meal delivery for a week and considered the quality of the meals, delivery and packaging, preparing instructions and more.\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date."

      "text": "After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.\nI have tried and written about meal delivery services for over four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.\nHere are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service:\n- Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. If you\u2019re feeding a family or partner, consider a meal kit plan with multiple serving sizes (typically ranging from two to eight servings) instead.\n- Dietary restrictions: If you\u2019re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service\u2019s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs.\n- Pricing: The price of meal kit delivery services are based on the quantity of meals you get per week and the quality of ingredients and recipes. More budget-friendly services might not cater to all dietary restrictions or needs, while diet- and lifestyle-specific options typically cost more.\n- Delivery dates and times: Consider your availability to receive your meals to ensure they don\u2019t go to waste. Most services will offer customizable delivery plans to choose what days you want to receive your weekly delivery.\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\nAll of the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.\nBest overall\nGet $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor\u2019s website.\nFactor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.\nI tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient \u2014 after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Though they don\u2019t look the prettiest in their container, the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I\u2019m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.\nExperts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: \u201cFactor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,\u201d says Resnick.\nBest variety\nCookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have the service pick for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.\n\u201cThe convenience is unbeatable \u2014 it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn\u2019t feel limited by the menu at all,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). \u201cThis didn\u2019t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved \u2014 if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,\u201d says Malin.\nCookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. \u201cIt feels like grocery shopping, except I don\u2019t have to push a cart or carry bags,\u201d she says. There\u2019s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: \u201cAll I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,\u201d says Brown.\nYou can flag any allergies or foods you don\u2019t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. \u201cI appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,\u201d says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.\nBest for most dietary restrictions\nBistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you\u2019re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans \u2014 you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you\u2019ll be able to customize which meals you receive.\nThe service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women\u2019s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.\nBest vegan\nPurple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. \u201cBecause it\u2019s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,\u201d says Resnick. She calls the meals a perfect mix of \u201cfamiliar and innovative,\u201d with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.\nMalin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loves the convenience and taste of the meals. \u201cWhen it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they\u2019re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they\u2019re boring. But Purple Carrot\u2019s were genuinely delicious,\u201d says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. \u201cThe pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.\u201d\nYou can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.\nBest for families\nHome Chef\u2019s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

After finding out that I had new food allergies that were quite restrictive on my diet I wanted to seek help in how to better nourish my body with the correct protein, veggies etc. I then sought out Abby and I haven't looked back since. She looks at you as a whole person and what is going on in your life, physically and emotionally and that was exactly what I needed in my life. Thank you Abby!!!\n- Dina, New York City\nI've never felt better! Thank you, Abby!\nI was about to give up on my weight loss goals when I reached out to Abby and I\u2019m so glad I did! As a vegan, I was finding it hard to find the proper balance of nutrients that my body required, therefore had trouble losing weight and was struggling with other health issues. Working with Abby has been both refreshing and rewarding. Abby is knowledgeable, reliable and has developed a personalized plan, which not only has helped me lose weight but also changed my lifestyle and has improved my overall health.\n- Holly, Sea Cliff\nAbby\u2019s Food Court and Abby have literally changed my life!\nAbby's the most kind hearted human who cares about her clients to the core.

She takes on a very tactful approach, one that is well thought out, personal, and approachable. I am undoubtedly someone who loves food, and she has had a naturally ability to help me reframe my mindset about what food truly is - \"Something to nourish yourself with so you can live your life purpose - to have a healthy body and be energized and show up at work and make a difference.\" Abby is a cheerleader, a friend, an absolute expert, patient and knows how to show up for her clients in all the right ways. She has most certainly brought more value to than I could have ever known going into it.\n- Laura, New York City\nAfter my first conversation with Abby, my perspective on healthful eating changed.\nAbby offered concrete suggestions and food options, but that was only part of her counseling. She encouraged me to recognize where my body was in a process and to honor the care it required. Abby\u2019s ability to pair self-love with nutritional guidance is essential to creating healthy eating alongside a healthy mindset. I would encourage everyone, but especially actors and dancers, to work with Abby. She is the balm to an industry that creates shame around body image; Abby teaches you to feed yourself as a way of loving your body! As an added bonus, having followed abbysfoodcourt on Instagram for over a year, she has encouraged me to make low-waste choice that are truly sustainable.

Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. However, it\u2019s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to my experts. The service also has a family plan with four-serving oven-ready meals.\nBefore ordering, you\u2019ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.\nBest gluten free\nSunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don\u2019t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don\u2019t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.\nMalin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. \u201cThere were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe \u2014 I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don\u2019t normally buy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.\u201d\nBest prepared and meal kit combo\nBlue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.\nI tried Blue Apron\u2019s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I\u2019m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Sides like veggies are mixed into the meals rather than portioned separately (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).\nBest for healthy eaters\nSplendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. \u201cThey taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,\u201d says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.\nWhile you can\u2019t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.\nBest for sensitive stomachs\nEpicured\u2019s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don\u2019t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan \u2014 each diet has a \u201cmenu cycle,\u201d which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don\u2019t manually pick your meals, last week\u2019s meals will be sent again).\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.
