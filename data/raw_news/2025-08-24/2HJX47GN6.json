  "content": "Hey, all, and happy Friday! Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility, your hub for news, analysis, and scoops around the future of transportation. To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nI was sad to have missed the Monterey Car Week this year, especially because there were a number of reveals I was interested in, including the all-electric Cadillac Opulent Velocity; the Chevrolet Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo concepts; and Lucid Gravity X reveals. But alas, the sprawling, Champagne-soaked grounds of Quail or the sea of seersucker suits and wide-brimmed hats at Pebble Beach Golf Course were suboptimal landscapes for my newly fractured and boot-encased foot. Next year!\n\nIn the meantime, I thought I would reach out to you, dear reader, to get your forecast on what\u2019s in store for automakers and EV sales in the United States once the federal EV tax credit expires September 30.\n\nMy prediction? Well I don\u2019t really want to taint the results, but I will say this: Automakers are going to have to do something in the short term to attract customers, and not just because of the expiring EV tax credit.\n\nServe Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery robot company, announced earlier this week that it acquired Vayu Robotics, a startup that has developed AI foundation models and a simulation-powered data engine for robots. The companies didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal, but some back-of-the-envelope math and a little bird helped me determine that Serve Robotics paid between $45 million and $50 million for Vayu.\n\nGot a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, Sean O\u2019Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I highlighted a deal between Uber, autonomous vehicle tech startup Nuro, and EV maker Lucid. You can read about that here, but the important piece to remember is Uber\u2019s commitment to make an undisclosed \u201cmultimillion-dollar\u201d investment into Nuro. (Sources told me it is more than the $300 million Uber invested in Lucid.)\n\nNuro has now raised more money in a Series E round that has reached $203 million from a group of new investors that includes Nvidia, existing backer Baillie Gifford, Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, and Pledge Ventures. And a portion of Uber\u2019s investment has gone toward the Series E round.\n\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\n\nARK Invest, Cathie Wood\u2019s firm, invested about $12.9 million in the Chinese autonomous driving firm Pony.ai, according to the company.\n\nGrid Aero, an aerospace startup, raised $6 million in seed funding from Calibrate Ventures and Ubiquity Ventures.\n\nGroup14, a battery materials startup, raised $463 million in a funding round led by battery manufacturer SK with participation from ATL, Lightrock, Microsoft, Porsche, and OMERS. Alongside the round, Group14 also announced it had \u201cacquired full ownership\u201d of a joint venture with SK in South Korea.\n\nOway, founded in 2023 and backed by Y Combinator and General Catalyst, recently closed a $4 million seed round. Read up on the company\u2019s plan to build a decentralized \u201cUber for freight.\u201d\n\nOne update on the Via IPO: Renaissance Capital estimates Via could raise up to $500 million.\n\nRedwood Materials said it is working with Caterpillar to recycle the battery packs from the company\u2019s battery-electric underground loaders.\n\nTesla is planning to introduce in-car voice-assistant functions powered by DeepSeek and ByteDance\u2019s Doubao artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Routing Company, a startup that helps transit agencies match riders with vehicles quickly and cheaply, landed Zoox as its first robotaxi client. Zoox will purchase a nonexclusive license for The Routing Company\u2019s tech and will bring five of the startup\u2019s engineers on board to \u201cadvance the efficiency and scalability\u201d of its fledgling robotaxi service.\n\nVolkswagen faces a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey over the buttons on the steering wheel of its cars, including ID.4. The lawsuit alleges the buttons are too sensitive and too easy to activate unintentionally.\n\nWaymo has been granted a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the first such approval granted by the city. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nIn the world of drones and food, I suppose it was inevitable we would get Zipotle \u2014 a merging of the words Zipline and Chipotle. Zipline, an autonomous drone delivery startup, has partnered with Chipotle to fly digital orders to guests\u2019 locations in the greater Dallas area.\n\nVanity Fair has a lengthy feature on Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana that digs into her past, how she manages, and, as the author notes, her un-Elon style. It\u2019s worth the read and gives me an opportunity to remind you all that Mawakana will be on our stage at Disrupt 2025, which will be held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.",

      "text": "Tekedra Mawakana won\u2019t take the bait, no matter how many times I try. The co-CEO of Waymo, which operates the biggest fleet of driverless cars in the country, is rolling through the streets of downtown San Francisco with me in a modified Jaguar I-Pace. Elon Musk has claimed he\u2019s coming to take down Waymo and its more than 1,500 robotaxis with competing Teslas that can operate in \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d mode\u2014beginning with a 20-vehicle invite-only autonomous taxi service that\u2019s started testing in parts of Austin. In 2019 Musk pledged to have a million Tesla robotaxis in service by 2020. So far, the Austin experiment hasn\u2019t exactly been flawless. Can you believe he\u2019s trying this again? I pepper Mawakana in the back of the Jag. When his \u201cself-driving\u201d cars need a human in the seat to keep from crashing? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she half-whispers, looking out the window. She lets out a quiet challenge to Musk, even as she makes it a point not to say his name. \u201cThere\u2019s zero evidence of anything. And there\u2019s so much talk about it. We have a whole service across many cities, right? It\u2019s not a play to have fanboys. It\u2019s a play to, like, actually change people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nWaymo and Tesla are in the same game, at least from this angle. Mawakana\u2019s company has built an autonomous driver, made of a suite of sensors and software, that can be used in vehicles from multiple car companies; Musk has said that if his cars can\u2019t drive themselves, Tesla is \u201cworth basically zero.\u201d Each is using robotaxis as proof of concept. The similarities end there.\nMawakana, like the business she helps lead, is deliberate, strategic, focused, cautious. Waymo is her one and only company, and she shares the leadership duties. Musk is Musk. Mawakana is a safety obsessive, as is Waymo. Musk is emblematic of the move-fast-and-break-things ideology. While Full Self-Driving Teslas have killed multiple people, Waymo vehicles have not killed a single person. Musk is apparently convinced that all Teslas need to drive themselves are advanced cameras and the right amount of AI. His cars start at $42,000; hers, outfitted with 29 of those cameras plus advanced radar, laser range finders, and acoustic sensors, can cost seven times as much. She\u2019s a lawyer by training and spent much of her career at the nexus of government and technology. Musk, in fairness, also spent time at the nexus of government and technology\u2014130 rocky days. She\u2019s one of a handful of Black female (or Black, or female) chief executives in Silicon Valley; he goes on his social media platform to whine about how \u201cteachers in California spend their time indoctrinating kids in DEI racism & sexism & communism.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine Musk on skates (though he appears to be making good on his promise to build a \u201croller skates & rock restaurant\u201d in Los Angeles). Mawakana says, \u201cI can be found with roller skates and a beach tent in my trunk at all times.\u201d\nIt sounds like a cute study in contrast. Except the future of the global automotive industry\u2014and how we move through cities\u2014could be at stake, depending on which CEO\u2019s vision wins out. Tesla is by far the bigger company, with annual revenue of almost $98 billion and about $7 billion in earnings, compared to an estimated $75 million in revenue and an estimated $1.12 billion in losses last year for Waymo. Mawakana doesn\u2019t have great answers for how many jobs her autonomous vehicles might eventually cost (opponents say it could be millions), or how many people it currently takes to supervise her self-driving fleet (her deputies will only talk about the \u201cminutes of human time\u201d needed for each hour on the road), or the resilience of that fleet when protesters start lighting her robocars on fire (in Los Angeles last June). But when it comes to autonomy, Mawakana is ahead. Waymo is logging at least 250,000 driverless paid rides per week in Austin, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Silicon Valley, more than 10 million such rides overall. Waymo had expanded its operations to Atlanta on the day Mawakana and I rolled through San Francisco together. Miami and DC are next, and Waymo has begun preparation for New York City.\n\u201cShe believes the technology should speak for itself, in customers\u2019 hands, as opposed to telling customers what to believe about the future,\u201d says Alex Roy, a general partner at New Industry Venture Capital and a former executive at Argo, the Ford-backed autonomy company. \u201cThat\u2019s why I call her the un-Elon.\u201d\nMawakana lives a low-key life, at least by Silicon Valley mogul standards. She wasn\u2019t invited to the Gilded Age Bezos wedding in Venice. She doesn\u2019t bowhunt with Zuck, and she\u2019s not joining Sam Altman in his doomsday structures. She lives in the same Bay Area home she bought when she was briefly a VP at eBay, in 2016 and 2017. Her art collection is modest, largely centered around Black and female artists, and is a \u201ccelebration of goddess energy.\u201d She spends a chunk of her weekends going to her son\u2019s basketball games; sometimes she\u2019ll take him to Coachella or Rolling Loud. Vacations often involve a group of girlfriends sailing in the Caribbean or going to EDM festivals. Her big splurge last year was a quick trip to Paris for Vogue World.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been, for a long while, toiling away at this and pretty under the radar,\u201d she says. \u201cI genuinely have come to this through a very different path than most people and have arrived in it in a different capacity. And so, like, you know, it looks different\u201d from the tech-CEO clich\u00e9.\nYet she and Waymo are now central to what is arguably the most important conversation happening in tech, and maybe our broader society too: how far can automated systems go and how much human labor will they replace. And it\u2019s all happening while Mawakana fends off a challenge from the world\u2019s richest man, leading the planet\u2019s best-capitalized carmaker. What happens next?\nI meet Mawakana at Waymo\u2019s nondescript offices on Market Street, in a bland tower that used to be the local headquarters of Chevron Oil. She\u2019s dressed in black jeans and gold Air Jordans. Minutes into our chat, she recalls a moment and lets out a combination of a laugh and a groan. Her only kid recently turned 16 and just got his learner\u2019s permit. So now the driverless-car CEO is teaching her son to drive, and \u201cit\u2019s really stressful to me. Waymos won\u2019t be everywhere before he\u2019s out in the world,\u201d she says. About 40,000 Americans die every year in traffic accidents. Her son may be \u201csuper careful\u201d on the road but that makes him kind of an anomaly. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t that great driving. People are speeding. People are talking on the phone. Their baby\u2019s crying in the back seat. There\u2019s a lot happening.\u201d\nEvery erratic driver multiplies the complexity. The streetscape dials up the confusion: pop-up construction sites, traffic cops in the middle of the road, bikers, swerving scooter riders, potholes, buses, stop signs hidden by trees, club kids pouring out into the night, children running out to grab a lost ball. Making sense of it all\u2014and then reacting to every chaotic element in fractions of a second\u2014has proven to be one of the most challenging problems in computer vision and machine learning. The smartest minds in the profession thought they might be on the verge of solving it 20 years ago. They were wrong.\nI was there in the Mojave Desert in 2004 when the Pentagon\u2019s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, held a million-dollar contest to see which autonomous car could complete a 150-mile course the fastest. Only one made it just past seven miles. A Stanford professor named Sebastian Thrun tricked out a Volkswagen Touareg enough to complete the course the next year. Google tapped Thrun to help develop Google Street View and build an autonomous car for the masses, and that company eventually became Waymo. Every big automaker poured billions into similar projects, even as Waymo pivoted to making sensors and software that would go into other cars. By 2012, Google cofounder Sergey Brin said they\u2019d be ready for the general public in less than five years. Tesla allegedly faked a video of Tesla\u2019s self-driving capabilities to keep up. But Musk still confidently made his predictions, like autonomous cross-country Tesla trips by the end of 2017.\nMawakana would shake her head when she heard Musk talk like this. \u201cNot a snowball\u2019s chance in hell,\u201d she remembers thinking back then. Despite the hype, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving program (and its predecessor, Autopilot) still required a human to take charge in times of trouble, making it closer to cruise control than true autonomy. Nor did Teslas have the array of sensors Waymos did: radar, to make sense of their surroundings in foul weather, and lidar, which relies on laser pulses, to \u201csee\u201d in the dark. And while Musk wanted his Teslas to be able to drive themselves anywhere, Waymo tried to constrain the problem by spending years mapping the streets of individual cities, starting in the Phoenix area. The company spent years more with Waymo-equipped vehicles driving themselves around those streets with humans behind the wheels to watch when and how the robocars screwed up. \u201cIt was when we removed the safety drivers that we realized in 2020 how much further we had to go,\u201d she says. Every edge case and odd situation led to 10 more to figure out. She picks out one: \u201cYou hail the car. We know nothing about you. It\u2019s a four-lane road that you\u2019re standing in front of. We stop in the middle of the block across the street from you. And you\u2019re vision-impaired. What do we do? How do you get to us?\u201d\nIt was too many variables for most of the big carmakers at too high a cost. One by one, they dropped their efforts to build their own mass-market autonomous vehicles. The few that remained began to face a human toll. Teslas running the company\u2019s Autopilot system were involved in 736 crashes over four years, according to federal statistics. Seventeen were fatal. General Motors invested more than $10 billion in Cruise, which had been operating the largest robotaxi fleet in San Francisco. Then one of Cruise\u2019s cars struck a pedestrian and dragged her underneath the vehicle for 20 feet. The outcry was deafening and only grew louder when the company was caught trying to hide details of the incident from federal regulators. GM shut down Cruise\u2019s robotaxi operations in December.\nMawakana and Waymo have managed to avoid those nightmare scenarios so far. Part of that is by staying away from riskier rides: Mawakana and her co-CEO, Dmitri Dolgov, announced an end to an autonomous trucking program in the summer of 2023 to focus on commercial autonomous ride hailing, and two years later Waymo is close to allowing these self-driving cars on highways. Part of it is cultural: Waymo executives told me Mawakana has created an environment where they\u2019re free to hit pause on major developments if they\u2019re not sufficiently safe.\nBut a big part is technical. David Margines, Waymo\u2019s director of product development, shows me a video of a recent almost-incident in December. A young girl falls off her scooter and into a two-lane road. The self-driving car smoothly moves clockwise around her. \u201cWhat do humans do in situations like this? They either turn or they brake,\u201d he tells me, drawing diagrams on a whiteboard. \u201cWhen we were avoiding this, we had a half of a g of deceleration combined with a third of a g of turning at the same time.\u201d It\u2019s a different\u2014and maybe better\u2014way of driving.\nOn my trip with Mawakana around San Francisco, an older man in a floppy hat stepped out in front of the car right as we were rounding a corner near Telegraph Hill; the Jaguar stopped itself with plenty of space to spare. Downtown, when a fire truck was coming up fast in the left lane, the Jaguar quickly dipped from the middle to the far-right lane to give it maximum room.\nHow safe are Waymos, really? Depends on whom you ask, and how. Waymo boasts of having driven 71 million miles without a fatal accident. But the average for human drivers is about 1.2 fatalities per 100 million miles. The company claims its autonomous driver, compared to humans, has 88 percent fewer accidents that result in serious injuries. Research out of the University of California, Berkeley, suggests the robotaxis are about as safe as the average flesh-and-blood Uber driver. Outside safety researchers give Waymo credit for publishing peer-reviewed studies of its data; Tesla, for example, doesn\u2019t do anything like it, and the data Musk\u2019s company does release is debatable at best, these experts say. But the safety researchers I spoke with also contend that Waymo isn\u2019t providing enough information to back up its safety claims. \u201cThey are seen as the most trustworthy player in the industry that is notorious for opacity,\u201d says Carnegie Mellon University engineering professor Phil Koopman. \u201cTheir marketing, PR people have been claiming \u2018saving lives\u2019 for years now, and they do not have enough data to know whether that\u2019s true.\u201d\nI\u2019m the target market for a robocab. I didn\u2019t get my license until I was 26, and that was after failing my first two driver\u2019s tests. My skills behind the wheel, or lack thereof, are legendary in my family. With extensive practice, I can now parallel park\u2014sometimes, if the space has been vacated by a school bus. So yes, I would love a robot chauffeur to take me around. But that comes with a cost.\nDriving is one of the most common jobs in the country, especially for folks without a college degree. There\u2019s something like 3 million full-time truck and delivery drivers, plus millions of more people driving Lyfts, Ubers, and old-school cabs. And while Waymo and other autonomous vehicle companies are concentrating on robotaxis right now, it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not the endgame. The endgame is replacing as many of those humans as possible with a Waymo driver\u2014and to make your car robo-friendly too. The taxis are just a way to train the system. \u201cToday, we\u2019re deploying that in a Jaguar,\u201d says Margines. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it with trucks someday, and we\u2019ll do it on personally owned vehicles.\u201d Which means whatever benefits autonomous driving brings\u2014and I\u2019m convinced there will be many\u2014it will likely cost millions of people their livelihoods. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be driving jobs, and companies like Waymo don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d says Peter Finn, who heads Teamsters Local 856 in Northern California. The state Assembly has passed bills trying to keep a person in commercial vehicles, Finn adds, but Big Tech\u2019s managed to prevent those bills from going anywhere. Waymo alone spent nearly $5 million on lobbying for various issues in California\u2019s last legislative session.\nMawakana says she understands the anxiety. She grew up working-class, the daughter of an airman first class in the US Air Force, in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta. Her uncle Joe Nathan was a truck driver in Mississippi. \u201cIt was a hard job. He ate in that truck, and he lived in the truck, and he died in that truck,\u201d she says. But the best she can do to alleviate Finn\u2019s concerns is to note that there has been a truck-driver shortage in recent years\u2014and to riff about how the horse-and-buggy economy eventually grew into a more vibrant one based around the automobile.\nBut there are downsides to that vision. \u201cIf you give everyone\u2019s car like a robot chauffeur, it would actually have a horrible impact,\u201d says Edward Niedermeyer, author of The Autopilot Effect, a forthcoming book on the Tesla-Waymo competition. \u201cMost of traffic is caused by single-occupant vehicles. Private AVs [autonomous vehicles] would give people zero occupant vehicles. You\u2019d send your car off to deliver stuff. Why would you park the car when it could just circle blocks endlessly and just create traffic.\u201d\nAnd while the company may say it is \u201coptimistic about how autonomous driving technology will create demand for many new businesses and jobs over time,\u201d for now maintaining Waymo\u2019s current fleet takes fewer people than you might think. The company claims in a statement it \u201cdirectly and indirectly supports 2,000+ jobs\u201d in the city and county of San Francisco, but that figure includes jobs \u201cthat benefit from increased economic activity (e.g., retail, hospitality, entertainment).\u201d I was expecting to see a crew of mechanics at the company\u2019s depot on Toland Street. Instead there were just a handful of contractors, swapping out tires and plugging the vehicles into their electric charging stations. The cars mostly drove themselves around the facility and parked themselves when their human caretakers were done with them.\nWaymo also has people working in call centers who can respond to riders\u2019 questions and teams that monitor and can provide guidance to the robotaxis if they get stuck. Exactly how many of these \u201cremote assistants\u201d are doing this work, where they\u2019re located, and how many cars each person supervises neither Mawakana nor anyone else at Waymo will say exactly. All they\u2019ll note is that there are people both in the United States and \u201coutside,\u201d and that, for every hour of vehicle time in San Francisco, Waymo needs \u201conly a few minutes of human time on average.\u201d Tesla may be advertising for \u201cteleoperation\u201d jobs to \u201caccess and control\u201d its supposedly self-driving cars. (An inherently unsafe proposition, experts tell me, because of the lag time involved.) But for Waymos in the United States, Mawakana and her team insist, there\u2019s no off-site steering wheel or joystick for a human to drive the cars from afar.\nIn an earlier job, Mawakana was forced to sit on a far more important secret. US intelligence agencies were sucking up huge amounts of data from commercial internet services\u2014and ordered the companies not to say a thing about it. Mawakana was about a month into a new job as deputy general counsel of Yahoo when Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the security state\u2019s subornment of Silicon Valley started to come out. \u201cOn that day, we couldn\u2019t go out and say to our users, \u2018This is what\u2019s happening.\u2019 Was against the law,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere was an entire ecosystem that was happening on the back end that consumers didn\u2019t even know about.\u201d The disconnect made her seriously uncomfortable. Eventually, she left for eBay, and then for Waymo in 2017.\nShe became the head of global policy. At many tech companies that can be an ancillary role, but policy is critical to Waymo\u2019s expansion. If it couldn\u2019t persuade local governments to let its autonomous cars onto their roads, if it couldn\u2019t build some kind of community comfort with the idea of robots on the streets, Waymo had no business, no commercial future. \u201cI remember going home from the interview and being like, Okay, this is \u2018put your money where your mouth is,\u2019 mama,\u201d she tells me. By 2021 she was named co-CEO.\nThat put her in rarified company. According to a 2024 report from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, less than a quarter of American tech workers are women and less than 8 percent are Black. That hasn\u2019t stopped a slew of MAGA-friendly executives from demanding more \u201cmasculine energy\u201d in the workplace and trying to roll back the diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts of the Black Lives Matter era. \u201cAt every level of my career, I have been one of very few,\u201d Mawakana says. So when Musk and his mates shout that DEI is so dangerous, \u201cit\u2019s like railing against a machine that didn\u2019t yield a lot of results. What it did yield is more voices at the table, more opinions. More is great. It\u2019s been great. It\u2019s been wonderful. But it hasn\u2019t been transformative. And it definitely hasn\u2019t been status quo\u2013threatening.\u201d\nUnder Mawakana, Waymo stood up to a trade organization to make laws more robocar-friendly in state capitals. She got together with groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Foundation for Blind Children so they could help plead the case for Waymos. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t take their seeing-eye dogs into Ubers and Lyfts without being discriminated against,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey didn\u2019t feel comfortable with their 22-year-old daughter after a club.\u201d Still, there was major pushback, especially in San Francisco, where the city attempted to sue state regulators for granting licenses for the robotaxis to operate (a state court rejected San Francisco\u2019s legal challenge in January). But even the city attorney acknowledged that Waymo was a relatively \u201cgood actor\u201d in the field.\nThis is the kind of tiptoeing approach that Tesla fans would ordinarily make fun of. Except Musk\u2019s robotaxi rollout in Austin is more cautious still. The cars may not go out in inclement weather and they won\u2019t operate downtown, at least not at first. Finally, these driverless cars will have, in addition to the teleoperators, a \u201cTesla safety monitor sitting in the right front passenger seat.\u201d Musk is once again promising those million robocabs are coming soon. Perhaps this time he\u2019ll be proven right. But for now, Alex Roy notes, \u201cTesla is literally deploying, like verbatim, the deployment strategy used by Waymo.\u201d With one key difference: Mawakana has been doing this for years, and Musk is millions of miles behind her.\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nHow a Death Row Murderer Exposed One of America\u2019s Most Prolific Serial Killers (Part 1)\nHow a Death Row Murderer Exposed One of America\u2019s Most Prolific Serial Killers (Part 2)\nWhen Barneys Ruled New York\nZen and the Art of Being Jennifer Aniston\nEliot Spitzer Speaks His Piece\nOn Set of The Pitt\nThe Singular Style of Princess Anne\nA Mission Divided at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\n24 TV Shows We Can\u2019t Wait to See This Fall\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "Battery materials startup Group14 announced Wednesday it has closed a $463 million funding round to expand its manufacturing footprint, a sign that investors remain confident in the future of electric vehicles.\nThe startup manufactures silicon anode materials, which significantly boost the storage capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Group14 currently operates three factories, two in the U.S. and one in South Korea.\nDespite headlines about softening demand growth for electric vehicles, the global market for lithium-ion batteries remains strong. Over the next decade, it\u2019s expected to grow more than 15% annually, quintupling in size, according to Precedence Research. And automakers and investors are still in pursuit of companies working on technology that will make EVs more efficient and affordable.\nThe round was led by battery manufacturer SK with participation from ATL, Lightrock, Microsoft, Porsche, and OMERS. Alongside the round, Group14 also announced it had \u201cacquired full ownership\u201d of a joint venture with SK in South Korea, which includes its BAM 3 factory. SK had owned 75% of the JV. When asked whether the value of the JV transaction was included in the Series D total, Group14 spokesperson Kristen Caron said the company was \u201cnot disclosing any additional details about the round.\u201d\nSilicon has long been targeted as a potential replacement for graphite, today\u2019s go-to anode material, because it can hold up to 10 times more electrons. But with every charge and discharge, pure silicon anodes have a tendency to crumble as the material expands and contracts, something that graphite is more resistant to.\nStartups like Group14 and its competitor Sila have accommodated silicon\u2019s propensity to swell by creating structures that keep silicon in place without sacrificing the anode\u2019s overall integrity. Group14\u2019s material is a scaffold with internal voids that hold the silicon, giving it room to expand.\nThe material itself can be blended with graphite or replace it entirely. Many companies still opt for the latter because of graphite\u2019s inherent stability. But the more silicon used, the more energy a single cell can store. Group14 says its material can improve energy density by up to 50% and cut fast-charging times below 10 minutes.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Nvidia is among a group of new investors to back Nuro \u2014 which develops self-driving software for delivery and ride-hailing services \u2014 in a funding round that has reached $203 million.\nThe Silicon Valley startup announced Thursday that several investors, including existing backer Baillie Gifford, added another $97 million to its Series E round. New investors include Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia, and Pledge Ventures. Uber, which last month said it would make a \u201cmulti-hundred-million dollar\u201d investment in Nuro as part of a broader deal with the electric car maker Lucid, also participated.\nNvidia\u2019s investment follows years of technical collaboration with Nuro. The startup uses Nvidia GPUs for its large-scale data processing and model training, and its latest compute model is built on the Nvidia Drive AGX Thor platform.\nThe first $106 million tranche of Series E funding was announced in April. Investment accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN participated in that first block.\nNuro has raised $2.3 billion to date. Its Series E post-money valuation is $6 billion. That\u2019s a 30% drop from its $8.6 billion valuation in 2021 when Nuro raised $600 million in a Series D round.\nMuch has changed in the past four years for Nuro and the broader autonomous vehicle industry. Like most startups in the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nuro was forced to examine its business model after economic conditions shut off the once-free-flowing tap of capital and ushered in a period of consolidation.\nNuro went through several rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023 before overhauling its business strategy. In 2024, Nuro scrapped plans to own and operate a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, and instead focused its efforts on licensing its technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Under the deal, Uber invested $300 million in Lucid and agreed to buy \u201cat least\u201d 20,000 of the EV maker\u2019s Gravity SUVs over the next six years.\nUber also said it would invest an undisclosed \u201cmulti-hundred-million dollar\u201d amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch the amount is more than Uber\u2019s investment in Lucid.\nA portion of Uber\u2019s investment has gone toward the Series E round. The remaining investment will be parceled out to Nuro as the company hits certain milestones.\nNuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson said in a statement that the company is well-positioned to continue its next phase of growth with the new capital. He added that the company, which employs about 700 people, will focus on delivering new commercial partnerships to realize autonomy at global scale.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

      "text": "Waymo has been granted a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the first such approval granted by the city. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing \u201cimmediately.\u201d\nThe company is allowed to deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace SUVs in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. Waymo\u2019s vehicles must have a trained safety operator in the driver\u2019s seat, with at least one hand on the wheel at all times. The company cannot pick up passengers (since it would need a license from the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission) and it has to regularly meet with and report data to the city\u2019s Department of Transportation (DOT), according to the mayor\u2019s office.\nThe permit brings Waymo one step closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city, which would be arguably its most challenging to date. The company currently operates in San Francisco, Austin, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. All of those are warm-weather cities, and only San Francisco comes close to the complexity of operating in New York City.\nWaymo has spent years poking at the Big Apple, starting in 2021 when it used its Chrysler Pacifica minivans to manually map the city. And receiving this permit was no sure thing. The company applied in June, and has spent the last few months meeting with lawmakers and local organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\nThe permit is part of a new autonomous vehicle safety regime launched by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024. To apply, Waymo had to coordinate with first responders, as well as submit a testing plan to the local DOT, along with a safety plan that documented the qualifications of the vehicle operators, among other things. Waymo has also obtained the \u201cnecessary permits\u201d from the New York state Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\nWhen Waymo\u2019s trial period ends in late September, it will have to apply for an extension if it wants to keep testing.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions.

      "text": "Uber is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.\nUnder the deal announced Thursday, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid and separately buy \u201cat least\u201d 20,000 of the EV maker\u2019s new Gravity SUV over the next six years. Those EVs will be equipped with Nuro\u2019s autonomous vehicle system, and the vehicles will be owned and operated by Uber or its third-party fleet partners. Uber plans to launch a robotaxi service in a major U.S. city next year.\nProduction of these modified Lucid Gravity vehicles is expected to begin in late 2026, according to a regulatory filing.\nUber is also investing an undisclosed \u201cmulti-hundred-million dollar\u201d amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement said the amount is more than Uber\u2019s investment in Lucid.\nThe agreement between the three companies was a year in the making, Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson told TechCrunch.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s probably a reflection of how meaty it is,\u201d he said, adding that Uber was looking to make a very large commitment to a robotaxi program, and spent time with almost every AV company to find the most suitable partner.\n\u201cWe were thrilled that, at the end of all that, we were the partner that was chosen,\u201d he said.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nFerguson said engineers at Lucid and Nuro have already made progress on the project. The companies have been testing a prototype driverless vehicle on a closed track at Nuro\u2019s proving grounds in Las Vegas.\nLucid\u2019s Gravity SUVs are ideal because the vehicles are already equipped with the kind of hardware redundancies required for a Level 3 automated driving system, Ferguson said. (Level 3 is a designation by the Society of Automobile Engineers that allows the driver to take their eyes off the road and hands off the steering wheel in certain conditions.)\nThe Nuro-equipped Gravity vehicles will be Level 4, which means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions without human intervention. Still, the added redundancies made it \u201calmost a delight\u201d as Nuro integrated its self-driving system into the vehicles, Ferguson said.\nUber has spent the past two years locking in partnerships with autonomous vehicle technology companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world. The ride-hailing giant has partnered with more than 18 companies globally, across ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, WeRide, and Baidu.\nUber\u2019s most high-profile partnership in the U.S. \u2014 and one that is commercially operating today \u2014 is with Waymo. The companies offer a \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d service in Austin and Atlanta.\nThis deal illustrates just how much money Uber is willing to invest in hopes of tapping into, and even dominating, the burgeoning autonomous vehicle market.\nThe agreement is also validation for Nuro, which has raised more than $2 billion from high-profile investors since it was founded in 2016. The startup initially focused on applying its AV tech to a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, which it had developed. But the company burned through its cash reserves, and after facing difficult capital markets, conducted multiple rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023.\nLast year, Nuro pivoted its business strategy to focus more on the startup\u2019s core autonomous driving technology. It ditched the low-speed delivery model and set out to license its autonomous vehicle technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies. The decision to only focus on developing and licensing the AV system allowed Nuro to extend its runway from 1.5 years to 3.5 years, the company said at the time.\nBut the company still needed a licensing deal to prove its shift. The Uber agreement, along with several others in the works, according to Ferguson, suggests the pivot is paying off."

      "text": "'It's A Car, Not A Phone': VW Sued Over Touch Buttons Involved In Fatal Crashes\nVolkswagen's controversial capacitive buttons have earned it a lawsuit after numerous NHTSA complaints and crashes.\n- VW faces a new lawsuit over its use of capacitive touch controls.\n- The lawsuit claims that the touch areas on the steering wheel are too easy to activate and have become safety hazards.\n- At least one VW executive has acknowledged that capacitive buttons were a \"mistake\" and pledged to bring back physical controls.\nFor years, the auto industry tried to convince drivers that their cars should feel more like smartphones. Reject analog tradition, embrace digital modernity\u2014the industry mantra\u2014was chanted from the rooftops as new models ascended onto the world. New buttonless models with huge tablets strapped to the dashboard, that is.\nConsumers didn't respond well to this change. In fact, Volkswagen as a brand ended up doing a complete 180 and swore off the capacitive touch buttons in its current generation models like the ID family of EVs. Too little, too late, though, as a new class action lawsuit has come for the Germans and their touch-sensitive tech.\nVolkswagen ID.4 steering wheel capacitive buttons mod\nThe lawsuit zeroes in on the buttons found on the steering wheel of cars like the ID.4 and ID.Buzz (among other VW models like the Golf). It claims that the buttons are too sensitive, making it far too easy to unintentionally activate features by just brushing a finger over the capacitive area on the control plane. That means a quick fumble while turning the steering wheel in traffic could be the equivalent of pocket dialing someone on your iPhone\u2014could become a problem.\nVolkswagen declined to comment on ongoing litigation.\nInsideEVs found these controls annoying when driving cars equipped with the capacitive buttons\u2014\"as frustrating as ever,\" said Patrick George when driving the Volkswagen ID.4. Some owners even went as far as to replace the components entirely using parts from other models.\nOne of the features that can be activated on the steering wheel is the adaptive cruise control. The lawsuit claims that in at least one occurrence, accidental activation caused sudden unintended acceleration and, as a result, a VW is accused of being involved in at least one fatal crash.\nIt also called into question Volkswagen's IQ.Drive safety features. The lawsuit claims that in some circumstances, the brake pedal failed to disengage the ACC system, emergency braking failed to activate in obvious scenarios and airbags didn't deploy.\nFolks have complained to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about these features on the ID.4, according to complaints on the NHTSA's public portal and cited in the complaint.\nAnd what's even more damning is that Volkswagen's top brass has acknowledged that capacitive controls were \"a mistake.\" Andreas Mindt, Volkswagen's design boss who used that phrase to describe the capacitive controls, swore to re-implement physical buttons after feedback from customers revealed just how much of an issue these touch controls are in real-world scenarios.\nIn the end, Mindt was right: it's a car, not a phone. Not all customers want their cars behaving like giant iPads with wheels. Some want that satisfying, physical click of an analog button with instant feedback. Feel a click? You know what comes next. But an accidental touch could mean letting off the gas and not slowing down like you expected.\nPerhaps the bigger lesson is that automakers should think twice before turning their cars into rolling gadgets. Sure, tech is more important than ever. But the responsible and effective implementation of it is key.\nRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\nFord, Chevrolet And Ram Have A Big EV Problem\nWhere Rivian\u2019s CEO Sees EV Batteries Going Next\nAmerica Has Completely Blown Any Sort Of EV Transition\nThis Tesla Supercharger Extension Cable May Look Perfect, But It Isn't Ready For Prime Time: Expert\nDealership Salesman Reveals If You Should Put Money Down On a Volkswagen ID4\u2014Or Any\u2014Car Lease.

      "text": "Jun 4, 2025\nFrom the road to Redwood: Electric vehicle battery recovery\nRead post\nAt Redwood, we\u2019re building a battery supply chain to power the energy transition and a critical materials reserve. Today, we're excited to share our strategic collaboration with Caterpillar to recycle the batteries from their battery-electric underground loaders, an essential piece of equipment for modern mining operations.\nThe very metals mined by Caterpillar\u2019s equipment are used to manufacture batteries, powering the world\u2019s evolving energy landscape. Now, Redwood is ensuring that those same metals are being recovered and returned to the supply chain. This collaboration is further strengthened by Caterpillar Venture Capital\u2019s investment in Redwood\u2019s Series D, highlighting their commitment to a more circular future for mining and electrification.\nCaterpillar\u2019s R1700 XE is a fully electric, zero-emission underground loader designed for high-performance mining operations. It is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack that eliminates the need for diesel fuel, significantly reducing on-site emissions. Each R1700 XE battery pack is substantial\u2014with a 213-kWh capacity. To put this into perspective, one of these battery packs has a capacity equivalent to 17,193 iPhones. These batteries contain lithium, a high-value mineral that can be recovered and reintroduced into the battery supply chain.\nCaterpillar is a leader in heavy equipment innovation, and their commitment to electrification is setting new standards for efficiency and sustainability in the mining industry. Equipment, like the R1700 XE batteries we are recycling, play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, lowering operating costs, and improving air quality in underground mining environments. As global demand for batteries continues to rise\u2014expected to grow by more than 1,000% in the coming decade\u2014recycling alone cannot meet this unprecedented need. Mining for critical minerals will remain essential, and companies like Caterpillar will play a key role in responsibly extracting these resources to support electrification. The key is ensuring that, at the end of their life, the batteries powering this equipment are recycled efficiently, closing the loop on the materials supply chain.\nThe future of electrification depends on our ability to recover and reuse the materials that power it. Our partnership with Caterpillar highlights the immense potential of a truly circular supply chain\u2014one where the metals that power our technology never go to waste. Before recycling, we often deploy batteries for second-life applications through Redwood Energy, and we are exploring this opportunity with Caterpillar and all of our recycling partners. As we continue to expand our capabilities and partnerships, we remain committed to closing the loop on the battery supply chain. Together, with partners like Caterpillar, we are building a future where the materials we depend on are sustainably sourced, responsibly managed, and recycled."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions.

      "text": "When James Cox, the former leader of Uber\u2019s ride-share product, Uber Pool, left that company in 2019, the Silicon Valley giant had abandoned its autonomous vehicle development and sold off the division entirely. While Uber Pool had struggled to take hold, Cox felt a massive opportunity had been missed: taking the core of Uber Pool\u2019s tech and applying it to robotaxis.\nFor the last five years, Cox has instead been running a small startup called The Routing Company, which helps transit agencies match riders with vehicles quickly and cheaply. In that time, The Routing Company has helped arrange 3 million trips across 13 U.S. states and five countries.\nBut now The Routing Company has landed its first robotaxi client: Zoox.\nThe Routing Company announced Wednesday that it has struck a deal with the Amazon-owned robotaxi company. Zoox will purchase a nonexclusive license for The Routing Company\u2019s tech and will bring five of the startup\u2019s engineers on board to \u201cadvance the efficiency and scalability\u201d of its fledgling robotaxi service.\nCox will become a senior adviser to Mike White, Zoox\u2019s chief product officer. But the former Uber executive will continue on as CEO of The Routing Company. Any new tech that those engineers develop inside Zoox will stay with the Amazon-owned company. The companies declined to disclose the terms.\nThe deal is the latest example of how robotaxi companies are increasingly looking outward for help as they deploy real-world fleets. Waymo has recently announced a string of operational partnerships with companies like Uber and Avis. Last year, delivery startup Nuro outsourced its simulation work to Toyota-backed Foretellix in a bid to cut R&D costs.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this deal enables us to scale the positive impacts of our technology within what will be a very fast expansion in the robotaxi space,\u201d Cox told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Zoox, in a statement, also said it believes the new team members will help it scale. The company plans to bring its early-rider program to San Francisco and offer paid public rides in Las Vegas later this year.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It\u2019s also very challenging to get right.\n\u201cImagine playing chess in four dimensions, and the board was melting, the pieces move themselves, and there was a cost to moving every piece \u2014 and you have to do all of that in real time,\u201d Cox said. \u201cAny player that doesn\u2019t take all into account all that chaos in a live manner will always struggle.\u201d"

      "text": "Pony.ai Attracts Premium Capital as Funds Chase the Next Tech Transformation\nGUANGZHOU, China, Aug. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading investment management firms are backing Pony.ai.\nRecent corporate filings reveal ARK Invest, Cathie Wood's firm, invested roughly US$12.9 million in the Chinese autonomous driving company in August. This marks ARK's first investment in a Chinese firm solely focused on Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving technology development and commercialization.\nARK wasn't alone in backing Pony.ai. Exchange and corporate filings reveal the robotaxi operator attracted at least 14 major global institutional investors in Q2, including prominent names like Baillie Gifford and Nikko Asset Management \u2013 firms renowned for successful investments in Tesla, Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan. This broad backing stands in sharp contrast to many U.S. investors shifting away from Chinese assets amid geopolitical tensions and tariffs clouding the growth outlook.\nARK's strategy is clear: invest in emerging high-tech companies Wood believes can transform industries. As detailed in ARK's \"Big Ideas 2025\" report, the firm projected the ride-hailing market could surge to a US$10 trillion value by 2030, with global robotaxi fleets potentially reaching around 50 million vehicles. As Wood has emphasized, a robotaxi company's success hinges significantly on its cost optimization. Pony.ai's recent earnings and outlook provided compelling reasons for investor confidence.\nIn Q2, the company reported a striking 158% year-on-year increase in robotaxi revenues. This growth was supported by the ramped-up production of its seventh-generation robotaxi models. By expanding its fleet and securing more regulatory permits in densely populated urban centers, Pony.ai is meeting rising user demand.\nMore importantly, Pony.ai outlined a clear path to profitability \u2013 offering the rare certainty investors seek.\nFounder and CEO James Peng highlighted key factors in a recent CNBC interview: \"Unit economics are paramount. The Gen-7 vehicle boasts a 70% lower cost than its predecessor. We've also significantly reduced operational costs: our remote assistant-to-vehicle ratio has been significantly improved and it is expected to hit 1:30 by the end of the year, insurance costs fell 18%, and ground support and charging operations are more efficient.\"\n\"Based on these metrics,\" Peng added, \"we are confident in Gen-7's unit-level profitability. Further scaling the fleet will then drive corporate-level profitability.\" Pony.ai targets a fleet of 1,000 robotaxis by year-end \u2013 a threshold the company believes will achieve positive unit economics. Progress is rapid: just two months after unveiling Gen-7 at the late-April Shanghai Auto Show, around 200 new vehicles have rolled off production lines, bringing the total fleet to roughly 500 units.\nBeyond production, Pony.ai is accelerating user acquisition. Regulators recently granted the company a commercial permit to operate fare-charging services in parts of Shanghai's Pudong areas, the financial heart of the eastern Chinese city. This makes Pony.ai the only company with fully-driverless commercial permits across all four Chinese tier-1 megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen).\nService hours have also expanded to 24/7 in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Furthermore, a recent partnership will integrate Pony.ai's robotaxi service into Tencent's ubiquitous WeChat platform, unlocking access to its massive user base exceeding one billion.\nBolstered by a clearer commercial outlook and solid safety and tech validation, Pony.ai is winning favor not just with funds, but also recognition from analysts. Following the Q2 earnings release, major institutions including Goldman Sachs, Huatai, UBS, and Daiwa all rated the stock \"buy\". Goldman set a price target of US$24.5, indicating 54.5% upside compared to Pony.ai's closing price of US$15.86 on August 15.\nUBS analysts, in an Aug. 5 research note, stated: \"By the late 2030s, we expect the robotaxi market value to reach US$183 billion in China and US$394 billion in international markets excluding the U.S., assuming gradual operational expansion and improving regulatory clarity.\" Pony.ai is best positioned for robotaxi commercialization, the UBS analysts added.\nSOURCE Pony.ai\nWANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\nNewsrooms &\nInfluencers\nDigital Media\nOutlets\nJournalists\nOpted In\nShare this article"

      "text": "Thousands of semitrucks that cut across the U.S. highway system each day are harboring a secret: They\u2019re only about half full.\nThat inefficiency represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity. And one that a few companies like Uber Freight and Flock Freight are already chasing as part of broader business models that match truck drivers with companies selling goods.\nSan Francisco-based startup Oway is seeking out a narrower business model that more closely resembles Uber for freight, especially on the most inefficient long-haul routes. But it\u2019s a model that the startup believes can scale big enough to make an impact on the country\u2019s economy.\nOway, founded in 2023 and backed by Y Combinator and General Catalyst, recently closed a $4 million seed round in pursuit of that goal. Founder Phillip Nadjafov told TechCrunch that investors have bought into Oway\u2019s concept because his company has already developed a way to cut the cost of shipping a pallet across the U.S. by 50%, using a clever mixture of new and somewhat old technologies.\nThere\u2019s artificial intelligence, of course, in the form of machine learning that Oway developed to help find and match cargo with empty trailer space and a convenient destination (or a short detour). Oway is also automating a lot of the standard shipping and insurance documentation that goes with freight.\nBut Oway\u2019s ride-share cargo pitch is made possible by what\u2019s known as \u201celectronic logging devices\u201d (ELDs) that are installed on the trucks that traverse our country.\nELDs became government mandated around a decade ago, part of a push to make trucking safer and more efficient by eliminating paper logbooks. This makes it harder for shippers and drivers to skirt the federal rules on maximum driving time, theoretically cutting down on fatigue.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

And there\u2019s some evidence that the promised safety benefits may be offset by an increase in aggressive driving since drivers can\u2019t fudge their hours as easily.\nBut the devices are nonetheless the cornerstone of what Oway is doing, because ELDs also made it possible to keep tabs on the exact location of a truck in real time.\nWith this information, Oway can work with shippers to identify destinations close to an already-planned route. When there is empty space on the trailer \u2014 which there often is, according to Nadjafov \u2014 Oway can help customers place cargo in those trailers at a fraction of the typical cost.\nThe result is Oway claims it can bring the cost of moving a sub-2,000-pound pallet between Los Angeles and Dallas from about $350 down to as low as $140.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need to \u2026 buy a whole 50-something-foot truck to move [something] across the country in order to get good pricing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a single box over 100 pounds you want to move across the country, you should be able to, now, with current technology \u2026 do that. And this is a huge problem we have in America.\u201d\nThat disconnect, Nadjafov argued, creates higher shipping rates and consumer prices, but also leads to more emissions and more idle time for truckers. He believes Oway can solve this and is already working with big companies with thousands of vehicles in their fleets, though he said he can\u2019t disclose who they are because they\u2019ve asked for the relationships to stay private for now.\nThe way Nadjafov pitches it, Oway\u2019s business model combines some of the best aspects of the two main ways freight gets shipped by trucks in the U.S.\nOne model is known as \u201cfull truckload,\u201d which involves truck trailers being packed with goods, often in service of one shipper. These shipments typically go from point A to point B, offering quicker delivery but at a higher price.\nThe other model is what\u2019s known as \u201cless-than-truckload\u201d shipping, which typically involves multiple shippers sharing space on a single truck. This lowers the cost, but it takes longer, as the goods often have to bounce between multiple trucks and warehouses before making it to their destination.\nNadjafov\u2019s promise is that Oway can achieve the speed of full truckload shipping with the cost and dynamism of less-than-truckload shipping. What\u2019s more, by shipping more goods on direct long-haul routes, that freight is less likely to get damaged since it\u2019s not being unloaded and reloaded as it goes from a truck to a warehouse and back again.\nOway is doing all this in a \u201cdecentralized\u201d way, Nadjafov describes, meaning it is not trying to buy out entire trailers\u2019 worth of space and is even working with other brokers in the industry on top of the carriers and shippers.\n\u201cWe want Oway to be flexible so that one day new businesses and industries could be built on the novel applications of this infrastructure,\u201d he said.\nNadjafov said Oway has already received interest from companies in other countries, but his startup is focused on the U.S. for now \u2014 in part because Oway is only 12 people, and because of how reliant this country is on trucking.\n\u201cTrucking is a trillion-dollar industry and the empty space phenomenon itself is a $100 billion problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, I think, a very transformative movement for the entire commerce and logistics sector of America over the next 10 years, because I believe that this will be basically the de facto way that most businesses are going to move things around.\u201d\nUpdate: This story has been updated to reflect more current market rates for moving goods between LA and Dallas.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

      "text": "DETROIT \u2014 General Motors on Friday revealed a new all-electric Cadillac concept car designed to preview how the automaker plans to keep its high-performance V-Series vehicles relevant for EVs.\nThe vehicle is called \"Opulent Velocity.\" True to the name, Cadillac says it's a balance of ultra-luxury and performance for the V-Series, which is best known for cars with high-performance engines such as the 6.2-liter V8 Blackwing, rated at more than 600 horsepower and pound feet of torque.\n\"What we're really looking to do is achieve kind of the best of both worlds. What is kind of the ultimate hyper-performance machine in the future, coupled with ultimate luxury,\" Bryan Nesbitt, Cadillac executive global design director, said during a media briefing.\nElectric vehicles can offer a solid performance when it comes to acceleration, such as 0-60 mph times of three seconds or less, but automakers still face challenges on how to differentiate the vehicles and create the same excitement that the sound, or \"roar,\" of a traditional performance vehicle gives.\nNesbitt and other Cadillac officials stressed that performance for EVs isn't just about 0-60 mph times. They said it's about handling, as well as technologies on the vehicle, including interior features such as biometrics and driver-assistance technologies such as GM's Super Cruise.\n\"The intent in all of this is to continue to elevate the brand,\" Nesbitt said.\nCadillac released few details about the concept vehicle, which automakers routinely use to gauge customer interest or show the future direction of a vehicle or brand. The vehicles are not meant to be sold to consumers.\nThe concept car is a sleek, future-looking sports car. It features \"scissor\" doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door. It was revealed in connection to Monterey Car Week and the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance car show in California.\nMuch like the bespoke, $300,000 Celestiq car from Cadillac, the concept is meant to move Cadillac more upmarket to compete against the likes of Lamborghini and EV startup Rimac as opposed to traditional competitors such as Ford's Lincoln brand.\nCadillac's sales were down 1.7% through the first half of the year compared with the first six months of 2023. All of its vehicles experienced sales declines aside from its all-electric Cadillac Lyriq crossover."
