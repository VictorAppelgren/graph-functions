I totally know what you're talking about,\" Fallon interjected as his memory was coming back to him. \"I think I remember bringing beer into the bar, and then him charging me for my own beer.\"\n\"That's Tracy. He's very cheap, but if you want somebody dead, he'll do it,\" Gutfeld joked.\nGutfeld then said he and Fallon saw each other, and the latter's eyes lit up.\nFOX NEWS CHANNEL DOMINATES ALL OF TELEVISION IN JULY, CNN HITS ROCK BOTTOM AMONG KEY DEMO\n\"And you run towards me, and you tackle me, like you're a giant golden retriever,\" Gutfeld recalled. \"You're like on top of me. And so we're wrestling. We're wrestling. And then you change, and you start wrestling my buddy Andy, and you're wrestling him. And you guys get on the ground. You guys are now on the ground wrestling.\"\n\"What?!\" Fallon reacted in disbelief.\n\"Yes,\" Gutfeld told him. \"So I pull out a cigarette. I light a cigarette, and I'm smoking it, and you stop, and you come over to me, and you grab it, and you crinkle it, and you go, \u2018These things will kill you!\u2019 and you threw it. And then I go, \u2018Dude, I\u2019m not rich. You're rich.' Cigarettes are expensive in New York City. I yell, and all of a sudden, your face changed, and you looked sad, and then you left.\"\nBut, Gutfeld revealed, Fallon returned with a fresh pack just five minutes later and handed it to his future guest.\n\"I go, \u2018That was really sweet. You want me to die,'\" Gutfeld said, as Fallon and the audience laughed.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"I'm sorry I tackled you,\" Fallon said later with a grin.\n\"It was all very good-natured, and it was a great memory,\" Gutfeld told the NBC host. \"And I'm so glad I finally got to tell you!\"\n\"I'm so happy,\" Fallon replied. \"That's a true story\u2026 I remember. All the details you said are correct.\"\nGutfeld and Fallon also discussed his FOX Nation game show, \"What Did I Miss?\", where contestants who've been isolated for months try to pick real news from fake news, as well as Gutfeld's winding path to his top-rated hosting gigs on \"Gutfeld!\" and \"The Five.\""

      "text": "Jay Leno reflected on why he always kept his jokes politically balanced while hosting \"The Tonight Show\" for over two decades.\nThe 75-year-old comedian recently sat down for an interview with David Trulio, the president and CEO of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, during which he was questioned about his approach to political humor.\n\"I read that there was an analysis done of your work on \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 for the 22 years and that your jokes were roughly equally balanced between going after Republicans and taking aim at Democrats. Did you have a strategy?\" Trulio asked.\n\"It was fun to me when I got hate letters [like] \u2018Dear Mr. Leno, you and your Republican friends\u2019 and \u2018Well, Mr. Leno, I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' \u2014 over the same joke,\" Leno recalled.\nJAY LENO, WIFE MAVIS RELY ON FAITH, FAMILY TO OVERCOME LIFE'S HARDSHIPS\n\u2018And I go, \u2019Well, that's good,'\" he said. \"That's how you get a whole audience.\"\nLeno went on to note how late-night comedy has changed amid the current divisive political landscape.\n\"Now you have to be content with half the audience because you have [to] give your opinion,\" Leno said.\nWhen Trulio asked if Leno had any advice for comedians today, the \"Jay Leno's Garage\" host referred to his longtime friendship with late comedy legend Rodney Dangerfield.\n\"I knew Rodney 40 years,\" he said. \"I have no idea if he was Democrat or Republican. We never discussed [it], we just discussed jokes.\"\n\"And to me, I like to think that people come to a comedy show to kind of get away from the things, you know, the pressures of life, whatever it might be,\" Leno continued. \"And I love political humor, don't get me wrong, but it's just what happens when people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.\"\nWhile speaking with Trulio, Leno discussed how comedy could be used to create common ground.\n\"Funny is funny,\" Leno said. \"It's funny when someone who's not\u2026.when you make fun of their side and they laugh at it, you know, that's kind of what I do.\"\n\"I just find getting out \u2014 I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture,\" he continued. \"When I was with Rodney, it was always in the economy of words \u2014 get to the joke as quickly as possible.\"\nTrulio pointed out that both Leno and Dangerfield achieved massive success during their careers, noting the two's \"approach worked in the marketplace.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"Well, why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole [audience],\" Leno replied.\n\"I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture,\" he explained. \"I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group, you know, or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support or whatever, but just do what's funny.\"\nLeno's comments came prior to the uproar that ensued after CBS announced on July 17 that it was canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" with the show's final episode scheduled to air in May 2026.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nAt the time, the network clarified that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" and noted, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\nWeeks ahead of the cancellation, CBS and Paramount paid President Donald Trump a $16 million settlement following his lawsuit against the news network for airing an edited interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.\nColbert, who frequently blasts Trump on his show, criticized the settlement and described it as a \"big fat bribe\" during an episode that aired days before the cancellation was announced.\nThe host's supporters, including several politicians, have accused CBS and Paramount of canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" for political reasons.\nTrump celebrated the news of the cancellation in a post on his platform Truth Social, which drew a fiery response from Colbert, who told the president \"Go f--- yourself\" during the opening monologue of his show on Monday.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSeveral fellow late night show hosts and comedians have rallied around Colbert. \"The Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon and \"Late Night\" host Seth Meyers, \"Last Week Tonight\" host John Oliver and \"The Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart attended Colbert's taping on Monday in a show of support. Stewart and Oliver previously worked alongside Colbert on \"The Daily Show.\"\nOn Friday, \"The Late Show\" creator David Letterman slammed CBS' decision to cancel the long-running show as \"pure cowardice\" and asserted that the network mistreated Colbert, who succeeded him as host in 2015.\nFox News Digital's Gabriel Hays contributed to this report."

However, \"Maddow\" only aired three times during the entire month of July as its namesake continues to only work on Monday nights.\nKAROLINE LEAVITT STOPS BY \u2018RUTHLESS\u2019 TO TOUT TRUMP\u2019S 'INCREDIBLE' FIRST SIX MONTHS OF SECOND TERM\n\"FOX & Friends\" finished July with 1.3 million viewers and 169,000 in the demo, remaining the No. 1 cable news program in the mornings in both categories for the 53rd consecutive month.\n\"America\u2019s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino,\" \"The Faulkner Focus,\" \"Outnumbered,\" \"America Reports with John Roberts and Sandra Smith\" and Martha MacCallum\u2019s \"The Story\" all also had strong months to help Fox News crush the competition during the day and \"Fox News @ Night\" dominated its timeslot.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"The Big Weekend Show\" averaged 1.5 million viewers to finish as the No. 1 cable news program on Saturdays, while \"Sunday Morning Futures\" averaged 1.7 million to take the Sunday title. \"My View with Lara Trump\" was the most-watched weekend program in primetime with over 1.4 million viewers.\nFox News was also No. 1 in cable news with Asians and Hispanics and upscale viewers throughout total day viewership during July.\nRatings data courtesy of Nielsen Media Research."
