  "description": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggles on the mound and Zach Neto hits two home runs as the Angels overcome Shohei Ohtani's 42nd home run in a 7-4 victory over the Dodgers.",
  "content": "On the first day of spring training, at a Camelback Ranch facility adorned with ever-present reminders of the team\u2019s 2024 World Series title, a Dodgers staff member took in the scene, then chuckled while reflecting on the club\u2019s trek to a championship.\n\n\u201cLast year was not a fun year,\u201d the staff member said. \u201cAt least, not until the end.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in the afterglow of the franchise\u2019s first full-season title in more than three decades, the turbulent path getting there became easy to forget.\n\nLast season\u2019s Dodgers dealt with a wave of injuries to the pitching staff, inconsistencies in the lineup, and the club\u2019s lowest regular-season win total (98) in six years.\n\nFast-forward six months, and this year\u2019s Dodgers find themselves in a similar place.\n\nThey are again navigating absences on the mound and in the bullpen over the last several weeks. Their offense has gone from leading the majors in scoring over the first half of the season, to suddenly sputtering over the last month and a half.\n\nAnd after a 7-4 loss to the Angels on Monday, in the opener of a three-game Freeway Series at Angel Stadium, they are on pace for only 92 victories with a 68-51 record, clinging to what has dwindled to a just one-game lead in the National League West over the San Diego Padres.\n\nMonday\u2019s game was a lost cause from the start.\n\nDespite getting an extra day of rest this week, after flipping places in the rotation with Tyler Glasnow for Sunday\u2019s loss against the Toronto Blue Jays, Yoshinobu Yamamoto turned in one of his worst starts in the majors.\n\nHe gave up a home run to Zach Neto on his first pitch of the night, and another run later in the first inning after two walks (one of them on a missed third strike call from home plate umpire Dan Iassogna) and a Yo\u00e1n Moncada single.\n\nThen, in the fifth, his outing completely fell apart. Five of the first seven batters of the inning reached base (four singles and a hit by pitch). Four runs crossed the plate (including two on a Mike Trout single). And after Yamamoto walked his fifth batter with two outs, manager Dave Roberts was forced into an early hook, removing Yamamoto after 4\u2154 innings and six runs (the most Yamamoto has allowed in his 41-game MLB career).\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 lineup didn\u2019t do much better.\n\nOver the first six innings, they failed to figure out Angels right-hander Jos\u00e9 Soriano and his upper-90s mph sinker, managing just two hits while striking out six times.\n\nBy the time they finally put a runner in scoring position in the seventh, the deficit had grown to 7-0 on Neto\u2019s second home run of the night (this time off Alexis Diaz). And even then, they came up empty, with Alex Freeland grounding into an inning-ending double-play against former Dodgers reliever Luis Garc\u00eda with the bases loaded.\n\nEighth-inning home runs from Shohei Ohtani (his 42nd of the season, and the 100th of his career at his old home stadium in Anaheim) and Max Muncy (a three-run drive inside the right-field foul pole) put the Dodgers on the board at long last.\n\nBut it was far too little, much too late \u2014 allowing the Angels (57-62) to improve to 4-0 against the Dodgers this season after sweeping a series at Chavez Ravine back in May.\n\nWhen coupled with Sunday\u2019s maddening loss to Toronto (a defeat that left Roberts outwardly perturbed in his postgame news conference), the last 48 hours have represented another backward step in a Dodgers\u2019 campaign that is quickly growing full of them.\n\nIt has zapped whatever momentum was building after the team\u2019s two series-opening victories against the AL East-leading Blue Jays last weekend. It has dropped the club to 12-19 since the Fourth of July, the fifth-worst record in the majors over that span. And, most consequentially, it has opened the door for the Padres (who have won three in a row and five out of six) to potentially take the division lead ahead of their visit to Dodger Stadium on Friday.\n\nThe only silver lining: The Dodgers overcame similar struggles last year, doing just enough down the stretch to win the division and march all the way to an unlikely championship.\n\nBut they were hoping to avoid such headaches this season, and mount a more enjoyable defense of their title.\n\nWith less than two months remaining in the season, that dream has come and gone.\n\nThe Dodgers can still win another World Series. But the road to this point has been anything but fun.",

      "text": "- Share via\nAt the end of the 2019 minor-league season, Alex Call looked at his hitting numbers, then looked himself in the mirror.\nA former third-round draft pick who had already changed organizations once, he knew he had just had the kind of year that typically portends a short professional career.\nAs a 24-year-old outfielder at the double-A level in the Cleveland Guardians organization, Call had taken 325 plate appearances that year with the Akron RubberDucks. In 93 of them \u2014 a rate of nearly 30% \u2014 he recorded a strikeout.\nIt wasn\u2019t the only ugly stat in a season that saw Call bat just .205, reach base at a .266 clip and hit only five home runs. But it was the biggest sign of a fundamental flaw plaguing the right-handed hitter\u2019s game.\n\u201cThat,\u201d he recalled recently, while reflecting on what became a turning point moment in his career, \u201cjust wasn\u2019t gonna get it done.\u201d\nShohei Ohtani goes four innings and allows one run and strikes out eight, but Dodgers can\u2019t hold early lead and lose 5-3 to the St. Louis Cardinals.\nSix years later, Call joined the Dodgers as a trade deadline addition last week with a polar opposite reputation. Now, the defensively versatile outfielder is one of the harder outs in all the majors. Since the start of last season, his .297 batting average ranks eighth among MLB hitters with at least 350 plate appearances. More important, over that same span, he ranks top 60 in strikeout rate and walk rate (with a 55-to-39 ratio overall), and 22nd in chase rate; consistently putting together some of the better at-bats in all the sport.\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s just a straight grinder, works at-bats,\u201d general manager Brandon Gomes said after the Dodgers acquired Call from the Washington Nationals in exchange for two pitching prospects. \u201cPlaying against him, he\u2019s always incredibly frustrating to try to game plan for and get out.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve faced Alex a few times,\u201d added future Hall of Fame left-hander Clayton Kershaw. \u201cHe\u2019s tough against lefties, a great defender. A good add, for sure.\u201d\nThe Dodgers, of course, could have made splashier adds at the deadline. They were linked to All-Star caliber names, including Steven Kwan of the Guardians, but didn\u2019t splurge to pay such inflated deadline prices.\nInstead, they settled for Call, who was a smaller name but came with team control through 2029. They put their faith in his overhauled offensive skill set, hopeful a personal transformation more than half-a-decade in the making will make him a key piece in their pursuit of a second straight World Series title.\n\u201cThat is my whole game,\u201d Call said on the day he arrived with the club. \u201cI am going to grind out at-bats, put the ball in play, take my walks, make it tough on the pitcher, lengthen out the lineup.\u201d\nThe origins of that mindset date to that 2019 season, and the pandemic-altered year that followed.\nEntering 2020, Call committed to a change at the plate. In what was a crowded pipeline of outfielders in the Guardians system \u2014 highlighted at that time by Kwan, who has since blossomed into one of the best left fielders in the game \u2014 he recognized he needed a new identity. If he was going to reach the majors, it was going to start with simply working better at-bats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad feeling,\u201d he said, \u201chaving a cloud hanging over your head after a season like that.\u201d\nThe only problem: COVID-19 came, the 2020 minor league season was canceled, and Call (like so many other minor-league long shots clinging to big-league dreams) was left effectively on his own.\nSo, he found different ways to improve his bat.\nAs the baseball world shut down, Call bought a portable Junior Hack Attack hitting machine with a self-feeding ball dispenser. And everywhere he went that year \u2014 from spring training housing in Phoenix to his childhood home in Wisconsin to his family\u2019s offseason residence in Indiana \u2014 he sought out any place \u201cI could find a hitting cage and an outlet\u201d to use it, he said laughing.\nHis focus was simple. Work on hitting fastballs up in the strike zone. Eliminate what had been one of the biggest holes in his swing.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just about having that mentality to where, it doesn\u2019t matter if I have two strikes or if it\u2019s an 0-0 count,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve I\u2019m comfortable in every situation. I\u2019m going to put the ball in play.\u201d\nBy that winter, Call sought out a more advanced piece of training technology as well.\nOver the previous couple years, a company called Win Reality had begun manufacturing virtual reality hitting goggles \u2014 using data-driven models, actual video and computer-generated images to recreate virtual at-bats against real pitchers from a hitter\u2019s point of view inside Oculus-style headsets.\nA handful of MLB teams, including the Dodgers, had invested in the system for their teams. In the months leading up to the 2021 season, Call decided to do the same for himself, buying the $300 product (and paying for its annual $200 software program) to help couple his new swing with a more discerning approach.\n\u201c[I was] just really practicing the zone,\u201d Call said. \u201cKnowing what pitches are my strengths and what pitches I don\u2019t want to swing at until two strikes. Developing that plan and developing that approach.\u201d\nThe training paid off.\nAt the start of the 2021 season, Call was sent back to double-A Akron. When he arrived, he was informed by manager Rouglas Odor that he would only be slated to play 2-3 games per week \u2014 a quick reminder of how far down the organization depth chart he\u2019d fallen.\n\u201cI remember him being very disappointed,\u201d Odor, now the Guardians\u2019 big-league third-base coach, recalled this week. \u201cBut he took ownership of his career, and didn\u2019t let what I told him affect him.\u201d\nCall\u2019s chance arrived that May, after Kwan went down with a hamstring injury. And almost immediately, his COVID-year changes took effect. Over 180 plate appearances, Call hit .310, drew 21 walks and \u2014 just as he\u2019d hoped \u2014 cut his strikeout rate by half, punching out only 26 times.\n\u201cHe was a totally different hitter,\u201d said Odor, who had also been Call\u2019s manager during his dismal 2019 campaign. \u201cDefensively, he was already to play in the big leagues. He made some unbelievable plays \u2026 But offensively, he found his stroke. His plate discipline was more consistent. And he had an unbelievable season.\u201d\nBy the end of the season, Call had been promoted to triple-A. The next July, he earned a promotion to the majors.\nThe ascent from there wasn\u2019t linear. In August 2022, he was designated for assignment and claimed off waivers by the Nationals. In 2023, he played in 128 big-league games but hit only .200, sending him back to triple-A for most of last year.\nStill, his plate discipline didn\u2019t waver (he struck out only 78 times in his 439 plate appearances in 2023, an 18% rate, while also drawing 53 walks). His VR routine only became more ingrained, seeing upward of 54,000 simulated pitches (or, essentially 25 seasons\u2019 worth of throws) through his headset each year, as he told the Washington Post last month.\nIt all has clicked over the last calendar year, with Call following up a productive return to the majors at the end of 2024 with his best full-season performance this term.\n\u201cThe type of player that I am, I can hit the ball over the fence, but it\u2019s not really my full game,\u201d Call said. \u201cSo for me, it was about trying to create as many opportunities to get on base as possible \u2026 I have to be able to hit the ball at good angles.\u201d\nCall is one of only four players with at least 200 plate appearances this season (along with Kyle Tucker, Gleyber Torres and Geraldo Perdomo) who strikes out less than 15% of the time, chases less than 20% of the time and whiffs less than 20% of the time. He has hit .236 with two strikes (better than everyone else on the Dodgers except Hyeseong Kim).\nHe had his first standout game with the Dodgers on Wednesday, when he singled, doubled and made a catch while crashing into the left-field wall to save an extra-base hit.\nHern\u00e1ndez: Mookie Betts sounds depressed, but he isn\u2019t giving up on snapping his hitting slump\nDodgers shortstop Mookie Betts is trusting that hard work and sheer will can eventually end the worst hitting slump of his career.\nEight at-bats into his Dodgers career entering Friday\u2019s game, he has also yet to strike out once.\n\u201cI\u2019m always proud of players like Alex, because he wasn\u2019t this big prospect, but he became an everyday big-league player,\u201d Odor said. \u201cHe had the urgency to make something happen in order to reach his goal, and his dream.\u201d\nAnd now, Call is aiming to take his career one step further \u2014 to be not just a productive big-league bat, but one capable of playing an impactful role on a title-contending club in Los Angeles.\n\u201cI always knew that I could do it and be an established major leaguer,\u201d Call said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, sometimes it takes a little bit of time. And I\u2019m grateful that I was given that time, and just continued to get better.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nThe Toronto Blue Jays did everything possible to hand the Dodgers a victory Sunday.\nTheir pitchers gave up 10 hits, including two home runs. They walked 13, a season-high for the Dodgers, twice loading the bases on free passes in the final two innings. At the plate, Toronto struck out 14 times.\nThe Dodgers, however, refused to accept the gift, giving up an eighth-inning lead in a 5-4 loss that dropped their lead over the San Diego Padres in the National League West to two games. The Padres trailed by six games less than three weeks ago.\n\u201cThis is frustrating because I just felt there\u2019s no way we should lose this game today,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWe had them on the ropes numerous times. And for us not to win is so frustrating.\u201d\nIn his second start after missing four months with a shoulder injury, the Dodgers\u2019 Blake Snell dominated Toronto, striking out 10 in five scoreless innings of a 9-1 win.\nHow frustrating? The Dodgers were one for 10 with runners in scoring position. They left a season-high 16 men on base \u2014 six in the last two innings.\nEvery Dodgers starter reached base at least once. Yet they still lost.\nAfterward, third baseman Max Muncy insisted the black cloud had a silver lining, even if no one else could see it.\n\u201cWe were creating opportunities. So, you know, we were doing the first part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t cashing in today. The positive you take out of it is we found a way to create a lot of opportunities.\n\u201cYou just have to finish the job.\u201d\nThat goes double for the Dodger relievers. Starter Tyler Glasnow was brilliant, striking out eight and allowing just two runs over 5\u2154 innings, turning a 3-2 lead over to a bullpen that had to get 10 outs. Once again they couldn\u2019t do it, with Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia giving up three solo home runs in the span of six batters.\n\u201cYou give good hitters pitches right down the middle, they\u2019re going to do damage,\u201d said Treinen, who came on in the eighth with a one-run lead and left five batters later trailing after back-to-back home runs by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Addison Barger.\n\u201cSometimes we get away with making bad locations turn into outs. They made me pay for it and it cost us a game.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not the only one who had to pay. Because after Freddie Freeman walked with the bases loaded for the second time to tie the game in the eighth, Vesia came on to start the ninth with the score even again. Ernie Clement unevened it on Vesia\u2019s first pitch, driving an 85-mph slider over the wall in left field to put Toronto ahead. It was the 65th homer Dodgers relievers have allowed this season; only two bullpens in the majors have given up more.\nBut the Blue Jays\u2019 generosity knew no end, so Toronto tried to give the win back when reliever Jeff Hoffman loaded the bases with one out for Shohei Ohtani.\nBut after fouling off two tough full-count pitches from Mason Fluharty, a left-hander with a 5.15 earned-run average and Toronto\u2019s eighth pitcher of the day, Ohtani waved at a sweeper outside the zone to strike out.\n\u201cThe last thing I was thinking was he was going to strike out. ... We\u2019ve got to come up with one right there,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cChasing the ball down below is something we can\u2019t have happen.\u201d\nMookie Betts followed by grounding into a force out to end the game.\nThree innings earlier Ohtani, who had two hits, including his 41st homer of the season to run his hitting streak to a season-best nine games, was thrown out trying to steal third with two outs and Freeman at the plate, ending another Dodger threat.\n\u201cThat was his decision,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNot a good baseball play.\u201d\nClayton Kershaw gives up seven hits and one earned run over six innings and Mookie Betts hits a two-run home run in the Dodgers\u2019 5-1 win over Toronto.\nNow the Dodgers head to Anaheim for a three-game series with the Angels before returning home to face the Padres, likely with the division lead at stake.\nThe Dodgers have been faltering since July 1, going 15-18. San Diego has been on fire, going 21-13 over the same span. Among NL teams, only the Milwaukee Brewers have been better.\nWhile San Diego has the most saves (39) and the best bullpen ERA in baseball (3.04), Dodgers relievers rank 21st (4.24).\nAnd while the Padres got better at last month\u2019s trade deadline, making five trades that netted them reliever Mason Miller and left-hander JP Sears from Oakland, first baseman/outfielder Ryan O\u2019Hearn and left fielder Ram\u00f3n Laureano from the Orioles and catcher Freddy Fermin from the Royals, the Dodgers barely tinkered around the edges. Their major acquisition, reliever Brock Stewart, has given up six hits and two runs in 3\u2154 innings.\nThe Padres went all in. The Dodgers did not.\nTalk about frustrating."

      "text": "Dodgers Dugout: The 10 best third basemen in Dodger history\n- Share via\nHi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell. On Friday, we\u2019ll look at the struggling offense. Until then, here\u2019s a bonus edition of the newsletter.\nTop 10 third basemen\nHere are my picks for the top 10 third basemen in Dodgers history, followed by how all of you voted. Numbers listed are with the Dodgers only. Click on the player\u2019s name to be taken to the baseball-reference.com page with all their stats.\n1. Ron Cey (1971-82, .264/.359/.445, 121 OPS+, 6-time All-Star)\nCey is one of the most underrated players in the history of baseball, let alone the Dodgers. He was unfortunate in that he was a direct contemporary of possibly the two greatest third basemen in history (especially up to that time) in Mike Schmidt and George Brett, so Cey often went overlooked.\nIf you ask fans who was the best player on the Dodgers from 1977-81, most would name Steve Garvey or Reggie Smith. But let\u2019s take a look at the numbers:\nFrom 1977-81\nMost homers: Cey, 122; Garvey, 118; Dusty Baker, 102.\nOPS+: Smith, 154; Cey, 129; Garvey, 126.\nWAR: Cey, 22.4; Smith, 16.7; Garvey, 16.3\nCey, of course, was nicknamed \u201cThe Penguin,\u201d because his knees were about six inches off the ground, giving him a stiff-legged run. He never seemed slow though, just awkward looking.\nHe was co-MVP of the 1981 World Series, the Series during which he was famously hit in the head by a Goose Gossage fastball, still the only game (Game 5) I have watched where I was convinced someone had just been killed. Cey was taken to the hospital and had a concussion. You can watch it here. He played in Game 6.\n\u2018\u2019I heard it hit the helmet,\u2019\u2019 Gossage said after the game. \u2018\u2019If he doesn\u2019t have a helmet on, he might be dead.\u2019\u2019\nThe Dodgers traded Cey to the Chicago Cubs after the 1982 season for Dan Cataline and Vance Lovelace. They traded him too soon, for players that didn\u2019t pan out. Cey went on the have four productive seasons with the Cubs, leading them to the NL East title in 1984. He was released by the Oakland A\u2019s during the 1987 season and never played in the majors again.\nCey took part in our \u201cAsk....\u201d series five years ago. You can read it here.\n2. Pedro Guerrero (1978-88, .309/.381/.512, 149 OPS+, 4-time All-Star)\nLet\u2019s get the negative out of the way first: Guerrero was born to be a DH. He was a bad third baseman, a bad first baseman and a bad outfielder. But he may be the best hitter in Dodger history. He is second in OPS+ in Dodger history (minimum 3,000 plate appearances), trailing only Mike Piazza. and he had around 1,000 more plate appearances than Piazza. He hit .320 in 1985, then blew out his knee on an ill-advised slide in spring training of 1986. He came back in 1987 to hit .338. He had power, hitting 30+ homers three times (back when that really meant something) and had a good eye at the plate. He was not a good fielder at third, and hated playing there, but you have to give him credit for going out there whenever he was asked. On April 3, 2017, Guerrero had a stroke while in New York. According to his wife Roxanna Jimenez, doctors said Guerrero was in a coma, declared him brain dead and asked her to consider taking him off life support. She refused. Two days later, Guerrero woke up and has made a miraculous recovery. He still has memory problems and moves slower than he used to, but he makes appearances at autograph shows.\n3. Justin Turner (2014-22, .296/.375/.490, 133 OPS+, 2-time All-Star)\nTurner remains a fan favorite, as every offseason I get emails from readers hoping the Dodgers will bring him back.\nTurner had a middling career with the Orioles and Mets (.260 career average in 318 games) before signing with the Dodgers before the 2014 season in a transaction that few paid attention to. The Dodgers and Turner unlocked something in his swing though, because he was a revelation in 2014, hitting .340/.404/.493 in 109 games. He became the heart of the offense, and his hard-nosed style of play endeared him to fans. If there was a clutch situation, Turner was the one you wanted up at the plate. Remember this clutch moment against the Cubs in the 2017 NLCS? And even though he is on the downside of his career with the Cubs this season, he still has his clutch moments. He\u2019s one of those guys you hope retires as a Dodgers.\n4. Max Muncy (2018-current, .232/.358/.484, 127 OPS+, 2-time All-Star)\nMuncy has never captured the hearts of Dodgers fans the way other players the last few years have. He hits for a low average, but draws a lot of walks and has a lot of power. The offense this season went into the tank about the same time he was injured. And while he will never win a Gold Glove, he usually battles the position to a draw. The streakiest of streak hitters, he set a record for most consecutive times reaching base in the NLCS last season, then followed it up by going 0 for 16 in the World Series. A big part of the Dodgers\u2019 success since he joined the team.\n5. Adrian Beltr\u00e9 (1998-2004, .274/.332/.463, 108 OPS+)\nHow is a Hall of Famer fifth? He wasn\u2019t a Hall of Famer when he was with the Dodgers. In fact, he was considered a bit of a disappointment until an amazing 2004 season, when he hit .334 with 48 homers and 121 RBIs. He finished second in MVP voting that year. Sadly, that would be his last year as a Dodger, as management at the time (owner Frank McCourt and general manager Paul DePodesta) didn\u2019t make a big effort to sign him. \u201cI think it was more the GM than anything,\u201d Beltr\u00e9 said later in his career. Beltr\u00e9 blamed himself for telegraphing that he didn\u2019t want to leave. \u201cIt was a mistake on my part to show it too much, that I wanted to stay back then. They wanted to use that against me in the negotiation.\u201d (Read more about Beltre and his time with the Dodgers here.) Beltr\u00e9 was the best fielding third baseman in team history, and the Dodgers spent many years seeking an adequate replacement for him, something they were never able to do until Justin Turner came along.\n6. Cookie Lavagetto (1937-41, 1946-47, .275/.372/.384, 105 OPS+, 4-time All-Star)\nLavagetto had an incredible batting eye, walking 370 times while striking out only 155 times from 1937-41. His career was derailed by World War II, as he served four years in the Navy during what would have been his prime. When Lavagetto was young, Oakland Oaks owner Cookie DeVincenzi took an interest in him and signed him to a contract, so Lavagetto\u2019s new teammates started calling him \u201cCookie\u2019s Boy,\u201d which eventually was shortened to just \u201cCookie.\u201d His real first name was Harry. When he returned from the Navy, his skills had eroded enough to where he played only two seasons. But he had one great moment in him still. In Game 4 of the 1947 World Series, Bill Bevens of the Yankees had a no-hitter against the Dodgers in the ninth inning. Bevens had walked eight Dodgers, and the Yankees led 2-1. With one out, Bevens walked Carl Furillo, then got Spider Jorgensen to foul out. Al Gionfriddo ran for Furillo and stole second. Bevens intentionally walked Pete Reiser, and Eddie Miksis ran for Reiser. Manager Burt Shotton then sent up Lavagetto to pinch-hit for Eddie Stanky. Lavagetto hit Bevens\u2019 second pitch off the right-field fence, scoring Gionfriddo and Miksis with the winning runs and ending Bevens\u2019 no-hitter. Lavagetto died in 1990 at the age of 77.\n7. Arky Vaughan (1942-43, 1947-48, .291/.368/.383, 113 OPS+, 1-time All-Star)\nVaughan is in the Hall of Fame, as a shortstop wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates cap. That\u2019s where he spent the first 10 seasons of his career.\nYou might see that gap in his career and think \u201cmilitary service interrupted his career,\u201d but no. Vaughan hit .277 and .305 in his first two seasons with the Dodgers.\nOn July 10, 1943, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher suspended pitcher Bobo Newsom for insubordination. The next day, Vaughan read a newspaper story in which Durocher belittled Newsom. He confronted Durocher when he arrived at the ballpark. Durocher stood behind what he said. According to teammate Billy Herman, \u201cArky didn\u2019t say another word. He went back to his locker and took off his uniform \u2014 pants, jersey, socks, cap \u2014 made a big bundle out of it, and went back to Leo\u2019s office, telling Leo, \u2018Take this uniform and shove it right up your... If you would lie about Bobo, you would lie about me and everybody else. I\u2019m not playing for you.\u2019\nAnd Vaughan left. Some of his teammates left with him. Durocher and general manager Branch Rickey convinced all of the players to return for that day\u2019s game except Vaughan. He returned the next day and played the rest of the season, but quit baseball at the end of the season.\nRickey talked to him every year, trying to get him to return, but Vaughan refused. Until Rickey said he needed a veteran leader like Vaughan on the bench in 1947 because of the debut of Jackie Robinson. Vaughan returned. Vaughan hit .325 off the bench for the Dodgers and helped them reach the World Series, his first. He played in 1948, hit .244, and retired for good.\nOn August 30, 1952, he and a friend, Bill Wimer, went sailing on Lost Lake in northern California. The boat sank. Wimer couldn\u2019t swim, so Vaughan tried to carry him along as he swam to shore. Witnesses at the time said they made it to 25 yards from shore when they both sank and drowned (why these witnesses didn\u2019t help is lost to the annals of time). Their bodies were recovered the next day. Vaughan was 40.\nAt Vaughan\u2019s funeral, Robinson said, \u201cHe was one of the fellows who went out of his way to be nice to me when I came in here as a rookie. Believe me, I needed it. He was a fine fellow.\u201d\n8. Billy Cox (1948-54, .259/.320/.370, 82 OPS+)\nCox was a member of the \u201cBoys of Summer\u201d Dodgers but had the misfortune of being traded to Baltimore just before the 1955 season, when Brooklyn finally won the World Series. Cox was a great fielder but below-average hitter. He served for four years in the military during World War II as a member of the 814th Signal Corps. The Signal Corps laid wire and set up communication centers for the advancing troops, which meant he was often in the middle of combat zones. One time, while playing for the Pirates, the sound of a fireworks display that was set off while he was on the field reminded him of his time in the military and he ran to the dugout for cover. And how good was Cox on defense? Perhaps teammate Carl Erskine put it best: \u201cHe had such quick hands that it seemed as though he had four gloves instead of one.\u201d Cox started smoking when he was overseas during the war, and it eventually took its toll. He died of esophageal cancer in 1978. He was only 58 years old. The baseball field in his hometown of Newport, Pa., is named for him.\n9. Joe Stripp (1932-37, .295/.335/.384, 97 OPS+)\nStripp had a solid bat and was a Gold Glove-level defender, though they didn\u2019t give that award out when he played. After Stripp retired, he opened up a baseball school in Orlando, Fla., which was considered one of the best baseball schools in the country in the 1940s and \u201950s. Stripp died in Orlando in 1989 at the age of 86.\nThere isn\u2019t a lot known about Stripp, who is one of those guys who just sort of faded away after he retired. He was born 122 years ago and played in the majors for 11 seasons. It\u2019s nice to remember him here.\n10. Mike Sharperson (1987-93, .287/.363/.373, 108 OPS+, 1-time All-Star)\nSharperson was more of a utility player than a third baseman, appearing at every infield position and in right field with the Dodgers. His best season was 1992, when he hit .300 and made his only All-Star team. He was a guy you could put in for a player who needed a day off and know you were going to get a solid performance. Those types of players are very valuable to a team over the course of 162 games. On May 26, 1996, Sharperson was killed in a one-car crash at the junction of the 15 and 215 freeways. He was driving from Las Vegas, where he was playing for the triple-A Las Vegas Stars, to San Diego, which had just recalled him from the minors. Witnesses said it appeared he was about to miss the turn onto the 215 connector and tried to get over at the last second. His car hit a dirt median and Sharperson was ejected through the sun roof. Sharperson was only 34.\nOnce you get down to around ninth or 10th place, there are a lot of guys who are interchangeable there. You could make a case for Billy Grabarkewitz or Casey Blake or Ken McMullen or George Pinkney or Tim Wallach or a host of others. The Dodgers have not had a lot of great third basemen.\nThe readers\u2019 top 10\n1,286 ballots were sent in.

      "text": "- Share via\nA lazy, lovely afternoon at Chavez Ravine was startled awake Sunday by three blue-curdling screams.\nThe Dodger bullpen had struck again.\nEighth inning, one out, Dodgers leading the Toronto Blue Jays by a run, rusty Blake Treinen on the mound.\nVladimir Guerrero Jr., boom, nooooo!\nAddison Barger, boom, nooooo!\nNinth inning, game tied, Alex Vesia on the mound acting like a closer because the Dodgers don\u2019t have a healthy closer.\nErnie Clement, boom, not again!\nBattered by three home runs in the last two innings Sunday, the Dodgers lost a game they should have won, blew a game they should have had, and planted an ominous message deep into the bowels of sweaty Dodger Stadium.\nBlake Treinen and Alex Vesia gave up three homers in the span of six batters and Shohei Ohtani strikes out at a critical moment in a 5-4 loss to Toronto.\nThis is a team trying to win a second consecutive championship without an adequate bullpen.\nThe 5-4 loss wasted a sterling start by Tyler Glasnow, frittered away 10 hits and 13 walks from a burgeoning offense, ruined a chance to sweep the team with the best record in the American League, and created a trivia question that will be bandied about the league until the last week in October.\nWhat standout reliever did the Dodgers acquire at the trade deadline?\nNobody.\nWhat standout reliever had their critics been begging them to acquire for weeks?\nAny of them.\nMaybe Andrew Friedman\u2019s previous deadline brilliance convinced everyone into thinking he could pull something off again, and maybe the public pressure was less than usual because of the credits earned by the 2024 title, but here\u2019s guessing much of Dodger nation woke up Monday morning after watching a reliever tagged with the loss in three of the last six games and thought...\nWhat just happened? Is it too late to fix?\nWhat happened was the Dodgers\u2019 belief in the recovering health of their bullpen. And, um, yeah, unless you want to bring Bobby Miller up from Oklahoma City to close games (not a bad idea, eh?), it\u2019s not getting fixed anytime soon.\nMichael Kopech, Tanner Scott and Kirby Yates should all be returning from the injured list, and the thought is that the Dodgers can find a closer somewhere in there, but you\u2019ve seen them all and do you agree?\nThere is also the belief in this weird bit of Dodger closer history \u2014 the final inning in their last two championships was worked by a starter.\nThis is countered by the fact that the last two times Friedman didn\u2019t make a significant pitching upgrade at the deadline they were eliminated in the first round.\nSo, yes, Friedman hasn\u2019t lost any of his smarts and Dave Roberts hasn\u2019t lost any of his savvy and they can probably piece this mess together for short periods in October.\nBut between now and then, you need someone to make the big pitch in the clutch situation and save the offense from itself.\nYou need a closer so you don\u2019t have the eternal optimist Roberts looking oddly despondent late Sunday afternoon.\n\u201cThis is frustrating because I just felt there is no way we should lose this game today,\u201d he said.\nHe wasn\u2019t so upset with Vesia and Treinen \u2014 both guys have been put in tough spots, especially Treinen, who recently came off the injured list.\nHe was mostly upset with the Dodger offense that made the withering bullpen \u2014 which has recorded the most innings in baseball \u2014 so necessary.\nThe Dodgers had a 3-2 lead after six innings. The back-to-back dingers in the eighth cost them that lead.\nThe Dodgers came back to tie it on a bases-loaded walk to Freddie Freeman in the eighth.\nClement\u2019s long ball grabbed the lead again for the Blue Jays in the ninth.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d Vesia said.\nBut equally frustrating was the 16 men the Dodgers left on base, including leaving the bases loaded three times, twice in the last two innings.\n\u201cWe had them on the ropes numerous times,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd for us not to win is so frustrating.\u201d\nIn his second start after missing four months with a shoulder injury, the Dodgers\u2019 Blake Snell dominated Toronto, striking out 10 in five scoreless innings of a 9-1 win.\nHow disappointed was Roberts? When is the last time you\u2019ve heard him criticize Shohei Ohtani\u2019s play? Well, he did it Sunday, twice in a span of a minute.\nFirst, there was Ohtani ending the sixth inning by getting thrown out attempting to steal third base with Freeman at the plate.\n\u201cNot a good baseball play,\u201d Roberts said.\nThen there was Ohtani striking out with a wild swing on a low and outside full-count pitch from Mason Fluharty \u2014 he of the 5.15 ERA \u2014 with bases loaded in the ninth.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to come up with one right there,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cChasing the ball down below ... is something that we can\u2019t have.\u201d\nYou know what could have prevented all this angst? A deeper bullpen. A more rested bullpen. A fixed bullpen."

      "text": "Shohei Ohtani and his agent accused of sabotaging $240-million real estate project\n- Share via\nA Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Dodgers\u2019 star and his agent got them fired from a $240-million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.\n\u201cBalelo and [Ohtani], who were brought into the venture solely for [Ohtani\u2019]s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\nYoshinobu Yamamoto struggles on the mound and Zach Neto hits two home runs as the Angels overcome Shohei Ohtani\u2019s 42nd home run in a 7-4 victory over the Dodgers.\nThe suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.\nA spokesman for Balelo\u2019s agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.\n\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\nOhtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time most valuable player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.\nInvestment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan\u2019s Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.\n\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\u201d\nThe suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\u201d\nBlake Treinen and Alex Vesia gave up three homers in the span of six batters and Shohei Ohtani strikes out at a critical moment in a 5-4 loss to Toronto.\n\u201cThis partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\u201d the investment brochure said. \u201cWe see Shohei Ohtani\u2019s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\u201d\nThe suit said Balelo \u201cquickly became a disruptive force,\u201d threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren\u2019t made.\n\u201cKingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo\u2019s every whim,\u201d the suit said. \u201cOver time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with [Ohtani] than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\u201d\nLast month, in what the suit called \u201ca coordinated ambush,\u201d Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.\n\u201cKingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\u201d the suit said. \u201cPlaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\u201d\nGolen writes for the Associated Press."
