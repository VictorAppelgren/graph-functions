  "title": "Do Mikron Holding's (VTX:MIKN) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?",
  "description": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks...",
  "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mikron Holding (VTX:MIKN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Mikron Holding with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Mikron Holding has grown EPS by 26% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It seems Mikron Holding is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nWhile it's always good to see growing profits, you should always remember that a weak balance sheet could come back to bite. So check Mikron Holding's balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.\n\nAre Mikron Holding Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Mikron Holding insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at CHF22m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. As a percentage, this totals to 7.2% of the shares on issue for the business, an appreciable amount considering the market cap.",
