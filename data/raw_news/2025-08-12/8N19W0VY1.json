  "title": "Why Investors Slammed the Brakes on Pony AI Stock Today",
  "description": "In one important respect, the company only met expectations in its latest earnings release and business update.",
  "content": "\u2022 The self-driving tech developer delivered some strong growth numbers in its second quarter.\n\u2022 It also updated the production figures of the robotaxis that use its technology.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Pony Ai \u203a\n\nExpectations were clearly high for robotaxi developer Pony AI's (NASDAQ: PONY) second-quarter earnings, which were published before market open on Tuesday. The company's solid but not spectacular performance and production update ended up discouraging some investors. Collectively, they traded out of the stock to leave it with a nearly 4% dip in price that trading session.\n\nBig boost in the take for licensing and applications\n\nReporting in both Chinese yuan and U.S. dollars, the China-based Pony AI revealed that its revenue leaped 76% year over year to just under $21.5 million. Much of that increase came from a more than tenfold rise in licensing and applications revenue. This came in at $10.4 million against slightly over $1 million in the same quarter of 2024.\n\nGoing in the opposite direction was net loss, which widened on both a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. Under the latter standard, it was slightly over $46 million ($0.13) per share, comparing unfavorably to the year-ago deficit of $30 million.\n\nOn average, analysts tracking Pony AI were modeling $16 million for revenue. Their consensus estimate for profitability wasn't immediately apparent.\n\nIn terms of operations, Pony AI said that since the launch of mass production of robotaxis two months ago, more than 200 of Guangzhou Auto Group's and Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation's Gen-7 models -- packed with Pony AI technology -- have been produced. This puts the manufacturers on track to meet, although not exceed, its target of 1,000 by the end of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pony Ai right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pony Ai, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pony Ai wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.",

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."

      "text": "Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, is a set of accounting standards followed by most U.S. businesses, nonprofit organizations, and state and local governments. GAAP is industry shorthand used to denote the standardized guidelines that specify how and what companies report to the public.\nInterested parties, such as investors, lenders, and potential donors, expect companies to adhere to GAAP reporting standards so that they can understand an organization's financial performance and compare it to others. Let's take a closer look at these generally accepted principles and who uses them.\nWho uses GAAP?\nWho uses GAAP?\nPublicly traded companies adhere to GAAP because it is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That means GAAP is particularly useful for investors because it requires each company to measure and report its financial performance in the same way. Directly comparing companies and different reporting periods for the same company are integral to making investment decisions.\nBy contrast, most private companies keep track of their financial performances only for tax purposes. GAAP principles have less importance if the company doesn't plan to offer an initial public offering (IPO). Companies often report both GAAP and non-GAAP (adjusted) results.\nIPO\nWhat are the generally accepted accounting principles?\nWhat are the generally accepted accounting principles?\nAuditors and internal accountants are required to follow these 10 generally accepted accounting principles:\n1. Regularity\nCompanies must follow all specific rules and regulations with regularity. The accounting principles work together, so any deviation from reporting requirements on one part of a company's financial statement could cause other parts to be incorrect.\n2. Consistency\nThe same accounting standards should be consistently applied to the entire accounting process. And a company must verify that these standards have been carried out throughout the company.\n3. Sincerity\nAccurate and impartial accounting is imperative. Despite being paid by the companies they are auditing, accountants must prepare truthful and sincere financial statements.\n4. Permanence of method\nDifferent but equally valid accounting methods are sometimes available. Companies should use the same methods across reporting periods as much as possible. Establishing a permanent accounting method facilitates accurate comparison.\n5. Noncompensation\nThe value of a company's liabilities should not be compensated for by the value of the company's assets. A company's assets may exceed its debt, but its financial statements should report its asset and liabilities separately.\n6. Prudence\nAccountants should be prudent and conservative when deciding which accounting methods to use. A prudent approach ensures a company's financial performance is not overstated.\n7. Continuity\nAccounting should be conducted based on the assumption that a company will continue to operate indefinitely. If an accountant is required to make any assumptions, those assumptions should be based on historical precedents set by the business.\n8. Periodicity\nFinancial data should be reported at regular intervals to allow for easy comparison among reporting periods and companies.\n9. Materiality\nAll material financial data and information should be disclosed. Anything that affects a company's financial standing is generally considered material, meaning companies must provide full financial disclosure.\n10. Utmost good faith\nAccountants and business managers should act in good faith by honestly recording transactions and collecting financial data.\nFour additional GAAP principles\nFour additional GAAP principles\nIn addition to these 10 primary principles, companies are expected to adhere to four additional principles to guarantee the integrity and consistency of their financial statements:\n- Recognition: Financial statements should accurately recognize all of a company's assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.\n- Measurement: Financial statements should measure and present financial results in accordance with GAAP specifications.\n- Presentation: For its financial statements, a company should present an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\n- Disclosure: In the spirit of full disclosure, financial statements should include any necessary notes to fully explain the financial information provided.\nRevenue\nRules and regulations for GAAP\nRules and regulations for GAAP\nThe Financial Accounts Standards Board (FASB), a nonprofit organization given regulatory authority by the SEC in the 1970s, establishes specific rules and standards in accordance with GAAP. These are the basics of GAAP rules:\n- Accrual accounting: GAAP accounting is accrual accounting. The accrual accounting method records revenue when a service is provided or a good is sold, not when cash is exchanged. Direct expenses, such as cost of goods sold, are accounted for when the sale of the product or service occurs. Indirect expenses, such as rent and marketing, are accounted for when the expense is paid.\n- Depreciation and capital expenditures: The costs of large asset purchases are accounted for over the life of the asset. If a business buys a piece of equipment expected to last 10 years, the business will expense 10% of the cost of the equipment each year for 10 years.\n- Historical cost: Most assets, like a company's property, facilities, and equipment, are reported on the company's balance sheet at their original costs, not their current market values.\n- Bad debts: Companies with significant accounts receivable -- money owed to them by customers -- must account for the likelihood that some of that money will never be received.\nAccountants devote their entire careers to understanding and applying the specific rules that the FASB establishes in accordance with GAAP. Knowing at least the basics of GAAP can help investors better understand and compare the companies in their portfolios."
