  "content": "Germany\u2019s Federal Employment Agency is actively promoting the country\u2019s \u201ccitizen\u2019s benefit\u201d (B\u00fcrgergeld) to young migrants, presenting it online as a straightforward and appealing option for those without work.\n\nA dedicated section of the agency\u2019s website, written in English for \u201cpeople from abroad,\u201d features a smiling young couple \u2014 including a man in his early thirties holding a book and a woman in a hijab \u2014 under the headline:\n\nThe site outlines that the benefit is a state welfare payment for those with \u201cno income or who do not earn enough money\u201d to support themselves and their dependents. Basic eligibility criteria are listed plainly: \u201cYou are capable of working,\u201d \u201cYou are at least 15 years old,\u201d and \u201cYou live in Germany and the center of your life is here.\u201d The guidance stresses that applicants need not be elderly or unfit for work \u2014 those under 15 or unable to work can also receive support if they are part of a \u201ccommunity of need\u201d with someone who qualifies.\n\nAlongside the requirements, the website presents the process as quick and simple. A prominent red box invites visitors to \u201capply online,\u201d advising them that if they already have an account, they can begin their application \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nThe page also sets out obligations for recipients \u2014 attending Jobcenter appointments, informing the agency of any changes in personal circumstances \u2014 but the overall tone is one of ease and accessibility.\n\nWriting in Focus, columnist Jan Fleischhauer uses the site as a starting point for a broader critique of Germany\u2019s welfare policy toward migrants.

He points to the steady rise in costs \u2014 from \u20ac39 billion in 2022 to \u20ac47 billion in 2024 \u2014 not including accommodation and healthcare expenses.\n\nHe also highlights Health Minister Nina Warken\u2019s proposal to shift medical costs for B\u00fcrgergeld recipients out of health insurance budgets and into general taxation, claiming advocates of the benefit \u201cfear nothing more than transparency\u201d about the true financial burden.\n\nRemix News has reported often on the imbalance between German citizens and foreigners receiving welfare benefits. In November last year, we cited statistics from the Federal Employment Agency (BA) which showed that of the 4 million people who can work but receive social benefits in Germany, more than 2.5 million have a migration background, constituting 63.5 percent of all recipients.\n\nThis group includes foreigners and those who have a foreign background, which means their parents may have been born abroad.\n\nIn June, Bild reported how nearly half of Germany\u2019s \u20ac17.68 billion in housing support for 2024 was paid out to foreigners, citing government data.\n\nThe money, distributed under the citizen\u2019s benefit system, was used to cover rent, heating, operating costs, and deposits for low-income residents.\n\nOf the total, \u20ac8.15 billion went to people without German citizenship, even though they make up just around 15 percent of the population.\n\nThe remaining \u20ac9.53 billion went to German citizens \u2014 this includes German-born individuals and those born elsewhere who have become naturalized.\n\nFollowing its electoral success, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) vowed to address the rising costs of immigrants claiming benefits.\n\nIts General Secretary, Carsten Linnemann, warned against this trend in April. \u201cOnce again, it shows how urgently this citizen\u2019s allowance needs to be abolished.\u201d He said the new government, which his party will lead, will \u201ctackle this quickly.\u201d",

  "summary": "Germany's Federal Employment Agency is promoting the country's \"citizen's benefit\" (B\u00fcrgergeld) to young migrants. The agency's website includes a dedicated section for \"people from abroad\" and includes a picture of a smiling couple. The benefit is available for those without income or do not earn enough money to support themselves and their dependents. The eligibility criteria include being able to work, at least 15 years old, and at least part of a \"community of need\" with someone who qualifies. However, critics argue that the relaxed approach to migrants undermines political claims that immigration is essential to sustain the social safety net.

      "text": "Citizen's benefit is a state welfare benefit. It is paid when people have no income or do not earn enough money to support themselves and their dependents. In this context, the Jobcenters refer to this as a \u201ccommunity of need\u201d (Bedarfsgemeinschaft).\nWho is eligible for citizen's benefit\nThe basic requirements apply:\n- positiv:You or members of your community of need are in need of assistance.\n- positiv:You are capable of working.\n- positiv:You are at least 15 years old and have not yet reached the age limit for your pension.\n- positiv:You live in Germany and have the centre of life here.\nTipp:You are less than 15 years old or you cannot work for health reasons: In this case, you are eligible to receive citizen\u2019s benefit if you live in a community of need with persons who fulfil the requirements.\nOther requirements for people from abroad\nIf you do not have German citizenship, additional requirements apply:\n- positiv:You are from a country which is part of the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland: You were previously employed in Germany and lost your job through no fault of your own.\n- positiv:You are from another country (third countries): Your residence status determines whether you are eligible to receive citizen\u2019s benefit.\nThose who are not eligible for citizen's benefit\nYou are not eligible for citizen\u2019s benefit, if you ...\n- negativ:are not legally a resident of Germany.\n- negativ:receive financial assistance under the Asylum Seekers\u2019 Benefits Act.\n- negativ:have only come to Germany to look for a job.\nThese are your obligations as a recipient of citizen's benefit\nAs a recipient of citizen\u2019s benefit, you receive financial support from the Jobcenter. This support also comes with some specific obligations that you are required to fulfil, however.\nThese include:\n1. Attend your appointments at the Jobcenter\nYour Jobcenter will invite you to regular appointments. You are required to attend these appointments. At these appointments, you can clarify, for example\n- outstanding questions about your application.\n- how to improve your chances of finding a new job.\n- how the Jobcenter can help you find a job.\n- specific next steps on your journey to finding a new job, which are recorded together with you in your cooperation plan.\nWichtig:Important: If you cannot attend your appointment, because you are ill for example, please inform the Jobcenter immediately. Failure to attend without informing the Jobcenter can result in reductions in your support.\n2. Tell the Jobcenter about any changes\nThe amount of support paid to you as citizen\u2019s benefit is based on your personal circumstances. If these change, you are required to inform the Jobcenter.\nImportant changes are, for example:\n- You take up a new job, start an apprenticeship or start a course of study.\n- Somebody moves in or out of your home.\n- You get married or have a child.\nWichtig:Important: If you do not report changes or report them too late, this results in disadvantages for you: You may be required to pay back money, you may have to pay a fine, or there may even be criminal consequences.\n3. Work together with the Jobcenter\nThe goal of the Jobcenter is for you to become independent of government assistance again.\nYou are therefore obliged\n- to look for a job on your own.\n- to apply for jobs that the Jobcenter suggests to you and that are reasonable.\n- attend courses that the Jobcenter offers you and pays for.\n- comply with the agreements in your cooperation plan.\nCitizen's benefit is composed as follows\nCitizen's benefit is paid monthly. It is calculated individually and consists of several parts:\nStandard support requirement\nThe \u201cstandard support requirement\u201d (Regelbedarf) refers to the fixed-rate amounts with which you can cover your daily living costs. These include, for example, expenses for food, clothing and electricity.\nThe exact amount depends, among others, on how old you are and whether you live alone or with other people.\nThe current standard support requirements are available on the website of the Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs: Basic income support for job-seekers\nTipp:Good to know: If you receive citizen\u2019s benefit, you are automatically enrolled in the statutory health insurance and care insurance system.\nAccommodation costs\nIn addition to the standard support requirement, the Jobcenter pays for your heating and accommodation, for example the rent for your apartment. Condition: The costs are reasonable. The extent to which costs are \u201creasonable\u201d depends on where you live.\nWichtig:Important: Make sure you check with your Jobcenter before moving and signing a new rental agreement.\nOther benefits\nIn the case of special circumstances, you are eligible to receive a supplement to your standard support requirement. This may be paid, for example, if you are a single parent or you are pregnant.\nOne-off financial assistance is also available, if you are furnishing your own apartment or you are pregnant and need to buy things for your child, for example.\nTipp:Good to know: Children, adolescents and young adults are eligible to receive \u201cbenefits for education and participation\u201d. These include, for example, grants for school-related needs or for the membership of a sports club.\nApplying for citizen's benefit\nYou can apply for citizen\u2019s benefit online.\nTo do this, you are required to register for our eServices. If you already have an account with us, please log in with your login details.\nYou can then make an immediate start with your application.\nOnce your application has been reviewed, you will receive a written response from the Jobcenter by mail (technical term: notice [Bescheid]).\nPlease note: you can enable online delivery in your account for our eServices. The notice will then be sent to you online.\nYou can also send your application for citizen\u2019s benefit in paper form (for example, by post) to your local Jobcenter. To do this, you have to fill out some forms.\nFurther information is available on the citizen\u2019s benefit website: Application and notice.\nAdvice from the Jobcenter\nIn addition to financial security, the Jobcenter offers you comprehensive advice and support. The objective is for you to be able to support yourself again as soon as possible and on a permanent basis. We support you by encouraging you and helping to find offers for you regarding your job search.\nYou are welcome to raise the following topics in your consultation:\n- finding a suitable job in Germany.\n- the possibility of receiving financial assistance for job applications.\n- a language course if you have limited knowledge of German.\n- embarking on an apprenticeship, if you are interested in one.\nMake an appointment with your Jobcenter. To find out which Jobcenter is responsible for you, use the Jobcenter search at the bottom of the page.\nAppointments are also available for persons without knowledge of German\nIf you have little or no knowledge of German, you can still make an appointment with us. You have the following options:\n- Take a person with you whom you trust and who is able to translate for you.\n- When making an appointment, say that you need an interpreter. We will then initiate all of the further steps."

      "text": "\u201eBewirb dich online\u201c: So preist der deutsche Staat Zuwanderern das B\u00fcrgergeld an\nDeutschland ist ein gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiges Land. Es ist so gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig, dass es Zuwanderern aus dem Ausland nicht nur erkl\u00e4rt, wie man einen Job ergattert, sondern auch gleich, wie man ohne Arbeit in Deutschland \u00fcber die Runden kommt.\n\u201eCitizen\u2019s benefit (B\u00fcrgergeld) for People from Abroad\u201c hei\u00dft eine Seite der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit, auf der Interessenten \u00fcber die M\u00f6glichkeit des staatlich finanzierten Lebens aufgekl\u00e4rt werden.\nB\u00fcrgern\u00e4he wird bei der Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit \u00fcberhaupt gro\u00dfgeschrieben\nDamit niemand auf die irrige Idee kommt, B\u00fcrgergeld sei nur etwas f\u00fcr Menschen, die zu alt oder zu krank zum Arbeiten sind, strahlt einen von der Seite ein junges P\u00e4rchen an, das so aussieht, als ob es m\u00fchelos eine Besch\u00e4ftigung f\u00e4nde. Links ein junger Mann Anfang drei\u00dfig mit einem gr\u00fcn eingebundenen Buch in der Hand; neben ihm eine junge Frau mit Hijab, die ebenfalls nicht so wirkt, als ob sie auf den Kopf gefallen w\u00e4re.\nBesucher der Webseite erfahren nicht nur alles \u00fcber die Bedingungen f\u00fcr ein Leben auf St\u00fctze (\u201eDu bist arbeitsf\u00e4hig\u201c, \u201eDu bist mindestens 15 Jahre\u201c, \u201eDu hast deinen Lebensmittelpunkt in Deutschland\u201c). Die Agentur gibt auch hilfreiche Tipps, die sie mit einer kleinen Gl\u00fchbirne versehen hat, damit der Leser sie nicht \u00fcbersieht: \u201eGut zu wissen: Wenn du B\u00fcrgergeld erh\u00e4ltst, bist du automatisch im System der gesetzlichen Gesundheits- und Pflegeversicherung eingeschrieben.\u201c Hand aufs Herz, wer k\u00f6nnte da Nein sagen?\nB\u00fcrgern\u00e4he wird bei der Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit \u00fcberhaupt gro\u00dfgeschrieben. Deshalb findet sich am Ende der Seite ein rot markiertes Feld, das man nur anklicken muss, um sich unb\u00fcrokratisch f\u00fcr die Transferleistung registrieren zu lassen. \u201eDu kannst dich online bewerben\u201c, hei\u00dft es dort, so als handele es sich beim B\u00fcrgergeld um einen Sprachkurs oder ein Fortbildungsprogramm f\u00fcr Hochbegabte. \u201eWenn du bereits einen Account besitzt, logge dich bitte mit deinem Accountnamen ein. Du kannst dann augenblicklich mit der Bewerbung beginnen.\u201c\nMan sieht den Erfolg auch bei den Kosten\nIch wei\u00df nicht, ob es viele L\u00e4nder gibt, die so stolz ihr Sozialsystem bewerben. Ich habe nicht die Probe aufs Exempel gemacht. Aber ich bezweifle, dass man in den Vereinigten Staaten oder in Kanada Einwanderern in den leuchtendsten Farben die Vorz\u00fcge des Wohlfahrtsstaats ausmalt.\nSie wollen keine Podcast-Folge mehr verpassen? Abonnieren Sie \u201eDer Schwarze Kanal\u201c hier.\nGemessen an den Zugangszahlen ist die Werbekampagne der Agentur f\u00fcr Arbeit ein voller Erfolg. Gut die H\u00e4lfte der B\u00fcrgergeldbezieher hat inzwischen einen ausl\u00e4ndischen Pass. Das steht zwar in krassem Widerspruch zum Talkshow-Mantra, wonach wir Einwanderung br\u00e4uchten, um unsere Sozialsysteme am Laufen zu halten. Aber kaum jemand in der Politik scheint sich daran zu st\u00f6ren. Beziehungsweise: Das Sozialsystem wird am Laufen gehalten, nur ganz anders, als es von seinen Architekten in Aussicht gestellt wurde.\nMan sieht den Erfolg auch bei den Kosten. Allen Ank\u00fcndigungen zum Trotz sind die Ausgaben in den vergangenen Jahren laufend gestiegen, von 39 Milliarden Euro im Jahr 2022 auf 43 Milliarden in 2023 und dann 47 Milliarden in 2024. Der Bundeskanzler hat angek\u00fcndigt, die B\u00fcrgergeldkosten zu senken. Aber ich gebe Ihnen Brief und Siegel, dass daraus nichts folgen wird.\nHin und wieder kommen die Probleme an die Oberfl\u00e4che\nUnd das sind nur die offiziell ausgewiesenen Zahlen. Daneben gibt es ja noch die Kosten f\u00fcr Unterbringung und medizinische Versorgung, die nirgendwo so richtig auftauchen. Die neue Gesundheitsministerin Nina Warken hat neulich einen Vorsto\u00df gemacht, die Leistungen f\u00fcr B\u00fcrgergeldempf\u00e4nger aus dem Etat der Krankenkassen herauszunehmen. Dass die Krankenkassenbeitr\u00e4ge ebenfalls dramatisch steigen, liegt auch daran, dass immer mehr Leute beim Arzt vorsprechen, die selbst keine Beitr\u00e4ge zahlen.\nWarken hat vorgeschlagen, die Behandlungskosten k\u00fcnftig aus Steuereinnahmen zu decken. Aber nichts f\u00fcrchten die B\u00fcrgergeld-Advokaten so sehr wie Transparenz. Solange die Kosten im allgemeinen Gesundheitsbudget untergehen, gibt\u2019s auch keine politische Diskussion. Nicht auszudenken, wenn zutage tr\u00e4te, wie viele Milliarden allein die Zahnbehandlung kostet. Das m\u00f6chte man dann doch lieber vermeiden.\nHin und wieder kommen die Probleme an die Oberfl\u00e4che, so wie Blasen in einem gro\u00dfen Teich. Vor ein paar Tagen trat der Hauptgesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer des Deutschen Landkreistages in der \u201eFrankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung\u201c mit einem Notruf auf. Die Kommunen bef\u00e4nden sich im freien Fall. Auf die Frage, weshalb die Lage so desolat sei, nannte er zwei Gr\u00fcnde: steigende Personalkosten (plus acht Milliarden) und wachsende Sozialausgaben (plus neun Milliarden).\nDer Ort, der am weitesten von der Realit\u00e4t entfernt liegt, ist das Willy-Brandt-Haus\nFrage der \u201eFAZ\u201c: \u201eGibt es einzelne Posten, die besonders auff\u00e4llig sind?\u201c Antwort: \u201eWir hatten die Anpassung der Regels\u00e4tze in der Sozialhilfe und im B\u00fcrgergeld, au\u00dferdem sind mehr Menschen in den Leistungsbezug gekommen.\u201c\nJeder Stadtk\u00e4mmerer kann einem vorrechnen, was das bedeutet. Weil die Kommunen immer mehr f\u00fcr Personal und Sozialleistungen ausgeben, muss an anderer Stelle gespart werden \u2013 beim Bus, beim Freibad, beim Sport, beim Theater. Das bekommen auch die B\u00fcrger mit, die nicht von Sozialtransfers leben, sondern die Chose \u00fcber ihre Steuern am Laufen halten.\nEntsprechend ist die Stimmung. Und im Augenblick ist die Wirtschaftslage noch so, dass \u00fcberall h\u00e4nderingend Leute gesucht werden, die mit anpacken. Man mag sich nicht ausmalen, wie die Lage erst aussieht, wenn die Zahl der Arbeitslosen mal wieder bei f\u00fcnf Millionen steht.\nDer Ort, der am weitesten von der Realit\u00e4t entfernt liegt, ist das Willy-Brandt-Haus. Dort hat man sich entschieden, die Wirklichkeit f\u00fcr etwas zu halten, dem man am besten mit Verdr\u00e4ngung und Beschw\u00f6rung beikommt. Ich w\u00fcrde sagen, das ist schon bei der Ampel gr\u00fcndlich schiefgegangen. Aber das sieht man in der SPD-Zentrale anders.\nAuch so untergr\u00e4bt man das Vertrauen in den Staat\nDort hat man den Eindruck, wenn man dabei geblieben w\u00e4re, die Probleme zu leugnen, w\u00e4re man noch immer im Amt. Deshalb hat Lars Klingbeil die Parole ausgegeben, dass beim B\u00fcrgergeld alles beim Alten bleiben soll. Man d\u00fcrfe nicht auf dem R\u00fccken von Menschen sparen, die gerade hier angekommen seien, wie er sich ausdr\u00fcckte.\nAuch so untergr\u00e4bt man das Vertrauen in den Staat und seine Institutionen. Man verspricht den Menschen, dass sie von Einwanderung profitieren werden, und dann pr\u00e4sentiert man ihnen eine Rechnung, die allen Ank\u00fcndigungen Hohn spricht.\nDie neue Regierung hat das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Schuldenprogramm der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte auf den Weg gebracht. Trotzdem fehlt \u00fcberall das Geld, weil die Ausgaben noch schneller steigen als die Schulden. Ich will nicht unken. Aber der Weg in den Untergang begann schon einmal mit der Zerr\u00fcttung der Staatsfinanzen. Wenn der B\u00fcrger den Eindruck hat, dass Solidit\u00e4t nichts mehr z\u00e4hlt, dann w\u00e4hlt er irgendwann auch unsolide. Das gilt zumal, wenn an der Spitze Leute stehen, die eben noch f\u00fcr sich in Anspruch nahmen, der Garant f\u00fcr Seriosit\u00e4t und Verl\u00e4sslichkeit zu sein.\nDass Sozialdemokraten nicht mit dem Geld auskommen, das sie anderen abnehmen: geschenkt. Das ist bekannt. Aber dass auch auf Konservative kein Verlass mehr ist, das k\u00f6nnte der ber\u00fchmte Tropfen sein, der das Fass zum \u00dcberlaufen bringt."

  "argos_summary": "Germany's Federal Employment Agency is promoting the 'citizen's benefit' (B\u00fcrgergeld) to young migrants, presenting it as an accessible welfare option for those without work. The agency's website outlines eligibility criteria and emphasizes a straightforward application process, while also highlighting obligations for recipients. Columnist Jan Fleischhauer critiques this approach, noting that a significant portion of benefit recipients are non-citizens, which raises concerns about the sustainability of Germany's welfare system amidst rising costs and political debates over immigration and social support.",
