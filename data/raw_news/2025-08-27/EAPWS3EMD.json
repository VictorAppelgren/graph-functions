  "content": "Pro-DEI organizers fired up to maintain Target boycott as promises go unfulfilled Organizers of a Target boycott that began in January are pointing to their tactics as a hopeful sign that actions against corporate retailers can still make a deep impact. Organizers of a Target boycott that began in January are pointing to their tactics as a hopeful sign that actions against corporate retailers can still make a deep impact. When Target announced its current chief executive officer will be stepping down in February 2026 and an insider was taking the helm, those organizers saw it as a move in the right direction and stress more than ever that boycotts will continue as long as previous promises made to the public go unfulfilled. \"It's been now nearly 200 days and what all the statistics and economics are showing that since that boycott was announced on that Monday \u2014 every single week since then \u2014 Target foot traffic in nearly 2,000 stores has declined sharply and continues to decline,'' said organizer Jaylani Hussein, at a news conference of the National Target Boycott movement outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters late last week. Boycott organizers in Minnesota were among some of the first to galvanize when Target opted in January to follow other companies like Amazon and Walmart and forego diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. High-profile civil rights activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jamal Bryant also made similar calls for what they deemed a betrayal of previous DEI promises. Social justice advocates say this shows boycotting is a key tactic not to be taken for granted. Retail analysts say it's difficult to gauge the exact impact of the boycott, since Target has faced a slump the last few years and a leadership change was in the cards. Still, groups like Washington-based DC Boycott Target Coalition insist falling foot traffic is ''due in no small part'' to a boycott that spans coast to coast. ''The leadership change doesn't mean anything without a culture change,\" the group said in a statement, vowing to continue pressuring Target until the corporation sees its diversity goals as \"more important than bowing to an administration that is filled with racism, failure and hatred.'' Opponents began the national boycott in February, during Black History Month. Their strategy left some Black-owned brands with merchandise on Target shelves conflicted or scrambling. By April, Sharpton actually met with Target's CEO Brian Cornell, who had been at the helm for 11 years. But, nothing concrete came of it. Cornell's departure from the role had been in the works for several years. In September 2022, the board extended Cornell's contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65. When Target's chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke takes over, Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board. In a call with reporters, Fiddelke attributed the sales malaise to many issues like focusing too much on basics and not enough trendy items, particularly in home goods. Stacey Widlitz, president of investment research firm SW Retail Advisors, said she believes that Target's sales malaise has more to do with its operational issues \u2014 messy stores and poorly stocked shelves \u2014 not from its pullback from DEI initiatives. Unraveling them did not affect Target ''exponentially compared to somebody else,'' she said. ''The consumer has a very short memory. If you have great, compelling product at value prices, they'll forgive you.\" The number of Americans who say they regularly shop at Target has gone down 19% since 2021, according to Consumer Edge. The number of Americans who say they do not shop at Target has risen 17%. The same analysis also looked at trends along party lines. Since last year, the number of regular Target shoppers who identify as Democrat has declined 13%. Inversely, the number of Republican customers has risen 13%. It's not clear if that is due to Target's $1 million donation to Trump's inauguration or some other factors. The strategy of racial justice boycotts stretches back over 160 years, from Reconstruction era ''Buy Black'' campaigns stressing the Black American economic influence to the Montgomery Bus Boycott of the Civil Rights Movement. There have been more modern campaigns like the NAACP's 15-year economic boycott of the state of South Carolina over its display of the confederate battle flag widely regarded as a symbol of hatred and slavery. The civil rights group ended its boycott in 2015 after the state removed the flag from its statehouse grounds, following the massacre of nine Black parishioners at a historic African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston. Some Black creators on the social media platform TikTok rejoiced on the platform at the CEO leaving and credited the boycotts. Others cautioned that Cornell was essentially promoted but that the boycott is still needed. Black Americans' buying power has climbed over the last 25 years and is now an estimated $2.1 trillion annually, according to Nielsen research. Part of the reason organizers say they have zeroed in on Target is because the company had heavily touted a commitment to DEI back in 2020 after protests erupted across the nation over the murder of George Floyd. That year, Target announced it would increase representation of Black staff by 20% over three years and invest $10 million in social justice organizations. In 2021, the company pledged to dedicate more than $2 billion toward Black-owned businesses before the end of 2025. In January, however, Target said it would conclude the hiring and advancement goals it had set. For boycott organizers, a reversal of those decisions is the only way to rectify the situation. ''We're expecting that Target is making good on the promises that it made. Otherwise there's no point of discussion regarding calling off this boycott,'' said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and past president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP. ''We're asking people to join us, get involved and hold Target accountable for its actions.'' AP Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.\nThat may be changing.\nFrom New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It\u2019s putting a spotlight on Trump\u2019s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.\nYet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate \u2014 away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.\n\u2018\u2019Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,\u2019\u2019 Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. \u2018\u2019Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.\u2019\u2019\nDemocrats are ramping up visits to detention centers\nAcross the country, Democrats have shown up \u2014 sometimes unannounced \u2014 at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration\u2019s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.\n\u2018\u2019Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. \u2018\u2019You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado\u2019s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.\u2019\u2019"

The Trump administration said it intends to deport him to the African country of Uganda.\nAdministration officials have said he's part of the dangerous MS-13 gang, an allegation Abrego Garcia denies.\nThe Salvadoran national's lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts in court, arguing he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has also told immigration authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.\nA request for asylum in 2019\nA U.S. immigration judge denied his request for asylum in 2019 because he applied more than a year after he had fled to the U.S. He left El Salvador at the age of 16, around 2011, to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen and was living in Maryland.\nAlthough he was denied asylum, the immigration judge did issue an order shielding Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he faced credible threats of violence from a gang there that had terrorized him and his family. He was granted a form of protection known as ''withholding of removal,'' which prohibits him from being sent to El Salvador but allows his deportation to another country.\nFollowing the 2019 ruling, Abrego Garcia was released under federal supervision and continued to live with his American wife and children in Maryland. He checked in with ICE each year, received a federal work permit and was working as a sheet metal apprentice earlier this year, his lawyers have said."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's administration is taking management of Union Station away from Amtrak in the latest example of the federal government exerting its power over the nation's capital.\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the takeover Wednesday alongside Amtrak President Roger Harris at Washington's main transportation hub during the launch of an updated version of the rail service's Acela train. The federal government owns Union Station, which is near the Capitol.\nDuffy said the station has ''fallen into disrepair'' when it should be a ''point of pride'' for the District of Columbia. He said the Republican administration's move would help beautify the landmark in an economical way and was in line with Trump's vision.\n''He wants Union Station to be beautiful again. He wants transit to be safe again. And he wants our nation's capital to be great again. And today is part of that,'' Duffy said.\nIt's Trump's latest attempt to put the city under his control. In recent weeks, Trump has increased the number of federal law enforcement and immigration agents on city streets while also taking over the Metropolitan Police Department and activating thousands of National Guard members. Last week, Trump said he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington.\nDuffy said the federal government can do a better job managing the train station and attract more shops and restaurants and generate more revenue that will be used to pay for upgrades to the station, which opened in 1907. Since then, the cavernous Roman-columned building has been through multiple management changes and numerous ups and downs regarding its cleanliness, safety and state of repair.\nMayor Muriel Bowser said upgrading the transit hub that serves various rail lines and buses would be an ''amazing initiative'' for the federal government to take on because the city cannot afford the cost.\n''It has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation,'' the Democrat said at a separate news conference."

Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has 660 restaurants in 43 states, made the change as part of a wider plan to modernize its restaurants and appeal to younger customers.\nThe chain\u2019s sales have been slipping as it faces growing competition from breakfast chains and others. In its 2024 fiscal year, Cracker Barrel\u2019s same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, dropped 0.1% despite a 4.9% increase in menu prices. Same-store retail sales at its shops fell 5.5%.\nBut many protested the change.

The company said it would continue to honor Uncle Herschel \u2014 the older man in its logo, who represents the uncle of Cracker Barrel\u2019s founder \u2014 on its menu and on items sold in its stores.\nBut the controversy continued. On Tuesday morning, Trump said via Truth Social that Cracker Barrel \u2018\u2019should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before.\u2019\u2019 Cracker Barrel\u2019s shares rose after more than a week of declines."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.\nThe new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who would have to prove their risk \u2014 and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.\nAdditionally, Pfizer's vaccine will no longer be available for any child under 5, because the FDA said it was revoking the shot's emergency authorization for that age group.\nParents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company's Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.\nThe revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they'll be able to get one, with access dependent on decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.\nThe new restrictions \u2014 previewed by FDA officials in May \u2014 are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.\nThe approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.\n''The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,'' Kennedy wrote on social media."

The toll from the attack on Nasser Hospital rose to 22 after two more people died Wednesday, Gaza health officials said.\nThe Israeli military, which has said it will investigate, offered no immediate explanation for striking twice and no evidence for an assertion that six of the dead were militants.\nAs a growing chorus of international leaders urge Israel to reconsider its offensive and commit to talks, Pope Leo XIV called for Israel to halt the ''collective punishment'' and forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza.\nIsrael prepares Gaza City for an evacuation\nAid groups warn that an expanded Israeli military offensive could worsen the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory, where most of the over 2 million residents have been displaced, neighborhoods lie in ruins and a famine has been declared in Gaza City.\nThe Israeli military on Wednesday told residents of Gaza City to prepare to leave.\n''The evacuation of Gaza City is inevitable,'' spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote in Arabic on X.

      "text": "Minnehaha Academy found itself in a turf war over a turf field with its neighbors off West River Parkway.\nLast year, the Minneapolis-based K-12 private school submitted its soccer field renovation proposals to the Minneapolis City Planning Commission. The proposals included updating the upper campus\u2019 pitch from natural grass to artificial turf.\nMinnehaha\u2019s residential neighbors voiced concerns that included both increased usage of the field and potential chemical contamination from turf materials. The city\u2019s denial of the request cited that synthetic turf\u2019s tendency to overheat and raise surface temperatures clashed with the city\u2019s environmental goals.\nThe debate over using artificial grass forced the school to consider alternatives. The eventual decision to go with a hybrid grass field puts Minnehaha Academy into a rare class: the first school in Minnesota, and one of the first in the U.S., to adopt this type of blended turf.\n\u201cTo the average athletic director, it\u2019s [artificial] turf or grass,\u201d Minnehaha Academy athletic director Josh Thurow said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we know here in Minnesota.\u201d\nThe playing surface, stitched together in about 20 days, will be the same kind used at Minnesota United\u2019s Allianz Field and the Green Bay Packers\u2019 Lambeau Field.\nMike Huray, Minnehaha Academy\u2019s chief financial officer, said the cost of installing the hybrid grass was comparable to what the school had budgeted for an artificial turf field; he gave a price range of $300,000 to $600,000 for the new pitch. An additional charge, according to the administration, comes in the recurring cost of grassy grounds upkeep.\nWhat is hybrid grass?\nGrassMaster, the company installing Minnehaha\u2019s field, originated in 1989 and has since installed fields for soccer\u2019s World Cup as well as at many pro facilities. Two GrassMaster machines were flown in from Brazil, their shipping container taking up a handful of spots in Minnehaha Academy\u2019s parking lot in August.\nComments"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors have failed to obtain a felony indictment against a man who was seen on camera hurling a sandwich at a federal law enforcement official in the nation's capital, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nSean Charles Dunn was arrested on an assault charge after he threw a sub-style sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent. A video of the incident went viral, and shortly after he was fired from the Justice Department, where he worked as an international affairs specialist in the department's criminal division.\nThe case is one of the examples of the legal pushback to President Donald Trump's law enforcement surge in Washington that has led to more than 1,000 arrests. It is highly unusual for grand jurors to refuse to return an indictment, and it was once said that prosecutors could persuade a grand jury to ''indict a ham sandwich.''\nGrand jurors decide in secret proceedings whether there is enough evidence for an indictment, and prosecutors could go back to try again in Dunn's case. The person briefed on the failure to obtain an indictment against Dunn on Tuesday was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA message seeking comment was sent Wednesday to a spokesperson for the top federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, whose office is prosecuting the case. An attorney for Dunn declined to comment.\nThe New York Times first reported the development.\nDunn's arrest came in one of the first days after Trump's Aug. 11 order for federal agents and troops to flood Washington. Authorities say Dunn approached a group of CBP agents, pointed a finger in an agent's face and swore at him, calling him a ''fascist,'' a police affidavit says. An observer's video captured Dunn throwing a sandwich at the agent's chest, the affidavit says.\n''Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!'' Dunn shouted, according to police."

      "text": "A husband is speaking out with words of caution after a hit-and-run driver plowed into his wife while she pulled two of their children in a wagon in a Twin Cities intersection last week.\nThe crash near the family\u2019s Eden Prairie home on Aug. 22 left one child, 2-year-old Somaia Kamawal, fighting for her life at HCMC. Her mother, 27-year-old Spogmai Kamawal, and her 11-month-old brother, Samir, were slightly injured. Two other small children on foot with the family were not physically harmed.\nThe State Patrol is leading the investigation into the crash about 8:20 p.m. at the intersection of Mitchell Road and Chestnut Drive in Eden Prairie. There was no word as of Wednesday about either the driver or the vehicle being found.\n\u201cSeeing Somaia in the pediatric intensive care unit is very hard,\u201d the children\u2019s father, Naseer Kamawal, said in a statement released Tuesday evening by the hospital. \u201cWe know she is strong and our daughter is getting the best care, but it is still very difficult to see your precious child in critical condition.\u201d\nNaseer Kamawal urged drivers to \u201cwatch for pedestrians and use extra caution. If you\u2019re walking, please be careful and watch for vehicles. ... It was wrong for someone to hit my family and drive away, I also don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. Don\u2019t let this person keep you from enjoying time with your family outdoors.\u201d\nThe father thanked the first responders who rushed to his family\u2019s aid at the Eden Prairieintersection, medical staff at HCMC and \u201cour community who have been supporting us through these difficult few days, and law enforcement for their work to solve this case. ... We are looking for justice for our family and to have this case solved as soon as possible.\u201d\nAn online fundraising campaign started on behalf of the Kamawals noted that \u201cthis family moved from St. Paul to Eden Prairie four years ago seeking a safer community and better opportunities for their children. Now, instead of living the life they worked so hard to build, they are facing unimaginable pain, medical bills, and the long road of recovery.\u201d"

      "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 A top Florida official says the controversial state-run immigration detention facility in the Everglades will likely be empty in a matter of days, even as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration and the federal government fight a judge's order to shutter the facility dubbed ''Alligator Alcatraz'' by late October. That's according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press.\nIn a message sent to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman on Aug. 22 related to providing chaplaincy services at the facility, Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie said ''we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days.\" Rojzman, and the executive assistant who sent the original email to Guthrie, both confirmed the veracity of the messages to the AP on Wednesday.\nA spokesperson for Guthrie, whose agency has overseen the construction and operation of the site, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe facility was rapidly constructed two months ago with the goal of holding up to 3,000 detainees as part of President Donald Trump's push to deport people who are in the U.S. illegally. At one point, it held almost 1,000 detainees, but U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said that he was told during a tour last week that only 300 to 350 detainees remained. Three lawsuits challenging practices at the detention center have been filed, including one that estimated at least 100 detainees who had been at the facility have been deported. Others have been transferred to other immigration detention centers.\nNews that the last detainee at ''Alligator Alcatraz'' could leave the facility within days came less than a week after a federal judge in Miami ordered the detention center to wind down operations, with the last detainee needing to be out within 60 days. The state of Florida appealed the decision, and the federal government asked U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams to put her order on hold pending the appeal, saying that the Everglades facility's thousands of beds were badly needed since other detention facilities in Florida were overcrowded.\nThe environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, whose lawsuit led to the judge's ruling, opposed the request. They disputed that the Everglades facility was needed, especially as Florida plans to open a second immigration detention facility in north Florida that DeSantis has dubbed ''Deportation Depot.''\nWilliams had not ruled on the stay request as of Wednesday.\nThe judge said in her order that she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days by transferring detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed."

      "text": "St. Thomas offensive lineman Jason Laliberte told reporters at the start of practice earlier this month that the Tommies coaching staff doesn\u2019t want the team looking ahead.\n\u201cOur coaches are really heavy on being in the moment and not focusing too far into the future,\u201d said Laliberte, a senior from Maple Grove. \u201cBut it\u2019s all in the back of our minds. We\u2019re definitely excited to get the opportunity [in the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs] this year.\u201d\nThe Tommies, who have been a provisional member of NCAA Division I since leaving the MIAC and Division III in 2021, were officially confirmed as a Division I member in June. They are fully eligible to compete in postseason play in all sports starting this fall after the NCAA Division I Board of Directors voted in June to approve a rule change that shortened the transition period for schools reclassifying from five years to four years. Before that vote, the Tommies wouldn\u2019t have been eligible for the playoffs until next season.\nTommies linebacker Ryan Sever, a senior from Benilde-St. Margaret\u2019s, said the team welcomed the news.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different juice in the locker room,\u201d he noted. \u201cA different level.\u201d\nThe Tommies, who open the season Thursday night at home against Lindenwood, are 31-13 overall and 26-6 in conference games since joining the Pioneer League in 2021.\nThe Tommies, who have not finished lower than third place in the 11-team non-scholarship league in their four seasons in the league, were picked to finish third in this season\u2019s preseason poll. San Diego, which finished second in the league last season, was the favorite. Defending champion Drake was picked No. 2.\nThe Tommies have four quarterbacks \u2014 Amari Powell, Ryan Jackson, Michael Rostberg and Andy Peters \u2014 competing for the starting position."
