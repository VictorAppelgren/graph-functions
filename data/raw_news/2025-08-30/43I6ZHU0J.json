  "content": "Anti-DEI activist and conservative political commentator Robby Starbuck has joined Meta in the hopes of getting rid of alleged biases in its AI technology.\n\nStarbuck, 36, has been a vocal opponent of DEI in corporate America in recent years and sued the tech giant after claiming its AI tool defamed him.\n\nHe alleged the company's AI chatbot falsely assert that he was arrested for and pled guilty to participating in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.\n\nThe two parties settled in early August and as part of that settlement, Meta is bringing Starbuck onboard to try and stop its AI from showing 'ideological and political bias.'\n\nIn a statement announcing the hiring, Meta said that is has worked on improving the accuracy of its artificial intelligence but Starbuck will give it a bigger boosts.\n\n'Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.'\n\nStarbuck told The Tennessean that his conservative views 'aren't a secret' but he's simply looking for Meta AI to be 'neutral' and 'fact driven.'\n\n'It's my goal to ensure fairness for everyone and ethical responses about everyone,' he said.\n\n'Regardless of your politics, I want to help shape a future where you don't have to worry about a thumb on the ideological scale. AI is going to be an increasingly large part of our lives and we all need it to be trustworthy, fair and accurate. It's my goal to be a part of making that happen.'\n\nStarbuck is seen as a rising star on the right after leading the charge in pushing corporations to end DEI programs.\n\nIn 2024, he predicted that within two years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the US and even overseas will be in the rearview mirror.\n\nBefore then, the dad-of-four, who's pressured everyone from Ford to Lowe's to ditch DEI, says his biggest targets are yet to come.\n\nThose targets coincidentally included his new employers at Meta and other big tech firms \u2014 not just over their internal procedures but also for content streams that he says harm kids.\n\nStarbuck has this year emerged as a hugely divisive character in America's culture wars.\n\nHe once directed music videos for Snoop Dogg and Megadeth in LA, but swapped that for rural living near Nashville, Tennessee, where he tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to win a Republican House seat in 2022.\n\nFrom a farm in Franklin, he's had greater success in posting X/Twitter videos exposing the DEI programs of top firms and getting their conservative customers to stop spending until executives scrap them.\n\nSo far, Ford, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply, Molson Coors, Caterpillar, and Brown-Forman, which makes Jack Daniel's, have all folded. Starbuck lauds his '100 percent success rate.'\n\nHis wins echo the past backlashes against Bud Light over its tie-up with a trans TikToker and Target for its Pride range, which some consumers said was inflammatory.\n\nStarbuck and other activists gained momentum after the US Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023.\n\nThat ruling sparked a series of lawsuits and complaints against companies for discriminating against white workers.\n\nMany companies that embraced DEI policies in the wake of the cop killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May 2020 have stepped back from them for fear of irking conservative patrons.\n\n'People deserve to be able to shop without thinking they're supporting some cause or having somebody else's social value shoved down their throat,' says Starbuck.\n\n'Companies should be neutral and stay out of politics and divisive social issues.'\n\nHe's now planning the final stage of his anti-DEI campaign by targeting 'wokery' at big tech firms.\n\nIt's a phase shift for Starbuck, as the DEI issues are more complicated, and the companies in question \u2014 from Meta to TikTok, and YouTube \u2014 are much wealthier than his past targets.\n\nHe seeks to halt not only their internal DEI systems, but also how they expose kids to violence, pornography, and posts that promote eating disorders, a negative self-image and radical gender ideology.\n\nStarbuck's campaigns to date have been successful as niche attacks on DEI. He may well struggle to make as much noise \u2014 and impact \u2014 when wrestling the world's wealthiest and most powerful corporations.",

      "text": "Walmart is the latest company to roll back DEI policies amid backlash\nWalmart has joined a growing list of major corporations and rolled back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The move by the world's largest retailer marks a seismic shift in corporate strategy that comes after attacks by conservatives and activists at the company's 'woke' policies. Some of the sweeping changes include abandoning a $100 million racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd.\nThe retail juggernaut also won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers that are 51 percent-owned by women, minorities, veterans or members of the LGBTQ community. Walmart's pivot is the latest domino to fall in a growing conservative crusade against DEI initiatives and underscores the increasing pressures faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the Supreme Court 's ruling in June 2023 that ended affirmative action in college admissions.\nEmboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups. Right-wing groups have relentlessly targeted corporate diversity efforts, branding them as ' woke overreach.' Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on X.\nSeveral of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe's and Tractor Supply. Boeing also took apart its DEI department reassigning staffers to teams within the company's human resources department Bud Light beer lost its spot as the top-selling beer in the U.S. in 2023 following a controversy over a social-media promotion. In the summer of 2023, Target's sales fell after coming in for criticism of its Pride month merchandise displays.\nBut Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so. The company typically tries to stay neutral on hot-button social issues to appeal to a broad spectrum of shoppers and workers. 'This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,' Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he had been in conversation with Walmart. 'No retail company wants a story about them from us ahead of Black Friday,' he said. Walmart also agreed to stop using the terms 'DEI' and 'Latinx' in official communication.\nStarbuck congratulated Walmart for its new direction. 'I have to give their executives major credit because this will send shockwaves throughout corporate America. This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,' he said while warning other corporate giants. 'We've now changed policy at companies worth over $2 Trillion,' he wrote. 'Companies like Amazon and Target should be very nervous that their top competitor dropped woke policies first. I think Target specifically will suffer serious sales problems as a result and Walmart will benefit.' Elon Musk also chimed in stating, 'The tide has turned', following Walmart's decision.\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it is not financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion is not next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said. The changes don't stop there. Walmart has scrapped any use of race or gender as a criterion in awarding supplier contracts, signaling a stark departure from efforts to improve diversity in its business partnerships. The company said it didn't have quotas and will not do so going forward. Additionally, it will cease tracking demographic data for grant eligibility and funding decisions.\nWalmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to: 'address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.' And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees, signaling a chilling blow to inclusivity. Critics argue Walmart's capitulation undermines years of progress toward equity in corporate America.\n'We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,' the company said in a statement. The changes come soon after an election win by Donald Trump, who has criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views. They include his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration. With Trump allies celebrating Walmart's pivot as a triumph, critics fear the tidal wave of 'anti-woke' rhetoric is only gaining momentum.\nA Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it has been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word 'belonging.' It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling. Walmart's stunning reversal will send shockwaves across corporate America, leaving DEI advocates scrambling to salvage initiatives in an increasingly hostile environment. Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying that DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream.\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

      "text": "Meta taps Robby Starbuck, part of larger conservative effort against alleged big tech bias\n- As part of a settlement agreement with Meta, former Tennessee congressional candidate and anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck has been appointed to help screen the company's AI for \"bias.\"\n- Starbuck, who is well known for targeting companies for their DEI practices, sued Meta for their AI chatbot's false responses about him.\n- His hiring is part of a larger trend of conservative pushback against alleged big-tech bias targeting conservative voices.\nFormer Tennessee congressional candidate and anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck has been appointed by Meta to help address \"ideological and political bias\" in the company\u2019s artificial intelligence endeavors, according to a statement released by Meta.\nThe move comes as part of an early-August settlement deal between Starbuck and Meta\u2014the parent company of Facebook \u2014 following a lawsuit from Starbuck that accused the social media giant of defamation after Meta AI returned false statements when users asked about Starbuck.\nIn a joint statement on X, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan and Starbuck said on Aug. 14 the two parties had \u201cresolved this matter to our mutual satisfaction.\u201d\n\u201cSince engaging on these important issues with (Starbuck), Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cBuilding on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.\u201d\nIn response to The Tennessean, Starbuck said that while he has his \"own political views that aren\u2019t a secret,\" he does \"not want to force them into an AI,\" as it \"needs to be a neutral fact driven system.\"\n\"It\u2019s my goal to ensure fairness for everyone and ethical responses about everyone,\" he said. \"Regardless of your politics, I want to help shape a future where you don\u2019t have to worry about a thumb on the ideological scale. AI is going to be an increasingly large part of our lives and we all need it to be trustworthy, fair and accurate. It\u2019s my goal to be a part of making that happen.\"\nStarbuck is well known to both big businesses and Tennessee residents. The Middle Tennessee-based activist has publicly targeted many businesses online for their DEI-practices through large social media campaigns, including Harley-Davidson, Walmart, Tractor Supply, John Deere and more. In some cases, he has taken credit online for companies scaling back or entirely removing DEI programs.\nThe Meta position will grant the conservative activist weight in one of the largest AI systems on the market with more than 1 billion users, according to a statement from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a May shareholder meeting and reported on by CNBC.\nDefamation suit gets attention of conservative lawmakers, officials\nStarbuck\u2019s lawsuit, filed in April, alleges that Meta committed defamation by knowingly sharing false statements about Starbuck, including statements about his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nIn court documents, Starbuck states that in response to Meta users\u2019 inquiries about him, Meta AI shared incorrect claims about him, including that he participated in the riot, was arrested for his involvement and ultimately pleaded guilty for disorderly conduct.\n\u201cImagine waking up one day and learning that a multi-billion-dollar corporation was telling whoever asked that you had been an active participant in one of the most stigmatized events in American history \u2013 the Capitol riot on January 6th, 2021 \u2013 and that you were arrested for and charged with a misdemeanor in connection with your involvement in that event,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cFurther imagine that these accusations were completely false: that you were at your home in Tennessee on January 6th, and that you had never been accused of committing any crime in your entire life.\u201d\nStarbuck alleged in court documents that he reached out to Meta executives about the issue, which he became aware of in August 2024.\nBut despite lengthy communications with Meta, according to Starbuck, the AI responses continued as recently as April 2025, when he filed the lawsuit.\n\u201cFrom that day I\u2019ve faced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family,\u201d he said, in a statement about the lawsuit on X.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d he added. \u201cYou could be the next target too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m taking on this David vs. Goliath fight. For me, my honor, my family, for our elections, and for you!\u201d\nDays after Starbuck filed his suit, conservative Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, shared Starbuck\u2019s statement on X, calling for an investigation and a \u201cseries of rigorous hearings\u201d into the matter.\n\u201cMeta has been undercutting conservatives for years \u2014 at great expense to Republican candidates and conservative causes throughout the country,\u201d he said.\nMelissa Holyoak, commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, responded to Lee on X and stated her concern with the matter.\n\u201cThis type of conduct, if true, is extremely alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cThe FTC wants to hear from tech platform users who have been banned, shadow banned, demonetized, or otherwise censored.\u201d\nShe shared a link to a federal inquiry launched by the FTC in February into Tech Censorship to \u201cbetter understand how technology platforms deny or degrade (such as by \u201cdemonetizing\u201d and \u201cshadow banning\u201d) users\u2019 access to services based on the content of the users\u2019 speech.\u201d\nThe public comment period for the inquiry, which closed on May 21, garnered nearly 3,000 responses, including several free speech organizations and major conservative advocacy groups.\nGroups like the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) and the CATO Institute argued against harsher content moderation, with FIRE saying the moves by the FTC were an \u201cattempt to evade the First Amendment by asserting government control over content moderation practices.\u201d\nHowever, conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, in their filed comment, submitted what the group alleges are detailed examples of censorship against conservative users by internet behemoths.\n\u201cThe framers of the Bill of Rights \u2014 specifically the First Amendment \u2014 understood the critical importance of free speech, and we must protect that freedom against threats from private companies as much as from government agents,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Phil Sechler, director of the ADF Center for Free Speech, in a statement announcing the filing.\nSome 763 of the responses \u2014 making up 26% of the comments \u2014 are filed anonymously, something that FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has previously criticized giving much weight to, according to a report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\nConcerns over big-tech bias part of a larger trend\nStarbuck\u2019s lawsuit, as well as the FTC\u2019s inquiry into big tech censorship, are part of an overarching trend of conservative pushback against alleged big tech bias targeting conservatives \u2014 and a major political pressure point of the Trump administration.\nOn his first day in office for his second term, Trump signed the Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship executive order, calling for an immediate end to all \u201cgovernment censorship.\u201d The order alleges that the federal government had previously violated American\u2019s free speech rights under the guise of combating online misinformation through third-party means.\n\u201cOver the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans\u2019 speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve,\u201d the order states.\nHowever, the Trump administration\u2019s promotion of free speech online stand at odds with previous actions by Trump, who has repeatedly been staunchly opposed to current legal protections that shield private internet companies from liability and, ironically, largely protect free speech rights online.\nSection 230, the landmark 1996 law that has shaped the internet, shields internet providers from a majority of civil liability regarding user-posted content, so that providers are not crippled with lawsuits for speech made by private citizens. Without it, internet platforms will likely be forced down one of two paths: either refrain from any type of content moderation, like those against hateful or harmful conduct, or proactively, heavily moderate speech in a restrictive way to avoid lawsuits.\nIn May 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term, he issued an executive order aimed at cutting the legal protections in Section 230 after Twitter, now known as X, fact-checked several of his tweets about voting by mail. The order was swiftly revoked by President Biden in 2021.\nSuch efforts have been hinted at returning multiple times in Trump's second term. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, appointed by Trump to the position in both his administrations, described his plan for \"reigning in Big Tech,\" which called for drastically curbing the liability protections offered in Section 230, in a chapter of the expansive conservative policy handbook Project 2025.\n\"The FCC has an important role to play in addressing the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,\" wrote Carr. \"Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.\"\nRobert Thompson, a media professor at Syracuse University, said that a crackdown on Section 230 has been a long time coming, thanks to right-leaning frustration towards a number of fact-checking initiatives by social media companies.\n\u201cConservatives, I think, feel that when it comes to the issue of these fact-checking situations, which is very much addressed in Section 230, that these efforts have been disproportionately aimed at them,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe biggest examples of this, which was all the vaccination and election fraud stuff, those kinds of things were where rational fact-checking did tend to point to the fact that this was not correct information. And those statements did tend to come from things that would have fallen under this huge umbrella of conservativism.\u201d\nA nuance often lost in the discussion, Thompson notes, is that the same people who are pushing for the restricting of Section 230 are also people who benefit heavily from it.\n\u201cIt is true that very many of the very people and entities that are really wanting to restrict, attack and maybe even completely revoke Section 230 are often the very entities who very much benefit from those protections,\u201d he said. \u201cLet's just say, for the sake of argument, they scrap Section 230 entirely, which gets rid of the whole opportunity to have immunity for their online content. Well, then the very people that advocated for getting rid of it are going to suddenly be upset when all of this stuff happens as a result of them not being protected by Section 230. Suddenly, these social media and other operations will be getting sued for what their users are posting, and then losing those lawsuits.\u201d\nThe USA TODAY Network - The South region's coverage of First Amendment issues is funded through a collaboration between the Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.\nHave a story to tell?
