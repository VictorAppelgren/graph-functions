      "summary": "The Los Angeles Times’ investigative reporter Brittny Mejia has pursued detailed information from the Trump administration’s immigration team after ICE raids in Southern California led to the arrest of U.S. citizens, including Brian Gavidia, who was mistakenly detained and later released. Mejia’s reporting exposed misstatements by DHS officials, highlighted racial profiling allegations, and prompted a federal judge to temporarily halt indiscriminate immigration stops. The case has sparked a lawsuit and increased scrutiny of ICE’s enforcement tactics, with the judge ordering agents to cease profiling based on appearance.",
