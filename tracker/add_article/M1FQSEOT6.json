      "summary": "U.S. equities rose on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining over 200 points and the S&P 500 up 0.8%, driven by strong earnings from Broadcom and DocuSign. Broadcom shares climbed 1.23% after reporting Q3 revenue and earnings that beat expectations, while DocuSign gained 0.45% on a solid Q2 earnings beat. Lululemon surged 3.81% on the day but fell 16% after-hours after the company cut its 2025 outlook, and Opendoor jumped 16% following a large CEO share sale that helped the stock avoid delisting. Neonode’s shares collapsed 71% after news of a pending patent‑lawsuit settlement, underscoring the volatility of tech stocks amid earnings and regulatory catalysts.",
