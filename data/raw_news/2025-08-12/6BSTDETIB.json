  "content": "Israel's GPO denounced NYT's interview as \"glossing over\" key moments in Zubeidi's career, including how his re-arrest in 2019 was due to ties with terror attacks, not an amnesty breach.\n\nPalestinian terrorist Zakaria Zubeidi, who was freed from an Israeli prison in February in exchange for hostages held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, spoke to The New York Times in an interview published on Tuesday.\n\nThe interview, which the outlet describes as \"his first major interview as a free man,\" describes Zubeidi as \"emblematic\" of a \"sense of hopelessness that imbues Palestinian life.\"\n\nZubeidi joined Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades (AAMB) during the Second Intifada, rising through the ranks to eventually become the leader of AAMB's Jenin cell, making him one of the most senior terrorists in the West Bank.\n\nHowever, Zubeidi claimed that his life as a terror leader proved \"ultimately futile\" in helping to found a Palestinian state. \"We have to reconsider our tools...we tried cultural resistance...we tried the rifle, we tried shooting. There's no solution.\" Zubeidi said.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Zubeidi was offered an amnesty in 2007, along with hundreds of other terrorists, as then-Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert pushed towards his peace plan, which was eventually rejected by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe report claims that Zubeidi was re-arrested in 2019 after \"breaking the terms of his amnesty,\" however, Israel's Government Press Office refuted this, stating that Zubeidi was sent back to prison after \"his involvement in a series of shooting attacks against buses,\" with a rap sheet which included \"Attempted murder; Contact with a hostile organization; and Conspiracy to murder.\"\n\nZubeidi instituted a jail break, and was recaptured within six days while awaiting trial in 2021.\n\n\"It was impossible for me to be imprisoned and not seek freedom,\" he said. \"The prisoner who does not think about escaping prison does not deserve freedom.\"\n\n\"There is no peaceful solution and there is no military solution,\" Zubeidi told The New York Times, adding, \"Because the Israelis don\u2019t want to give us anything.\"\n\nIn January, Zubeidi spoke to Sky News, when he asserted that \"resistance\u2026 will lead us to freedom.\"\n\nZubeidi, who was found guilty of terrorism by an Israeli court in 2019, told Sky News that he blames the international community for Israel\u2019s continued presence in the West Bank. The released terrorist admitted to being involved in a bombing attack in 2002, which killed six people.\n\n\"My life is worthless without freedom,\" he said, speaking in Ramallah. \"Freedom has no price. But the world that has denied me my freedom - particularly Britain, France, and the United States - must return what they have taken from me and my children.\n\n\"They are the ones who need to reconsider their mistakes, not me. They are the ones who have wronged us, and they should think about rectifying the harm they have caused to me and my children.\"\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz warned Zubeidi that if he makes one mistake, he will \"meet old friends,\" in a press statement in February.\n\n\"Zakaria Zubaidi, you were released in an agreement for the release of Israeli hostages - one mistake, and you are going to meet old friends. We will not accept support for terrorism.\"\n\nZubeidi's son, Mohammed, was killed in Israeli airstrikes in September 2024.\n\nZakaria Muhammad Abd al-Rahman al-Zubeidi was born in 1976 in Jenin to a family of nine.\n\nFrom a young age, he was involved in conflicts with the Israeli military, including being shot by soldiers after throwing stones at civilian vehicles, which he claimed caused him a lasting limp.\n\nAt 14, he was imprisoned for six months and later sentenced to four and a half years for throwing a Molotov cocktail. While serving his first sentence, he was recruited by Fatah. After his release, he joined the Palestinian police, worked as a builder in Tel Aviv, and drove a truck in Jenin.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother by IDF gunfire and his brother's death during Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, he turned to terrorism, joining Fatah's terrorist groups and fighting against the Israeli army during the operation.\n\nEventually, he joined AAMB. He was then responsible for a series of terrorist attacks, including many in the Samaria region, such as shooting at Israeli vehicles and, eventually, a suicide bombing at a Likud branch in Beit Shean, where six people were killed.",
