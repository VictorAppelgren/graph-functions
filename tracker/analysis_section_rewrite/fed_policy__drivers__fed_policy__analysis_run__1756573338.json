      "feedback": "The draft is on target but can be sharpened to meet Argos’ elite bar: 1) **Trim redundancy** – collapse the two “Fed cut → rally” paragraphs into one concise causal chain (Fed policy → 10‑yr yield → discount rate → valuation → spx). 2) **Anchor every claim with a source** – add inline citations for the 40 % tech weight, the 3–5 % rally magnitude, the 5–10 % downside, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread steepening; remove any statements that lack a citation. 3) **Quantify the tech concentration risk** – explicitly state that a 10 % earnings miss in the top‑10 could trigger a 3–4 % index pullback, citing FAN5RYW6T. 4) **Integrate the DXY catalyst** – note that a 50–100 bp DXY rise (Z7O1DCHS7) signals risk‑on sentiment that can lift spx, but keep it brief. 5) **Watch‑list clarity** – list only the three decisive windows (July CPI/PCE, Sept 5 payrolls, mid‑Sept Fed meeting) with expected directional impact. 6) **Remove extraneous mortgage‑rate discussion** – it dilutes focus; keep only the link to the 10‑yr yield. 7) **Ensure canonical mapping** – keep the handle spx, sign (+3–5 % or –5–10 %) and horizon (3–6 mo). After these edits, the paragraph will be concise, defensible, and fully compliant with the acceptance gate.",
