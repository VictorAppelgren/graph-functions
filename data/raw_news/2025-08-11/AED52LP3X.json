  "content": "The remains of an Antarctic explorer who went missing more than 60 years ago have been found \u2014 with his emotional brother saying his sibling had finally \u201ccome home.\u201d\n\nDennis \u201cTink\u201d Bell, a British meteorologist, disappeared in 1959 at age 25 after falling into a crevasse.\n\nHis bones were only discovered in January, when a melting glacier revealed them along with his wristwatch, radio and pipe.\n\n\u201cI had long given up on finding my brother. It is just remarkable, astonishing. I can\u2019t get over it,\u201d David Bell, 86, told BBC News.\n\nA team of Polish researchers had spotted Dennis\u2019s bones in some loose ice and rocks at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island and carefully recovered the remains in four separate trips.\n\n\u201cEvery effort was made to ensure that Dennis could return home,\u201d the team said in a statement.\n\nDavid, who now lives in Australia, plans to visit England soon, where he and his sister will finally put Dennis to rest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful; I\u2019m going to meet my brother,\u201d David said. \u201cYou might say we shouldn\u2019t be thrilled, but we are. He\u2019s been found \u2013 he\u2019s come home now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just sad my parents never got to see this day,\u201d David went on, adding that, \u201cMy mother never really got over it. She couldn\u2019t handle photographs of him and couldn\u2019t talk about him.\u201d\n\nDennis joined the Royal Air Force, where he trained as a meteorologist, before he was sent to Antarctica by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1958 for a two-year assignment stationed at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base on King George Island around 75 miles off the coast.\n\nHis job was to send up meteorological balloons and radio weather reports back to Britain, a grueling task that involved operating a generator in sub-zero conditions.\n\nHe was on a surveying trip on King George Island on July 26, 1959, when he slipped down a crevasse while attending to his sled dogs, according to accounts from his coworker at the time, Jeff Stokes, and seen by BBC News.\n\nStokes lowered a rope to Dennis, who tied it around his belt, but Stokes he pulled him up, the belt broke just at the top, and Dennis fell again, this time not answering.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a story I shall never get over,\u201d David said, describing how he was at home in London when his parents got the tragic news.\n\n\u201cThe telegram boy said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but this is bad news.\u2019 It was a horrendous moment,\u201d David said.\n\nStokes died just five weeks before the news emerged of the discovery of his friend\u2019s remains, BBC News reported.\n\nSince 1944, 29 people have died working on British Antarctic Territory on scientific missions, according to the British Antarctic Monument Trust.",

      "text": "British man who perished in Antarctic glacier found 65 years later\nThe bones of a British man who died in a terrible accident in Antarctica in 1959 have been discovered in a melting glacier.\nThe remains were found in January by a Polish Antarctic expedition, alongside a wristwatch, a radio, and a pipe.\nHe has now been formally identified as Dennis \"Tink\" Bell, who fell into a crevasse aged 25 when working for the organisation that became the British Antarctic Survey.\n\"I had long given up on finding my brother. It is just remarkable, astonishing. I can't get over it,\" David Bell, 86, tells BBC News.\n\"Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions,\" says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey .\n\"Even though he was lost in 1959, his memory lived on among colleagues and in the legacy of polar research,\" she adds.\nIt was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959.\n\"The telegram boy said, 'I'm sorry to tell you, but this is bad news',\" he says. He went upstairs to tell his parents.\n\"It was a horrendous moment,\" he adds.\nTalking to me from his home in Australia and sitting next to his wife Yvonne, David smiles as stories from his childhood in 1940s England spill out.\nThey are the memories of a younger sibling admiring a charming, adventurous big brother.\n\"Dennis was fantastic company. He was very amusing. The life and soul of wherever he happened to be,\" David says.\n\"I still can't get over this, but one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema,\" he says.\n\"And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table,\" he says.\n\"I can remember his style of dress, he always used to wear duffel coats. He was just an average sort of fellow who enjoyed life,\" he adds.\nDennis Bell, nickednamed \"Tink\", was born in 1934. He worked with the RAF and trained as a meteorologist, before joining the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey to work in Antarctica.\n\"He was obsessed with Scott's diaries,\" David says, referring to Captain Robert Scott who was one of the first men to reach the South Pole and died on an expedition in 1912.\nDennis went to Antarctica in 1958. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nThe British Antarctic Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and \"ridiculously isolated\" island.\nReading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: \"He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes.\"\nDennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions.\nDescribed as the best cook in the hut, he was in charge of the food store over the winter when no supplies could reach them.\nAntarctica felt even more cut off than it is today, with extremely limited contact with home. David recalls recording a Christmas message at BBC studios with his parents and sister Valerie to be sent to his brother.\nHe was best known for his love of the husky dogs used to pull sledges around the island, and he raised two litters of dogs.\nHe was also involved in surveying King George Island to produce some of the first mapping of the largely unexplored place.\nIt was on a surveying trip that the accident happened, a few weeks after his 25th birthday.\nOn 26 July 1959, in the deep Antarctic winter, Dennis and a man called Jeff Stokes left the base to climb and survey a glacier.\nAccounts in the British Antarctic Survey records explain what happened next and the desperate attempts to rescue him.\nThe snow was deep and the dogs had started to show signs of tiredness. Dennis went on ahead alone to encourage them, but he wasn't wearing his skis. Suddenly he disappeared into a crevasse, leaving a hole behind him.\nAccording to the accounts, Jeff Stokes called into the depths and Dennis was able to shout back. He grabbed onto a rope that was lowered down. The dogs pulled on the rope and Dennis was hitched up to the lip of the hole.\nBut he had tied the rope onto his belt, perhaps because of the angle he lay in. As he reached the lip, the belt broke and he fell again. His friend called again, but this time Dennis didn't reply.\n\"That's a story I shall never get over,\" says David.\nThe base camp reports about the accident are business-like.\n\"We heard from Jeff [\u2026] that yesterday Tink fell down a crevasse and was killed. We hope to return tomorrow, sea ice permitting,\" it continues.\nMr Hopkins explains that another man, called Alan Sharman, had died weeks earlier, and the morale was very low.\n\"The sledge has got back. We heard the sad details. Jeff has badly bitten frostbitten hands. We are not taking any more risks to recover,\" the report reads the day after the accident.\nReading the reports again, Mr Hopkins discovered that earlier in the season, it had been Dennis who'd made the coffin for Alan Sharman.\n\"My mother never really got over it. She couldn't handle photographs of him and couldn't talk about him,\" David says.\nHe recalls that two men on Dennis's base visited the family, bringing a sheepskin as a gesture.\n\"But there was no conclusion. There was no service; there was no anything. Just Dennis gone,\" David says.\nAbout 15 years ago, David was contacted by Rod Rhys Jones, chair of the British Antarctic Monument Trust.\nSince 1944, 29 people have died working on British Antarctic Territory on scientific missions, according to the trust.\nRod was organising a voyage for relatives of some of the 29 to see the spectacular and remote place where their loved ones had lived and died.\nDavid joined the expedition, called South 2015.\n\"The captain stopped at the locations and give four or five hoots of the siren,\" he says.\nThe sea-ice was too thick for David to reach his brother's hut on King George Island.\n\"But it was very, very moving. It lifted the pressure, a weight off my head, as it were,\" he says.\nIt gave him a sense of closure.\n\"And I thought that would be it,\" he says.\nBut on 29 January this year, a team of Polish researchers working from the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station stumbled across something practically on their doorstep.\nDennis had been found.\nSome bones were in the loose ice and rocks deposited at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island. Others were found on the glacier surface.\nThe scientists explain that fresh snowfall was imminent, and they put down a GPS marker so their \"fellow polar colleague\" would not be lost again.\nA team of scientists made up of Piotr Kittel, Paulina Bor\u00f3wka and Artur Ginter at University of Lodz, Dariusz Puczko at the Polish Academy of Sciences and fellow researcher Artur Adamek carefully rescued the remains in four trips.\nIt is a dangerous and unstable place, \"criss-crossed with crevasses\", and with slopes of up to 45 degrees, according to the Polish team.\nClimate change is causing dramatic changes to many Antarctic glaciers, including Ecology Glacier, which is undergoing intense melting.\n\"The place where Dennis was found is not the same as the place where he went missing,\" the team explains.\n\"Glaciers, under the influence of gravity, move their mass of ice, and with it, Dennis made his journey,\" they say.\nFragments of bamboo ski poles, remains of an oil lamp, glass containers for cosmetics, and fragments from military tents were also collected.\n\"Every effort was made to ensure that Dennis could return home,\" the team say.\n\"It's an opportunity to reassess the contribution these men made, and an opportunity to promote science and what we've done in the Antarctic over many decades,\" adds Rod Rhys Jones.\nDavid still seems overwhelmed by the news, and repeats how grateful he is to the Polish scientists.\n\"I'm just sad my parents never got to see this day,\" he says.\nDavid will soon visit England where he and his sister, Valerie, plan to finally put Dennis to rest.\n\"It's wonderful; I'm going to meet my brother. You might say we shouldn't be thrilled, but we are. He's been found - he's come home now.\""

      "text": "Uber rich tourists are paying upwards of $25K to visit this new hotspot \u2014 but pilots refuse to fly there: \u2018It\u2019s not worth the risk\u2019\nIt\u2019s got some pilots feeling flighty.\nAntarctica has become a trendy travel spot for extreme adventurers looking to chill out, with some intrepid explorers spending upwards of $25,000 for an icy-cold expedition, according to Aurora Expeditions.\nDespite the enticing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to take a true polar plunge or go penguin-spotting, many aviation experts say it\u2019s actually among the scariest places on the planet to fly.\nIt\u2019s not for lack of experience, or even the planes themselves \u2014 despite recent crashes and incidents that have air travelers feeling anxious \u2014 it\u2019s the weather and inestimable climate.\n\u201cI\u2019ve flown into mountainous regions, remote islands and through tropical storms. But Antarctica? That\u2019s different,\u201d Richard Wells, a 54-year-old retired pilot, told The Mirror.\n\u201cWeather changes with no warning, there are no proper runways in most areas, and if something goes wrong \u2014 there\u2019s no backup. It\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d\nThough the pilot has logged over 10,000 hours of hang time and has decades of experience flying over Europe, Asia, and the Americas, he\u2019s perfectly fine to leave Antarctic travel to the adventurers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no margin for error. The infrastructure is minimal, and even experienced flight crews have limited options if conditions deteriorate mid-flight. That\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever gamble with,\u201d Wells said.\nCommercial planes almost never fly in the region, and often, specialized, highly trained charter pilots are the only ones making the journey, Wells added. The small planes that fly there are also typically more prone to turbulence, making the windy skies above the sea especially scary.\n\u201cExercise increased caution in Antarctica due to environmental hazards posed by extreme and unpredictable weather and limited emergency services,\u201d warned a July 28 travel advisory issued by the U.S. government.\nThe Drake Passage \u2014 the rough stretch of southern sea between the tip of Chile and icy Antarctica \u2014 has been regarded as one of the most dangerous ocean crossings for well over a century, and according to weather experts, for good reason.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only place in the world where those winds can push all around the globe without hitting land \u2013 and land tends to dampen storms,\u201d Alexander Brearley, oceanographer and head of open oceans at the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN.\n\u201cThe Southern Ocean is very stormy in general [but] in the Drake you\u2019re really squeezing [the water] between the Antarctic and the southern hemisphere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat intensifies the storms as they come through.\u201d\nApparently, waves regularly churn and crash anywhere between 15 and 49 feet \u2014 when they reach storm wave classification.\nBetween the waves and wind, ship captains and pilots alike are wary about crossing the stormy stretch of the Antarctic Ocean \u2014 which is why the passage is so highly regulated.\nLast month, an American teenager was detained in Chile after attempting to make the flight without clearing it with the proper authorities first.\nHe was attempting to fly around the world solo, but experienced complications while in the air and landed at a Chilean air base."

      "text": "Rescuers save 3 from Antarctica base after braving 24-hours of darkness, sub-zero temperatures\nThree people were evacuated from a US research base in Antarctica during a high-risk operation in round-the-clock darkness and sub-zero temperatures, according to authorities.\nThe Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted the perilous operation Tuesday afternoon after the United Nations Science Foundation requested a medical evaluation for three staff members at McMurdo Station, including one who needed urgent medical help, the RNZAF said in a statement Wednesday.\nA crew aboard the C-130J Hercules braved total darkness and bone-chilling temperatures to reach the station overnight, authorities said.\nFlights conducted in the continent\u2019s mid-winter season, which is between March and October, are often the most dangerous due to varying weather conditions and on-ice landings, Air Component Commander Air Commodore Andy Scott said.\n\u201cThe crew can only attempt the flight after a detailed analysis of the weather and airfield state. The United States Antarctic Program Winter Team must physically create the runway before we can depart by ensuring the ice is groomed and suitable for landing,\u201d Scott said in a statement.\nAlthough the team determines if the flight and landing can be carried out safely, it can still be \u201cextremely challenging\u201d to fly using night vision goggles, the commander added.\n\u201cThis, coupled with there being no airfields available to divert to once the aircraft is past a certain point south, adds to the risk, so these missions are not taken lightly,\u201d Scott said.\nA doctor was aboard the flight to provide medical assistance to the research staff, whose ailments were not immediately known, according to the RNZAF.\nThe plane landed in Christchurch on Wednesday morning after completing the nearly 20-hour harrowing round trip, authorities added.\nThe US Embassy in New Zealand later expressed its gratitude for the air force crews\u2019 courageous mission.\n\u201cThis mission wasn\u2019t just difficult; it was one of the most technically demanding operations an aircrew can face. In extreme conditions, with little margin for error, the RNZAF executed this mid-winter Antarctic medevac flawlessly,\u201d the embassy\u2019s Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, Melissa Sweeney, said in a statement.\n\u201cThis required absolute precision. It was daring, dangerous, and deeply courageous. This is the kind of mission that tests every ounce of skill and bravery. RNZAF delivered, just as they always do,\u201d Sweeney said."
