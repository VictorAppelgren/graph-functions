  "content": "TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar held steady on Tuesday, with markets braced for a key consumer inflation report later in the day that could shape expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Australian dollar was steady hours before a policy decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against six counterparts, including the euro and yen - was steady at 98.497 as of 0046 GMT, after advancing 0.5% over the past two sessions.\n\nPrior to that, the dollar had retreated as U.S. President Donald Trump's dovish-leaning pick to replace a Fed governor, and similarly inclined potential candidates for chairman, led traders to increase easing bets.\n\nIn addition, Fed officials have sounded increasingly uneasy about the labour market, signalling their openness to a rate cut as soon as September.\n\nCooling inflation could cement bets for a reduction next month, but if signs emerge that Trump's tariffs are fuelling price pressures, that might keep the central bank on hold for now.\n\nTraders currently put the odds of a quarter-point cut on September 17 at about 89%.\n\n\"Risk-reward heading into U.S. CPI this week is for a modest USD bounce as any upside surprise will challenge market pricing of almost a full cut by September,\" TD Securities strategists wrote in a research note.\n\n\"A downside surprise, on the other hand, is unlikely to move Fed pricing and the USD as much,\" they said.\n\n\"The reasoning is that for the Fed to consider an outsized cut of 50 basis points, the catalyst will be further deterioration in the labour market and not a downside CPI miss.\"\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect core CPI to have risen 0.3% in July, pushing the annual rate higher to 3%.\n\nThe greenback rose 0.1% to 148.28 yen on Tuesday. The euro was flat at $1.1615.\n\nThe dollar on Monday largely ignored Trump's signing an executive order extending a pause in sharply higher tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, a move that some market participants said was expected.\n\nWith the United States and China seeking to close a deal averting triple-digit import tariffs, a U.S. official told Reuters that chip makers Nvidia and AMD had agreed to allocate 15% of China sales revenues to the U.S. government, aiming to secure export licences for semiconductors.\n\nThe yuan was flat at 7.1935 per dollar in offshore trading.\n\nThe Aussie fetched $0.6518 , little changed from Monday with economists and investors widely expecting a quarter-point rate reduction from the RBA, after second-quarter inflation came in weaker than expected and the jobless rate hit a 3-1/2-year high.",

  "summary": "The U.S. dollar index was steady at 98.497 as of 0046 GMT, after advancing 0.5% over the past two days. This comes ahead of a consumer inflation report that could influence Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Prior to this, the dollar had retreated due to concerns over the appointment of a dovish-leaning Fed governor and potential candidates for chairman. Fed officials have expressed openness to a rate cut as soon as September, but if signs emerge that tariffs are fuelling price pressures, they might keep the central bank on hold.

The Australian dollar also held steady before a policy decision from the Reserve Bank of Australia, amid expectations of a rate reduction due to weak inflation and rising unemployment. Market analysts suggest that any unexpected inflation data could impact the dollar's performance, while ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China continue to influence market sentiment.",
