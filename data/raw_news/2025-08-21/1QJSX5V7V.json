  "title": "What's Going On With Lockheed Martin Stock Thursday? - Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)",
  "description": "Lockheed Martin reports $1.8 billion in charges in Q2, causing BofA to lower outlook. Missiles unit shows potential, but supply chain constraints limit growth.",
  "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT reported $1.8 billion in charges in the second quarter, led by a classified Aeronautics program and two Rotary and Mission Systems projects, prompting Bank of America Securities (BofA) analyst Ronald J. Epstein to trim his outlook.\n\nThe analyst reaffirmed a Neutral rating and lowered his price forecast to $480 from $495, citing ongoing program challenges and limited near-term catalysts.\n\nEpstein said the recurring charges, which follow roughly $2 billion recorded in 2024, have shaken investor confidence. The latest write-downs included $950 million tied to a classified Aero effort, $570 million on Canada's Maritime Helicopter Program, and $95 million related to Turkey's utility helicopter program.\n\nAlso Read: Lockheed Martin Under Intense Wall Street Pressure On Mounting Program Risks, Q2 Woes\n\nTogether, the charges cut $5.83 per share from quarterly earnings. Additional hits came from a $66 million NGAD asset write-off and a $103 million tax adjustment, partly offset by state tax benefits.\n\nThe bright spot remains the Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) unit, which Epstein identified as the primary driver of potential upside. Programs such as Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) remain in high demand as the U.S. and allies replenish stockpiles. MFC's backlog rose 4% from 2024 and 25% over two years, signaling a strong pipeline.\n\nHowever, he added, supply chain constraints limit how fast the segment can scale, meaning it cannot fully counterbalance headwinds elsewhere.\n\nLooking ahead, BofA lowered its adjusted EPS forecast for 2025 to $21.95 from $27.30. Projections for 2026 and 2027 were also reduced slightly.\n\nEpstein set his price forecast at $480, down from $495, based on a 12x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026e, a level he sees as capped at Lockheed Martin's 10-year historical average while the company works through margin pressure and tax headwinds.\n\nEpstein flagged additional risks, including a potential $4.6 billion IRS tax dispute, program execution challenges, and budget-related uncertainty around the F-35. While long-term demand for missiles remains supportive, Epstein said Lockheed Martin may remain in the penalty box until management resolves program issues and restores investor confidence.\n\nAdditionally, Lockheed Martin on Thursday announced it has secured a $720 million contract from the U.S. Army to produce Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) and HELLFIRE missiles, marking the fourth and final follow-on award under its current multi-year agreement.\n\nThe deal will support U.S. Army, Navy, and international customers, including a Foreign Military Sales order of 160 JAGMs for the United Kingdom and HELLFIRE deliveries to NATO allies Poland, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy, and new customer Canada.\n\nPrice Action: LMT shares are trading lower by 0.12% to $445.62 at last check Thursday.\n\u2022 Could Boeing Be The Answer To US-China Trade Truce?",

BA is edging closer to securing a massive aircraft order from China that could involve as many as 500 jets, which could mark the end of a years-long sales drought in the world\u2019s second-largest aviation market.\nLast major Boeing order from China dates back to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 state visit.\nNews of the potential breakthrough lifted Boeing shares. The stock is up 27% year to date, buoyed by a turnaround effort under CEO Kelly Ortberg.\nAlso Read: Boeing\u2019s Decades-Long 737 Delivery Record Could Finally Fall To Arch-Rival Airbus\nBloomberg reported that negotiations are ongoing regarding details such as the aircraft types, the delivery schedule, and the order size.\nThe deal is still contingent on the United States and China maintaining progress in easing trade tensions, which flared during Trump\u2019s first term.\nWhile the talks could collapse, Bloomberg reported that officials in Beijing have already begun consulting with domestic airlines about future fleet needs, signaling preparations for a large-scale purchase.\nThe transaction under discussion is expected to rival China\u2019s recent agreement with Airbus SE EADSY EADSF for up to 500 planes, which has not been publicly announced.\nBoeing forecasts that China\u2019s commercial fleet will more than double to 9,755 aircraft over the next two decades, far outpacing the output of its state-backed competitor, Comac.\nSince 2019, when Chinese regulators grounded the 737 Max following two fatal crashes, Airbus has dominated aircraft deliveries to the country.\nIn the past six years, Boeing has managed only 30 new orders from Chinese carriers and leasing firms.\nBoeing reported stronger-than-expected revenue for the second quarter, driven by a sharp rise in commercial aircraft deliveries. However, its adjusted loss per share was wider than Wall Street projections.\nRevenue climbed 35% year over year to $22.75 billion, beating the Street estimate of $20.20 billion, led by higher delivery volume and improved operational performance.\nBoeing delivered 150 commercial airplanes in the quarter, up 63% from a year ago. The total company backlog rose to $619 billion, including more than 5,900 commercial aircraft orders valued at $522 billion.\nThe aerospace giant is also looking at a possible hindrance in production as over 3,200 workers rejected a new contract offer in Illinois and Missouri.\nPrice Action: BA stock is trading higher by 1.94% to $230 at last check Thursday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Releases\nOrlando, Fla., August 21, 2025 \u2013 The U.S. Army has awarded Lockheed Martin a $720 million contract for the production of Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) and HELLFIRE missiles, marking the fourth and final follow-on award as part of its current multiple-year contract. This contract will provide critical procurement and production support for the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and international customers, further solidifying Lockheed Martin's position as a leading provider of multi-domain missile systems.\nUnder this contract, Lockheed Martin will deliver JAGM and HELLFIRE missiles to meet the urgent operational needs of the Army, Navy and its international partners. The contract includes key Foreign Military Sales (FMS) including 160 JAGMs for the United Kingdom. The award also includes HELLFIRE FMS orders for key NATO allies Poland, Spain, Czech Republic and Italy. In addition, the contract award includes new HELLFIRE international customer Canada.\n\u201cThis contract is a significant milestone in our ongoing partnership with the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and our international allies, and we're proud to continue playing a vital role in their defense strategies,\" said Casey Walsh, program management director of Multi-Domain Missile Systems at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. \"As we continue to evolve our deterrence capabilities, we remain committed to supporting the military's critical missions and helping to protect those who serve, both at home and abroad.\u201d\nThe importance of this contract extends beyond the production of JAGM and HELLFIRE, as it also underscores the strength of Lockheed Martin's partnerships with the Army, Navy and its international allies. For example, the Poland HELLFIRE FMS order, a part of this contract, supports the recent U.S. government FMS agreement for AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Polish Air Force. As the global security landscape continues to evolve, Lockheed Martin remains committed to delivering innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of its customers, and this contract is a significant step forward in that effort.\nBoth the JAGM and HELLFIRE systems are designed and developed in Orlando, Florida. The weapon systems are manufactured across various Lockheed Martin facilities in Dallas, Texas; Orlando and Ocala, Florida.; Archbald, Pennsylvania.; and Troy, Alabama. With more than 145,000 missiles produced, JAGM and HELLFIRE continue to be the weapon of choice in critical, precision engagement opportunities.\nAbout Lockheed Martin\nLockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery. Our all-domain mission solutions and 21st Century Security\u00ae vision accelerate the delivery of transformative technologies to ensure those we serve always stay ahead of ready.

      "text": "- Goldman Sachs\u2019 Noah Poponak slashes Lockheed\u2019s price target to $398, citing margin pressure and growth risks.\n- Lockheed hit a 52-week low of $410.11 after Q2 results revealed $1.6B in charges and negative free cash flow.\n- See what Wall Street is buying with instant access to ratings on 1,000 top stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and more. Unlock all ratings now.\nLockheed Martin Corp. LMT faces growing pressure from Wall Street after delivering mixed second-quarter results and absorbing nearly $1.6 billion in charges across key segments.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak reiterated a Sell rating on Lockheed Martin and lowered his 12-month price forecast to $398 from $406. He pointed to ongoing problems that could hurt profits, reduce cash flow, and make future earnings less predictable.\nPoponak noted that the latest charges in classified Aeronautics and helicopter programs within Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) reduce segment margin expectations and may drag free cash flow lower beyond 2025.\nHe also highlighted risks tied to NGAD program losses and uncertainty around future F-35 funding, both of which threaten a substantial share of Lockheed\u2019s earnings base.\nDespite continued demand in missile defense and other high-profile programs, Poponak believes Lockheed is entering a more challenging phase. He cut his 2025-2028 EPS estimates and lowered his 12-month price target to $398 from $406, while maintaining a target P/E multiple of 0.81x relative to the S&P 500.\nOther Analysts Also Turned Cautious Following The Results:\n- Susquehanna\u2019s Charles Minervino maintained a Positive rating and lowered his price forecast from $550 to $490.\n- RBC Capital\u2019s Ken Herbert kept a Sector Perform rating and cut his forecast from $480 to $440.\n- Truist\u2019s Michael Ciarmoli downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold and reduced his forecast from $554 to $440.\n- Baird\u2019s Peter Arment maintained an Outperform rating while trimming his forecast from $540 to $500.\n- JP Morgan\u2019s Seth Seifman maintained an Overweight rating while lowering the price forecast from $520 to $465.\nEarnings Recap: Margins Hit by Legacy Program Charges\nLockheed reported net sales of $18.16 billion, slightly missing estimates, while adjusted EPS of $7.29 beat the $6.63 consensus. However, GAAP earnings fell to $1.46 per share, down sharply from $6.63 a year ago due to charges related to cost overruns and schedule slippage in legacy programs.\nOperating margin collapsed to 4.1% from 11.9%, and free cash flow turned negative at $150 million. The company reaffirmed its 2025 sales guidance of $73.75 billion to $74.75 billion and free cash flow outlook of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, but lowered its GAAP EPS forecast to $21.70-$22.00, from $27+ previously.\nIRS Dispute and \u2018Golden Dome\u2019 Talks\nAdding to the pressure, Lockheed\u2019s CFO reportedly confirmed that the IRS is seeking $4.6 billion in additional income taxes. According to Reuters, the company is challenging the claim through the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and is prepared to pursue judicial action if necessary.\nMeanwhile, CEO James Taiclet confirmed discussions with U.S. officials over former President Trump\u2019s proposed $175 billion \u2018Golden Dome\u2019 missile shield. While no contracts have been awarded, Taiclet said Lockheed is \u201call in\u201d on the concept.\nLockheed Martin reached a 52-week high of $618.95 on Oct. 21, 2024, and a 52-week low of $410.11 on July 22, 2025, the day after it reported second-quarter results, marking an approximate 34% decline from its peak.\nPrice Action: At last check Wednesday, LMT shares were trading higher by 2.70% to $421.82.\nRead Next:\nPhoto by JHVEPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
