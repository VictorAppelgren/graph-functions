  "argos_summary": "Citigroup\u2019s recent analyst consensus shows a mixed outlook, with 17 analysts offering bullish and bearish views and an average 12\u2011month target of $100.53\u2014an 8.1% lift from the prior $93.00. The bank posted solid 8.11% revenue growth in the first quarter, yet its net margin, ROE, and ROA lag industry peers, raising concerns about profitability. Analysts largely maintain their ratings, with a few upgrades and downgrades reflecting nuanced assessments of the firm\u2019s credit and market\u2011making segments. Overall, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic, tempered by margin and return pressures that could influence future pricing and risk appetite.",
