  "title": "US says UK human rights situation has worsened in past year",
  "description": "The report criticises restrictions on freedom of expression after the Southport attacks and abortion buffer zones.",
  "content": "A report produced by the Trump administration says the human rights situation in the UK has \"worsened\" over the past year. The annual report, which looks at global human rights, specifically pointed to what it said were restrictions on freedom of expression and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism in Britain. The criticism echoes comments previously made by members of the US president's senior team, including Vice-President JD Vance. A UK government spokesperson said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\"\n\nThe report also describes the human rights situation as having \"worsened\" in France and Germany. On freedom of speech in the UK, it said \"specific areas of concern\" included restrictions on political speech deemed \"hateful\" or \"offensive\". It said the response to last year's Southport attacks had been an \"especially grievous example of government censorship\", adding, \"censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech\". Three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift dance class by 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana in July 2024. A peaceful vigil was held in the town the next day, but misinformation spread online about Rudakubana led to violent protests. Posts claiming he was an asylum seeker, who had arrived in the UK on a small boat, were shared widely. In the wake of the rioting, action was taken against internet users who made the false claims and urged revenge. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised that those involved would \"face the full force of the law\".\n\nThe US state department report said local and national government officials had \"repeatedly intervened to chill speech\". State department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, without naming the UK specifically, said online restrictions had targeted \"disfavoured voices on political or religious grounds.\" \"No matter really how disagreeable someone's speech may be, criminalising it or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression or polarisation,\" Bruce told reporters.\n\nThe report, external also pointed to buffer zone laws which prohibit protests outside abortion service centres and Public Spaces Protection Orders, powers local councils can use to ban certain anti-social activities. Scotland implemented 200m (656ft) buffer zones in September 2024. A month later, 150m buffer zones were put in place around abortion clinics in England and Wales. When they were introduced, safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said: \"We will not sit back and tolerate harassment, abuse and intimidation as people exercise their legal right to healthcare.\" In April, a woman was convicted of holding a sign reading \"Here to talk, if you want\" outside a clinic in Bournemouth. Livia Tossici-Bolt's case was highlighted by Vance and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour - a bureau within the US state department. The bureau said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling. \"Freedom of expression must be protected for all,\" it added. On a more positive note, the report also highlighted how \"the government effectively enforced laws protecting freedom of association, collective bargaining, and the right of workers to engage in a strike or other industrial action\".",

      "text": "Buffer zones set to come in around abortion clinics\n- Published\nBuffer zones will come into force around abortion clinics in England and Wales from 31 October.\nIt will make it illegal to hand out anti-abortion leaflets within the buffer zone or obstruct anyone using or working at an abortion clinic.\nThe protection zones, which will prohibit protest, will extend to a 150-metre radius around abortion services and those convicted of breaking the new law will face an unlimited fine.\nOne abortion charity said the move could not \"come soon enough\" but an anti-abortion organisation warned women would lose access to \"vital practical support\".\nSafeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said: \u201cThe right to access abortion services is a fundamental right for women in this country, and no-one should feel unsafe when they seek to access this.\n\u201cWe will not sit back and tolerate harassment, abuse and intimidation as people exercise their legal right to healthcare.\"\nThe law was initially approved by Parliament in May 2023. However the government said it would launch a consultation on guidance before permitting the buffer zones to be implemented.\nThis led one charity to accuse the then-Conservative government of kicking the issue \"into the long grass\".\nCampaigners also raised concern that the draft guidance would still allow \"silent prayer\" outside abortion clinics.\nThe Home Office now says the changes will be implemented from the end of October.\nUnder the law it would be illegal for \"anyone to do anything that intentionally or recklessly influences someone\u2019s decision to use abortion services, obstructs them, or causes harassment or distress to someone using or working at these premises,\" the department said.\nIt is expected that silent prayer will fall under the scope of the law. Police and prosecutors will get guidance on enforcing the law in the coming weeks.\nA similar ban was introduced in Northern Ireland last year and another will come into force in Scotland on 24 September.\n- Published19 January 2024\n- Published12 August 2024\nHeidi Stewart, head of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the implementation of the zones \"can't come soon enough\".\n\"For years our staff and the women we care for have endured anti-abortion fanatics standing outside clinics for hours on end staring at them accessing or going to provide private medical care, stopping them outside and telling them that abortion is murder.\"\nShe added that the government should remember the law was \"designed to address the harm caused by so-called silent prayer\" and that \"all forms of harassment\" should be prohibited.\nCatherine Robinson, a spokesperson for Right To Life UK, said the zones would mean \"vital practical support provided by volunteers outside abortion clinics, which helps to provide a genuine choice, and offers help to women who may be undergoing coercion, will be removed\".\nEaling council, in west London, established the country's first buffer zone around a Marie Stopes clinic in 2018 - using a Public Space Protection Order to give local police the power to move, or even fine, anyone who breached it.\nThe proposal was subjected to a legal challenge but was ultimately allowed to continue.\nOn social media Rupa Huq,, external Labour MP for Ealing, said she was pleased that \"safe access zones finally becoming reality within next month\".\nShe added: \"Ealing introduced first ever one and has led the way. Women up and down the country will now have same protections.\"\nBishop Sherrington, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of England and Wales, said the buffer zone legislation discriminates against people of faith.\nIn a statement he said: \"By legislating for and implementing so-called \u2018safe access zones\u2019, the UK government has taken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards in the protection of religious and civic freedoms.\n\"Religious freedom includes the right to manifest one\u2019s private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities.\""

      "text": "Campaigner defiant over abortion clinic breach\n- Published\nA woman convicted of breaching an abortion clinic protection zone has said she will continue her \"fight for free speech\".\nLivia Tossici-Bolt, 64, was given a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of \u00a320,000 for two charges of breaking a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO).\nThe anti-abortion campaigner held a sign reading \"Here to talk, if you want\" outside a clinic in Bournemouth on two days in March 2023.\nHer legal representative told the BBC Tossici-Bolt had been offering a \"consensual conversation\" and would explore \"all legal options\" following the ruling.\nThe case has been highlighted by US Vice-President JD Vance and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour - a bureau within the US State Department.\nThe bureau said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling, in a post on X. \"Freedom of expression must be protected for all,\" it added.\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Tossici-Bolt said: \"It was nothing to do with protesting, harassing or intimidating. It was inviting a conversation.\"\nShe said her actions were \"certainly not to make any woman unhappy or distressed\".\n\"Anyone could have approached me - including women attending the clinic. It was up to them,\" said Tossici-Bolt.\n\"I was there to listen to them. Not that I was there to convince them or change minds or not.\"\nAsked what she would do next, she said: \"I was given a conditional discharge. I will continue my fight for free speech.\"\nAt Poole Magistrates' Court on Friday, District Judge Orla Austin said Tossici-Bolt's presence \"could have a detrimental effect\" on the women attending the clinic.\nThe judge continued: \"It's important to note this case is not about the rights and wrongs about abortion but about whether the defendant was in breach of the PSPO.\"\n'Unprecedented'\nThe prosecution had been brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council for breach of a PSPO under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.\nThe zone at Ophir Road came into force in October 2022, running from 07:00 to 19:00, Monday to Friday.\nTossici-Bolt's legal counsel, Jeremiah Igunnubole, from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said they would \"explore all legal options\".\nHe said the conviction and costs imposed were \"unprecedented\".\n\"Never before have we seen entirely peaceful conduct being criminalised for nothing other than offering a consensual conversation,\" he said.\nSpeaking earlier this week, former supreme court justice Lord Sumption said: \"Women having an abortion - it's a very agonising decision and most people feel they are entitled to protection.\n\"Anti-abortion campaigners can shout their views from the rooftops, broadcast or write in the press.\n\"Freedom of speech is in no way inhibited, except they cannot stand outside abortion clinics so as to harass the women trying to get in.\"\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story BBC Dorset should cover?\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, external, X (Twitter), external, or Instagram, external.\nRelated topics\nSee also\n- Published5 April\n- Published18 September 2024"

      "text": "How a deleted LinkedIn post was weaponised and seen by millions before the Southport riot\n- Published\nHow did one single social media post, taken down within hours for being false, still end up being viewed millions of times and presented as credible evidence about the Southport attack?\nThe fatal stabbings at a children's dance class on 29 July sparked riots in England and Northern Ireland. Unrest was fuelled by misinformation on social media that the suspect was an illegal migrant.\nResponsibility for the violence that ensued cannot be sourced to a single person or post - but the BBC has previously established a clear pattern of social media influencers driving a message for people to gather for protests.\nIn the hours immediately after the Southport attack, several posts from a mixture of sources - including self-styled news accounts - began sharing false claims. This misinformation soon merged together.\nBy the time violence started in the Merseyside town on the evening of 30 July, some of the claims had been amplified or repeated by well-known online influencers such as Andrew Tate, who had millions of views repeating false narratives on X.\nHowever, one LinkedIn post in particular - analysed by the BBC - appears to have had an outsized effect in stirring up the false belief that the dance class suspect was a migrant.\nIt was written by a local man, who could have had no idea of how far his words would travel.\nEddie Murray - who lives near Southport - posted this message about three hours after the attack, stating that a migrant had carried it out:\n\"My two youngest children went to holiday club this morning in Southport for a day of fun only for a migrant to enter and murder/fatally wound multiple children. My kids are fine. They are shocked and in hysterics, but they are safe. My thoughts are with the other 30 kids and families that are suffering right now.\n\"If there's any time to close the borders completely it's right now! Enough is enough.\u201d\nThe post implies that Mr Murray's family were at the scene of the attack.\nIn fact, the BBC has been told that although they were in the area, they had been turned away from the dance class because it was full.\nMr Murray's post is one of the earliest examples of local testimony to incorrectly use the word \"migrant\".\nHe later told us he was only posting the information he had been given.\nWhat happened next demonstrates how an unsubstantiated claim can spread at speed, with no concern for whether it is true.\nIn the hours immediately after the stabbings, little information was released by Merseyside Police. It is normal for officers not to release information about a suspect under arrest - especially, as in this case, when they are under 18. Even in cases where the suspect has died, it can be many hours before they are named officially.\nA short police statement was issued just after 13:00 to say that \"armed police have detained a male and seized a knife\".\nWhat followed was intense speculation - most of it on social media.\nMr Murray's post was only seen by a few hundred people and it was later taken down. LinkedIn told us the post had been removed because it didn\u2019t meet its policies on \"harmful or false content\".\nHowever, by then it had been copied and posted elsewhere and, within a few hours, had been viewed more than two million times on social media, according to BBC Verify analysis.\nWe found that on X, within an hour of the original post, a screenshot had been posted by an account calling for mass deportations. This would go on to have more than 130,000 views in total.\nNext, at 16:23, an online news website based in India called Upuknews shared a retweet of Eddie Murray\u2019s post, which it described as \"confirmed\". This had more than half a million views.\nBy now, online speculation about the suspect was running high. There was a huge appetite to know what had happened in Southport.\nAt the same time as Upuknews\u2019s tweet, the Murray screenshot was posted on X by the co-leader of far-right group Britain First (and convicted criminal) Paul Golding. He claimed that the evidence was \"stacking up that the Southport attack was carried out by a migrant\".\nHis post received nearly 110,000 views.\nAt 16:36, just 13 minutes later, Reform Party activist Nicholas Lissack tweeted he had \"confirmed the authenticity of the post made by the father of the children who were present at the Southport Attack\".\nMurray's screenshot was also reposted by a white nationalist who wanted \"the border closed\" and made a call to \"deport these savages\".\nMany of these accounts are verified by X with purchased blue ticks, which means their posts have greater prominence on other users' feeds.\nSome of the accounts qualify for X monetisation and could receive direct payments from the platform.\nFive hours after the attack, at 16:49, a false name for the suspect appeared on X alongside Eddie Murray\u2019s screenshot, BBC analysis has found.\nBernie Spofforth, an account-holder once temporarily removed from X for allegedly posting misinformation about Covid, said the suspect had been named as \"Ali-Al-Shakati\". In a statement the next day, Merseyside Police confirmed an incorrect name was being posted online for the suspect.\nMs Spofforth would later be arrested and released without charge. She has always denied any wrongdoing, insisting she only copied and pasted the information before deleting it and apologising. She told the BBC previously that she got the name from another post that has since been deleted.\nAt 17:09, Laurence Fox, the actor and head of the right-wing Reclaim Party, reposted Ms Spofforth's post alongside the Eddie Murray screenshot and wrote: \"Close the borders.\"\nThis single post was viewed 500,000 times.\nIn total, a screenshot of Eddie Murray's original LinkedIn post was viewed more than three million times on X, according to BBC Verify analysis. However, it is clear he would have had no idea of how it would spread online.\nWe can also reveal more from Mr Murray's other deleted LinkedIn posts, made on the day of the Southport attack.\nThis one repeats the Al-Shakati name:\n\"BBC news are lying. The Child murderer was from Africa. He was on MI6 watch. His name is Ali Al Shakati.\"\nAnother reads:\n\"I see people stil [sic] believe what the left wing media say because it suits their own left wing woke agenda. It's because of these sort of people the reason why this has happened in the first place.\"\nMr Murray appeared to have become a credible source on social media for many. One woman on Facebook posted in support of him, asking others \"You believe media/news over the people who was the witness\u2026[?]\"\nAnother person tweeted: \"That post by Eddie Murray has been fact checked, it is on his LinkedIn and is true.\"\nWe approached Mr Murray for a comment, first through LinkedIn, where he told us he did not regret his original post.\nWe later approached him in person. He said he had only posted what he had been told, genuinely believing his posts were correct.\nWhen we asked Mr Murray why he had posted that the suspect's name was Al-Shakati, he replied that he was just posting what others had been saying online.\nAt no point after 29 July did he correct any of his posts.\nAt 17:25 the police said they had arrested a 17-year-old from Banks in Lancashire. Nearly two hours later, they clarified that he had been born in Cardiff, external.\nBut by this point, the relentless waves of misinformation were already propelling the town towards a riot, putting more lives at risk.\nA key instigator was a group on the Telegram messaging app, set up about six hours after the stabbings. Called Southport Wake Up, the BBC has previously tracked down and confronted an administrator of the group. The account encouraged others to protest on St Luke's Road at 20:00 on Tuesday 30 July, with online posters from the account also being shared on X, TikTok and Facebook.\nThat protest later turned into a riot. A BBC crew at the scene heard shouts of \"You're fake left-wing news\".\nMisinformation was also amplified that evening by far-right activists for their own agendas. The BBC filmed David Miles, an activist for the white nationalist group Patriotic Alternative - one of the largest far-right movements in the UK. He was seen filming and talking to protesters near the police cordon for more than 30 minutes as officers were attacked and fires took hold.\nMr Miles also staged photos at the scene, wearing a \"Free Sam Melia\" T-shirt. Melia, a prominent regional organiser for Patriotic Alternative, was jailed earlier this year for inciting racial hatred. He was once in the neo-Nazi group National Action - since banned as a terrorist organisation.\nEarlier that day, Mr Miles's Telegram account shared a poster advertising the time and place for the protest. He later reposted dozens of locations for protests across the country.\nAs the riot took hold, a post on Mr Miles's Telegram channel said, \"what did they expect a garden party\".\nWhen approached by the BBC, Mr Miles denied exploiting the deaths of children. He said he was not violent and described the riots as \"awful\".\nIn response to the Southport stabbings, and the lack of information given by police about the suspect in the face of false claims, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, said that the law, as it currently stands, \"stokes the risk of online disinformation\" (the deliberate spreading of false information).\nHe also stated the false claims that circulated on social media about the identity and asylum status of the suspect were \"plausibly connected to some of the violence that followed\".\nMr Hall has written to the Law Commission suggesting legal reforms which would allow names, nationality, and ages of individuals to be reported where there is no substantial risk of prejudice.\nMany of the misleading posts we have analysed are still on X and Facebook, and David Miles is still posting on Telegram.\nThe government asked Ofcom to consider how illegal content, particularly disinformation, spread during the unrest.\nThe media regulator concluded that there was a \"clear connection\" between the violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland in the summer and posts on social media and messaging apps.\nIn an open letter, external setting out its findings, Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said such content spread \u201cwidely and quickly\u201d online following the stabbings in Southport.\nMeanwhile, the government has told the BBC it is working at pace to implement the Online Safety Act, which requires social media platforms to remove illegal content and prevent the deliberate spread of false information.\nThe act was passed into law in October 2023, but its protections have yet to come into effect.\nWe approached X for a comment, but have not received a reply.\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Wearn, Phill Edwards & Daniel de Simone\nRelated topics\n- Published2 October 2024\n- Published8 August 2024\n- Published2 August 2024"

      "text": "Trump administration rewrites and scales back annual human rights report\n- Published\nThe Trump administration has significantly rewritten and downscaled the US government's annual report on global human rights abuses.\nThe state department document, previously seen as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government, significantly reduces criticism of some US allies such as Israel and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and South Africa.\nEntire sections included in reports from previous years are also eliminated, dramatically reducing coverage of issues including government corruption and persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals.\nState department officials say it was \"restructured\" to \"remove redundancies\" and \"increase readability\".\nThe report also describes the human rights situation as having \"worsened\" in some of the closest allies of the United States, including the UK, France and Germany, due to regulations on online hate speech.\nThe language used echoes previous criticism by the Trump administration and some US tech bosses who oppose online harm reduction laws in some European countries, portraying them as attacks on free speech.\nUzra Zeya, a former senior state department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, accused the Trump administration of \"gutting\" decades of highly respected work on human rights protections and an \"abandonment of core values\" to the US.\n\"It sends a signal that there's going to be a free pass from the United States government, that it will look the other way if a government is willing to cut deals or do the bidding of this administration,\" she told the BBC.\nThe report accuses the UK of \"significant human rights issues\", including \"credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression\". It also describes prosecution and punishment for human rights abuses as \"inconsistent\".\nIn response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.\"\nIn the UK last year, following the stabbing deaths of three young girls in Southport, England, authorities took action against social media users who falsely alleged that an asylum seeker was responsible and urged revenge.\nBrazil, which the Trump administration has frequently criticised, was singled out in the state department report for \"disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech\".\nBoth the UK and Brazil have previously rejected similar criticism from the US.\nIn the section on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, the report says the ongoing war \"led to a rise in reports of human rights violations\".\nHowever, the report continues, \"the government took several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses\". It also accuses Hamas and Hezbollah of war crimes, charges both have denied.\nThe report omits reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former defence minister Yoav Gallant and a Hamas commander, Mohammed Deif.\nICC judges concluded there were \"reasonable grounds\" that the men bore \"criminal responsibility\" for alleged war crimes. Both Israel and Hamas have rejected the allegations.\nEl Salvador has been accused by Amnesty International, external of \"arbitrary detentions and human rights violations\", as well as \"inhumane\" detention conditions.\nHowever, the state department report concluded there were \"no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\".\nTrump has a close relationship with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whom he lauded in April as \"one hell of a president\" and doing a \"great job\".\nThe document was published following months of delay amid reports of significant internal dissent at the state department over its contents.\nIt follows internal guidance issued by political leaders earlier this year reportedly advising staff to shorten the reports to remove some references to issues including corruption and gender-based crimes, and follows some executive orders on related issues issued by President Trump.\nDuring a visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year Trump berated \"Western interventionists\" and said the US would no longer be \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\".\nRelated topics\n- Published8 April\n- Published7 January"

Acts of Antisemitism and Antisemitic Incitement EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The human rights situation worsened in the United Kingdom during the year. Significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. The government sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, but prosecution and punishment for such abuses was inconsistent. Section 1. Life a. Extrajudicial Killings There were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. b. Coercion in Population Control There were no reports of involuntary sterilization on the part of government authorities. Section 2. Liberty a. Freedom of the Press The law generally provided for freedom of speech, including for members of the press and other media, and the government generally respected this right, though there were specific areas of concern, including involving restrictions on political speech deemed \u201chateful\u201d or \u201coffensive\u201d as well as speech within \u201cPublic Spaces Protections Orders\u201d areas (allowing local councils to limit speech rights within designated areas) and \u201cSafe Access Zones\u201d (limiting speech rights around abortion clinics). These restrictions on freedom of speech could include prohibitions on efforts to influence others when inside a restricted area, even through prayer or silent protests. The law prohibited expressions of \u201chatred\u201d toward persons because of their color, race, nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origin, religion, or sexual orientation as well as any communication that was deemed threatening or abusive and was intended to harass, alarm, or distress a person. The penalties for such speech included fines, imprisonment, or both. There were laws in the United Kingdom (UK) that restricted freedom of speech in certain areas or allowed local councils to establish areas with restrictions on freedom of speech. The law authorized UK authorities, including the Office of Communications (Ofcom), to monitor all forms of communication for speech they deemed \u201cillegal.\u201d The Online Safety Act of 2023, which came into force in 2024, defined the category of \u201conline harm\u201d and expressly expanded Ofcom\u2019s authority to include American media and technology firms with a substantial number of British users, regardless of whether they had a corporate presence in the UK. Under the law, companies were required to engage in proactive \u201cillegal content risk assessment\u201d to mitigate the risk of users encountering speech deemed illegal by Ofcom. Experts warned that one effect of the bill could be government regulation to reduce or eliminate effective encryption (and therefore user privacy) on platforms. Expansive and unclear restrictions on potentially prejudicial reporting on ongoing court and tribunal proceedings limited the freedom of the press. In one instance, UK contempt of court laws forced U.S. magazine The New Yorker to geoblock British subscribers from reading an online article regarding an ongoing court case. The Law Commission (a statutory independent body) undertook a wide-ranging review of contempt of court rules with an eye towards reform. On April 1, the Scottish government implemented the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, including the introduction of offenses \u201cstirring up hatred\u201d through threatening or abusive behavior and the communication of threatening or abusive material. Censorship by Governments, Military, Intelligence, or Police Forces, Criminal Groups, or Armed Extremist or Rebel Groups Legal restrictions on speech labeled as threatening, offensive, or constituting a \u201chate crime\u201d applied to print and broadcast media including social media. In the wake of an attack in Southport in which three young girls were stabbed to death, local and national government officials repeatedly intervened to chill speech as to the identity and motives of the attacker (later identified as Axel Rudakubana, a British citizen of Rwandan origins). The government called on companies, including U.S. firms, to censor speech deemed misinformation or \u201chate speech.\u201d Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson threatened to prosecute and seek the extradition of those who \u201crepost, repeat, or amplify a message which is false, threatening, or stirs up racial/religious hatred.\u201d The Crown Prosecution Service shared a video online stating that citizens should \u201cThink before you post!\u201d and threatening legal consequences for violations of the law. After the attack, numerous individuals were arrested for online speech about the attack and its motivations, though in some cases charges were later dropped. Numerous nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and media outlets criticized the government\u2019s approach to censoring speech, both in principle and in the perceived weaponization of law enforcement against political views disfavored by authorities. While many media observers deemed \u201ctwo-tier\u201d enforcement of these laws following the Southport attacks an especially grievous example of government censorship, censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech. In July, a man was jailed and handed an eight-week sentence for posting a meme suggesting a link between migrants and knife crime. In October, an individual was convicted in England for engaging in silent prayer in violation of a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In the British Virgin Islands, the law criminalized \u201csending offensive messages through a computer\u201d with imprisonment for up to 14 years and a fine if convicted. The law applied to messages that were deemed \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d or had \u201cmenacing character\u201d or that were sent \u201cfor the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience.\u201d Media freedom NGOs strongly criticized the law. b. Worker Rights Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The law provided for the right of workers to form and join independent trade unions, bargain collectively, and conduct legal strikes. The law did not cover workers in the armed forces, public-sector security services, police forces, and freelance or temporary work. The law prohibited antiunion discrimination and protected employees from unfair dismissal while striking for up to 12 weeks, provided the union complied with the legal requirements governing such industrial action. Under the law employers were not allowed to dismiss an employee for being or wanting to be a trade union member. The law required a supportive ballot before industrial action by a trade union. A ballot was regarded as supportive if at least 50 percent of those who were entitled to vote did so, and if the majority of those votes were in favor of industrial action. For workers in \u201cimportant public services,\u201d defined as health services, education for those younger than 17, fire services, transport services, nuclear decommissioning and the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, and border security, a ballot was deemed supportive only if at least 40 percent of eligible voters voted in favor of industrial action. After securing a supportive ballot, the trade union was required to provide the employer with 14-days\u2019 notice before strike action was taken. The members\u2019 agreement to a union\u2019s proposed industrial action automatically expired six months after the date of the ballot. If nonunion members conducted a strike, they were protected from dismissal and had the same rights as union members, if the industrial action were lawful. Industrial action, including strike action organized by a trade union, was legal provided conditions were met. The government effectively enforced laws protecting freedom of association, collective bargaining, and the right of workers to engage in a strike or other industrial action. Employers generally respected freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Most trade union rights applied only to recognized, independent trade unions. A trade union could be certified as independent if it was not employer linked. The trade union was recognized by the employer if there was a recognition agreement between trade union and employer for collective bargaining purposes. Workers were entitled to have a trade union recognized where most of the workers concerned supported the union, as evidenced by a ballot showing a majority of workers voted, and at least 40 percent of those eligible to vote supported recognition. There was a statutory procedure for trade union recognition (and derecognition) applicable to companies with more than 21 workers. A statutory recognition agreement limited negotiations to pay (not including pensions), hours of work, and holidays. Workers on strike could expect to lose wages for the time they did not work. No one could be forced to take part in a strike. Penalties for violations of freedom of association, collective bargaining, and the right to strike were commensurate with those for analogous legal violations of civil rights and were regularly applied against violators. Inspection was sufficient to enforce compliance. Remedies were limited in situations where workers faced reprisal for trade union activity. Workers could make a claim to an independent employment tribunal in instances of unfair dismissal, discrimination at work, breach of contract, or unauthorized pay deductions. Workers claiming unfair dismissal for trade union activities, acting as a workers\u2019 representative, and whistleblowing were able to continue paid employment (known as interim relief) until the case was decided by the employment tribunal. The Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service, primarily funded by the Department for Business and Trade, worked to help employees and employers better adhere to collective bargaining and other workplace laws and to improve workplace relationships. It provided free advice to employers, employees, and their representatives, as well as dispute resolution services. If the Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service was not able to settle a dispute, a claim could be made at an employment tribunal and, in some cases, be eligible for interim relief. Forced or Compulsory Labor See the Department of State\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/. Acceptable Work Conditions Wage and Hour Laws The law provided for the National Living Wage for workers ages 23 and older and for workers ages 16 to age 22. Wages were above the official estimate for the poverty income level. The law limited the workweek to an average of 48 hours, normally calculated based on a 17-week period. The law did not prohibit compulsory overtime, but it limited overtime to the 48-hour workweek restriction. The 48-hour-workweek regulations did not apply to senior managers and others who could exercise control over their own work hours. There were also exceptions for the armed forces, emergency services, police, domestic workers, sea and air transportation workers, and fishermen. The law allowed workers to choose to work more than a 48-hour week; this was called an \u201copt out\u201d of the 48-hour limit. An individual could \u201copt out\u201d for a certain period or indefinitely; the \u201copt out\u201d was required to be voluntary, and an employee could not be fired or treated unfairly for refusing. The employee could cancel an \u201copt out\u201d agreement at any time, by giving seven days\u2019 notice. There were exceptions for airline staff, delivery drivers, security guards, and workers on ships or boats. In March 2023, the Ministry of Economy and Labour established the Employment Minimum Hourly Wage Order. In June 2023, Bermuda implemented its first minimum wage. The order set the minimum hourly wage and provided a hybrid payment structure for employees who received gratuities, commissions, and service charges. If basic wages did not equal the minimum hourly rate for employees who received these forms of compensation, the employer would be liable for the difference. The Bermuda Department of Labour enforced any contractually agreed wage and hour and standards. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) reported violations of wage, hour, or overtime laws were common in the agriculture, chemicals, construction, fairgrounds and theme parks, film and theater, logistics and transport, manufacturing, mining, energy, sports and leisure, utilities, and waste and recycling sectors. Occupational Safety and Health The government set occupational safety and health (OSH) standards, which were generally appropriate for the main industries. The law stipulated employers could not place the health and safety of employees at risk. The government proactively identified unsafe conditions. By law workers could remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and authorities effectively protected employees in this situation. Alleged violations of OSH standards were common in the construction, manufacturing, and agricultural, forestry, and fishing sectors. The Bermuda Department of Labour and Training enforced OSH standards. Regulations enforced by the department extensively covered the safety of the work environment, occupational safety, and health standards and were appropriate for the main industries. Wage, Hour, and OSH Enforcement The government effectively enforced minimum wage, overtime, and OSH laws. His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs enforced wage laws, and the HSE was responsible for enforcing OSH laws. Penalties for violations were generally commensurate with those for similar crimes such as fraud or negligence. Penalties were regularly applied against violators. Although criminal enforcement was available, most minimum wage noncompliance was pursued via civil enforcement through the courts. The number of labor inspectors was insufficient to enforce compliance. Inspectors had the authority to make unannounced inspections and initiate sanctions The UK informal economy was estimated to be approximately 10 percent of the overall economy. Approximately 2.9 million businesses traded without being registered for Value Added Tax, the Pay As You Earn Plan, or both and were classified as unregistered. The HSE effectively enforced occupational health and safety laws in all sectors including the informal economy. In Bermuda, penalties enforced by the Department of Labour and Training were commensurate with those for similar violations and were regularly applied against violators. c. Disappearance and Abduction Disappearance There were no reports of enforced disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. Prolonged Detention without Charges The law prohibited arbitrary arrest and detention and provided for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of their arrest or detention in court. The government generally observed these requirements. Police in England and Wales had powers to stop and search anyone if they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect the individual could be in possession of drugs, weapons, stolen property, or any item that could be used to commit a crime. In Scotland, guidelines allowed police to make arrests only when police had \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d The use of stop and search powers had to be deemed \u201cin accordance with the law, necessary, and proportionate,\u201d a refinement introduced after criticism that stop-and-search was being used to target specific racial groups. In Northern Ireland, the law permitted police officers to stop and search members of the public. In most circumstances, a police officer needed grounds to search an individual; however, some stop-and-search powers allowed individuals to be searched without grounds. By law, persons living in the 14 overseas territories, including Bermuda, were generally provided the same rights and protections against arbitrary arrest and detentions, with slight variations in each of the jurisdictions. d. Violations in Religious Freedom See the Department of State\u2019s annual International Religious Freedom Report at https://www.state.gov/religiousfreedomreport/. e. Trafficking in Persons See the Department of State\u2019s annual Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/. Section 3. Security of the Person a. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment The law prohibited such practices, and there were no credible reports government officials employed them. b. Protection of Children Child Labor There was no significant presence of the worst forms of child labor. The law prohibited all the worst forms of child labor. The law prohibited the employment of children younger than 13 with exceptions for sports, modeling, and paid performances, which depending on local bylaws could require a child performance license. Children younger than 18 were prohibited from working in hazardous environments or after 7 p.m. The law prohibited those younger than 16 from working in an industrial enterprise, including transportation or street trading. Children\u2019s work hours were strictly limited and could not interfere with school attendance. Different legislation governed the employment of persons younger than 16 and, while some laws were common across the UK, local bylaws varied. Children could work part-time from age 14, but in some local council areas, children could work part-time from age 13. In Scotland, children between ages 13 and 16 were allowed to work but only if, for example, their safety, health, development and education were not put at risk. Some local bylaws required children between ages 13 and 16 to obtain a work permit from local authorities. The local authority\u2019s education and welfare services had primary responsibility for oversight and enforcement of the permits. The Department for Education had primary regulatory responsibility for child labor, although local authorities generally handled enforcement. The government effectively enforced the applicable laws. Penalties were commensurate with those for equally severe crimes. Penalties were regularly applied against violators. In Bermuda, children younger than 13 could perform light work of an agricultural, horticultural, or domestic character if a parent or guardian was the employer. Schoolchildren could not work during school hours or more than two hours on school days. No child younger than 15 could work in any industrial undertaking, other than light work, or on any vessel, other than a vessel where only family members worked. Children younger than 16 could not work at night; children ages 16 to 18 were allowed to work until midnight under certain conditions; and employers were required to arrange for safe transport home for girls ages 16 to 18 working until midnight. The government effectively enforced the law. Penalties were commensurate with those for similar crimes and were regularly applied against violators. The Bermuda Police Service reported no cases of child labor or exploitation of children during the year. There were no confirmed reports during 2023 of the worst forms of child labor in the British Overseas Territories, but gaps in the law made children vulnerable. The British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Montserrat, and Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha did not have functioning labor inspectorates to enforce labor laws. There were legislative gaps in the prohibition of trafficking in children for labor exploitation in Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha. While criminal laws prohibited trafficking in children for sexual exploitation, they did not address trafficking in children for labor exploitation. Laws did not exist in Monserrat or the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) regarding the use of children in drug trafficking and other illicit activities. Child Marriage The minimum legal age for marriage was 16. In England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, persons younger than 18 required the written consent of parents or guardians, and the underage person was required to present a birth certificate. In Scotland, parental consent was not required for marriage at age 16. The legal minimum age for marriage was effectively enforced by the governments. Forcing a person to marry was a criminal offense throughout the country with a maximum prison sentence of seven years if convicted. Forcing a UK citizen into marriage anywhere in the world was a criminal offense in England and Wales. In Scotland, forced marriage was considered an abuse of human rights, as well as a criminal offense. In Northern Ireland, forced marriage was a criminal offense with a maximum prison sentence of seven years if convicted. The government operated a public helpline to provide advice and support to survivors of forced marriage. The government offered lifelong anonymity for survivors of forced marriage to encourage more to come forward. c. Protection to Refugees The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commission for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, returning refugees, or asylum seekers, as well as other persons of concern. Provision of First Asylum In England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the law provided for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and, except for Bermuda, the governments had systems for providing protection to refugees. Asylum was a matter reserved for the national government and was handled centrally by the Home Office, including for most overseas territories. Bermuda\u2019s constitution and laws did not provide for granting asylum or refugee status, and the government did not have an established system for providing protection to refugees. Following the UK\u2019s general election in July, the incoming Labour Party government reversed the plans of the Conservative government to transfer asylum seekers to Rwanda under the Safety of Rwanda Act. d. Acts of Antisemitism and Antisemitic Incitement The 2021 census recorded the UK Jewish population at approximately 292,000 persons. There were credible reports of crimes, violence, and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. Since the October 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, the NGO Community Security Trust recorded a large increase in antisemitic incidents across the UK. Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK in the first half of the year reached a record high of 1,978 anti-Jewish hate incidents, an increase from 964 for the same period in 2023. From January to June there were 121 reported incidents of assault, and cases of damage and desecration of Jewish property rose by 246 percent from 24 cases in 2023. During the same period incidents of threats increased 158 percent to 142, and cases of antisemitism affecting persons and their property in education increased by 119 percent to 162 cases. Data published by the Home Office showed a doubling of antisemitic attacks (to 3,282 incidents) in the first three months of the year compared to the previous year. On January 29, a potentially lethal antisemitic attack was averted in London by employees of a kosher store, who fended off a knife-wielding attacker. On February 12, a Jewish chaplain for universities in the Yorkshire area and his family were subjected to death threats and harassment after a campaign was launched to oust him from his position because of his Israeli Defense Force service during the Israel-Hamas War. The chaplain and his family were forced to go into hiding because of the campaign. In February, the government announced a \u00a370 million ($89 million) grant for security and protection of Jewish communities. On July 17, the government endorsed Global Guidelines for Countering Antisemitism at a meeting of the World Jewish Congress Special Envoys and Coordinators Combating Antisemitism Forum in Buenos Aires. On October 1, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced an additional \u00a3875,000 ($1.1 million) in funding for grassroots community projects \u201csupport community projects tackling extremism, hate, intolerance and radicalisation across London,\u201d and on October 7, the government announced funding of \u00a37 million ($8.9 million) to tackle antisemitism in schools and universities. For further information on incidents of antisemitism in the country, whether or not those incidents were motivated by religion, and for reporting on the ability of Jews to exercise freedom of religion or belief, see the Department of State\u2019s annual International Religious Freedom Report at https://www.state.gov/religiousfreedomreport/.

      "text": "Southport attacker admits murdering three girls\n- Published\nKnife attacker Axel Rudakubana has pleaded guilty to murdering three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\nThe 18-year-old stabbed Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, along with 10 others on 29 July last year, in a \"meticulously planned rampage\".\nAs his trial was set to begin at Liverpool Crown Court, Rudakubana, who prosecutors said had \"shown no remorse\", unexpectedly entered guilty pleas to all charges, including murder, attempted murder and terror-related offences.\nThe victims' families were not in court and the judge apologised to them, saying \"we had all assumed\" the trial would get under way in earnest on Tuesday.\nBefore a jury could be sworn in, Stan Reisz KC, defending, asked for the charges to be put to his client again and he pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder, along with two terror-related charges.\nRudakubana, of Banks, a village in west Lancashire, also admitted producing the biological toxin ricin and a charge under the Terrorism Act related to possessing an al-Qaeda training manual.\nMerseyside Police said the stabbing attack had not been declared a terrorist incident despite the discovery of the document.\nGovernment sources have told the BBC that Rudakubana was referred to the government's counter-terrorism Prevent programme several times before the attack over his general obsession with violence and he had been visited by police.\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced a public inquiry will be held into the attacks.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer earlier said the conviction of the \"vile and sick Southport killer\" was welcome but also a \"moment of trauma for the nation\".\nHe added: \"There are grave questions to answer as to how the state failed in its ultimate duty to protect these young girls.\n\"Britain will rightly demand answers, and we will leave no stone unturned in that pursuit.\"\nAs each charge was put to him, Rudakubana, who had his face covered with a PPE mask, quietly said \"guilty\" to each count.\nMr Justice Goose said: \"Axel Rudakubana, you can hear me, I know.\n\"Those who sit with me say you have nodded your head to indicate you can hear what I am saying.\"\nHe told him he would be sentenced on Thursday and a life sentence was \"inevitable\".\nRudakubana cannot be sentenced to a whole-life term for his crimes because he is under the age of 21.\nThe attack took place during a summer holiday dance class for children at the Hart Centre in Southport.\nRudakubana, who was 17 at the time, also stabbed eight other children along with yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who was instructing the class, and businessman John Hayes, who was one of the first people on the scene.\nA peaceful vigil was held in the town the next day, but misinformation spread online about Rudakubana led to a riot breaking out.\nPosts claiming he was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK on a small boat were shared widely.\nThe violent unrest quickly spread around the country.\nAbout 1,200 people have been arrested in connection with the riots in towns and cities across the UK, and more than 400 charged.\nDozens of them have been jailed.\nIn Court: Southport stabbings\nAxel Rudakubana admits the murder of three young girls in Southport\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nPatrick Hurley, who had become MP for the town less than a month before the attack, said there was \"surprise and shock\" at the pleas coming before the trial started.\nHe said: \"We are all hoping the families get the outcome and justice they need.\"\nThe Labour MP said he was pleased the victims' families would not have to sit through the \"mental torture\" of a lengthy trial.\n\"This isn't a day for celebration - it is a day to make sure we remember the victims,\" he added.\nIn the days following the murders, Alice was described by her family as a \"perfect dream child\" who \"moved their world\" with her \"confidence and empathy\".\nBebe's parents Lauren and Ben King said she was a \"sweet, kind, and spirited girl\" who was \"full of joy, light and love\".\nElsie Dot was said to be \"extraordinary\" and an \"amazing little girl\".\nThe corner of the street near to where the attack happened became a sea of flowers, as people from all around the country came to pay their respects, including King Charles.\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents in 2006, and moved to Banks near Southport in 2013.\nHe started behaving violently from Year 9 and was excluded from Range High School in Formby in October 2019 at the age of 13.\nHe had attacked a pupil with a hockey stick and had to be restrained by a teacher.\nRudakubana was prevented from returning to his former school a week before the stabbing murders after his father pleaded with a taxi driver not to take him.\nHe was wearing the same hooded sweatshirt and surgical mask he wore during the attack one week later.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Ursula Doyle, deputy chief crown prosecutor for Mersey and Cheshire, described the attack as \"unspeakable\".\n\"At the start of the school holidays, a day which should have been one of carefree innocence; of children enjoying a dance workshop and making friendship bracelets, became a scene of the darkest horror as Axel Rudakubana carried out his meticulously planned rampage,\" she said.\nMs Doyle added: \"It is clear that this was a young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence.\n\"He has shown no sign of remorse.\"\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover on Merseyside\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, external, X, external, and Instagram, external.

      "text": "Police get new guidance on releasing suspects' ethnicity\n- Published\nPolice will be encouraged to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations under new guidance, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says.\nIt is hoped the change will reduce the risk to public safety where there are high levels of misinformation about an incident or in cases of significant public interest.\nDecisions on releasing such information will remain with police forces, with wider legal and ethical considerations also considered, the NPCC added.\nIt comes after a series of high-profile cases including that of two men, reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire.\nWelcoming the new guidance, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them.\"\nThe guidance, which comes into immediate effect, forms part of a wider review of the College of Policing's professional practice for media relations.\nThe NPCC said the guidance would reaffirm that verifying a suspect's immigration status was not the police's responsibility.\n\"It is for the Home Office to decide if it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confirm immigration status,\" the council said.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC last week that there needed to be \"more transparency in cases\" over the background of suspects.\nThe NPCC said the new guidance aimed to ensure policing was more consistent, fair and transparent, as well as addressing possible mis and disinformation.\nThe change was in recognition of public concern and ensured police processes were \"fit for purpose in an age of rapid information spread\", the council added.\n- Published5 August\nBefore 2012 police forces made decisions on what information to give to the media on a purely case-by-case basis.\nBut after Lord Leveson published his report into the ethics of the press, police forces became much more cautious abut what information they released.\nAs it stands, there is nothing in the College of Policing's guidance on media relations that prevents police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even ethnicity of someone who has been charged.\nHowever there is nothing that specifically mentions them either which is why the information released to the media largely comes at the discretion of the police force. Hence the very different measures taken in recent cases.\nIn May, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's winning of the Premiership title, Merseyside Police were quick to reveal that the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a terrorist attack in the public interest.\nConversely, the forces decision not to release information about Axel Rudakubana - the man jailed for murdering Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, in Southport last summer - allowed false information to spread.\nThat misinformation was deemed at least partly responsible for the riots in England and Northern Ireland between 30 July and 5 August 2024.\nReferring to the riots, Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, described it as the \"real-world consequences\" of the information the police release into the public domain.\nShe said: \"We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels.\"\nShe added that \"being as fair, consistent and transparent as we can will improve confidence in policing\".\nChief Constable Sir Andy Marsh, CEO at the College of Policing, added that the interim guidance would \"bring consistency\" and that \"information can be released for all ethnicities and nationalities when it meets the right criteria.\"\nThe guidance has been developed following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Home Office and the College of Policing will update its current authorised professional practice for media relations later this year.\nThe Home Office spokesperson added: \"The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld.\n\"The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. All cases will of course take account of consultation with the police and CPS.\n\"The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial.\""

  "argos_summary": "A report by the Trump administration indicates that the human rights situation in the UK has deteriorated, citing restrictions on freedom of expression and antisemitism-related violence. It highlights concerns over government censorship following the Southport stabbings, where misinformation about the attacker led to riots across the UK. The report also criticizes similar trends in France and Germany, while the UK government defends its commitment to free speech amidst these challenges.",
