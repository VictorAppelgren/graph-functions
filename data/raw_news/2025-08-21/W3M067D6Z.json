      "text": "Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal have come aboard as producers on \u201cSecret of a Mountain Serpent\u201d through their banner Pushing Buttons Studios, with the feature set to make its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival.\nThe film is directed by Nidhi Saxena, who won Venice\u2019s Biennale College Fund grant for the project. Saxena previously helmed \u201cSad Letters of an Imaginary Woman,\u201d which premiered at the 2024 Busan International Film Festival.\n\u201cSecret of a Mountain Serpent\u201d is co-produced with Forest Flower Films, the banner of Cannes Camera d\u2019Or winner Vimukthi Jayasundara. Set in a remote Himalayan town during the 1990s, the intimate drama follows Barkha (Trimala Adhikari), a schoolteacher whose husband is stationed at the border. In an environment where most men are absent and silence permeates daily life, Barkha becomes drawn to Manik Guho (Adil Hussain), a mysterious outsider who disrupts the delicate equilibrium of waiting, restraint and local mythology.\nPopular on Variety\nChadha and Fazal launched Pushing Buttons Studios to champion authentic, emotionally driven storytelling. Their \u201cGirls Will Be Girls,\u201d directed by Shuchi Talati, won two awards at Sundance last year.\n\u201cWe were immediately drawn to Nidhi\u2019s lyrical vision. This is a story rooted in myth and yet is startlingly relevant today. At PBS, we believe in backing storytellers who take creative risks and Nidhi has crafted something singular, poetic, and soulful,\u201d Chadha and Fazal said.\nSaxena, who also wrote the screenplay, added: \u201cThis film is about women chose to risk everything and follow their desires, shedding the burden of moralities imposed upon them by the world. I was looking for kindred collaborators and this feels like a meeting of minds and hearts. It also feels like we no longer need to borrow men\u2019s voices to tell our stories. We have our own voice, which is strong, with femininity.\u201d\nThe production has completed principal photography and is currently in post-production ahead of its Venice bow."

      "text": "Kevin Spacey\u2018s European festival tour is moving to Venice.\nThe actor, who made a surprise appearance in Cannes to promote British indie film \u201cThe Awakening,\u201d in which he has a small role, is now heading to the Venice Film Festival to present the trailer for a new sci-fi movie he directed.\n\u201cHoliguards Saga \u2014 The Portal of Force,\u201d first announced by Variety earlier this year, is a supernatural action-thriller in which Spacey also stars alongside Dolph Lundgren (\u201cRocky IV,\u201d The Expendables\u201d), Tyrese Gibson (the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, \u201cMorbius\u201d), Brianna Hildebrand (\u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cLucifer\u201d), Disha Patani (\u201cKalki 2898 AD,\u201d \u201cBharat\u201d) and Eric Roberts (\u201cRunaway Train,\u201d \u201cThe Righteous Gemstones\u201d).\nVariety understands that the trailer for the movie \u2014 which shot in 2024 and marks Spacey\u2019s first feature as director in more than 20 years \u2014 will be shown as a special presentation on Aug. 29, attended by Spacey.\nPopular on Variety\nAs per the description, \u201cHoliguards Saga \u2014 The Portal of Force\u201d is set against the backdrop of a near-future world fractured by hidden supernatural forces, where two ancient warrior factions \u2014 the Holiguards and the Statiguards \u2014 wage a secret war for control of humanity\u2019s fate. Amid this conflict, a young woman discovers that she\u2019s the daughter of two rival leaders and could end the conflict. Meanwhile, a Statiguard strategist prepares a catastrophic attack in Paris using a nuclear device and an army of mind-controlled civilians, channeling energy from a cosmic portal to awaken an ancient force known as the Prime.\nThe film is planned to be the first in a franchise. It also marks the first feature to be produced by Elledgy Media, owned by Portugal-based Ukrainian entrepreneur Elvira Gavrilova Paterson.\nSpacey, who fell from grace in Hollywood following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, was found not liable in a civil lawsuit in New York in 2022 and acquitted in a criminal case in London the following year. Since then, he\u2019s been making moves into lower budget indie film waters. In addition to \u201cThe Awakening\u201d and \u201cHoliguards Saga \u2014 The Portal of Force,\u201d he had a voice role in U.K. thriller \u201cControl\u201d and appeared in thriller \u201cPeter Five Eight.\u201d\nIn Cannes, alongside promoting \u201cThe Awakening,\u201d Spacey was also the recipient of an award by the Better World Fund, and gave a fiery speech at the gala dinner, where he tearfully talked about his ousting from Hollywood.\n\u201cAs my friend Elton John once said, and the reason that this means so much to me, is because I\u2019m still standing, I\u2019m still standing,\u201d he said after closing the 10-minute speech."

They first teamed up in Sorrentino\u2019s dazzling 2001 debut, \u201cOne Man Up\u201d in which Servillo played an ageing cocaine-addicted crooner. Servillo is best known to international audiences for his memorable turn as Roman writer and socialite Jep Gambardella who embarks on a Dantesque descent amid the Eternal City\u2019s grotesque glitterati in \u201cThe Great Beauty,\u201d which won the 2014 best international film Oscar. He also played a heroin-addicted accountant for the mob in Sorrentino\u2019s sophomore film \u201cThe Consequences of Love;\u201d controversial Italian politician Giulio Andreotti in \u201cIl Divo;\u201d and media-mogul-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi in Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLoro.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\n\u201cI am very happy that the 82nd Venice International Film Festival will open with the new and highly anticipated film by Paolo Sorrentino,\u201d Venice artistic director Alberto Barbera said in a statement. He went on to underline that Sorrentino made his festival debut at Venice in 2001 with \u201cOne Man Up\u201d during Barbera\u2019s early years as Venice chief.\nThough Sorrentino launched several subsequent works \u2013 including \u201cThe Consequences of Love,\u201d \u201cIl Divo,\u201d and \u201cThe Great Beauty\u201d \u2013 from Cannes, his rapport with Venice consolidated over the years with the launch from the Lido of the first episodes in his groundbreaking series \u201cThe Young Pope\u201d (seasons one and two) and, with his 2021 film \u201cThe Hand of God\u201d that won the Silver Lion-Grand Jury Prize.\n\u201cPaolo Sorrentino\u2019s return [to Venice] in competition comes with a film destined to leave its mark for its great originality and powerful relevance to the present time, which the audiences of the Venice Film Festival will have the pleasure of discovering on opening night,\u201d Barbera concluded.\n\u201cLa Grazia,\u201d which is written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino, is a Fremantle film produced by The Apartment, a Fremantle Company, by Sorrentino\u2019s own Numero 10 shingle, and by PiperFilm that will distribute it in Italy.\nMubi owns worldwide rights excluding Italy. The Match Factory is handling international sales.\nAs previously revealed by Mubi boss Efe Cakarel, Jim Jarmusch\u2019s triptych picture \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, is believed to be up for a Lido competition slot.\nThe upcoming edition of Venice is shaping up to be a star-studded affair with Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d featuring Dwayne Johnson as two-time UFC heavyweight champ Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife Dawn; Luca Guadagnino\u2019s #MeToo-themed thriller \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri; and \u201cBugonia,\u201d the latest collaboration between Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone \u2014 who were last at the fest in 2023 with the Oscar-winning \u201cPoor Things\u201d \u2014 all likely to be set for a Venice sendoff, as Variety has reported.\nAs previously announced, two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne will preside over the main jury.\nThe 82nd edition of Venice will run Aug. 27-Sept. 6. The lineup will be announced on July 22."
