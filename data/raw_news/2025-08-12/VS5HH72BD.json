  "description": "Last night Elon Musk complained about the fact that Apple never seems to feature X or Grok on the App Store. Today, Apple responded.",
  "content": "Last night Elon Musk took to X to complain about the fact that Apple never seems to feature either X or Grok on the App Store. He claimed the company was unfairly favoring ChatGPT, and said xAI would take \u201cimmediate legal action\u201d. Today, Apple responded.\n\nIn a statement to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple said:\n\nMusk\u2019s claims came after he grew frustrated that, despite the X app topping the News chart yesterday, it never seemed to be featured on the App Store, apparently making it harder to climb the overall rankings.\n\nLikewise, over the past few days, and despite launching new features and making Grok 4 free for all users, the Grok app only reached fifth place overall and second in the Productivity category.\n\nBy contrast, he claimed that Apple\u2019s constant promotion of ChatGPT made it \u201cimpossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store,\u201d a claim quickly and easily debunked by xAI\u2019s own Grok, following a heated exchange between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.:\n\nAs for the lawsuit, despite Musk\u2019s promise of \u201cimmediate legal action\u201d by xAI, no suit appears to have been filed today.\n\nApple\u2019s statement to Gurman suggests it\u2019s taking the threat seriously, but its pointed use of the word \u201csafe\u201d is a not-so-subtle nod to Grok\u2019s recent controversies (including antisemitic content and the release of sexualized companion chatbots), which may disqualify it as a recommendation-worthy app in the company\u2019s view.\n\nWhat did you think of Apple\u2019s response to Musk\u2019s threat? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Elon Musk is (once again) going after Apple, this time accusing the company of an \u201cunequivocal antitrust violation\u201d for allegedly favoring OpenAI in the App Store\u2019s AI rankings. Here are the details.\nA bit of context\nLast month, xAI released Grok 4, its latest large language model, promising major performance gains over leading competitors. Since then, the company has also rolled out features like Grok Imagine, its image and video generator, as well as customizable \u201ccompanion\u201d chatbots.\nDuring the same time period, according to data from App Figures, the Grok app climbed from around 60th to 29th place in the overall App Store rankings last week.\nEarlier today, xAI made Grok 4 free for users worldwide, helping the app climb further to fifth place in the overall App Store rankings, and second in the Productivity category.\nStill, that hasn\u2019t been enough to dethrone OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which has spent the better part of the past year hovering at, or near, the top of Apple\u2019s charts.\nFor the past year, Apple has also repeatedly featured ChatGPT in its App Store editorial content. More significantly, it partnered with OpenAI as part of its new Apple Intelligence rollout, which includes direct Siri integration and support for the Writing Tools feature.\nBut what about the lawsuit?\nEarlier tonight, Elon Musk posted the following on X:\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly triggered his threat of legal action, but if history is any guide, he\u2019ll likely post more about it as his supporters egg him on. So his reasoning behind the move may become more apparent as the hours and days progress.\nMusk, of course, co-founded OpenAI before parting ways with the organization early on. More recently, he sued the company in an effort to block its transition to a for-profit model, a case still making its way through the courts.\nAt the same time, he\u2019s also been competing directly with OpenAI with xAI. So it\u2019s possible his latest grievance with the App Store is just an extension of that broader fight, and that he sees Apple\u2019s platform as playing a key and anticompetitive role in OpenAI\u2019s continued success.\nBe that as it may, Musk has a history of threatening legal action without always following through, so whether tonight\u2019s post amounts to anything remains to be seen. For now, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if he offers more context, or if xAI actually moves forward with a lawsuit in the coming days.\nDo you think Apple is giving OpenAI an unfair advantage on the App Store? Let us know in the comments.\nUpdate 10:25 p.m. ET: A few hours before the lawsuit threat, Musk had published this post in which he asked Apple why it \u201crefuse(d) to put either \ud835\udd4f or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when \ud835\udd4f is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps.\u201d His post quoted a Tesla fan account, claiming that \u201cthe people\u201d had spoken, and that X was the top news app in the U.S.\nAirPods deals on Amazon\n- AirPods Max, USB-C Charging: $479.99 ($549 off)\n- AirPods Pro 2, USB-C Charging: $169 ($80 off)\n- AirPods 4 USB-C Charging: $99 (was $129)\n- AirPods 4, USB-C and Wireless Charging: $148.99 (was $179)\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Despite Grok's recent updates and a climb to fifth place in the overall rankings, Musk expressed frustration over its lack of promotion by Apple. In response, Apple acknowledged Musk's concerns but hinted that Grok's controversies might affect its recommendation status, while no legal action has been initiated by Musk as of yet.",
