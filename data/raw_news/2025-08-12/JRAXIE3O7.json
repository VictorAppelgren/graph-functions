  "description": "Rapper and YouTuber DDG posted on social media that sheriff's deputies drew their weapons and briefly detained him in what he believes was a swatting incident.",
  "content": "DDG performs during the Summer Smash Music Festival in June in Bridgeview, Ill.\n\nA popular YouTube streamer posted on social media that he \u201calmost [died] today\u201d after Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies drew their weapons on him and briefly detained him Sunday afternoon in what he said appears to be a swatting incident.\n\nvideo that he was at a paintball tournament in Castaic when police surrounded him and other participants.\n\n\u201cI turned around and there\u2019s like six police cars and I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, what\u2019s going to happen?\u2019\u201d he said in the post.\n\nDDG said he expected law enforcement would inform him of what was happening. Instead, he said, he was detained without an explanation.\n\nVideo on social media shows DDG being searched and being walked to and placed inside a sheriff\u2019s vehicle just before 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cBro, he pulled up. Ain\u2019t no \u2018what\u2019s up,\u2019 ain\u2019t no nothing, ain\u2019t no, \u2018dude, we got a call.\u2019 Nothing,\u201d DDG said.\n\nHe then mimicked the pointing of a gun and said police yelled at him, \u201cHands in the air!\u201d\n\nDDG said that he had \u201cjust got done smoking ... so, you\u2019ve got to think what\u2019s going through my mental, bro.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t elaborate on what he was smoking but added, \u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself the whole time, \u2018is this real?\u201d\n\nMultiple calls to the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Santa Clarita station went unanswered. The department\u2019s main media relations office said it had no information about the incident.\n\nAs he sat in the back of the sheriff\u2019s vehicle, DDG said, he told deputies he believed he was being swatted, which occurs when a false report of a crime or emergency is made to provoke an aggressive law enforcement response.\n\nThe most extreme examples of swatting have involved responses from Special Weapons and Tactics, or SWAT, teams.\n\nWhile sitting in the sheriff\u2019s vehicle, DDG said, he read information about the potential swatting call on an open sheriff\u2019s laptop. He believed someone provided the Sheriff\u2019s Department with a description of the exact type of car he drove. He added that whoever called in the complaint said that the rapper was armed and was going to hurt himself and others.\n\nDDG said he was held for 20 minutes before being released.\n\n\u201cEnjoy life, life life like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d he said on his stream, \u201cbecause you never know.\u201d",

      "text": "\u2018Swatting\u2019 calls spark panic, fear, massive police responses. Can California finally crack down?\n- Share via\nEarlier this month, the Claremont Police Department received a chilling 911 report: A caller said they were holding someone captive inside a Claremont McKenna College restroom, carrying a bomb and preparing to shoot anyone they saw on campus.\nThe call triggered a massive deployment of law enforcement and SWAT team members and sent waves of panic coursing through campus as students scrambled to find cover.\nBut the crisis was fake, the result of a \u201cswatting\u201d call, a hoax 911 report made in the hope of generating a large law enforcement response. The incident took place one day after a similar threat prompted a lockdown of Loma Linda University\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital.\nSwatting is a growing problem across the state and country. But California law can make it challenging to hold people accountable for the chaos their threats cause.\nAlthough falsely reporting an emergency to 911 is a misdemeanor offense, lawmakers are seeking tougher penalties for threats that cause mass disruption and target vulnerable populations such as schoolchildren or hospital patients.\nA false call for an armed shooter triggered a massive police response at Clarement McKenna College; L.A.\u2019s second \u2018swatting\u2019 incident in two days\nUnder current law, threats are only considered to be a crime when they are made against an individual \u2014 not an institution, such as a school or hospital. Now, state legislators are backing new legislation to close that loophole.\n\u201cRight now, California law falls short,\u201d state Sen. Susan Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said in a statement. \u201cUnless a threat names a specific individual, officials have limited options, even when the danger is clear.\u201d\nRubio is the author of Senate Bill 19, known as the Safe Schools and Places of Worship Act, which would allow prosecutors to charge individuals who make credible threats of mass violence against schools and places of worship, even if they don\u2019t name a specific person. The goal is to hold people accountable for making intentional threats, recognizing that even hoax threats can cause mass panic, school closures and expensive law enforcement responses.\nAssemblymember Darshana R. Patel (D-San Diego) has proposed similar legislation, Assembly Bill 237, which would close the same loophole and also apply to threats made against day-care centers, hospitals and workplaces.\n\u201cAB 237 will make it clear that threats against schools and religious institutions and hospitals and other locations will not be taken lightly and there are consequences,\u201d Chula Vista Police Chief Roxana Kennedy said at a recent news conference to promote the legislation. \u201cThis bill empowers law enforcement to hold individuals accountable for wasting valuable resources and instilling fear in schools and in our community.\u201d\nA major motivator for both proposed bills was an incident involving Shoal Creek Elementary School in San Diego.\nA 38-year-old man sent hundreds of emails threatening a mass shooting at the school, but a judge dismissed the case against him because the threats didn\u2019t target a specific person, even though a gun and a map of the school were found at his home. Prosecutors have since refiled the case, naming the school principal as the target of the threats.\n\u201cThe claim that you cannot threaten an entity is beyond false,\u201d said Shoal Creek parent Jenny Basinger while testifying on behalf of AB 237. \u201cWe are the entity. We are Shoal Creek Elementary. The students, the staff, and the community are the ones left picking up the pieces of the threat.\u201d\nRubio said she focused her bill on schools and places of worship because these are the most frequently threatened institutions; the senator said she also supported Patel\u2019s more expansive bill. Should both bills pass, legislators would work together to combine them into a single law, she said.\nThe FBI reported in January 2024 that agents opened investigations into more than 100 separate threats targeting more than 1,000 institutions in 42 states during a one-month period.\nSynagogues and Jewish community centers constituted the largest category of targeted institutions, with more than 400 saying they\u2019d been threatened during that period. The second most frequent target was schools and school districts, followed by hospitals and hospital networks.\nAn 18-year-old from Lancaster has pleaded guilty to making hundreds of calls falsely threatening to conduct shootings or detonate bombs at public facilities.\n\u201cThese incidents cause fear and potentially dangerous interactions with law enforcement,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security said in a 2024 bulletin. \u201cSwatting calls and hoax threats are a daily occurrence, often come in clusters across the U.S., and are typically made to harass, intimidate, and/or retaliate against their intended target.\u201d\nLast month, a Lancaster teen was sentenced to four years in prison after making more than 375 hoax calls that included threats to detonate bombs, conduct mass shootings and \u201ckill everyone he saw,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of Justice. However, many of the cases were difficult to prosecute under current state law.\nBevin Handel, a spokesperson for the city of Claremont, said it is the city Police Department\u2019s goal to file charges against the perpetrator of the Claremont McKenna College call, but there are several challenges.\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle in holding perpetrators of swatting calls accountable is determining their identities,\u201d she said. \u201cAdvances in technology allow callers to mask their voices, phone numbers or IP addresses (\u2018spoofing\u2019) or make their false 911 calls sound more credible.\u201d\nIn addition, she said, current state law makes it challenging to file charges against swatters that \u201ctruly reflect the magnitude of the response and the fear and trauma they can cause.\u201d"

      "text": "Reports of immigration raid at bus stop in Pasadena spark outrage\n- Share via\nReports of federal agents detaining people at a bus stop near a Winchell\u2019s Donut House in Pasadena spurred outrage among some elected officials in Los Angeles County.\nIn a video posted on social media, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) said six Pasadena residents were detained Wednesday morning. Chu said she was rebuffed by the Department of Homeland Security in seeking information on the conditions where the detainees were being held.\n\u201cWe have the right to know what is happening with them,\u201d Chu said.\nChu also expressed dismay that an unidentified agent pointed a gun at a man seeking to take video of his license plate. The incident was caught on video by witnesses.\n\u201cThe ICE agent jumped out of the car and pointed a gun as though he was going to shoot the young man, just for shooting a video of that license plate,\u201d Chu said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\nVideos aired by KABC-TV Channel 7 show men sitting on a bus bench being taken into custody, and another in which a man in a cap and black vest emerges from a car and draws and points a weapon at another man. One witness told KABC that three of the six people detained were seniors.\nIn a social media post by Chu that features a video taken by a witness near the corner of Los Robles Avenue and Orange Grove Boulevard, the lawmaker wrote, \u201cAs you can see, these ICE agents are pointing guns at innocent individuals, no warrants, no explanations, just fear and intimidation.\n\u201cThese raids in my district are absolutely vile. Masked and armed like a militia, they\u2019re terrorizing families and destroying any sense of safety in our communities. This is not law enforcement it\u2019s a gross abuse of power, and I will not stand for it,\u201d Chu wrote.\nState Sen. Sasha Ren\u00e9e P\u00e9rez (D-Alhambra), whose district includes Pasadena, said she received reports from witnesses who said that \u201cwhen they asked the masked men to see identification, one of the men stepped out the unmarked vehicle and cocked his rifle toward members of the public.\u201d\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn on Wednesday said federal agents are \u201cterrifying people\u201d with these sweeps.\n\u201cWe have already seen kids not going to school, people avoiding shopping, church, and even going to work,\u201d Hahn said in a statement. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if after people read about this incident that we see more people avoid taking Metro. This isn\u2019t right. The fear they are spreading is doing profound harm in our communities.\u201d\nHahn, who also serves as chair of the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said she had directed Metro staff about the agency\u2019s protocols if immigration agents board a bus or train. \u201cI know the options will be limited,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want Metro to do everything in our power to protect our riders.\u201d\nChu visited the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles in an attempt to be let into the facility and determine the conditions in which the people were being held but said she was rebuffed.\nA peaceful rally was held Wednesday night at the corner of Los Robles Avenue and Orange Grove Boulevard in support of those detained, KTTV-TV Channel 11 reported. One of those detained had been heading to their job \u201cto do fire recovery work\u201d for areas destroyed in the Eaton fire in Altadena, the news outlet reported."

      "text": "Video shows Florida deputies punching and dragging a Black man from his car\n- Share via\nA video showing Florida deputies punching and dragging a Black man from his car during a traffic stop has sparked nationwide outrage, with civil rights lawyers accusing authorities of fabricating their arrest report.\nThe footage shows that William McNeil Jr., 22, was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, asking to speak to the Jacksonville deputies\u2019 supervisor, when authorities broke his window, punched him in the face, pulled him from the vehicle, punched him again and threw him to the ground.\nBut Sheriff T.K. Waters of the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office says there\u2019s more to the story than the cellphone video that went viral on the Internet. He warned the public about \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that could lead to faulty conclusions. McNeil\u2019s lawyers say the video clearly depicts police brutality.\nBody camera footage of the encounter shows that McNeil had been repeatedly told to exit the vehicle, and though McNeil earlier had his car door open while talking with authorities, he later closed it and appeared to keep it locked for about three minutes before deputies forcibly removed him. The vantage point of the bodycam footage that was released makes it difficult to see the punches that were thrown.\nMcNeil\u2019s attorneys call the cellphone footage \u2018disturbing\u2019\nThe cellphone footage from the Feb. 19 arrest shows that seconds before being dragged outside, McNeil had his hands up and did not appear to be resisting as he asked, \u201cWhat is your reason?\u201d He had pulled over and had been accused of not having his headlights on, even though it was daytime, his lawyers said.\n\u201cWhat happened to William McNeil Jr. is a disturbing reminder that even the most basic rights \u2014 like asking why you\u2019ve been pulled over \u2014 can be met with violence for Black Americans,\u201d lawyers Ben Crump and Harry Daniels said in a statement. Crump is a Black civil rights attorney who has gained national prominence representing victims of police brutality and vigilante violence.\n\u201cWilliam was calm and compliant,\u201d they said. \u201cYet instead of answers, he got his window smashed and was punched in the face, all over a questionable claim about headlights in broad daylight.\u201d\nThe sheriff said the cellphone camera footage from inside the car \u201cdoes not comprehensively capture the circumstances surrounding the incident.\u201d\n\u201cPart of that stems from the distance and perspective of the recording cell phone camera,\u201d the sheriff said in a statement, adding that the video did not capture events that occurred before officers decided to arrest McNeil.\nCameras \u201ccan only capture what can be seen and heard,\u201d the sheriff added. \u201cSo much context and depth are absent from recorded footage because a camera simply cannot capture what is known to the people depicted in it.\u201d\nAuthorities say McNeil was reaching down, near where a knife was\nA key point of contention in the police report is a claim that McNeil was reaching toward an area where a knife was. Deputies later found the knife on the driver\u2019s side floorboard of his car when they searched it after taking McNeil into custody.\n\u201cThe suspect was reaching for the floorboard of the vehicle where a large knife was sitting,\u201d Officer D. Bowers wrote in his report. \u201cThe suspect continued to attempt to pull away from officers and refused to place his hands behind his back.\u201d\nBowers does not mention any punches being thrown in his report, and describes the force this way: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d\nIn a separate report, a second officer describes knocking McNeil to the ground by grabbing his legs and driving his shoulders into him. Then, he delivered six closed-fist punches to the hamstring of McNeil\u2019s right thigh, he said.\n\u201cAfter delivering the six closed fist strikes, the subject stopped resisting\u201d and was handcuffed by another officer, he wrote.\nMcNeil\u2019s attorneys say their client was \u2018never combative\u2019\nCrump and Daniels called Officer Bowers\u2019 report on the knife a \u201cfabrication,\u201d saying that \u201che never reaches for anything.\u201d\n\u201cThe only time he moves at all is when the officer knocks him over by punching him in his face,\u201d they said. \u201cThen this young man calmly sits back straight and holds his empty hands up.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s never combative, never raises his voice and he certainly never reaches for a knife,\u201d they added. \u201cHe simply asks for a supervisor and then they break his window and beat him yet, somehow, the report failed to mention that.\u201d\nThe second officer, who punched McNeil in the thigh, observed that McNeil kept his hands up as Officer Bowers smashed the window.\n\u201cAfter Ofc. Bowers opened the door, the subject refused to exit the vehicle, but kept his hands up,\u201d the second officer wrote. \u201cWith the subject\u2019s hands up, I reached in and unbuckled his seatbelt, telling him to exit the vehicle.\u201d\nMcNeil was charged with resisting a police officer without violence, driving with a suspended license and having less than 20 grams of marijuana, Waters said. He pleaded guilty to the charges of resisting an officer and driving with a suspended license, Waters said.\nWaters said the sheriff\u2019s office on Sunday became aware that the cellphone video was circulating on social media. Investigations then began, and the state attorney\u2019s office determined that no officers violated any criminal laws, he said at a news briefing. An \u201cadministrative review\u201d to determine whether officers violated any department policies is still ongoing, he said.\nMartin writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "L.A. County 18-year-old pleads guilty to making 375 \u2018swatting\u2019 calls throughout the U.S.\n- Share via\nA Lancaster 18-year-old pleaded guilty Wednesday to phoning in hundreds of false threats of imminent bombings, mass shootings and violence targeting locations across the U.S., including places of worship and schools.\nAlan W. Filion pleaded guilty to four counts of making interstate threats to injure people, federal authorities said.\nFrom August 2022 to January 2024, Filion made more than 375 \u201cswatting\u201d and threatening hoax calls, including calls in which he threatened to detonate bombs or conduct mass shootings at targeted locations, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSwatting occurs when a false crime or emergency is reported at a specific location to provoke an aggressive law enforcement response, often by a SWAT team. According to federal officials, it was Filion\u2019s intention to cause large-scale deployment of police and emergency services units at targeted locations.\nFilion, who was 16 when he made a majority of the calls, targeted religious institutions, high schools, colleges and universities, as well as government officials and numerous individuals across the nation.\nSimon Cowell, Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Miley Cyrus are all victims of the hoax known as \u2018swatting.\u2019 No one\u2019s been arrested, and laws haven\u2019t caught up.\nWhen he placed a swatting call at a targeted location, Filion would call emergency responders and provide them with false information about having placing dangerous explosives, telling authorities that he and others had firearms and explosives, and that he or other individuals had committed or intended to imminently commit violent crimes.\nIn an online post, Filion claimed that when he conducts a \u201cswatting\u201d call he \u201cusually get[s] the cops to drag the victim and their families out of the house, cuff them and search the house for dead bodies.\u201d\n\u201cSwatting poses severe danger to first responders and victims, wastes significant time and resources, and creates fear in communities,\u201d said Paul Abbate, FBI deputy director.\nIn 2023 Filion tried to turn the hoax calls into a business and made posts on social media, advertising his services and swatting-for-a-fee structure.\nIt\u2019s unclear if he was ever paid to make a hoax call or had any clients.\nFilion was arrested in January in California on Florida state charges arising from a May 2023 threat he made to carry out a mass shooting at Masjid Al Hayy, a mosque in Sanford, Fla.\nAlan Winston Filion has been arrested on suspicion of swatting Masjid Al Hayy mosque in Sanford, Fla. Authorities say he may be connected to other incidents.\nIn his call to authorities about the mosque, he claimed that he had an illegally modified AR-15, a Glock 17 pistol, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails. During the call he played an audio of gunfire in the background, according to Florida prosecutors.\nFilion has remained in custody since his arrest on state charges. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. A sentencing date has not yet been set.\nFilion has also pleaded guilty to making three other threatening calls, according to the Department of Justice.

      "text": "Soulja Boy arrested near his Melrose clothing shop on suspicion of felony weapons possession\n- Share via\nSoulja Boy faces a fresh round of legal woes, months after he was found liable for sexually assaulting and physically and emotionally abusing a former assistant.\nLos Angeles police arrested the 35-year-old rap star, known for \u201cCrank That (Soulja Boy)\u201d and \u201cKiss Me Thru the Phone,\u201d early Sunday morning on suspicion of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, a police spokesperson confirmed to The Times. Soulja Boy \u2014 real name DeAndre Cortez Way \u2014 was arrested Sunday around 2:50 a.m. near the intersection of Genesee Avenue and Melrose Avenue after police conducted a traffic stop. The rapper was arrested about five blocks west of his Melrose clothing store, SODMG Brand.\nWhile investigating the vehicle, police identified Way as one of the passengers. Later that morning around 6 a.m., officers booked the rapper into the jail at the LAPD\u2019s Wilshire Division, according to the Sheriff Department\u2019s inmate database.\nMarlon Wayans makes a punchline out of Soulja Boy\u2019s entire career after the \u2018Pretty Boy Swag\u2019 rapper targets the comic and his trans son with anti-LGBTQ+ slurs.\nAdditional information on what prompted the traffic stop and who else was in the vehicle was not immediately available, police said. A representative for Soulja Boy did not immediately respond Monday to The Times\u2019 request for comment.\nA Chicago native and Grammy nominee, Soulja Boy rose to prominence in the early aughts, but in recent years has faced legal repercussions for his treatment of women in his inner circle.\nIn April 2023, a Santa Monica jury sided with his ex-girlfriend, who sued him in 2020 for assault, kidnapping and invasion of privacy, among other counts. Two years after that verdict, Soulja Boy was found liable for sexually assaulting and physically and emotionally abusing a former assistant.\nIn April, a Santa Monica jury found Soulja Boy to be liable after a three-week trial and decided he must pay the woman more than $4 million in compensatory damages. The rapper\u2019s lead defense attorney disagreed with the decision.\nGlorilla talks about her recent drug arrest, which she said stemmed from a call about an alleged burglary. She says police focused on the wrong task.\n\u201cWe maintain that the evidence does not support the verdict. It is unfortunate that aspersions and misperceptions of a culture were allowed to influence the trial,\u201d attorney Rickey Ivie said in April. \u201cMr. Way fully intends to pursue his post-trial remedies and to fight for a just result in this case.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

This incident highlights the growing issue of swatting, where false emergency reports provoke heavy police responses, prompting California lawmakers to propose stricter penalties for such actions. Meanwhile, an 18-year-old from Lancaster pleaded guilty to making over 375 swatting calls across the U.S., targeting schools and places of worship, which has raised concerns about the safety and accountability of such hoaxes.",
