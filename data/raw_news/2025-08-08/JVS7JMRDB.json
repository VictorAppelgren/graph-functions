  "description": "This week brings the launch of a fresh rolling carry-on tote from Hulken, a Lego recreation of an Italian Riviera and an all-new, sleek Sony mirrorless camera.",
  "content": "It\u2019s Friday, and that means that we get to end the week by looking back at our editors\u2019 favorite product launches from the last seven days. Whether you\u2019re just hoping to keep up to date with the latest and greatest releases or are looking to shop them, we\u2019ve highlighted nine of the most notable drops from around the web.\n\nTo close out the week, our deals team of Rikka Altland, Jacqueline Saquin and Elena Matarazzo scoured the web to find the best new product drops. This week brings the launch of a fresh rolling carry-on tote from Hulken, a Lego recreation of an Italian Riviera and an all-new, sleek Sony mirrorless camera.\n\nLeica may have some competition\n\nSony\u2019s newest camera hit store shelves this week, and our senior editor, Rikka Altland, recently had a chance to try it out for herself. In true Sony fashion, the new RX1 R III is a mouthful of a name for a camera that\u2019s as elegant as they come in the mirrorless world. It features a lightweight body that includes a fixed Zeiss 35mm f/2 prime lens that is versatile enough to simulate the experience of other lenses. The camera\u2019s massive 61-megapixel full-frame sensor helps the cause, with more than enough pixels to crop in and adjust pictures as needed.\n\nAltland spent an evening with the new camera earlier in the week, immediately noticing another one of the Sony RX1R III\u2019s new tricks: an updated autofocus system. It\u2019s one of the snappiest autofocuses she has tried in this kind of camera, meaning blurry photos of your kids will be a thing of the past. Where it starts to give cameras in this class (think of Leica) a run for their money is with the introduction of 12 film presets, which include settings for a classic filmic FL look, a nostalgic FL2 film mode and more.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the Sony RX1 R III \u2014 its price tag. You\u2019ll have to shell out a whopping $5,098 to bring this shiny new piece to your photography setup.\n\nAn all-denim collab between two fashionable powerhouses\n\nThe latest limited-edition collaboration between Gap and B\u00e9is is a game-changer for anyone who\u2019s ever felt the burden of packing for both style and function. Each piece in this exclusive collection seamlessly blends Gap\u2019s iconic essentials with B\u00e9is\u2019s trendy travel-centric designs. Whether you\u2019re jet-setting to a tropical destination or heading out on a weekend adventure, the collection ensures you won\u2019t have to compromise on comfort or aesthetics while you\u2019re on the move.\n\nWhat sets this collaboration apart is its dedication to the needs of the modern traveler. Take the Convertible Cargo Barrel Pants, for example \u2014 two looks in one, designed to adapt to any situation with minimal effort. The pants can be transformed from shorts to pants with a zip. Add in the denim-like knits that offer the appearance of your favorite pair of jeans, but with all the softness and stretch of a knit. It also decks out bestselling B\u00e9is travel gear, like the already sold-out Weekender Bag and the Carry-On, in Gap\u2019s signature denim.\n\nThe collections are available at both B\u00e9is and Gap. While both brands are typically priced accessibly alone, the collab does carry a slightly higher premium. Prices range from $40 to $378, with the higher-end pieces reflecting the exclusivity of this limited-edition partnership.\n\nFor those who start celebrating spooky season a few months early\n\nChristmas in July was a couple of weeks back, and Lush is here to continue the spirit of celebration with its limited-edition Halloween collection. In about a month, or when Labor Day weekend rolls around, many of us will be slipping into chunky knits and sipping on PSLs, so why not start a bit early?\n\nIndulge in self-care nights and fight off those spooky Sunday scaries with an adorable Ghostie Bath Bomb or Dracula Bubble Bar, and coat your lips in a Blood Orange Lip Scrub while taking a soak. If baths aren\u2019t your or their thing, this spicy vanilla shower gel will look great in a boo basket alongside a creepy alien shower jelly.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t heard, Lush\u2019s body sprays are all the rage and give off a subtle scent that lasts all day. Mist yourself or even your space with the decadent Pumpkin Spice and earthy Lord Of Misrule.\n\nBuild your own Ligurian fishing village, no passport required\n\nCNN Underscored\u2019s Lego expert, Altland, may have just checked out her favorite sets from the new summer wave that just launched, but there\u2019s another new kit on the block worth taking a closer look at. Now available for purchase for those with a Lego account and officially going up for sale this weekend, the new Ideas Italian Riviera assembles an incredibly detailed replica of a coastal fishing village with 3,251 pieces.\n\nAside from gorgeous facades and intricate details on the outside, the three buildings have interior furnishing that can be revealed by lifting the building\u2019s different modules. Popping off the roofs and upper stories of the gelato store, diving equipment shop and fish market reveal plenty of scenes fit for a typical Ligurian village. To really sell those vibes, you\u2019re getting 10 minifigures who are right at home in the Italian Riviera.\n\nSelling for $300, this set is one of the more expensive models in recent months, but that isn\u2019t stopping Altland from eyeing this build for her own Lego collection.\n\nAnother favorite way to schelp\n\nHulken, a lifestyle brand synonymous with the hustle of modern life, has expanded its offerings into the world of travel with two exciting new releases that cater perfectly to the needs of people who are always on the go. The Hulken Carry-On ($150) is a lightweight, fold-flat, top-opening luggage solution that redefines the traditional carry-on bag, making it an essential for anyone who values both convenience and style during their travels.\n\nDeals editor Jacqueline Saguin has been a faithful user of the brand\u2019s original Hulken Bag, relying on it for picking up heavy packages and lugging large loads of laundry. Following in its footsteps, the Carry-On packs that OG design down into an airplane-ready footprint. Unlike typical carry-ons that open from the side or front, the top-opening feature allows for quick, easy access to your belongings, especially in tight overhead compartments or when you\u2019re trying to grab something mid-flight. It differs from the OG with additional carrying straps and an additional outer laptop compartment.\n\nIts lightweight construction means you won\u2019t have to worry about lugging a heavy bag through crowded airports or navigating a busy city with your gear. And, of course, the signature Hulken foldability makes it a breeze to stow away when not in use, freeing up precious storage space for those who prefer to travel light.\n\nAt $150, it\u2019s a bit steeper than its Rolling Tote counterparts. For those looking to maximize value, bundle the Carry-On and its companion Schlep Stack together for $200 and free shipping, which means $45 in savings.\n\nBack-to-school pieces that the whole family can enjoy\n\nCalling all Crayola fanatics! Crayola just released its collaboration with the iconic reusable water bottle brand, Swell, and with it, 12 limited-edition pieces in retired colors. Violet Blue, Orange Red, Magic Mint and Dandelion are back and were missed by folks old enough to remember that they even existed in the first place.\n\nWe\u2019re loving the retro-inspired prints and vintage twist on this back-to-school collection. It feels nostalgic, and although none of us are school-aged, we feel like we\u2019re going back this fall after seeing these pieces. Shop by your preferred color or mix and match between your favorites. The durable and easy-to-clean Salad Bowl Kits are blended with two colors and are perfect for the kids at heart who want to make their in-office desk salad a bit more cheerful.\n\nLittle ones can enjoy the itty bitty, 9-ounce flip straw bottle, which comes with a carrying handle and a set of old school sticker print-adorned food canisters for all their school snacks. If you\u2019re in the market for a new reusable water bottle that\u2019s a bit larger than the mini kid\u2019s one, the brand made a Crayola version of its classic screw top silhouette that holds 17 ounces of liquid.\n\nMustard\u2019s lineup of lively lockers is one of our editors\u2019 favorite storage solutions. The company is now expanding its collection with a new wall-mounted organizer named The Storyboard. Available in 12 different colors ranging from light pink hues and dark blues to chalkboard-inspired looks, it is made from the same powder-coated steel as the brand\u2019s lockers.\n\nEach one measures 33.5 inches wide and 20.9 inches tall \u2014 or vice versa, depending on whether you\u2019re hanging it in portrait or landscape position. In either case, The Storyboard can be used to hang up important documents, serve as a mood board and more when paired with Mustard\u2019s new magnetic Buttons that come in the same array of styles.\n\nAltland has been eyeing a new way to organize all the printed keepsakes she gets from the restaurants she visits. This seems like the perfect solution for hanging up ornate Omakase menus, postcards from hole-in-the-wall sandwich spots and all the other prints she has collected from her time eating her way around New York City. Mustard\u2019s new The Storyboard retails for $129 and is now available for purchase alongside The Buttons, which go for $28 when you buy a 6-pack.\n\nLaunched August 1, K18\u2019s new Heat Bounce is a science-led approach to how you can help shield hair from heat styling damage. This lightweight cream-to-mist formula is powered by the brand\u2019s ResiliCore technology, a molecule that aims to penetrate the hair\u2019s cortex to defend against heat up to 450\u00b0F and UV rays, per the brand. Priced at $38, it offers a fresh approach to heat protection without the usual heaviness or greasiness you\u2019d associate with traditional heat protectants.\n\nHeat Bounce completes K18\u2019s signature hair repair routine of leave-in masks and volumizers, ideal for those who prioritize maintaining healthy hair while styling with heat. Designed for all hair types and textures, it\u2019s designed to protect hair while leaving soft, shiny hair in its wake, without feeling weighed down. The brand also took notes from leading industry hair experts like Devante Turnbull, stylist to celebrities like Sza, to tweak its formulation.\n\nLeave hair frizz-free and smelling fresh with this summer inspired hair spray\n\nSince June, our associate editor, Elena Matarazzo, has used R+Co\u2019s Sun Catcher Leave-In Conditioner from its Ashley Streicher Collection. Instead of blow-drying her hair before a night or day out on the town, she\u2019s been using three or so pumps of the leave-in serum and letting her hair dry naturally. Surprisingly, her thick and bluntly cut bob has dried frizz-free with summery waves throughout.\n\nBefore learning about the leave-in conditioner and this most recent launch from Streicher and R+Co, Matarazzo had been following the talented hairstylist for years and adored the way she cut and created relaxed yet chic, textured styles with her clients\u2019 hair. So, once she got her hands on the first product from the Sun Catcher line, she was hooked.\n\nThe Sun Catcher Power C Nourish + Refresh Styling Spray is the newest addition to the block and is here to prep your hair for pre-blowout or air-drying. It lightly coats your hair and doubles as a heat protectant (up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit) and is packed with vitamin C to keep harmful UV rays out and pollution. Like the other products from Streicher, this one smells amazing. It reminds Matarazzo of a summer in California and smells of citrus, palo santo and cedar.\n\nAs deals editors at CNN Underscored, we are some of the first people to hear about the latest product news from reader-favorite brands. Our deals team \u2014 comprised of senior editor Rikka Altland, editor Jacqueline Saguin and associate editor Elena Matarazzo \u2014 is passionate about product launches that we would be tempted to shop, and we enjoy finding a coveted new item (especially one from a brand with top marks from our experts) because it means we\u2019re helping our readers make savvy buying decisions.",

Unlike traditional heat protectants that only coat the outside cuticle layer of hair, the size + molecular makeup of resilicore\u2122 allows it to penetrate deeper than ever before*, into the cortex where heat damage can occur, forming a protective shield that fortifies from within.\n*k18hair.com/disclaimers\n*k18hair.com/disclaimers\nWhile the molecular repair hair oil and HeatBounce have heat protection benefits, HeatBounce defends against heat from the cuticle to the cortex*, going as deep as heat damage goes to help protect against color fade, dry feeling, dullness, and breakage. The oil delivers traditional heat protection on the outer layers of hair and clinically proven damage repair.\n*k18hair.com/disclaimers\nAfter shampooing, apply the K18 mask (wait 4 minutes) or DAMAGE SHIELD conditioner. Then, apply HeatBounce and AstroLift\u2122 before blow drying or air drying. Use HeatBounce again before any hot tools. Finish with K18 oil and use AirWash\u2122 to refresh hair between washes.\nApply HeatBounce every time before you apply heat, including if you switch between blow drying to hot tools.\nthe future of heat protection\nheat protect + condition in one step\nhow to use HeatBounce\n1.
