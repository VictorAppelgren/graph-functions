  "description": "... which might be a bit of a problem coming into the next big crossover set with Spider-Man.",
  "content": "Magic: The Gathering is having an even bigger moment than usual this year, thanks to a lot of attention around its splashy crossovers and its rapid rollout of sets. But with that attention, there\u2019s definitely been some consternation about just how wide-reaching Magic\u2018s aesthetic is getting, between experimental in-universe sets and those aforementioned \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d bringing more and more licensed material into the game. In a fascinating new article looking at the major sets of the last year, the game\u2019s head designer is starting to reckon with those lessons learned\u2026 lessons that are going to make for a very interesting reaction to the game\u2019s next big collab.\n\nToday Magic head designer Mark Rosewater released his 2025 State of Design article on the official Magic website, looking back at feedback and lessons to be learned from the release of almost every major Magic set released in the last year (up to, but not including, Edge of Eternities, which released on August 1). There are lots of interesting points Rosewater makes in the piece, reflecting some of the biggest fan concerns about Magic\u2018s direction from a mechanical and aesthetic point of view, from the game\u2019s eagerness to move on from themes every set, creating an issue where mechanical elements are introduced and then left unsupported, to an awareness of the game\u2019s complexity creep from the sheer amount of interactions possible even when Magic introduces individually simplistic new mechanics.\n\nBut one of the most intriguing lessons to be learned that Rosewater highlights across several of the sets covered in the piece\u2014Bloomburrow, Duskmourn: House of Horror, Foundations, Aetherdrift, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, and Final Fantasy\u2014is a regular criticism Magic has faced as of late: that the game has occasionally pushed its fantastical too far into elements that don\u2019t capture Magic\u2018s feel. One particular pain point Rosewater highlighted was in Duskmourn, a horror-themed set that included several more direct aspersions to classic horror media, rooted in our own world.\n\n\u201cPlayers, it seems, are not fans of what I\u2019m going to call \u2018mundane modernity.\u2019 Magic has had many sets, such as Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty and The Brothers\u2019 War which push into more of a science-fiction feel, with items far more technically advanced than one would normally find in a fantasy story,\u201d Rosewater wrote. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t generally bother many players. Some things Duskmourn: House of Horror did for the first time bothered players, like having characters wearing and using things that we actually use: things like sneakers, or jeans, or a baseball bat. Part of fantasy is the idea that you\u2019re coming to a world that is fundamentally different than your own. Fantasy wants to be inspirational, and seeing everyday objects which are a part of all of our daily lives deflates that.\u201d\n\nAs Rosewater acknowledged, not every Magic set is rooted in explicitly fantastical material, from the sci-fantasy of sets like Edge of Eternities to collaborations in Universes Beyond like Doctor Who or Warhammer 40,000, which have fantastical elements rooted in science-fictional or real-world designs. But Magic also has a strong history of being able to root that kind of aesthetic in fantasy, which Duskmourn\u2018s more explicit horror callouts lacked. At a time when Wizards is also reckoning with the increase of non-Magic-original sets in the game, depending on the crossover, it\u2019s going to be an issue that continues to concern players (even beyond the general existence of Universes Beyond, complaints around which Rosewater acknowledged as a \u201csentiment [that] continually shrinks over time\u201d).\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting thing for Rosewater to acknowledge, though, as Magic is now little more than a month away from the release of its next set, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man. Although there are fantastical elements in a set about a superhero scientist and peculiar foes, like most of good Marvel, it\u2019s built into the so-called \u201cworld outside our window.\u201d The Final Fantasy set did a great job translating Final Fantasy to the world of Magic, while drawing on a myriad of aesthetics from steampunk to sci-fi to more traditional medieval fantasy, and managed to effectively balance those aesthetic styles with what players typically expect from Magic.\n\nWill Spider-Man walk the web-rope and balance that vibe, or will it end up with reactions like Duskmourn? We\u2019ll find out if there are more lessons to learn when the set hits shelves at the end of September.",

      "text": "State of Design 2025\nWhen I became head designer for Magic, one of the things I started doing was writing an annual column that looked back at the previous Magic \"year\" with a critical eye, examining what worked and what didn't work. I called it the State of Design article as I modeled it after the US president's State of the Union Speech. While I had become head designer in 2003, the first State of Design column wasn't until 2005 when the first year of sets I had overseen was released.\nHere are the links to the last twenty State of Design articles:\nAs always, I will start by looking back at the year as a whole, examining the highlights and lessons of the year. I will then talk about each booster release with new content, examining the highlights and lessons of each set. There is an amazing amount of great design work outside of the booster releases, but I am but one man with one column, so I'm going to talk today about the booster releases. Note that this article is more focused on big picture design issues than individual card-by-card notes. This column will cover Bloomburrow through Magic: The Gathering\u00ae\u2014FINAL FANTASY\u2122.\nI'll begin with the same question I start with every year: how was the last year of Magic design?\nI believe it was excellent, some of the best design work we've ever done. The sets, save maybe Aetherdrift, were all well received. In all the feedback I got this year, every set had multiple people call it their favorite, and not just of the year. This all coincides with Magic being at its all-time high for players. More people are playing Magic today than have ever played at any other point in the game's 32-year history. We have a number of metrics we use to measure the game's health, and all the metrics are the highest we've seen. Magic is currently at the top of its game, and I believe a lot of that is due to how fun Magic is to play, which is due in part to the hard work of all the designers.\nI should point out that there's a huge amount of work that goes into making Magic great beyond game design. But as this is a design column, I'm focusing on the design, however all that other work is also a significant part of the game's success.\nThat doesn't mean we did everything right. Each release had some lessons, which I'll get to today, and there are some larger trends that some players aren't happy with, which I'll also touch upon. I do believe, though, that design is in a healthy place, and that we're continuing to improve our ability to make awesome Magic sets.\nOverall Magic Design\nHighlights\nWe did a good job at finding our roots.\nOne of the big lessons of the prior Magic year was that Magic sets needed to feel a little more Magic-y. This year did a good job of addressing that. Both Foundations and Tarkir: Dragonstorm were lauded for how much they felt like sets of old, diving into the qualities that are quintessentially Magic. It's important to show we haven't forgotten our roots, and that in this era of Universes Beyond playing a larger role, Magic's settings and, more importantly, the essence of what makes the game special as a property, continues to be imbued in sets.\nWe made new setting that felt deep and immersive.\nAnother complaint we saw was that some of the sets felt too thin, especially sets introducing a new world or theme. Bloomburrow and Duskmourn: House of Horror, while radically different in tone, both showed Magic's ability to create new things that still felt ingrained in the Multiverse in an organic way.\nWe found a lot of valuable design space in tweaking known things.\nWe made a lot of new mechanics, like offspring, valiant, manifest dread, eerie, impending, omen, exhaust, harmonize, mobilize, renew, flurry, endure, behold, Saga creatures, and job select. This year was full of a lot of mechanics that were things Magic had done before, but tweaked. Maybe we were trying to improve upon the earlier mechanic, maybe we were adapting it for a new flavor, or we found cool new gameplay out of making a tiny change. This year's design got a lot of good work out of mining the game's past.\nWe also found some new things to do.\nGifting, Rooms, and start your engines! were core elements of the sets they appeared in. Each of those mechanics explored a new space, doing things we hadn't done before. Magic design should always use the tools in our toolbox when making new sets, but it's okay to make new tools as we need them.\nWe're getting pretty good at making Limited environments.\nA common response from the sets this year was how much players enjoyed the Limited environments of these sets. We're constantly adapting and improving our technology to make fun Limited environments, and I feel this last year was part of an upward trend in this area.\nLessons\nMagic is at its best when we recontextualize the tropes we're working with.\nResonance is an important part of design. When we explore new themes, there are certain expectations that it's important for us to hit in our card designs, but we need to be careful that we're doing our take on the trope and not just repeating it without any filter. Universes Beyond sets are where we should do straight allusions, and not in-Multiverse sets. Both Duskmourn: House of Horror and Aetherdrift suffered from being a bit too on the nose with some of our references.\nWe need to be better at supporting our themes downstream of our designs.\nEach set wants to introduce new mechanical themes. Part of the fun of getting the latest set is exploring new possible decks, but while we're good at creating new places to explore, we need to be a little better at following it up beyond that set. If you built an Otter deck in Bloomburrow or a Vehicle deck in Aetherdrift, for instance, future sets didn't add much for you to expand the deck with. This kind of set-over-set mechanical cohesion is easier said than done, as there are a lot of new themes to follow up on, and each new set has limitations necessary for it to deliver its own themes, but it is something we should spend more time on.\nWe need to be aware of complexity creep\nWhile we've been working to make sure that individual mechanics are less complex overall, there's a trend in the last year of us making the sets complex in mechanical interaction. Some of this is in the volume of mechanics we include and some of this is about the choice of mechanics. The tricky part is that we want mechanical synergy\u2014as it leads to better limited gameplay and constructed deck building\u2014but we need to be careful that we don't make an interconnected web that prevents the average player from being able to track what's happening.\nBloomburrow\nHighlights\nThe interconnection of the worldbuilding, creative design, game design, and artwork was a homerun.\nAll of our various teams at Wizards are talented, but sometimes the pieces of a set come together to create something far more powerful than the sum of its parts. Bloomburrow was one such set. All the various choices made from worldbuilding to names to flavor text to art to card mechanics blended seamlessly to make a truly amazing new world, one that both explored things Magic had never done, yet also felt at its core, like something the game could have done thirty years ago. It was a combination of familiarity and innovation, something that's pretty tricky to pull off well.\nThe mechanics were flavorful and fun.\nThe two mechanics that got the most callouts were offspring and gift. Offspring did the perfect job of being useful and synergistic while also being cute and flavorful. We made the choice to have each offspring get its own creature token, and that was a huge hit. Gift was popular for creating a new resource, one that Magic hasn't done much with. Giving something to another player, alongside being another slam-dunk flavor win, captured the whimsy of the genre, ended up being a very interesting political tool in multiplayer. The animal classes playing into village tropes, the seasons making use of paw prints, the various animal-centric abilities (forage, valiant, and expend) all reinforced the set's core theme, animals, in a way that made players quite happy.\nThe mechanical animal themes were beloved.\nThe Rabbits felt like Rabbits and the Frogs felt like Frogs. Bloomburrow had to deliver animal resonance, and it did in a big way. This might seem like an easy thing to do, but it's not. You see, typal themes are a thorn in the side of R&D. They're both widely popular and near impossible to do well. Constructed wants complete linearity in the typal themes, while Limited requires interconnectivity between archetypes. For instance, you want your Rabbit to reward you for playing other Rabbits, while also being a card that players not playing Rabbit typal will draft. Bloomburrow did our best job to date at toeing this line. If you want to draft Rabbits, you can. If you want to not draft a specific animal, you can. Having those two things co-exist, while still capturing the feel of the set, is a huge win.\nLessons\nFor some, the limited themes were too on rails.\nA lot of time and energy were spent in design making sure your Rabbit deck could include a Bird or Frog, but that's one of the challenges of strong linear themes. It loudly communicates what players are supposed to do, and if enough players follow those cues, it becomes the reality of the draft. While I feel Bloomburrow is the best typal set we've designed, that doesn't mean it's solved all the problems of typal sets. The number one complaint I got about the set was its draft was too \"on rails.\" Once you commit to drafting a certain animal, players felt the options available to them lessened too quickly. The big challenge for the next typal set will be how to communicate \"play Rabbits\" without communicating \"play only Rabbits.\"\nThere wasn't the right mix of animals\nFor some, ten animals were too many. Ten different factions, each with their own animal, caused a complex web that was too hard to decipher. We should have just had five animal factions. For others, ten animals weren't enough. The joy of an animal world is the variety of animals. Limiting each archetype to one animal was too limiting. Factions should have been about something that could group together numerous animals. While every animal had its fans, there was always an animal players would have preferred instead. Some would have preferred Badgers instead of Raccoons, Skunks instead of Bats, or Turtles instead of Frogs. The list goes on and on. Some players felt we didn't need to have Mice, Rats, and Squirrels. A big part of the success of Bloomburrow is the connection so many players have to animals, but the connections people have, while strong, are not consistent.\nThere was some disappointment with the mechanical execution on some of the animals.\nBirds, which all flew in this set, had a \"nonflying matters\" theme, which contradicted the desire for an all-Birds deck. We did it to make the Bird draft archetype work, but it flew in the face of expectations for Bird typal constructed decks. Otters weren't powerful enough and thus didn't see constructed play. Mice were too powerful and did see constructed play, but now many players are sick of seeing them. The Rats felt off to some and didn't play well with many Rats of yesteryear. In general, everyone liked the broad strokes of what was going on in the set, but everyone had quibbles with some details.\nToo many of the animals we focused on don't have enough cards.\nCommander is both currently the most popular tabletop format, and the most popular casual format. An animal theme is very appealing to casual players. But too many of the animals in Bloomburrow simply don't have enough cards to make a viable Commander deck. Some wished we had chosen animals with more backwards compatibility. Others wanted us to focus more on the ones that didn't have enough cards to allow us to make more. Creating new themes while also supporting a hundred card singleton format is an ongoing challenge that we have to work through. Some of this can be handled over time if we repeat themes, but it's a long-term answer to a short-term problem.\nDuskmourn: House of Horror\nHighlights\nThe overall feel of the plane was big success.\nWhen we first announced the existence of Duskmourn: House of Horror, there was a lot of worry about it. We already had a popular horror plan in Innistrad. What was Duskmourn going to offer that Innistrad didn't? It also was playing around with more modern tropes. Would that feel like Magic? There was a lot of skepticism, so we made the decision to release the Planeswalker's Guide earlier than normal, to let players see our concept for a plane that was a haunted house and the evil being that created it. Players loved it. It had its own distinct feel yet felt like an organic part of the Multiverse. There was one big exception to this, which I'll get to below.\nThe mechanics led to fun synergies and an amazing Limited format.\nThe enchantment theme, Rooms, manifest dread, eerie, the return of delirium, impending, glimmers, survival, overlords, and the way it all interacted with the graveyard was a huge success. The set was more bold mechanically than any other set of the year. It had amazing worldbuilding, complemented with outstanding art direction. It all came together to both make what many players called their favorite Limited set of the year, and it had a big impact on Constructed formats.\nAlso, I should specifically call out Rooms as that's the mechanical element I got the most compliments on.\nThe contrast to Bloomburrow showcased what makes Magic so great.\nMagic likes to \"push the pendulum\" as I like to say, that is we like to keep going to places we haven't just been. One of the exciting parts of being a trading card game like Magic, is our ability to be so many different things. Part of expressing that is our constant change in worlds, but never before have we created a contrast so extreme as Bloomburrow into Duskmourn: House of Horror (leading many to call it Gloomburrow). Many players leaned into this pretty stark shift with glee, and it led to a lot of fun community building. Many called this Magic's \"Barbenheimer\" moment.\nLessons\nThe 80's horror theme was forced into the set in a way that distracted from the overall vibe.\nThere's a fine line between being inspired by something and being a carbon copy of it. While the players mostly loved the haunted house vibe of the world, they were not happy with the allusions to popular horror movies that neither had a Magic take on them nor felt like they fit the larger feel of the plane. The harshest criticisms were for many of the Survivors that felt out of place in the set, most of which were loudly alluding to specific 70's/80's horror films. If we could go back, revising about ten to fifteen cards would have alleviated the major concern of the set for most players.\nPlayers have some issues with one of the set's creative choices.\nThis set consciously pushed into some space Magic had never gone before. Many were popular, but one area got the most criticism. Players, it seems, are not fans of what I'm going to call \"mundane modernity.\" Magic has had many sets, such as Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty and The Brothers' War which push into more of a science-fiction feel, with items far more technically advanced than one would normally find in a fantasy story. That doesn't generally bother many players. Some things Duskmourn: House of Horror did for the first time bothered players, like having characters wearing and using things that we actually use: things like sneakers, or jeans, or a baseball bat. Part of fantasy is the idea that you're coming to a world that is fundamentally different than your own. Fantasy wants to be inspirational, and seeing everyday objects which are a part of all of our daily lives deflates that.\nThe set had a little too much going on.\nThe enchantment theme, Rooms, manifest dread, eerie, the return of delirium, impending, glimmers, survival, overlords, and just the whole way it all interacted with a graveyard theme was a huge success, but it was also a lot. For some players, it was too much, and that's something we have to be careful with. While I'm not sure what exactly I'd take out if we were doing the set again, I'm pretty sure I'd take at least one thing out. Maybe two.\nMagic: The Gathering Foundations\nHighlights\nFoundations was what a core set should be.\nAs I often talk about, Magic's greatest challenge is its \"barrier to entry\". Getting from being someone that knows nothing about the game to being able to play your first game of Magic with confidence is a pretty big gap. We've spent years trying to figure out the secret to creating the best on-ramp to the game. Foundations took a new approach to this, one which players have responded well to. Rather than try to simplify things, to make learning easier, Foundationsaspired to excite new players. Yes, this isn't the easiest game to learn, but Foundations strived to show you why it's so exciting so that you'll want to learn.\nFoundations did a great job making this sales pitch, using its card selection, reprints and new cards, to show off all the cool things Magic has to offer. This involved highlighting a lot of cool creative elements and deciduous mechanics. It leaned into its complexity as a feature, not a bug. And the response to this has been spectacular.\nThe set has great card choices.\nThe Foundations design team asked everyone at Wizards, \"what existing cards got you excited most about Magic?\" It took all that data and found the reprints that it felt would make the most exciting set. Part of this was also the decision to make Foundations an evergreen set that would be in Standard for at least five years. This resulted in excitement from the fans, and a set that many have dubbed \"classic Magic\".\nIt was \"meat-and-potatoes\" Magic.\nWhile the set didn't shy away from the complexity of what Magic has to offer, it did figure out how to make a set that captured the core experience of Magic without being something that would overwhelm new players. The choices leaned into intuition and flavor, allowing the cards to work the way players would expect them to work, making a play experience that is welcoming and comforting.\nLessons\nSome players were nervous about certain cards being legal for five years.\nWhile the choice to make Foundations legal for five years did a lot to show our commitment to the new product line, some of our card choices are creating some concern. The two concerns that players communicated to me the most were Llanowar Elves and Omniscience. The former might warp Standard in ways that could cause issues, while the latter might lead to broken decks.\nSome players felt the set didn't go far enough.\nWhile the set has mechanics like kicker and cycling and landfall, there are other deciduous things like Sagas and Vehicles that didn't make the cut. Some players felt like the set could have pushed a little more in showing off the coolest parts of the game. I'll admit I'm a little skeptical, as there's a lot already in the set, but I'm willing for us to examine if there are swaps to be made when we refresh Foundations years from now (Sagas are pretty cool).\nThe Limited format was a bit tame compared to other drafts.\nWhile we feel all randomized boosters should have a limited environment, Foundations put limited concerns lower on their priority list than most sets. This resulted in a Limited environment that doesn't have the depth that more enfranchised drafters are used to.\nAetherdrift\nHighlights\nPlayers enjoyed having Vehicles as a mechanical focus for a set.\nKaladesh introduced Vehicles as a new artifact subtype. We'd talked about wanting a way to represent vehicles for many years, and we finally found a set where it made sense. They were popular enough, and captured such perfect flavor, that Vehicles did something that doesn't happen often, it became immediately deciduous, almost evergreen. Many sets these days include at least a Vehicle or two. With the exception of the Kaladesh block, Vehicles have also played a supporting role in sets, so many players enjoyed getting to have a set where Vehicles could shine. They also enjoyed saddle, which brought the feel of Vehicles to Mounts. Saddle had been introduced in Outlaws of Thunder Junction, but Aetherdrift gave saddle, Mounts, and Vehicles a focus.\nStart your engines! created an interesting Limited environment.\nInnovation gets harder as Magic ages. We've done a lot of mechanics, so it's tricky to find something new to care about that plays well. Start your engines! and speed gave Aetherdrift Limited a focus very uniquely its own, something a lot of Limited players enjoyed. I did get a lot of comments that players wished start your engines! had a more universal name, like accelerate, that would allow it to be used outside the context of a race. Players also wished there were more rewards for reaching lower speed levels.\nGetting to see three different planes in one set was nice.\nAetherdrift was what we called a \"travelogue set\". Making use of the Omenpaths, we created an expansion that was set not on one world, but three. Many players enjoyed that it let us catch up with the planes of Avishkar and Amonkhet. There was a lot of worldbuilding done to show how the events of the Phyrexian invasion, among other incidents, reshaped these planes. It also demonstrated how the existence of Omenpaths was impacting how the planes were evolving and interacting with one another. Players also enjoyed that we got to visit a new world, Muraganda, that we'd only seen glimpses of before. I've gotten a lot of requests for a new set that takes place exclusively on Muraganda.\nLessons\nPlayers preferred more emphasis on the planes and less on the race.\nPlayers liked seeing the three planes. In fact, the biggest complaint regarding the creative was that not enough time was spent focused on the planes themselves. So much of the set was focused on the race, and the majority of players seemed far less interested in the race than getting a chance to explore Avishkar, Amonkhet, and Muraganda.\nHaving three planes and ten racing teams, many from other settings, spread things too thin.\nThis issue was made worse by the fact that so many cards were focused on the racers, many of which were from brand-new settings. Three planes in one set was already stretching things a bit thin, so the addition of all the racing teams muddied things even more. Most players who commented on the race teams wished that we just had race teams from the three planes we were visiting. Others said that if they had to be from other planes than the ones in the race, they should be from places we already knew, so there was less worldbuilding that had to go on in the creative elements of those cards.\nThe racing theme in general wasn't well received.\nAetherdrift played into a lot of the criticisms of last year's sets where the set seemed more about focusing on specific tropes than bringing a world to life. While Duskmourn: House of Horror had some complaints about the survivors and some individual card concepts, the general sense was that the plane still had a lot of space to shine. Aetherdrift was mostly about a race that not enough players cared about. There were a number of players, though, that enjoyed seeing Chandra and Nissa's story get more focus.\nThe set was a bit on the weak side and didn't offer a lot for constructed.\nThe other big problem with Aetherdrift was the major themes of the set didn't \"land\" in Constructed formats. The fault for this wasn't set design or play design but rather vision design. We were trying something new. Vehicles were always a support mechanic, and we tried making it a focus for a set. It turns out there's a reason certain themes work better as support. Start your engines! was also us pushing into new space, one that didn't really end up working out for constructed. I'm not sorry we tried, as part of design's job is to push into new areas and attempt things we haven't tried before. But not everything will work out and Aetherdrift ended up being, in my mind, a noble, but failed, experiment.\nTarkir: Dragonstorm\nHighlights\nWe did a good job hitting our theme of \"best of both worlds.\"\nThe number one piece of feedback I got about the set was how excited everyone was to be back on Tarkir. It turns out when you take your time returning to a world, a lot of good will gets built up for the return. One of the biggest challenges of this set was we were actually returning to two different worlds (one about wedge clans, and one about Dragons) and it was important we made a set that focused on both those aspects. The feedback was that we did, and we did it well.\nWe did a great job of flavoring the clans, creatively and mechanically.\nA big part of doing that was capturing the clans. Players liked that we refocused them on their center enemy colors, giving the clans a fresh spin. They enjoyed the various clan mechanics. They liked the synergy between the clans. They enjoyed all the work the creative team did give them a new look. They enjoyed the new Spirit Dragons. All in all, we delivered well on Tarkir's wedge clans.\nWe're getting better at doing three-color.\nThree-color, like typal, is one of those themes that players enjoy conceptually, that's just really hard to execute on. The original Khans of Tarkir (due to a lot of work by Erik Lauer) is considered the first time R&D really handled three-color design well. It has become the model all three-color sets have used since. Erik oversaw this set's vision design (one of his last tasks before retiring) and helped take our three-color design to the next level, making use of design tools like two-brid mana. I got a lot of feedback appreciating the nuance of how the set was built, and the gameplay that resulted from it.\nLessons\nPlayers really wish we had found a way to get the Dragonlords in the set.\nWhen we last left Tarkir, there were Dragonlords ruling over ally-colored factions. Upon our return, we fast forwarded the story to get to three-color clans. A lot of players were sad that we breezed by the story of how two-color clans became three-color clans. How exactly did the Dragonlords fall? Because the set was focused on wedges and the Dragonlords were ally-colored creatures, a misfit for a wedge set (wedge sets use two-color enemy pairs as those overlap two wedges), there wasn't a good home for them. This upset a lot of players that really wanted us to find a place for them in the set. I'm not sure there's a good answer for this one, but I want to acknowledge that this was, by far, the number one complaint I got about the set. The fact that we repeated the clan leaders and Spirit Dragons in the Commander decks only reinforced the idea for many that there must have been a way to fit the Dragonlords in.\nLimited drifted to the two extremes.\nAs Tarkir draft settled, there ended up being two basic strategies: play red-white aggro or play a green-based four- or five-color strategy. In short, the best thing to do in Limited in this three-color set was not play three colors. This gets back to the core problem of three-color sets. If the mana is too tight, three-color play has too much variance as the power of your hand is based on what land you draw. If the mana is too loose, you play the best cards of every color and end up playing four or five colors. Once you do the latter, it's hard for any archetype to pick up its own best cards, because so many other drafters are splashing for them.\nOmen spells looked too much like Adventure spells.\nPlayers, in general, liked the gameplay of Omens. The biggest note about them is because they looked a lot like Adventures, players wanted to play them as such. The reason Omens shuffle themselves into your library was to allow the designers to make the Dragons stronger, which is important in a set about Dragons. This is another problem without a good solution, as we want to expand with \"extra spell\" mechanics, but there's only so much flexibility in card frame design.\nMagic: The Gathering\u2014FINAL FANTASY\nHighlights\nThe flavor of capturing the FINAL FANTASY video games was a slam dunk.\nThe number one job of any Universes Beyond set is to capture the flavor of the property it's presenting. The biggest compliments I got on this set is that it did an amazing job of capturing the essence of FINAL FANTASY. It was clear the designers who made the set loved the video games, and that love and attention to detail is on full display in the set.\nThe mechanics were evocative and fun.\nThe set doesn't just look good. It plays well. The design team did a good job of figuring out how to use Magic mechanics in a way that converted the fun of playing FINAL FANTASY games to Magic. All the mechanics got called out, but the three I heard the most about were Saga creatures, job select, and tiered. Each did an ideal job of capturing the essence of an aspect of FINAL FANTASY.\nThe Limited environment was super fun, even for players who weren't fans of the video games.\nAnother comment I got a lot from players who were unfamiliar with the FINAL FANTASY franchise was that the gameplay, especially in Limited, was just really fun. Even if you didn't recognize what the cards were referencing, the core gameplay of the set was just entertaining. And there were a lot of cards players wanted to put into their decks.\nLessons\nNot everything players wanted in the set got captured.\nThe biggest complaint I got from fans of FINAL FANTASY was that there was something that they adored from the franchise that didn't make it to a card. A corollary to this was a common complaint that the sets weren't even in their distribution of the sixteen games. Some players felt that the four games that got Commander decks should have had fewer cards in the main set.\nThe creative was less cohesive than other Universes Beyond sets.\nThe biggest note I got from players who were unfamiliar with the FINAL FANTASY franchise was that the creative design of the set felt less cohesive than other Universes Beyond sets. This was due to the fact that most Universes Beyond sets are presenting a single setting, where FINAL FANTASY was representing sixteen distinct worlds. I did get a lot of compliments that cards said what game they were from.\nThe bonus sheet had some layout issues.\nPlayers generally liked the bonus sheet as it related to card selection, card availability, and its impact on limited formats, but some had issues with how it was laid out. It was hard to tell what colors many cards were and the print was often difficult to read.\nThere are ongoing complaints about Universes Beyond sets.\nAs this is the only randomized Universes Beyond product I'm talking about today (I sadly didn't have space to discuss Magic: The Gathering\u00ae \u2013 Assassin's Creed\u00ae), I'm using this section to go over much of the feedback about Universes Beyond in general.\nThere are still players that don't like that we're doing Universes Beyond, although that sentiment continually shrinks over time. For example Magic: The Gathering\u2014FINAL FANTASY is already the best-selling Magic set of all time and it just came out. Some players don't mind Universes Beyond sets in general, but they feel at home in Magic's fantasy setting. Some players are unhappy that we're including Universes Beyond sets in Standard. Some are unhappy that Universes Beyond booster packs cost more on average than Magic Multiverse booster packs.\nAnother Year Gone By\nThat wraps up the last year of Magic design. I'm always happy to have a chance to go through it and review all the feedback I received on the last year's worth of sets. Thanks to everyone who took time to give me feedback. For those that would like to give me even more feedback, I'm curious what you thought of this article and any of the observations I made. You can email me or contact me through social media (Bluesky, Tumblr, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter).\nUntil then, may you have as much fun playing Magic as we do making it."

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Magic: The Gathering\u2018s new Final Fantasy set is an absolute love letter to the beloved RPG series, with hundreds of cards making a flavorful nod to their source material in one way or another. But one of the most fun references in a set filled with them almost didn\u2019t make it in\u2014thanks to a quibble between Wizards of the Coast and Square Enix\u2019s translation teams.\nIn a fascinating new article about translating the Final Fantasy set for its English and Japanese-language versions shared on the official Magic website today, Joseph Leis, the program manager for the Final Fantasy set, explained some of the challenges facing translating several cards in the set to ensure the standards of Magic\u2018s usual international translation process, while also working with Square Enix and its own translations for Final Fantasy as a franchise.\nBut one of the most intriguing examples concerns one of the most fun nods to Final Fantasy fandom\u2019s western history that almost didn\u2019t make it in: the Final Fantasy VI card, Suplex. Or, at least in the form that Final Fantasy VI fans would\u2019ve wanted it to.\nA red mana sorcery card, Suplex in the set can either be used to deal three damage to a target creature (with the added bonus of exiling them if it destroys it), or exiling a target artifact card from play. This second rule is a specific synergy so that Suplex can target another card in the game, the black mana artifact Phantom Train. It\u2019s a reference to the memetic legacy of FFVI players realizing that Sabin the monk, one of the game\u2019s expansive party members, can use one of his special abilities, Suplex, to physically hoist up the giant demon locomotive and slam it back down in an absurd image, dealing a ton of damage.\nIn the years since its release, and especially in the advent of the online age, Sabin suplexing a literal train has become a part of Final Fantasy meme culture. But the thing is, Suplex wasn\u2019t called Suplex in the original Japanese game. It was called Meteor Strike (or specifically \u201c\u30e1\u30c6\u30aa\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u201d in katakana) back when Final Fantasy VI was first brought over to North America as Final Fantasy III (several games in the series initially missed being translated), a name that Square Enix has kept ever since. While the original translation remained for many FFVI ports, it took until 2022 when the game was re-released as part of the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster collection for the official translation to be updated to Meteor Strike.\nSo Wizards and Square Enix found themselves at a bit of an impasse. Where possible, Wizards prefers that translation and localizations of card names diverge as little as possible from the English-language originals: Magic sets are typically designed in English first, and then translated into various languages, but the Final Fantasy set was the first in the game\u2019s history to be developed in English and Japanese simultaneously. Square Enix wanted to keep the Meteor Strike name as the official translation of Sabin\u2019s move as that\u2019s what was it always was in Japanese, but Wizards argued that English-language fans who played VI as kids would be disappointed if the card wasn\u2019t called Suplex as tribute to the nostalgic place the fight has taken in western fandom culture.\n\u201cThis was something that principle narrative designer Dillon Deveney went back and forth through multiple rounds of negotiations with Square Enix,\u201d Leis said, \u201cexplaining how important that scene and the name \u2018Suplex\u2019 would be to English-speaking Final Fantasy VI fans, how kids growing up would yell \u2018suplex!\u2019 at the top of their lungs while playing at the playground, and how the nostalgia of the term was something that he wanted to keep as an Easter egg for English-speaking Final Fantasy VI fans.\u201d\nThankfully, Square Enix eventually relented, and a rare divergence between the English and Japanese sets allowed Suplex and Meteor Strike to co-exist. Now you can exile that one particular artifact to your heart\u2019s content, in the exact way you\u2019d want to.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Hasbro\u2019s no stranger to giving credit where credit\u2019s due when a video game helps save its ass financially, having already made plenty of to-do about how the blockbuster success of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 a few years ago provided a surge of interest in D&D. Now it\u2019s thanking a video game of a different sort: the Final Fantasy saga, as its recent highly anticipated crossover with Magic: The Gathering has helped make the most successful set of the card game made so far.\nAccording to Deadline, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks touted on an earnings call today that sales of the Final Fantasy set, released just over a month ago, helped account for a 23% surge in Magic sales in the last quarter, helping the toymaker offset a $1 billion write-down to account for ongoing tariff-induced uncertainty from retailers, leading to a flat adjusted operating profit for the quarter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more people playing Magic, and there are more people who have never played Magic who are now playing Magic, than ever before,\u201d Cox noted.\nThe Final Fantasy set has been a subject of controversy even with its massive success and praise for the ways Wizards of the Coast integrated references and mechanics from the legendary RPG series into the Magic format. The first of the \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d crossover sets to be legal for play in Magic\u2018s standard format, before its release, Final Fantasy came to represent concerns from players that Magic was giving too much ground over to licensed crossovers instead of focusing on its original creative storytelling.\nThe surge of interest in the set\u2019s reveal also led to a rush on pre-orders, making trying to even get your hands on cards at their suggested retail prices a challenge\u2014especially the set\u2019s premium collector-focused booster packs, with aftermarket prices breaking over a thousand dollars at MagicCon Las Vegas for a box of cards meant to \u201conly\u201d sell for $455. Now, even as player interest switches focus to the upcoming release of Edge of Eternities on August 1st, Final Fantasy packs are still tough to come by.\nAll that controversy matters little to Hasbro\u2019s bottom line, so \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d is going to be here to stay. After Edge of Eternities, the first entirely sci-fi/sci-fantasy-themed Magic set, this year will see the release of two more major crossover sets in the form of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man in late September, and Avatar: The Last Airbender in November. And even though Edge returns to Magic\u2018s own storytelling, its mechanics seem ripe for being adapted for the arrival of some pretty hefty franchises among the stars\u2014ones Hasbro at large is already well acquainted with.\n\u201cComing up, we have Spider-Man, Star Wars, and Avengers: Doomsday,\u201d Cocks noted on the earnings call, referring more broadly to Hasbro\u2019s toy licenses rather than necessarily any specific plans for Magic (although we know there are indeed more Marvel sets on the way after Spider-Man). \u201cThat alone is a pretty stacked lineup and pretty meaningful top-line growth across our Marvel portfolio.\u201d\nSo maybe don\u2019t be too surprised if the toymaker finds a way to oust Final Fantasy from its current throne as Magic\u2018s most popular set in the not-too-distant future.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Today one of the biggest sets in Magic: The Gathering\u2018s recent history makes its grand arrival at last: Final Fantasy, the first of Magic\u2018s at-times-controversial \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d crossovers with other franchises to be given the full standard-legal treatment. It\u2019s a marriage of two of gaming\u2019s most beloved fantasy realms, and with absolute legions of fans of both Magic and Final Fantasy to please, it has to hit the highlights and mechanical flavoring of 16 mainline game\u2019s worth of viable cards. From everything we\u2019ve seen of the set in the run up to today\u2019s release, it looks like Wizards of the Coast and Square Enix helped build a match made in (seventh) heaven\u2014but here\u2019s some of our favorite nods to Final Fantasy\u2018s vast legacy that we love most from the set.\nNaturally, some of these references are about key major story points in their respective Final Fantasy titles. If you\u2019re not caught up with the 16 mainline games that have released over the past four decades, well, consider yourself very lightly spoiler warned here.\nTiered Spells Are a Perfect Blend of Final Fantasy and Magic\nOne of the new mechanical additions the Final Fantasy set brings to Magic is the \u201cTiered\u201d rule: if a player pays an additional cost to the card\u2019s initial mana cost, they can select from one of three tiers of power. More mana means more effects\u2014just like how in Final Fantasy a lot of magic spells have three evolutionary steps: their base form, a more potent version of that form with the suffix -ara, and then its most powerful form with the suffix -aga.\nThe tiered spells in the set are spread across two different forms: some are given to represent various limit break attacks from Final Fantasy VII, reflecting the party\u2019s ability to develop stronger special attacks over the course of the game. But the ones that represent some of Final Fantasy\u2018s elemental and restorative magics are each smartly attuned to the color identities they\u2019re assigned to in Magic. Aggressive fire and thunder magics are assigned to red; ice, which instead of doing damage bounces cards back into an opponents hands or libraries, is assigned to blue, which reflects that color\u2019s archetypal focus on interruption and control mechanics. It\u2019s a very neat way to mechanically marry a Final Fantasy player\u2019s understanding of the series\u2019 base magic system to a Magic player\u2019s understanding of its own colors\u2019 archetypes and escalatory effects.\nSuplex the Train, Dammit\nSuplex, renamed to Meteor Strike in later versions of Final Fantasy VI, is one of the many martial abilities of Sabin the Monk, letting him\u2026 well, pick an enemy up and flip them in the air to slam them straight back down. But while Sabin can use the move on a great number of VI\u2018s big creatures, the most infamous victim of the attack\u2014spurring years of internet meme history\u2014is the fact that he can use it when the party encounters the Phantom Train after Sabin, Cyan, and Shadow flee the Empire\u2019s invasion of Doma. The Phantom Train is, of course, a spectral haunted steam train, so it\u2019s very absurd that Sabin can just pick it up and suplex it like it\u2019s no big deal.\nSuplex gets its own card as a sorcery in Magic, which lets you do three damage to a creature\u2014pretty basic. Except, a player who plays Suplex could instead use its second ability, which allows it to specifically exile an artifact card. You know what\u2019s an artifact in the Final Fantasy set? The Phantom Train.\nLightning\u2019s Stagger\nFF XIII\u2018s protagonist has several cards to her name in the set, but Lightning, Army of One has several cool mechanical nods to XIII\u2018s battle system. The first is that \u201cArmy of One\u201d suffix, a reference to Lightning\u2019s powerful combo attack of that name in the game\u2014an aggression that is symbolically matched in the card by giving her several offensive keywords like Trample (which lets her deal excess damage from combat directly to a player) and First Strike (which lets her deal damage before anyone else resolves damage in combat).\nBut it\u2019s Lightning, Army of One\u2019s other rule that is the neater reference: she has Stagger, a nod to the mechanic of the same name in XIII that lets the party deal bonus damage to an opponent once they\u2019ve maxed out its stagger gauge through steady, repeated attacks for a brief period of time. In Magic, it lets any other creature that attacks Lightning\u2019s target, whether it\u2019s another creature or a player, take double damage for the rest of the turn. Same hat!\nSephiroth Yearns to Kill Aerith\nOne of the most infamous moments in the original Final Fantasy VII is Sephiroth\u2019s murder of Aerith as she prays in the City of Ancients. Like the synergy between Suplex and Phantom Train before it, Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier and Aerith have a synergy that grimly reflects his fated killing: Aerith\u2019s rules let her gain +1/+1 counters every time you gain life, and Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier gives you life every time another creature dies. The fourth time that effect happens, you can flip Sephiroth over, transforming him into his powerful One Winged Angel form.\nBut he can also sacrifice any card, including one of your own, every time he attacks. Which, more often than not, triggers \u201cdies\u201d as a mechanic, advancing Sephiroth closer to his transformation\u2026 and Aerith herself has a special rule that, when she dies, her accrued +1/+1 tokens can be given to all Legendary Creatures you have in play. So, if you have them both in play, Sephiroth can sacrifice Aerith for his fourth trigger, transforming, and then reap the benefits of all the +1/+1 tokens Aerith had built up from his attacking. It\u2019s mean! And very flavorful.\nOr you could just play Sephiroth\u2019s Intervention, a black Instant that destroys any target creature, if you just want to kill an Aerith for funsies.\nFinal Fantasy XIV\u2018s Final Days\nOne of the biggest pieces of background lore in the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV is the \u201cFinal Days,\u201d a cataclysmic apocalypse that happened thousands of years in the past that saw the world of Etheirys, the realm of a precursor race called the Ancients, break into 14 shards during a battle between the gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn in an attempt to stall the Final Days\u2019 arrival. Much of Final Fantasy XIV takes place on the primary of those reflective shards, the Source, while some of its expansions have seen players travel to the worlds of other shards, like Shadowbringers.\nThis event comes up in several poignantly thematic cards in the Magic set. Zodiark, Umbral God sees a player sacrifice half of the creatures they control, as a reference to the sacrifice the Ancients made to summon Zodiark and delay the Final Days in the first place. Meanwhile, Emet-Selch, Unsundered\u2014one of the few surviving Ancients, haunted by his desire to restore the world to what it was in his lifetime\u2014can transform into his godlike form of Hades once 14 cards enter your graveyard, and can play cards from your graveyard once he\u2019s done so.\nPhoenix Down Can Heal\u2026 and Harm\nPhoenix Down is an iconic item from across Final Fantasy, the simple revival medicine that lets you bring back a dead party member in battle. In Magic, it can only bring back cards from your graveyard with a mana value of four or less, reflective of its relatively basic form of restorative magic. But even better is the fact that it has a second ability: you can use it to exile undead creatures, a nod to the fact that healing items in Final Fantasy can be used on undead enemies to do damage instead.\nFear the Tonberry\nTonberries may look oddly cute with the dainty little knife and their big yellow eyes, but every Final Fantasy player knows that these green critters mean business once they get close to you. In most of their appearances, Tonberries take several turns of combat to slowly inch towards your party\u2014and once they do, they instantly kill you in a single attack with their chef\u2019s knife. This is wonderfully translated into Magic with a mix of two mechanics: a Tonberry enters play tapped and with a stun counter on it, which means it takes two player turns to be ready to attack. Once it does attack though, it has First Strike and Deathtouch, meaning no matter how much damage it does to a creature, it will always do lethal damage.\nGaluf\u2019s Sacrifice\nGaluf\u2019s death fighting Exdeath in Final Fantasy V is one of the game\u2019s most iconic moments, made all the more bittersweet by the fact his abilities are passed onto his granddaughter Krile, who joins the party in his stead. That inheritance is naturally reflected in Galuf\u2019s Final Act, which not only briefly boosts a creature\u2019s power (a nod to Galuf going all out as he takes on Exdeath 1v1), but lets it pass on +1/+1 tokens equal to its power when it dies.\nFight or Flight\nAn infamous gag moment in Final Fantasy VII comes when the party goes to rescue Aerith from Shinra\u2019s HQ ahead of the climactic escape from Midgar. You\u2019re given a simple choice, in both the original game and in Remake: take the elevator up to the 60th floor, which stops multiple times for a series of fights, or the \u201cquiet\u201d route\u2026 having to control Cloud as he runs up 59 flights of stairs.\nThe Magic card Aerith Rescue Mission encapsulates that choice perfectly: you can either take the elevator, giving you three 1/1 Hero Tokens (representing Cloud, Tifa, and Barrett being ready to fight), or you can take the stairs, which lets you tap and stun up to three creatures (representing their cardio-induced duress).\nThe Cycle of Sin\nFinal Fantasy X is built around the cycle of Sin, a massive creature that rises to cull civilizations that grow too large or too advanced\u2014but whose slaughter can be paused for a period of \u201cCalm\u201d years when a Summoner sacrifices themselves in a final battle against Sin to summon a final aeon capable of defeating Sin\u2026 albeit only temporarily, locking the world in a cycle of destruction.\nThat gets a pretty spot-on mirror in the card Sin, Unending Cataclysm; it not only removes counters from any number of creatures on the battlefield (to represent Sin\u2019s limitation of technological advancement), but also returns to your library when it dies rather than dying, meaning it can\u2019t be conventionally defeated. Its own bonus counters created from removing counters can be given to one of your other creatures\u2026 you know, so Sin can inherit them twice over when it returns.\nChampions From Beyond the Rift, Heed My Call!\nChampions From Beyond is a multilayered reference for Final Fantasy XIV players: the name and the art represents the climactic moments of the Shadowbringers expansion, when the player is aided by Iconic Catboy G\u2019raha Tia, who summons heroes (aka, other players) from across the 14 shards of the world to battle Emet-Selch. That group-content focus is reflected in its rules, which lets you create any number of Hero tokens while also offering bonuses for attacking in either groups of four or eight creatures. Those are references to the two standard group sizes for FF XIV\u2018s multiplayer content: Light Parties, groups of four for standard dungeon content; and Full Parties, groups of eight typically used in more challenging boss fights or endgame raids.\nQuistis\u2019 Blue Magic\nFinal Fantasy has all sorts of different magical archetypes across the series, but Blue Magic is one of its most arcane trademarks in the various schools of color-themed magics. Black Magic is primarily damaging elemental spells, White Magic is healing and support, Red Magic blends the two, while Blue represents an ability to absorb and learn the skills of an enemy opponent. Blue Mages exist across multiple Final Fantasy games, but FF VIII\u2018s Quistis it perhaps one of the most famous. It\u2019s fitting then that not only is she slotted into Magic\u2018s blue color archetype, but that her Blue Magic ability lets her cast spells from any player\u2019s graveyard, be it yours or your opponent: and that she cast them with any mana, regardless of their original cost.\nKain\u2019s Mind Control\nKain Highwind is a fascinating foil in Final Fantasy IV, his lingering jealousy towards FF IV\u2018s main character Cecil making him an easy target for the game\u2019s antagonist, Golbez, to corrupt him and brainwash him multiple times over the course of the story. Kain\u2019s almost-comical ability to be forced into betraying you is delightfully woven into Magic with his card, Kain, Traitorous Dragoon\u2014whenever Kain does damage to another player, they can choose to take control of him and he does mirrored damage to his original owner, meaning that Kain can bounce back and forth between ownership over the course of the game!\nAshe\u2019s Temptation\nA major turning point in Final Fantasy XII comes when Ashe, the exiled princess of the kingdom of Dalmasca, finds herself confronted with a dangerous temptation: fulfill her destiny as Ivalice\u2019s generational ruler and use the power of the almighty crystal called the Sun-Cryst to destroy the Archadian Empire that attacked Dalmasca at the start of the game, or destroy the Sun-Cryst and free Ivalice from the machinations of its creators.\nOn the surface, the Instant Fate of the Sun-Cryst is a pretty typical Magic card, paying five mana to destroy any non-land permanent. But it has a bonus twist: it only costs three mana if you target a tapped creature, ie\u2026 a creature that\u2019s already attacked you. It\u2019s a very flavorful way to incorporate Ashe\u2019s temptation towards revenge.\nOf Course Ignis Cooks\nIgnis\u2019 card just wouldn\u2019t be Ignis if it didn\u2019t include an ability based around cooking. \u201cI\u2019ve Come Up With a New Recipe!\u201d lets a player tap Ignis and pay some mana to exile a card from your graveyard\u2014and if it was a creature, you can create a food token, letting a player regain health. It\u2019s named, of course, for Ignis\u2019 meme-worthy repeated catchphrase from Final Fantasy XV: the party\u2019s cook whenever they camped, Ignis could learn various recipes throughout XV to grant the party various buffs and status effects when they rested. Specifying the bonus for exiling a creature is itself a cute reference to the fact that Ignis can cook various meals from the materials you get from killing creatures across XV\u2018s world, to boot.\nA Smile Better Suits a Hero\nMultiple cards throughout the Final Fantasy set give new themed art to already established Magic cards. Relic of Legends, a simple mana-generating artifact introduced in Dominaria United, is one of them, but its inclusion in the Final Fantasy XIV-themed Commander Deck, Scions & Spellcraft, is given a painful twist. The relic of legend in the new art refers to a traumatic sacrifice from Heavensward, XIV\u2018s first expansion, when one of your allies in the kingdom of Ishgard, Haurchefant Greystone, attempts to deflect a magical attack intended to strike the hero\u2026 only for his shield to buckle and for the strike to run him through instead, killing him. Cue the waterworks!\nIfrit vs. Titan\nClash of the Eikons refers to one of the standout moments of the latest mainline Final Fantasy, XVI, in which protagonist Clive Rosfield, transformed into the almighty summon Ifrit, scraps with rival summon Titan in an epic battle. Aside from looking as cool as the fight in XVI does, this sorcery lets you manipulate the amount of lore counters on a Saga card under your control: the card archetype that represents Final Fantasy\u2018s various summon creatures across the games in the set to reflect their status as powerful, but limited-time forces in battle.\nIt\u2019s not only flavorful in that sense, it\u2019s particularly flavorful to Final Fantasy XVI. The fight between Ifrit and Titan is really the first time that Clive truly comes into his own as Ifrit\u2019s \u201cDominant\u201d, embracing his transformation and pulling out all the stops to defeat Titan\u2014so it\u2019s only fitting that that clash represents the ability to manipulate Sagas in this way!\nThe Warrior of Light Unites All\nThe Warrior of Light is the name of the character created to represent the generic party members of the very first Final Fantasy, who had no set characters and could be given any of the series\u2019 iconic jobs over the course of the game. Now a quasi-mascot of Final Fantasy as a whole, oddly enough the Warrior of Light doesn\u2019t actually have a unique card representing him in the Magic set (he appears on some, but none are specifically centered around him as a character).\nHe is represented, however, on the \u201cThrough The Ages\u201d bonus sheet, a series of cards that reprints classic Magic cards with artwork drawn from across Final Fantasy history, from character concept work to promotional imagery from each game. The Warrior of Light is represented in this set of cards with a reprint of Jodah the Unifier, an iconic card that is popular in Magic\u2018s Commander as a \u201cWURBG\u201d archetype: having a cost that utilizes one mana from each of Magic\u2018s five colors, a deck with Jodah as its Commander can be built out of cards from every color in turn.\nOn top of that, Jodah the Unifier\u2019s abilities are built around synergies with Legendary Creatures and spells, buffing the more of them you have in play and getting more of them in play as quickly as possible. Across the Final Fantasy set most main characters are represented as Legendary Creatures, so it\u2019s fitting that the Warrior of Light can bring together heroes and villains from across the whole series to stand together!\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy! Captain your destiny! For the first time in over a century, our campus will be re-opened to admit individuals a minimum of 16 Earth years (or species equivalent) who dream of exceeding their physical, mental and spiritual limits, who value friendship, camaraderie, honor and devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today! Ex Astris, Scientia!\u201d\nUpcoming (movie): Star Trek: Section 31\nAnnounced as a TV series back in 2019 as a spinoff for fan-favorite Discovery guest star Michelle Yeoh, this plunge into the seediest side of Starfleet\u2014the shadowy spy organization Section 31 first introduced in Deep Space Nine\u2014is now planned as a Paramount+ film.\nNewly minted Oscar winner Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou, now turned into a kinder, but still kickass person by her time with Michael Burnham. \u201cI\u2019m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I\u2019ve loved for so long,\u201d Yeoh said in a statement. \u201cSection 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that\u2019s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can\u2019t wait to share what\u2019s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!\u201d\nWritten by Craig Sweeny and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Section 31 will start production later this year, and eventually come to Paramount+.\nWhere Can I Stream Classic Star Trek Shows?\nThat\u2019s all the new bits of Star Trek coming.

      "text": "A certain Star franchise may have boldly declared space the final frontier, but for Magic: The Gathering, it\u2019s only the beginning. After the huge risk (and ultimate success) of its Final Fantasy set last month, the venerable card game is leaping into another big risk, although this time devoid of any flashy crossover: its next set, Edge of Eternities, will mark Magic\u2018s first proper foray into full-on science fiction.\nThe series has flirted with sci-fi concepts across its fantastical settings for years with factions like the biomechanical Phyrexians or the multiversal eldritch horrors of the Eldrazi\u2014and even dipped its toe more specifically into the genre with the Warhammer 40,000 and Doctor Who crossovers, but Edge of Eternities, set to release next month, will see Magic embrace the stars in ways it never really has before. But even as it goes boldly, the set is doing so with a thoroughly Magic twist.\nEdge of Eternities represents one of Magic\u2018s biggest original storytelling opportunities in recent memory. Rather than playing with a new plane in the multiverse, Edge is going between and beyond the planar concept that has defined generations of Magic lore. Naturally, doing so also requires a lot of setup for the Magic community beyond cards and flavor text: Edge of Eternities\u2018 accompanying fiction will release across 11 story episodes, with five side stories to introduce new worlds, characters, planets, and the tone Magic is taking on as it explores the stars.\nBut while Edge is something entirely new, it is still rooted in the familiar for Magic diehards. The set takes place in the titular realm: the far edge of the Blind Eternities, the void between planes in the multiverse that has been hinted at for years in Magic\u2018s storytelling. \u201cThe metaphor that we\u2019ve been using internally is if the multiverse is an orange, and that the planes that we are aware of are the seeds, the Edge is the peel,\u201d senior story lead for Magic Roy Graham recently explained to press at a briefing for the new set. As the Edge itself is such an expansive and alien branch of Magic\u2018s worldbuilding, Edge of Eternities will act as a formal introduction to the realm by keeping itself focused on a singular system within the region, Sothera.\nFirst teased during Edge\u2018s recent unveiling at MagicCon Las Vegas, the Sothera system is a solar system where its central star has been collapsed into a massive supervoid by a cult of black hole worshippers known as the Monoists. Although rocked by Sothera\u2019s transformation, the system contains five primary planets, each aligned to one of Magic\u2018s mana archetypes. Kavaron represents red mana, Evendo green, Adagia white, Uthros blue, and Susur Secundi, the world closest to Sothera\u2019s new supervoid and the hub of Monoist activity in the system, naturally represents black. Each planet will have representation in Edge\u2018s card set, playing into some of the new mechanics being introduced.\nAcross those five worlds, multiple factions new and old will be introduced\u2014from insectoid terraformers to ancient precursor races, to even hints at familiar Magic factions like the Eldrazi, who\u2019ve long been known to hail from the Blind Eternities. But the set\u2019s main conflict will be spread across three primary groups: Pinnacle, essentially Magic\u2018s stand-in for Star Trek\u2018s Federation and Starfleet, a pan-species governmental and exploratory body that recently incorporated the Sothera system into its territories; the Monoists, who are seeking to complete Sothera\u2019s transformation into a full supervoid; and their ancient foes in the Celestial Palatinate, a holy empire built around a mathematical equation that has been locked in war with the Monoists for eons, who have sent the Solar Knights of the Sunstar Free Company to Sothera in an attempt to reverse the damage done to its dying star.\nBut again, not everything in Edge is brand-new to familiar Magic audiences. For all the new factions at play, there is at least one Planeswalker making a grand return in the set: Tezzeret, returning after the events of the Phyrexian invasion of the multiverse to make his next move. \u201c[Tezzeret] has travelled the vast distance through the Blind Eternities with the help of his Darksteel body all the way to the edge in order to start anew,\u201d Graham teased. \u201cIt\u2019s a realm filled with metal and machines and tools that he can bend to his will.\u201d\nAll that certainly sounds like a big step into tone and territory Magic has only really dipped its toes into before. But for the team behind Edge of Eternities, their approach still felt informed by a lot of what Magic usually does in the realm of fantasy\u2014and they were quick to explain their vision as being still in that realm, just with a science-y twist.\n\u201cWe really wanted to raise this idea of science fantasy,\u201d executive producer Mike Turian explained. \u201cAny time we go to a new plane, a new place, a new world, we\u2019re always looking to say, \u2018hey, how can we connect what\u2019s resonant and awesome about that setting with Magic: The Gathering?\u2019. So for Edge of Eternities, we wanted to go and take a look at what it means to take Magic to outer space, but, for instance, we have Sothera, which is a magical black hole. The word \u2018magical\u2019 there really carries a lot of weight in this idea of science fantasy. At the Edge, magic is not beholden to physics. We\u2019ve got flying whales in outer space\u2014a scientist wouldn\u2019t validate the possibility of this actually existing! And yet this really captures that essence, and we thought, the potential of combining Magic and outer space.\u201d\n\u201c[Edge being too far a leap for Magic] couldn\u2019t be less the case,\u201d Graham added. \u201cThis is an exciting new direction for us; it\u2019s territory we\u2019ve never managed to cover before in Magic. But everything is reflected and redefined, and mirroring the sorts of nuanced storytelling, deep fantasy worldbuilding, and resonant themes that Magic players will always love. It\u2019s being told in this new medium, the art is being interpreted in this out-of-this-world manner, and there are some things we\u2019re doing in the mechanical design and the story and narrative that only really makes sense in the context of a space-fantasy adventure.\u201d\nAs Graham teased, that mix of the familiar and the new is likewise reflected in Edge of Eternities\u2018 mechanical approach to Magic. One returning mechanic for Standard players is the return of legal Shock Lands\u2014dual-type lands that enter play tapped and can be untapped for a life cost. But even Edge\u2018s new mechanics all echo familiar design philosophies, iterating as much as they add.\nOne new mechanic that leans on iterative ideas is Station. Almost akin to the Crew mechanic that played a major role in Aetherdrift, cards with Station can gain new abilities and can transform type once a certain amount of charge counters have been placed on them by tapping other creature cards, gaining a charge token totalling that tapped creature\u2019s power level. In Edge, Station will be tied to two new card subtypes: Planets, which have no unique rules themselves but will all have Station, and Spacecraft, a new thematic vehicle type. The addition of spacecraft in Edge will also mark the first time that any vehicle type, spacecraft included, can be used as a player\u2019s commander in the Commander format, opening up a wide variety of deck-building opportunities.\nAnother is Warp, meant to represent the idea of faster-than-light travel within the Edge. Cards with Warp can pay an alternative, cheaper mana cost to be played, at the expense of being exiled during the next end step. A warped card can be played from exile, interacting with plenty of other standard Magic mechanics, but it can only be warped once\u2014in exchange, you get powerful benefits for their brief time on the battlefield.\nInteracting with Warp, is Void, representing the absence of space. If a card was warped that turn or if a nonland permanent leaves the battlefield, Void can trigger, providing either alternative effects on spells and sorceries, or additional ones on top of their regular effects. The final new mechanic teased to the press was Lander tokens, representing Pinnacle\u2019s mission of planetary exploration. Similar to food or treasure tokens, Landers can be sacrificed to tutor (or search your deck) for basic lands.\nIt was clear looking over what Wizards of the Coast has planned for Edge of Eternities that there was an intriguing parallel to its work on the Final Fantasy set. If that set integrated an outside property into Magic with a reverence and care to represent the very best of what the \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d concept could be for the game, Edge takes a similar approach in incorporating a new genre to Magic\u2018s original storytelling approach. The new worldbuilding is filled with potential for further exploration beyond Edge, drawing plenty of parallels between the new material and what Magic has already played with in similar spaces. Mechanically too, the set is shaping up to capture core tenets of science fiction and science fantasy that feel celebratory of the genres.\nBut especially in the wake of Final Fantasy and its status as one of the most financially successful Magic sets ever, it\u2019s hard not to look at what Edge is doing\u2014sandwiched as it is between huge Universes Beyond releases, with Spider-Man releasing in September\u2014even in the space of Magic\u2018s own storytelling, and feel like this is laying the groundwork for Magic\u2018s next big crossover.\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s great when working on these sets is that we get to be inspired by our players\u2019 expectations,\u201d Turian noted, refusing to be drawn to one particular franchise or another that may have inspired much of what Edge is doing. \u201c[We\u2019re] understanding how people think about outer space, and what it means to them, and we find great ways to incorporate that into our releases.\u201d\nTime will tell if the Edge holds further opportunities for exploration or if something lies even further beyond its universe. Magic: The Gathering \u2013 Edge of Eternities will hit shelves August 1.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "We\u2019re on the cusp of the release of Magic: The Gathering\u2019s next major set, Edge of Eternities, next week, but that didn\u2019t stop Wizards of the Coast from swinging into San Diego Comic-Con to show off its next big crossover: Spider-Man. And in our first major glimpse at what to expect from the set, we got treated to a whole spider-verse of new cards\u2014and, of course, some very nifty comic book-themed variants to get your wallet\u2019s spidey senses tingling.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that transforming cards are going to be the name of the game in Spider-Man, given the plethora of secret identities and alter egos of friends and foes at play here. While seemingly not every Spider-Hero included in the set will get that treatment, major players like Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and Gwen Stacy will all be able to flip between their civilian identities and their hero forms. Another recurring mechanic? Summoning spider tokens\u2014a cute nod to the origins of many a Spider-hero, although in Magic it turns Pete and his friends more into a Spiders-Man than anything else.\nOne new mechanic coming to the set that we know of thanks to these new cards is web-slinging, although it\u2019s more that the flavor is new rather than the actual mechanic. Drawing on a plethora of other quickening mechanics from Magic\u2018s past (and its present, given the arrival of Warp in Edge of Eternities), web-slinging lets a player pay a reduced mana cost for a card at the expense of returning a tapped creature you control back to your hand. Think of it like Spidey using something\u2014in this case, a creature on the battlefield\u2014to zipline into the action with haste! Metaphorical haste, rather than mechanical haste, that is.\nAside from introducing key heroes and villains coming to the set, the new reveals also showcased a host of variant card treatments\u2014although with a slight twist that Spider-Man will be the first crossover set that removes the distinctive triangular border frame that has defined \u201cUniverses Beyond\u201d cards in the past, further enmeshing Magic\u2018s crossover experiences with original sets. Variant treatments for Spider-Man include, of course, stylized webbing frames and comic-panel-inspired alternate art, but also special comics art variants that leverage decades of Marvel Comics artwork\u2014in some instances, turning cards into iconic comic covers, framing their rules text into a front-page spread.\nMagic: The Gathering\u2018s Spider-Man set begins releasing September 26.

      "text": "Magic: The Gathering has been doing crossover packs with various IP, and later this year, Avatar: The Last Airbender is joining those ranks. During this weekend\u2019s MagicCon, Wizards of the Coast showed off its first card from the set dropping in late November.\nNaturally, that card is a Legendary featuring Aang manipulating water, fire, earth, and air while in the Avatar State.

Nia DaCosta (who most recently helmed the revival of Candyman) is directing the film.\nIn the finale of Ms. Marvel season one, Carol Danvers showed up in Kamala Khan\u2019s bedroom, marking the first real tease of the film.

In December, we got a very, very brief tease of season two.\nEcho\nRelease date: November 29, 2023 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from the Hawkeye series will follow Echo, a deaf martial artist, as played by actress Alaqua Cox. Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre.

X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series.

This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?
