      "summary": "Crude oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by progress in US‑Japan and US‑EU trade talks that signal stronger economic growth and energy demand, and a record‑high S&P 500 rally that boosts confidence in the economy.  The rally was tempered by a weaker US manufacturing PMI and a decline in the crack spread, which dampens refinery demand.  Meanwhile, OPEC+ has increased output, but is considering pausing further hikes amid concerns of a supply glut, while Russian oil sanctions and a potential resumption of Kurdish exports add further supply dynamics to the market.",
