  "content": "THE Traitors star Charlotte Chilton has stripped down to a bikini for a sizzling selfie \u2013 just weeks after her explosive paternity row with singer Conor Maynard.\n\nThe reality star, 32, showed off her curves in a plunging two-piece khaki bikini as she beamed at the camera from the pool.\n\nShe whisked herself away to Lanzarote for some sun-soaked downtime and treated fans to a sizzling Instagram snap.\n\nCharlotte looked bronzed and carefree as she relaxed in style.\n\nShe captioned the snap: \"Living my best life\".\n\nHer followers praised her confidence, with many calling her \"beautiful.\"\n\nIt comes after Charlotte hit headlines over her public spat with singer Conor Maynard, who denied being the father of her child.\n\nShe broke her silence after the results of Conor's second paternity test were revealed.\n\nThe warring pair have been at loggerheads ever since their night of passion turned sour when Charlotte revealed she was pregnant - and began an 18-month fight to prove pop star Conor was the dad.\n\nHowever, The Sun revealed that a second paternity test was carried out - and Conor is NOT the baby\u2019s father.\n\nAn insider told us: \u201cCharlotte is shell-shocked by the news.\"\n\nThe singer took to Instagram to share the following statement: \"Today I received the results of a second paternity test, which was requested by Charlotte Chilton regarding her baby girl, Penelope.\n\n\"As with the last test, this test has confirmed again that I am not Penelope's father. As Charlotte requested, Penelope's, Charlotte's and my DNA were all taken at a Ministry of Justice accredited DNA testing facility that was selected by Charlotte.\n\n\"The results are therefore conclusive.\"\n\nConor claimed a DNA test five months ago ruled him out from having fathered baby Penelope.\n\nBut Charlotte demanded it be retaken after a jaw-dropping revelation suggested that an unidentified male was present when Conor's sample was collected, throwing the result into question.\n\nA representative for Charlotte shared a message on behalf of Charlotte - saying the star \"fought for justice\".\n\nIt read: \"On behalf of our client Charlotte Chilton, we would like to address the story published in today's Sun, confirming Conor Maynard is not the biological father of her beautiful daughter, Penelope.\n\n\"For those of you who have followed Charlotte's journey since her appearance on BBC's The Traitors, will know she has fought an extraordinary battle for truth and justice with heartfelt conviction.\n\n\"We are forever grateful to everyone who has shown unwavering love and support to Charlotte over the past 12 months.\n\n\"Special thanks must also go to Charlotte's rockstar legal advisors for their invaluable counsel and guidance.\n\n\"We could not have done this without you.\"\n\nHer team reassured her followers that Charlotte will be back soon to share her \"story in full\".\n\nThey added: \"Charlotte will now take time to process, heal and reflect and when she is ready, she will finally share her story in full.\"",
