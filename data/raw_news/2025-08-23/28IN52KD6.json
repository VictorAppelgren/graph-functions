There are still a lot of hidden effects and the biggest thing is the high rip current risk that is still present up and down the East Coast.\u201d\nTemperatures for tomorrow were expected to stay in the low 80s in NYC and on most of Long Island, with the Jersey Shore seeing the mercury reach the upper 70s and low 80s, Braud said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to get a little cooler too, so it\u2019s probably not the best beach-going weather anyway at the moment,\u201d he said.\nSome Jersey Shore beaches were expected to remain closed Saturday for cleanup, according to a report.\nBlinken is a regular in East Hampton.\nHe was vacationing at the Long Island hotspot on Aug. 15, 2021, hours before the Taliban took over Kabul, Afghanistan, and quickly left to tend to the crisis.\nThe Democratic lawyer\u2019s father Donald Blinken, the former US Ambassador to Hungary under President Clinton, seasonally lived on Lily Pond Lane for more than 50 years."

And, like, I fly off the cuff in not like a violent way, obviously,\u201d she laughed, adding that \u201cIf I feel something, I am going to say it. Sometimes it gets me into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s always devil\u2019s advocate as much as it literally kills me. He\u2019s so thoughtful in his decisions. He\u2019s the most ethical human on this entire planet. Every single decision he makes is based on his code of ethics,\u201d she added in the over-the-top tribute.\nAs she continued to heap praise on her partner, the mom reflected on the life lessons he had taught her, including how to ask for help and the importance of being vulnerable.\n\u201cI think one of the things I\u2019m going to miss is being able to show him how wonderful he\u2019s been to me and he can enjoy that. I think that bums me out,\u201d she said in the video.\nEmily said she was heartbroken at the thought she\u2019d no longer be able to trade bizarre stories and have him roast her.\n\u201cThere is no point to this video except to say like, yes, I feel sorry for myself and I\u2019m scared about how my life is going to change and how hard it is going to be for me,\u201d she said in the clip.\n\u201cBut I know how truly at the end of the day I am just so scared that all these wonderful things from this phenomenally perfect man, who has given me more than I can ever thank him for, might not be here to see all that.\u201d\nThe video was among a slew of TikToks she posted in the months leading up to Monday\u2019s shocking murder-suicide that shed light on her declining mental state \u2014 including one where she even admitted she needed professional help.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly when Long posted the seven-minute clip, which has since been reposted by other users.\nThe harrowing details continued to emerge just days after investigators said she shot her husband and her two eldest children \u2014 Parker, 8, and Ryan, 6 \u2014 before taking her own life at their Madbury, New Hampshire, home early Monday.\nThe couple\u2019s 3-year-old child \u2014 the lone survivor of the slaughter \u2014 was found alive and unharmed inside the house.\nThe mom\u2019s death was ruled a suicide while her family members\u2019 deaths were ruled homicides, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nInvestigators haven\u2019t yet revealed a motive for the tragedy.\n\u201cWhile investigators are becoming aware of various concerns/issues ongoing in the household at the time of the event in question, people should avoid speculating that this event was caused by a single reason or stressor,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in a statement."

      "text": "Feds plan to deport alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda\nFederal authorities warned alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia they plan to deport him to Uganda after he refused an offer to plead guilty to human smuggling charges and serve his sentence in Costa Rica, his attorneys said in a Saturday court filing.\nThe Salvadoran migrant, 30, was offered the deal Thursday night but rejected it, opting instead to walk free on Friday from a federal lock up in Tennessee and return home to his family in Maryland until his trial began, according to the seven-page filing in Federal District Court in Nashville.\nAbrego Garcia was deported in March and sent to El Salvador\u2019s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.\nThe Trump administration arranged for his return in June, and he was held in Putnam County Jail until Friday when a judge granted his release.\nThe Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security quickly threatened to boot him to Uganda, his lawyers argued.\nAbrego Garcia has been ordered to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore office Monday morning.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing read.\n\u201cThere can be only one interpretation of these events. The D.O.J., D.H.S, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.\u201d\nCourt documents showed federal prosecutors pushed Abrego Garcia to stay behind bars, offering that if he pleaded guilty, he would be accepted into the Central American country \u2014 a Spanish-speaking nation like his native El Salvador \u2014 as a legal immigrant and would not face detention.\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Friday blasted his release as \u201ca new low.\u201d\n\u201cBy ordering this monster loose on America\u2019s streets, the judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,\u201d she wrote on X.\nStay up to date on alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n- Trump admin plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia after prison release \u2013 and not to El Salvador, prosecutor tells judge\n- Kilmar Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of trafficking thousands of illegal migrants \u2014 including MS-13 gangbangers\n- Moment alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accused of human trafficking revealed in new bodycam video\n- Alleged MS-13 gangbanger\u2019s rank, street name revealed as fight over deportation to El Salvador megaprison rages: docs\n- Supreme Court rules Trump admin must \u2018facilitate\u2019 return of wrongfully deported Maryland man\n\u201cWe will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s smuggling allegations stem from a 2022 traffic stop where he was pulled over on a Tennessee highway with eight passengers in the car, but no luggage. Police in Tennessee had suspected human smuggling, but he was not charged at the time.\nHe was also previously accused of physically abusing his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a US citizen who has been fiercely advocating on his behalf.\nThe administration eventually admitted Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador under President Trump\u2019s invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d \u2014 but maintained he was \u201cconfirmed to be a ranking member of the MS-13 gang by a proven and reliable source.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia has denied any affiliation with the violent gang.\nLast month, a federal judge ordered immigration agents to wait 72 hours after Abrego Garcia\u2019s expected release from custody in Nashville before nabbing and deporting him to a third country, such as Mexico or South Sudan, where he is not originally from.\nThe judge also ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned to the supervision of an ICE field office in Baltimore upon his release, the same office that had been keeping tabs on him prior to his arrest in mid-March.\nHe first entered the country illegally in 2011 and was handed an order shielding him from deportation in 2019 over potential threats from MS-13\u2019s rivals in El Salvador.\nWith Post wires."

      "text": "3 arrests net large quantity of drugs headed to Burning Man, police say\nBurning Man doesn't officially start until Sunday, but three people have already been arrested on suspicion of transporting large quantities of drugs out to the playa.\nThe Pershing County Sheriff's Office made two arrests Thursday.\n\"We stopped them for routine traffic violations and found a lot drugs,\" Sheriff Jerry Allen told the Reno Gazette Journal on Friday.\nYerington police on Wednesday separately confiscated large amounts of crack cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD, Oxycodone, Vicodin, Valium and Xanax from a vehicle. Asked where he was headed, a 48-year-old suspect said \u201cBurning Man,\u201d according to police.\nAllen said his team is bringing twice the amount of Narcan, 100 doses, to the annual countercultural festival in the Black Rock Desert. The quick-acting nasal spray can stop an opioid overdose.\nElected sheriff of the rural Nevada county in 2015, Allen is on his 10th year coordinating a police force that patrols Burning Man and the surrounding communities during the influx of tens of thousands of people.\nHe\u2019s seen a lot and occasionally has butted heads with Burning Man leaders, including over how and where sexual assaults at the festival are reported and handled.\nIn Pershing County, with fewer than 7,000 residents the rest of the year, the population jumps more than 1,000% when Burners arrive. Attendance dropped following the hiatus of 2020 and 2021 due to COVID and the 2023 rains that turned the playa into a cement trap. Allen expected numbers to grow a bit compared with last year.\nThis year, rain expected in parts of Northern Nevada could again made the trek in and out of the desert tough.\nAllen said about 22 officers from Pershing County will work Burning Man, with deputies camped there before and after the nine-day festival\nFor the last two years, the sheriff's office has worked under the Bureau of Land Management to help provide law enforcement. Allen said the BLM and rural deputies work well together.\nAllen said every year he is concerned about security and the site's remoteness if something were to happen. The temporary encampment, Black Rock City, is about 120 miles from Reno.\nAllen said weapons are brought to the playa without much of a way to stop them from getting inside the gates. Burning Man forbids any type of weapon, including knives and firearms, but Allen said deputies have seen swords, rifles and handguns.\nThe majority of Burning Man traffic is expected Sunday, Monday and Tuesday after the gates open at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. It ends Labor Day Monday, Sept. 1."

Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was escorted off East Hampton\u2019s Georgica Beach after a hurricane\u2011related closure. In New Hampshire, a mother who had posted a TikTok praising her cancer\u2011stricken husband was later found to have killed her family and herself. Separately, federal officials are threatening to deport an alleged MS\u201113 gang member to Uganda after he declined a plea deal.",
