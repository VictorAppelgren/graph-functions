  "title": "Why Google Is Really Warning 2.5 Billion Gmail Users to Stop Using Their Password",
  "description": "Your email account is the key to everything. Google is warning users to up their security.",
  "content": "Your email account is the key to everything. Google is warning users to up their security.\n\nYou may have seen warnings that Google is telling all of its users to change their Gmail passwords due to a breach. That\u2019s only partly true. Google is telling users to change their passwords, but not because of a breach that exposed them. In fact, Google\u2019s real advice is to stop using your password altogether. Here\u2019s what I mean:\n\nThe breach traces back to Salesforce, whose systems were compromised by the hacker group known as ShinyHunters (also tracked as UNC6040). Attackers obtained business-related Gmail data, including contact lists, company associations, and email metadata. No actual Gmail account credentials were stolen, but the nature of the stolen data makes phishing and impersonation attacks far more dangerous. Google confirmed the link between the Salesforce breach and a rise in targeted phishing campaigns and said attackers are already impersonating Google, IT departments, or trusted vendors to trick people into handing over login information. Some campaigns even involve \u201cvishing,\u201d or fraudulent phone calls made from spoofed 650-area-code numbers that resemble Google\u2019s corporate lines. For years, phishing has been one of the most effective tools hackers use to break into accounts. Google\u2019s own data shows that phishing and vishing now account for roughly 37 percent of successful account takeovers across its services. With the data from Salesforce in hand, hackers can customize attacks that look far more authentic than the usual spam message.\n\nImagine receiving a message that references your actual employer, colleagues, or recent communications. That level of detail raises the likelihood that you\u2019ll trust the email, click a malicious link, or provide sensitive information. Once credentials are stolen, hackers can bypass additional protections and take over accounts\u2014sometimes without the victim realizing it until significant damage has been done. Look, the most important rule here is that you should literally never give anyone your Gmail password, especially not someone who calls you and purports to be tech support. No matter how convincing it may seem, Google is never ever going to call you and ask you for your login information. Seriously, even if your son calls you to help you with tech support, you should not give him your Gmail password. Why? Well, because your email is basically the key to everything. In an interview I did last year, Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cummings explains the problem:\n\n\u201cIf you do not have a good password on your email, the rest of your life is pretty much wide open, because every single service out there does reset password by sending you an email,\u201d says Graham-Cummings. \u201cSo if I can compromise your email, I can compromise pretty much everything else you have.\u201d Of course, even better than not giving out your password or clicking on links from fake tech-support emails is to stop using passwords altogether on your Gmail account. Google has been encouraging users for years to adopt passkeys instead. I also spoke with Jeff Shiner last year about passkeys. As the CEO of 1Password, Shiner knows a few things about how people use passwords and why they should be switching to more secure ways of protecting their accounts.\n\n\u201cA pass key, from an end user point of view, looks like the biometrics on your device,\u201d says Shiner. \u201cThe cool thing about a passkey is that to the end user, you never have a password for that service. You just use your biometrics, and then a passkey is created. But, from a security point of view, it\u2019s actually stronger than a password\u2014even a strong password\u2014because it can\u2019t be phished.\u201d In light of the breach, Google is encouraging Gmail users to change their password. In fact, you should change your password on a regular basis in the event it is ever compromised. But, even better is to stop using passwords at all. Google is also pushing users toward stronger forms of authentication, including passkeys and app-based two-factor authentication (2FA). Unlike SMS codes, which can be intercepted or spoofed, authenticator apps and passkeys make it much harder for hackers to break into accounts even if they trick you into handing over a password.\n\nGoogle\u2019s guidance can be summed up in five steps:\n\u2022 Reset your Gmail password regularly. Choose something unique and complex. Do not reuse passwords across accounts.\n\u2022 Turn on two-factor authentication. Preferably, use an authenticator app or a passkey.\n\u2022 Be skeptical of unsolicited messages. If you receive an email or call about account security, go directly to your Google Account dashboard instead of clicking links or giving information over the phone.\n\u2022 Use Google\u2019s Security Checkup. The tool provides a quick overview of devices, apps, and settings tied to your account.\n\u2022 Stay alert. If something feels off\u2014strange login notifications, unexpected password reset requests, or unusual email activity\u2014act quickly by securing your account. This episode underscores a broader truth about modern cybersecurity: your accounts are only as safe as the weakest link in the chain. In this case, a breach at Salesforce created risk for Gmail users who had no direct relationship with the company. Even if Google\u2019s own infrastructure remains secure, attackers can exploit data leaked from partners to undermine trust. With more than 2.5 billion Gmail users, it isn\u2019t surprising that the world\u2019s most popular email service would represent one of the most irresistible targets for hackers. Google\u2019s latest warning is a reminder that in a world of constant breaches, vigilance is the only reliable defense.\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
