  "content": "This article explains how to turn off auto-renewal on iPhones.\n\nHow to Turn Off Auto Renewal on iPhone\n\nThere are plenty of excellent subscription-based services available through your iPhone, but sometimes you need to cancel a subscription, lest you incur an unwanted charge.\n\nFollow these steps to turn off the auto-renewal feature on your iPhone:\n\u2022 On your iPhone, tap Settings > Apple Account (your name). In some versions of iOS, this option is called \"Apple ID.\"\n\u2022 Locate the subscription you want to cancel in the Active section of the Subscriptions screen and tap it. If you have a lot of subscriptions, you might need to scroll down the list.\n\u2022 You can edit your subscription if it contains options or cancel auto-renew. Tap Cancel Subscription to cancel the subscription. You've successfully turned off auto-renew on your iPhone for that subscription. If you pay in advance, you can still use the service up until the date listed. It's worth doing this if you plan on only having the subscription for a brief time.\n\nHow to Turn Automatic Renewal Back On\n\nIf you realize you didn't mean to turn off auto-renewal for a subscription or change your mind later, you can switch it back on from the same Subscriptions screen.\n\u2022 Tap the subscription you want to resubscribe to in the Inactive section of the Subscriptions screen. A payment screen appears with information about the renewal.\n\u2022 Tap the option you want. There may be more than one available. The subscription automatically renews on the date that's listed on the payment screen.\n\u2022 Complete the process by entering your password or via FaceID or TouchID. Your subscription is set up again until you choose to cancel it.\n\nIf you expect to see active subscriptions connected to your Apple Account but don't see them, there are a few key things to consider.\n\u2022 Subscription provider: Some subscriptions are conducted directly with the provider rather than Apple. Check the provider's website for more details.\n\u2022 Apple Account: Check that you've signed in with the correct Apple ID/Apple Account. If you have more than one Apple Account, you may have signed in on a different one than you used for the subscription.\n\u2022 Family Sharing: If you use Family Sharing, organizers can't manage subscriptions for other family members. They need to do it themselves.",

      "text": "Computers, Laptops & Tablets > Apple > iPad > 325 325 people found this article helpful What Is an Apple ID/Apple Account? Is it Different from iTunes and iCloud? What Apple Account is used for By Daniel Nations Daniel Nations Writer University of Texas at Arlington Daniel Nations has been a tech journalist since 1994. His work has appeared in Computer Currents, The Examiner, and other publications. He is a developer who has published apps in the Apple App Store, Google Play marketplace and Amazon Appstore; he also has worked as a data analyst and DB administrator. lifewire's editorial guidelines Updated on September 23, 2021 Apple iPad Macs Close Apple ID/Apple Account is both your iTunes account and the login for your iCloud account. It is basically your one-stop-shop for everything Apple. It includes your payment and shipping information for purchasing from both the digital music, movie, and App stores and physical products from Apple.com. It holds your personal information, your passwords, and security, and it also stores all of your subscriptions and in-app purchases on the App Store. Lifewire / Madelyn Goodnight So what's all the confusion? As Apple transitioned from a company selling music through iTunes to be played on an iPod to a company who sells smartphones and tablets, signing into these products with an \"iTunes account\" simply didn't make sense. So the iTunes account was renamed to Apple Account. The Apple Account is used with all of Apple's products from the iPhone to the iPad to the Mac to Apple TV. If you have any of these devices, you have been asked to sign in or create an Apple Account to use the device. You don't need more than one Apple Account. In fact, the experience is better using the same Apple Account across all devices. You can download apps to your iPad that you purchased on your iPhone, and some apps even let you download the Apple TV version. And while you are asked to sign in to iCloud separately, this is the same as Apple Account. In addition to using iCloud with your Mac, iPhone or iPad, you can sign into icloud.com to gain access to web versions of Pages, Number, Keynote, Notes, Find My iPhone/iPad among others. Why Do We Have To Sign Into Both Apple Account and iCloud? While it may seem confusing to sign into both your Apple Account and iCloud on your iPad, it's actually a pretty cool feature. It allows you to share an iCloud account with your spouse so both can access iCloud Photo Library and other cloud features while keeping the Apple Account separate. What Is Family Sharing? Family Sharing is a way to link Apple Accounts together into one unit. This allows parents to have greater control over what apps their kids are downloading, even allowing the child to request to download an app and having a dialog box pop up on the parent's device to approve the download. Also, many apps allow every Apple Account on the family account to download it once it has been purchased. Do you need Family Sharing? Many families simply use the same Apple Account across all of their devices. It's easy enough to childproof an iPad to restrict app downloads among other things. And having the same Apple Account as your spouse makes sharing apps, music, movies, etc. much easier. This can be a little confusing because you are asked to sign into your device to gain access to the App Store and iTunes and you are also asked to sign into iCloud. But while you can sign in to each separately, you use the same Apple Account account for both. How to Change Your Apple Account Password It is always a good idea to change your passwords on a regular basis, especially if a company you do business with was the victim of a hack. You can manage your account on Apple's Apple Account website. Simply click the Create a New Password link. In addition to changing your password, you can also change your security question and set up two-factor authentication. In order to make any changes to your account, you will need to answer your original security questions to verify your identity. The Essential Steps to Sign Out of Apple ID/Apple Account on Mac FAQ What is the minimum age requirement for an Apple Account? Children under age 13 can't create an Apple Account on their own. An adult who is the family organizer for Family Sharing can create an Apple Account for the child. What is an Apple Account example? Depending on when you created your Apple Account, it ends in @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com. Some people who got their Apple Accounts before 2008 may have all three. The portion before @ is what you chose when you originally obtained your Apple Account. What is an Apple Account verification code? Apple recommends you turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple Account as an additional layer of security. When you set it up, you designate your trusted devices. Then, when you use your Apple Account to make a purchase, you are asked to enter the verification code sent to your trusted device. Was this page helpful? Thanks for letting us know!

      "text": "Mobile Phones > iPhone & iOS > 170 170 people found this article helpful How to Use Face ID on Your iPhone Learn how facial recognition works with Apple devices By Sam Costello Sam Costello Writer Ithaca College Sam Costello has been writing about tech since 2000. His writing has appeared in publications such as CNN.com, PC World, InfoWord, and many others. lifewire's editorial guidelines Updated on July 8, 2021 In This Article View All In This Article What Is Face ID? Supported Devices How It Works Where Face Scans Are Stored How Secure Is My Face Scan? How to Set up and Use Face ID How to Disable Face ID Face ID: Accurate, Fast, Simple Use Face ID When Wearing a Face Mask Frequently Asked Questions Close Face ID is a facial recognition system that replaces Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner on some devices. It uses sensors arrayed around the iPhone's user-facing camera to scan your face and, if the scan matches the data on file, perform actions like unlocking the phone or authorizing an Apple Pay transaction. What Is Face ID Used for on iPhone? Face ID is used for many of the same things as Touch ID. Most important among these are: Unlocking the iPhone in place of entering a passcode. Supplying your Apple ID/Apple Account password or other passcodes. Authorizing Apple Pay transactions. What Devices Support Face ID? Face ID is supported by the full iPhone X series: the iPhone X, iPhone XS and XS Max, and iPhone XR. It's a safe bet that, just like Touch ID started on the iPhone and has been added to other devices like the iPad, Face ID will eventually appear on other Apple devices such as the iPad. Lifewire / Julie Bang How Does Face ID Work? The notch at the top of the iPhone screen on compatible devices is where the sensors used by Face ID are located. These sensors include: Dot Projector: This projects over 30,000 invisible dots onto your face. The dots are used to map the structure and depth of your face. That builds a three-dimensional \"unique facial map,\" according to Apple.Infrared Camera: This camera reads the dots from the Projector and captures an image. Flood Illuminator: This additional infrared light helps ensure that the system works even in the dark. The facial map captured by the infrared camera is matched against the data stored on your iPhone to unlock or authorize the Apple Pay transaction. It's also used to create animoji, animated emojis mapped to your face. The system is smart and sensitive enough, according to Apple, that it can recognize you even if you change your haircut, wear glasses, grow or shave a beard, age, or wear a cloth mask. That said, there have been some cases in which Face ID has misidentified people, including twins and children who look a lot like their parents. Is My Face Scan Stored in the Cloud? No, Face ID face scans are not stored in the cloud. All face scans are stored directly on your iPhone. They are held in the \"Secure Enclave,\" one of the iPhone's chips that's dedicated specifically to securing sensitive data. This is also where fingerprint information created by Touch ID is stored. How Secure Is My Face Scan? The way that the Secure Enclave works makes Face ID very secure. Your facial scan itself isn't actually stored on your iPhone. Instead, when the facial scan is created, it's converted to a number that represents the scan. That's stored on your iPhone. Even if a hacker were able to access the data in your iPhone's Secure Enclave (which is very unlikely), all they would get is a number, not an actual scan of your face. That means they would not be able to use the data to submit your information to another facial recognition system. How to Set up and Use Face ID Setting up Face ID is extremely simple\u2014in fact, you probably did it while setting up your new iPhone. Just position your face in the onscreen frame and roll your head around until the circle around the edge of the frame is filled in. Repeat as many times as the phone tells you and you're done. If you skipped that step during setup, you can always go back and add Face ID later. To do this, go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and follow the onscreen instructions. You can also add other faces to Face ID on your iPhone including someone you trust as well as alternative pictures of you (with and without a beard or glasses, for example). How to Disable Face ID If you need to quickly disable Face ID, press the iPhone's side button and volume down buttons at the same time. In order to enable Face ID again, you'll need to re-enter your passcode. How to Fix It When the iPhone Face ID is Not Working How Does Face ID Compare to Other Smartphone Facial Recognition Systems? Despite a healthy dose of skepticism when it was announced, Face ID has been a hit with users and critics. The overall consensus is that it's very accurate, very fast, and very simple. Overall, the transition away from Touch ID to Face ID has been faster and smoother than most people expected. It's also proved, once again, how good Apple is at this sort of innovation. When Face ID launched there was one major phone out with this kind of technology: Samsung S8. Unfortunately, that system has been shown to be very easy to fool, including by holding up a photograph. Because of this, the Samsung system appears to not be terribly secure. Samsung won't allow its facial scans to approve financial transactions (the way Touch ID can on an iPhone). Use Face ID When Wearing a Face Mask The iOS 14.5 update allows users to unlock their iPhone X and later using Face ID while they're wearing a face mask. To use this feature, you'll need an unlocked Apple Watch Series 3 or later and your iPhone nearby. Just glance at your iPhone, and then your Watch will issue haptic feedback letting you know the iPhone is unlocked. In iOS 15.4, Apple added mask functionality without a synced Apple Watch. After you re-scan your face, the iPhone will have enough information to unlock based on the visible part of your face. FAQ Does Apple Face ID work when eyes are closed? No, it does not. Face ID is attention-aware and can recognize if your eyes are open and your attention is directed towards the device. This helps to prevent someone from unlocking your device without your knowledge. How does Apple Face ID work with a scarf? Face ID is designed to work with head coverings and eyewear. It should be able to recognize your face even if you are wearing a hat, scarf, glasses, contact lenses, and even many types of sunglasses. Was this page helpful? Thanks for letting us know!

By Sam Costello Sam Costello Writer Ithaca College Sam Costello has been writing about tech since 2000. His writing has appeared in publications such as CNN.com, PC World, InfoWord, and many others. lifewire's editorial guidelines Updated on October 3, 2024 In This Article View All In This Article How to Remove Someone From Family Sharing What Happens When I Remove Someone From Family Share? What Happens to Shared Content After Removal From Family Sharing? Close What to Know Open Settings > select name or Accounts & Passwords > select iCloud Drive > Family Sharing.Next, select family member name > Remove > confirm removal. This article explains how to remove a family member from Apple's Family Sharing on an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Mac. Family Sharing is supported on devices with at least iOS 8. How to Remove Someone From Family Sharing Deleting someone from Family Sharing to stop sharing purchases with them is possible through the Settings app. Open the Settings app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Tap your name at the top. If you don't see that, go to Accounts & Passwords > iCloud Drive. Select Family Sharing. If you see Set Up Family Sharing instead, you'll need to log out and log back in with the Apple ID/Apple Account used to set up Family Sharing. Tap the name of the family member you want to remove from Family Sharing. Select Remove . You can hide Family Sharing purchases instead if you'd rather keep the member as part of the group but you want to make some of your purchases unavailable to them. Confirm that you want to remove that person. After the person is removed, you're returned to the main Family Sharing screen and can see that they are no longer listed. How to Remove a Child From Family Sharing What Happens When I Remove Someone From Family Share? When you remove someone from your family, the person will no longer be able to access the purchases made by the other members. This includes purchases made through iTunes, Apple Books, and App Store. It also revokes access to Apple Music Family Memberships and iCloud storage plans. You might remove someone from your Family Sharing account if you no longer want them to have access to these purchases or if you need to add someone else but you've already maxed out the six-person limit. What Happens to Shared Content After Removal From Family Sharing? So, you've removed a user from Family Sharing\u2014but what happens to the content they shared with you and you shared with them? In some cases, the content is no longer accessible, but in other cases, it's still accessible. iTunes, App, and Apple Books Store If the person you've removed from Family Sharing bought any DRM-protected content, such as music, movies, TV shows, and apps, those items are no longer available to other Family Sharing users. The person who leaves the Family Sharing group also loses access to the purchases made by other members of the plan. This happens because the ability to share someone else's purchases depends on being linked together by Family Sharing. When you break that link, you lose the ability to share. In-App Purchases If your favorite gaming app disappears from Family Sharing when you remove a family member, you can purchase it yourself to enjoy it. Any in-app purchases remain with the person who buys them, even if they leave Family Sharing, but they may need to download or purchase the app if one of the other family members bought it. Apple Music If an Apple Music subscription was shared among family members, the person who is no longer part of the Family Sharing group loses access. That includes any songs they've added to their library or downloaded for offline listening. To regain access to that music, they need to subscribe to Apple Music on their own. Removing a person from Family Sharing doesn't affect their Apple Account or the iTunes Store or App Store purchases they've made on their own. Was this page helpful? Thanks for letting us know!

This lineup gets Dynamic Island, Always-On technology, a programmable Action Button, and a powerful new A17 chip to keep operation fast and efficient. Both models also have a hardy Titanium build with the slimmest borders of any iPhone and a pro-grade ProMotion camera system with up to 3x optical zoom. Bottom line: For users who demand a lot from their iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro series delivers with speedy performance, a highly durable design, and excellent camera technology upgrades. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus AT&T What We Like Transition to USB-C. Dynamic Island technology. Thinner build. Upgraded camera system. Improved location finding. What We Don't Like No ProMotion. Limited colors. Lacks always-on display.

Notable specs: Like all of the iPhone 15 Pro models, the base 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with USB-C ports for charging and data transfer, Dynamic Island technology for live notifications, and improved SOS support and satellite roadside assistance. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus also get a revamped 48MP camera with up to 2x optical zoom.
