  "title": "Trump\u2019s endless new tariffs are threatening businesses \u2014 and you",
  "description": "It\u2019s the latest in a year of tariff policy whiplash.",
  "content": "Announced on July 31st, the latest set of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on foreign imports \u2014 possibly illegally \u2014 will set a floor of 15 percent for around 40 countries with a trade deficit with the US. There\u2019s an even higher rate for another couple dozen countries, as CNN has reported. This raises the floor for many countries from the universal tariff rate of 10 percent that Trump previously levied, though some goods, like smartphones, are carved out of higher rates. Tariff escalation seems far from over, with Trump threatening on Wednesday to impose a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors \u2014 unless companies build manufacturing plants in the US.\n\nAs Trump has ratcheted up pressure on foreign imports over the last few months, some Americans might not have noticed a marked difference in what they\u2019re spending, especially as huge tax hikes have been announced and then delayed or cut back. Trump\u2019s perpetually changing tariff deadlines and rates led a Financial Times columnist to coin the phrase \u201cTACO trade,\u201d short for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out.\u201d But experts say that some product categories have already seen clear price upticks, and more are likely on the way. Meanwhile, businesses have been left bracing for the impact of added taxes on imported goods, dealing with the uncertainty of how and whether they\u2019ll actually take effect.\n\nExperts warn that this new, broad wave of taxes, compounding existing baseline tariffs, may soon become more noticeable. \u201cThe impact of tariffs comes like waves, and it comes in slow motion,\u201d says Monica Gorman, managing director at Crowell Global Advisors and a former National Economic Council official in the Biden administration. \u201cBecause of the way supply chains are structured, we don\u2019t feel it right away. But that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to feel it. And, in fact, I think we will begin to start to feel it this fall and winter.\u201d\n\nSo far, consumer-facing businesses in particular have taken steps to avoid raising prices for their customers as the economy is already facing a pullback in spending. \u201cFor those businesses that know that their consumers have less ability to absorb, they\u2019re going to do everything they can before they raise prices,\u201d Gorman says. That\u2019s meant doing things like stocking extra inventory before Trump\u2019s first round of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs took effect in April. \u201cThey\u2019ve now sold through that inventory,\u201d Gorman says. \u201cAnd so what\u2019s coming in now is orders that were not yet in the United States when the tariffs went into effect, and that is only going to rise from this point forward.\u201d\n\nThe impact might look different across sectors or hit at different points. For example, this new wave of tariffs includes a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam and other places in Southeast Asia, where apparel production is common, likely impacting clothing goods. The National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade association, notes that automotive supply retailers have more wiggle room in their margins to absorb added costs than grocery stores. But even when retailers don\u2019t pass on costs to consumers, the NRF argues that it could still hurt the economy more broadly. \u201cThis is because cuts are made elsewhere \u2014 in jobs and investments,\u201d Mark Mathews, the NRF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a July blog post. \u201cFalling business investment has been the key driver of GDP reductions in previous recessions.\u201d\n\nUncertainty about what tariff policies might look like in the next year or even week contributes to businesses\u2019 hesitancy to make long-term strategic changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re a business and looking to make a three- to five-year investment, are you certain that this is the tariff environment that you\u2019re going to have in five years? Particularly if you\u2019re looking to build in the United States?\u201d Gorman asks. \u201cGiven that uncertainty, I would anticipate we may still see capital sitting on the sidelines, businesses still playing a game of wait-and-see, until there\u2019s just more sense of what the longer term outlook is.\u201d\n\nAnother confusing element for businesses to navigate is a new 40 percent tariff on transshipments, or goods shipped indirectly to the US without \u201csubstantial transformation.\u201d The idea is to make sure suppliers aren\u2019t evading high tariffs by routing through countries facing lower ones, and a senior Trump administration official told reporters last week that this definition could be substantially broadened, The New York Times reported. Doing so could mean added costs for businesses that are currently difficult to predict.\n\nSo far, US businesses and consumers have really only seen the first phase of tariffs\u2019 impact, says a source familiar with corporate lobbying efforts, who spoke on background to give insight into private conversations. \u201cCompanies have been preparing as much as they possibly could, but the sort of on again, off again; numbers up, numbers down; letters, no letters; do we have an executive order? Do we have a fact sheet? Do we have a Truth Social post? have made it hard to plan.\u201d As Thursday\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs take effect, this person says, consumers may soon begin to see their effect reflected in prices. \u201cAnyone who tells you, \u2018well, we\u2019ve had tariffs for six months and they\u2019re not hurting the economy,\u2019 they\u2019re really leaving out the fact that those big reciprocal tariffs that the President has imposed haven\u2019t gone into effect yet, and that we\u2019re still going to see those impacts start to really hit people.\u201d\n\nGorman expects consumers to notice tariff impacts in more purchases this holiday season. Even though many businesses tried to stock up ahead of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d in April, they are also constrained by storage space and cost for extra inventory. Still, some product categories, like baby products, have already seen large impacts. Since many baby products can\u2019t easily move manufacturing from China where Trump has already levied high tariffs, products like strollers and car seats have just recently started to see average retail prices rising anywhere from 10 to 35 percent, Gorman says.",

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:\nSection 1. Background. In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States. I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate.\nI have received additional information and recommendations from various senior officials on, among other things, the continued lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships and the impact of foreign trading partners\u2019 disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports, the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base. I also have received additional information and recommendations on foreign relations, economic, and national security matters, including the status of trade negotiations, efforts to retaliate against the United States for its actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and efforts to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.\nFor example, some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters. Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters. There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.\nAfter considering the information and recommendations that I have recently received, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive Order 14257, as amended, in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on goods of such trading partners in Executive Order 14257, as amended.\nSec. 2. Tariff Modifications. (a) The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order. These modifications shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed in Executive Order 14257, as amended.\n(b) Certain foreign trading partners identified in Annex I to this order have agreed to, or are on the verge of concluding, meaningful trade and security agreements with the United States. Goods of those trading partners will remain subject to the additional ad valorem duties provided in Annex I to this order until such time as those agreements are concluded, and I issue subsequent orders memorializing the terms of those agreements.\n(c) As provided in Annex I to this order, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to any good of the European Union is determined by the good\u2019s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 (General) of the HTSUS (\u201cColumn 1 Duty Rate\u201d). For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero.\n(d) Goods of any foreign trading partner that is not listed in Annex I to this order will be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, unless otherwise expressly provided. This rate shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order.\n(e) The HTSUS shall also be modified by continuing to suspend headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)\u2013(9) and (11)\u2011(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until the effective date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order. Upon the effective date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order, to facilitate implementation of the rates of duty provided in Annex I to this order, headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, which are organized by rate of duty, and subdivisions (v)(xiii) (1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be terminated as to future entries and replaced by the new trading partner-specific headings provided in Annex II to this order.\n(f) Excluding the changes set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply.\n(g) Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People\u2019s Republic of China).\n(h) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register.\nSec. 3. Transshipment. (a) An article determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of origin, (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592, and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin. CBP shall not allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties.\n(b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due diligence.\nSec. 4. Implementation. The Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the International Trade Commission, are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order. Each executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement this order.\nSec. 5. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall monitor the circumstances involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and shall regularly consult on such circumstances with any senior official they deem appropriate. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall also inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might indicate that a foreign trading partner has taken adequate steps to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.\n(b) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with any senior official they deem appropriate, shall recommend to me any necessary additional action if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.\n(c) The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should a foreign trading partner fail to take adequate steps to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or should a foreign trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or any subsequent order issued to address that emergency.\nSec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\nDONALD J.

      "text": "In the very first week of his presidency, Donald Trump vowed to force silicon manufacturing back to the United States by making processors more expensive, a threat he\u2019s repeated since. Is he finally going through with that plan? Trump just announced he\u2019ll putting an enormous 100 percent tariff on chips and semiconductors \u2014 unless your company kisses the ring like Apple CEO Tim Cook just did, perhaps.\nTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on computer chips with a gigantic loophole\n\u2018If you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK?\u2019\nIn the same live news conference where Apple announced a new $100 billion US manufacturing plan and presented Trump with a 24-karat gold and glass statue, the president explained that Apple had now done enough to escape his upcoming import taxes on chips:\nWe\u2019re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is if you\u2019re building in the United States or have committed to build without question in the United States, there will be no charge.\nAnd, it\u2019s possible that other companies already have, or easily will, meet Trump\u2019s bar for participation. Trump told the in-person and online audience that even a commitment to invest in US manufacturing may be enough to escape the tariffs. \u201c[If you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge, even though you\u2019re building and not producing yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK?\u201d\nHere\u2019s our transcript of Trump\u2019s full remarks on the topic:\nWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100 percent, on chips and semiconductors. But if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge, even though you\u2019re building and not producing yet, in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of the things that you\u2019re building. If you\u2019re building there will be no charge [\u2026] 100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States, but if you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK? If for some reason you say you\u2019re building and you don\u2019t build then we go back and add it up, it accumulates and we charge you at a later date. You have to pay, and that\u2019s a guarantee.\nIt\u2019s hard to think which companies a new chip tariff would apply to, as most major chipmakers already have at least some small commitment to US manufacturing. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, which accounts for the vast majority of leading-edge chips and drew Trump\u2019s ire as a result, announced a $100 billion US investment back in March.\nOr, perhaps, is Trump threatening tariffs on the makers of products that use chips rather than the makers of chips themselves? Apple isn\u2019t exactly a chipmaker, after all; it does design its own chips but relies on companies like TSMC to actually make them.\nIt\u2019s also possible that Trump won\u2019t enact this particular tariff at all. After previously threatening tariffs on chips in January and February, the Trump administration excluded them from tariffs come April. Trump did not say when new chip tariffs might happen. Trump\u2019s new general reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect tomorrow, August 7th.\nIn July, AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed that TSMC\u2019s US-made chips would cost it an extra 5 to 20 percent more than ones made overseas."

      "text": "At an event in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, Donald Trump unveiled a new set of planned tariffs that are being described as \u201cshort-sighted,\u201d and having \u201cno basis in logic,\u201d and being compared to Great Depression-era policies. Holding a giant poster board blowing in the wind, Trump announced staggering new taxes on products coming into the US from abroad. Among the 60 countries listed, tariff rates ranged anywhere from 10 percent to nearly 50 percent: 34 percent for China, 46 percent for Vietnam, 20 percent for the EU, and 49 percent for Cambodia, among others.\nThe US is the world\u2019s biggest importer, bringing in trillions of dollars of goods every year. Relatively little is produced in the US, and the eye-watering taxes will impact supply chains across industries: tech products and gadgets, clothing, food, automobiles, and more. Seeing souring relations between the US and China, some companies have worked to diversify supply chains by moving manufacturing to other countries \u2014 Apple, for example, was producing billions of dollars worth of iPhones in India last fall to move away from China. Under Trump\u2019s new plan, Indian imports would get slapped with 26 percent tariffs.\nThe President did not explain how the rates were calculated, but if implemented the steep taxes will likely make costs for retailers \u2014 and by extension, consumers \u2014 skyrocket. The Trump administration has regularly lied about who pays for tariffs, claiming that the exporting nation foots the bill. That\u2019s not how tariffs work, no matter how many times Trump claims otherwise.\nThe New York Times reports that the figures on the chart include a 10 percent \u201cbaseline\u201d tariff, meaning the additional hike on Chinese products is 24 percent, plus 10 percent.\nAfter the event, Trump also signed an executive order closing the de minimis exemption, a little-known carve out that allows packages valued under $800 to enter the US duty free. Ultra cheap retailers like Shein, Temu, and Amazon Haul use the rule as a loophole to keep prices low, and buyers don\u2019t have to pay any taxes that would otherwise apply to their purchases. By ending the exemption, Trump could destabilize the business model that has hooked Americans looking for a deal on China-reliant online retailers.\nThe massive taxes on imports are reportedly in addition to existing tariffs the Trump administration has levied on imports. He\u2019s also separately added taxes to vehicles and imports from top US trading partners like Canada and Mexico."

      "text": "President Donald Trump just set new tariffs for every country around the world, solidifying his extreme break with America\u2019s long-standing trade policy.\nTariffs on the vast majority of goods America imports are set to rise \u2013 even from the handful of countries that negotiated individual trade deals. The higher tariffs continue Trump\u2019s reversal of the decades of globalization that made America\u2019s massive services economy the envy of the world \u2013 but contributed to its long decline in manufacturing.\nWith just a few hours to go before its self-imposed August 1 trade deadline, the White House provided key details about its new trade policy late Thursday \u2013 and, along with it, its new tariff plan.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the latest set of tariffs:\nWhat are the new tariffs?\nThe White House announced Thursday that the \u201cuniversal\u201d tariff for goods coming into the United States will remain at 10%, the same level that was implemented on April 2.\nBut that 10% rate will apply only to countries with which the US has a trade surplus \u2013 countries to which the United States exports more than it imports. That applies to most countries, a senior administration official said.\nA 15% rate will serve as the new tariff floor for countries with which the United States has a trade deficit. About 40 countries will pay that new 15% tariff. That tariff will be lower for many of those nations than the April 2 \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, but it will be higher for a handful.\nAnd more than a dozen countries have tariff rates that are higher than 15%, either because they agreed to a trade framework with the United States or because Trump sent their leaders a letter dictating a higher tariff. The senior administration official said those countries have among the highest trade deficits with the United States.\nWhat countries have tariffs higher than 15%?\nThe White House identified 26 countries whose goods will be subjected to US tariffs greater than 15%. A senior administration official claimed these countries have excessive trade deficits with the United States.\n- Algeria: 30%\n- Bangladesh: 20%\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina: 30%\n- Brunei: 25%\n- Cambodia: 19%\n- India: 25%\n- Indonesia: 19%\n- Iraq: 35%\n- Kazakhstan: 25%\n- Laos: 40%\n- Libya: 30%\n- Malaysia: 19%\n- Moldova: 25%\n- Myanmar: 40%\n- Nicaragua: 18%\n- Pakistan: 19%\n- Philippines: 19%\n- Serbia: 35%\n- South Africa: 30%\n- Sri Lanka: 20%\n- Switzerland: 39%\n- Syria: 41%\n- Taiwan: 20%\n- Thailand: 19%\n- Tunisia: 25%\n- Vietnam: 20%\nIn addition, Mexico and Canada will continue to face higher tariffs for goods that are not exempt under the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. Mexico on Thursday agreed to a 90-day continuation of the current 25% tariff rate the US currently places on those items. Non-exempt Canadian goods imported to the United States will face a 35% as of Friday at 12:01 am ET \u2013 up from a 25% tariff previously.\nWhen do the tariffs go into effect?\nThe new tariff regime will not go into effect Friday, as had been expected.\nInstead, the tariffs will be implemented on August 7 to give Customs and Border Protection sufficient time to make the necessary changes to collect the new duties.\nCanada\u2019s tariffs are an exception \u2013 those will go into effect Friday.\nTrade agreements prevented tariffs from going even higher\nThe only major trading partners that didn\u2019t see tariff rates change on Friday were the United Kingdom, China and Mexico. Trump signed a trade framework with the UK and China. However, the deal signed with China expires in less than two weeks, which means those tariffs could soon increase.\nWith Mexico, Trump had threatened to raise tariffs to 30% at 12:01 am. But after a conversation with Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Thursday, he extended Mexico\u2019s previous tariff rate for another 90 days.\nOver the past month, Trump announced a handful of other trade agreements. It\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be finalized, but it appears those countries might have avoided rates above what\u2019s in their deals.\nFor instance, goods from the European Union were set to face 30% tariffs. The agreement reached over the weekend, however, calls for 15% tariffs for most goods. That\u2019s the same rate goods from South Korea and Japan will be taxed at.\nThat\u2019s still higher than the 10% rate goods have been tariffed at since April, though.\nAre these tariffs even legal?\nThat\u2019s a question actively being debated. Trump has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose country-specific tariffs.\nIn May, the Court of International Trade found Trump overreached his legal authority doing so. Oral arguments for the administration\u2019s appeal kicked off Thursday, and a panel of judges appeared skeptical that Trump had the power to levy tariffs using those emergency powers.\nOf particular issue was the unprecedented use of the IEEPA to levy tariffs, especially because the law makes no mention of tariffs to begin with.\nSeveral judges also questioned Trump\u2019s rationale behind declaring an economic emergency. The president has previously stated that US trade deficits with other countries, that is, when the US imports more than it exports, merit a national economic emergency requiring tariffs to correct.\nJudge Raymond Chen, however, questioned: \u201cCan the trade deficit be a extraordinary and unusual threat when we had trade deficits for decades?\u201d\nIt may take weeks, or even months, before the appeals court reaches a verdict. After that, it could still be challenged before the Supreme Court. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, Trump has plenty of levers to pull to roll out new tariffs and keep many in place.\nWill Trump extend his tariff deadline again?\nTechnically, he did. New tariff rates were set to go into effect Friday \u2013 and they will now mostly go into effect August 7.\nThe president has given no indication he\u2019ll pause these tariffs any further, though.\nHowever, he\u2019s said that about past tariff deadlines only to extend them later on. In short, everything, including the tariff rates that just went in place, is subject to change at the publishing of a Truth Social post.\nHaven\u2019t we been here before?\nThe tariff changes evoke Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d in April, when he similarly hiked import taxes across the board. The move threw financial markets into chaos and stoked fears of a global recession.\nTrump ultimately delayed the \u201creciprocal\u201d April tariffs hours after they took effect, later setting August 1 as the new deadline for trade agreements on pain of higher tariff rates. The president told some countries what rates they would face on that day absent new agreements but appeared to leave other nations in the dark.\nAre tariffs causing inflation?\nInflation has stayed relatively tame through Trump\u2019s earlier tariff rounds, but that could change as higher rates kick in. Already, companies including Procter and Gamble and Walmart have said tariff-related price increases are underway."

      "text": "Even though recent inflation readings have been muted, we should be careful of being lulled into a false sense of security. While it\u2019s true that prices haven\u2019t risen much yet, there are reasons to be concerned as we look forward.\nBy front-loading shipments into the earlier part of this year, retailers have been able to continue to sell goods that have a lower cost basis. Imports for the first four months of the year ran 10% higher than in the same period last year. That won\u2019t last forever, though.\nAs inventory becomes depleted, shelves are being restocked with goods that have been more expensive to source. And there will be fewer of those goods to go around. Imports in the next few months are expected to be well below last years\u2019 levels.\nAnecdotally, we hear that retailers are keeping prices lower for consumers by adopting lower margins on some products. While this creates some relief for consumers, it is worse for our economy in the long run.\nAccording to data from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, economic impacts worsen when businesses bear the burden of cost rises. Negative GDP impacts increase as businesses \u201ceat\u201d the costs of the tariffs. This is because cuts are made elsewhere \u2014 in jobs and investments. Falling business investment has been the key driver of GDP reductions in previous recessions.\nRetailer gross margins and profit margins tend to be lower than most other major industries. This difference is clearly visible when we compare some of the largest U.S. retailers against their peers in other sectors.\nSome segments of retail have profit margins of less than 2%. Conversely, major technology and financial services firms have profit margins that can range between 25%-40%. In terms of profit per employee, retailer profits are dwarfed by their competitors in other sectors. Any expectation that retailers can absorb large price shifts is misguided at best.\nWhile inflation remains muted for now, many of the factors keeping prices down are likely transient in nature. As those impacts begin to fade, it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where prices don\u2019t start ticking upwards."

      "text": "President Donald Trump just enacted a new wave of tariffs on dozens of America\u2019s trading partners, marking a substantial escalation in ongoing trade tensions that could constitute the biggest change to the global economy in nearly a century.\nThe historic new trade policy follows months of false starts to Trump\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rollout and countless bilateral trade negotiations, a handful of which resulted in agreements that fended off even higher tariffs.\nTrump and his economic advisers have celebrated the considerably higher tariffs that have already gone into effect, correctly noting that they have raised more than $100 billion in tax revenue without leading to catastrophic inflation or a recession, as some economists had feared.\nThe president is moving forward with new, significantly more aggressive tariffs that economists fear could exacerbate budding economic problems, including rising inflation and slowing job growth, that are just now becoming more apparent.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs:\nWhat are the new rates?\nBefore Thursday, virtually every country\u2019s goods were subject to a minimum 10% tariff. Now rates vary substantially from country to country.\nThe highest rates imposed are on goods from Brazil (50%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), Switzerland (39%), Iraq (35%) and Serbia (35%).\nAn additional 21 countries also face levies greater than 15%. That includes several countries the US relies heavily on for a variety of goods, such as Vietnam (20%), India (25%), Taiwan (20%) and Thailand (19%).\nGoods from India could also be subject to an additional 25% tariff stacked on top of that because of an executive order Trump signed Wednesday that seeks to penalize India for purchasing oil from Russia. That second tariff is slated to take effect on August 27.\nThirty-nine countries\u2019 goods, as well as members of the European Union, are subject to 15% tariffs, according to a list the White House published last week.\nBesides Canada and Mexico, all other countries the US imports goods from will continue to face a minimum 10% tariff, albeit with a few exemptions.\nGoods from Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs if they\u2019re compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. If not, goods from Mexico are subject to 25% tariffs, while goods from Canada are subject to 35% tariffs, up from 25% previously.\nWhat\u2019s the deal with the trade deals?\nIn most cases, they\u2019re not exactly trade deals, per se, but rather rough sketches of ones that could take months, or even years, to finalize \u2014 assuming they don\u2019t fall apart.\nOver the past five months, Trump announced eight trade agreements. Of those, only two \u2014 with the United Kingdom and China \u2014 have been formalized. The agreement with China, which significantly lowered tariff rates both countries imposed on one another\u2019s goods, expires on August 12. If both countries fail to act, rates could spike again.\nMost agreements Trump announced involve trading partners committing to purchasing more American products, like oil, cars, Boeing airplanes, defense equipment and agricultural goods. They also involve hundreds of billions of dollars worth of investments in American businesses.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the United States and other trading partners involved in agreements are on the same page about many of the proposed terms. For instance, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and a lead Japanese trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, both recently said many key details are still being worked out and are telling a vastly different story from Trump, who earlier this week said the country agreed to buy Ford F-150s.\nAre any goods exempt from the new tariffs?\nYes, plenty.\nOne notable exemption is smartphones, which aren\u2019t subject to any of the new rates. Additionally, goods for which Trump imposed separate sectoral tariffs or ordered investigations that could result in higher rates won\u2019t be stacked on top of country-specific \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\nFor the time being, that means pharmaceuticals, for instance, could be imported from countries duty-free. However, Trump is warning they could soon face significantly higher rates.\nThe EU sought to preempt those tariffs by negotiating a 15% tax on pharma exports to the US as part of the agreement announced with Trump. Other countries involved in trade agreements similarly are getting more favorable rates on certain sectoral tariffs.\nThere\u2019s also a partial exemption for certain goods manufactured abroad where at least 20% of their value comes from American materials and labor.\nWhen are these tariffs effective?\nTechnically they\u2019re already in effect, but there\u2019s a caveat.\nThe executive order Trump signed last week essentially states that most goods that were loaded on ships and in transit to the US before 12:01 am on Thursday will face whatever the prior tariff rates were until October 5.\nThis isn\u2019t the end\nIn addition to pharma tariffs, Trump has threatened to impose across-the-board tariffs on semiconductors and lumber. At an Oval Office event on Wednesday, for example, Trump said he would soon place a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, although he didn\u2019t give a timeline.\nAnd while the tariffs Trump just enacted could ultimately be rendered illegal, pending an ongoing court challenge, the president has plenty of levers he can pull to keep pushing his agenda for higher tariffs."

      "text": "What does TACO mean? What to know when Trump issues new tariffs after 2 delays\n- President Trump signed an executive order imposing new tariffs after his 'Liberation Day' tariffs were delayed twice.\n- This action is the latest in a series of fluctuating tariff policies during Trump's second term, leading to the term \"TACO trade\" (Trump Always Chickens Out).\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order to issue a new slate of tariffs on July 31, the latest in a long saga of policy changes for imports from countries around the world.\nReciprocal tariff rates for 70 countries will range from 15% to 41%, set to go into effect seven days from the order. Trump also separately raised the tariff rate on imports from Canada from 25% to 35%, which is set to go into effect Aug. 1.\nTariffs are a tax on goods from other countries that importers pay, and economists generally agree it leads to higher prices for consumers. Trump began imposing tariffs on imports from the U.S.'s top trade partners in February, only to change their effective date, scope or rate over the following months.\nThe on-again-off-again tariffs have been a theme of Trump's second term, leading to the creation of the term TACO. Here is what to know:\nWhat does TACO mean?\nFinancial Times columnist Robert Armstrong coined \"TACO trade\" in May, describing how some investors anticipate market rebounds amid Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies.\nThe acronym stands for \"Trump always chickens out.\"\nArmstrong describes TACO trade as many investors' strategy to buy into the market that dips when Trump announces steep tariffs on the assumption that he will back off his tariff order, and the market will rebound.\nTrump hit back at a reporter who asked about the term on May 28, saying, \"you ask a nasty question like that. It's called negotiation.\"\nTrump's tariffs have been on-again-off-again\nBack in February, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods from top trade partners Mexico and Canada and 10% on goods from China. Such was the start of a series of delays and negotiations that left Canada and Mexico relatively untouched when Trump expanded steeper tariff orders to the rest of the world in April.\nChina and the U.S. were caught up in an intense trade war where the economic powerhouses retaliated until both sides issued tariffs in the triple digits. They reached a truce in May and have discussed extending the 90-day pause while they work out a deal.\nTrump on April 2 announced widespread tariffs in what he called \"Liberation Day.\" Shortly after, he paused the climbing rates for 90 days.\nThat pause was set to expire on July 9, but instead of the tariffs going into effect, Trump extended the deadline. That deadline was Aug. 1, and Trump had said the deadline would not change, but the recent order gives it another week.\nMexico remains at 25% while it continues to work on a trade deal for the next 90 days, Trump said.\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief.\nThe White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States\u2019 most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month.\nBut smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump\u2019s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it\u2019s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday.\nThat\u2019s not to say tariffs won\u2019t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company $1.1 billion this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in.\nUnder different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple\u2019s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America come from India. And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple\u2019s largest market.\n\u201cIn terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. \u201cI think what\u2019s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they\u2019re going to capitalize on AI.\u201d\nTariffs are a hurdle but manageable\nTariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage. A combination of Apple\u2019s diversified supply chain \u2013 which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID \u2013 along with its high margins and Cook\u2019s operations expertise put the company in a strong position.\nSupply chain resilience is \u201csupposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,\u201d said Runar Bj\u00f8rhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys.\nThat held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday.\nWhile moves like these don\u2019t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically.\n\u201cLook, he\u2019s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.\u201d\nSome analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday\u2019s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future.\n\u201cBecause (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,\u201d said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation\u2019s data and analytics team. \u201cBut it is important, of course. It does present a risk.\u201d\nThat said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple\u2019s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don\u2019t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can\u2019t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don\u2019t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rhovde. \u201cBecause you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.\u201d\nCook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for \u201ca while\u201d during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company\u2019s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside.\n\u201cWell, if you look at the bulk of it, we\u2019re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we\u2019re doing the glass here, we\u2019re doing the Face ID module here, and so there\u2019s a ton of it, and we\u2019re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s a lot of content in there from United States.\u201d\nApple\u2019s AI troubles\nThe narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year \u2013 and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers.\nAnd the company\u2019s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple\u2019s. Just this week, Google posted an ad for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: \u201cIf you buy a new phone because of a feature that\u2019s coming soon, but it\u2019s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.\u201d Apple\u2019s initial batch of AI features also didn\u2019t launch in time for the iPhone 16\u2019s arrival last September.\nAt the same time, many of Apple\u2019s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple (AAPL) might reach first.\nThat\u2019s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta (META) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models.\nStill, Apple saw stellar earnings results for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales \u2013 including in China \u2013 and overall revenue.\nBut during Apple\u2019s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company\u2019s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap.\n\u201cTaking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,\u201d Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. \u201cWe are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.\u201d\nBut Apple can\u2019t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone\u2019s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm \u2013 the three of which dominate the Android phone space \u2013 to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that\u2019s the real focus on Apple right now.\u201d"

This escalation in tariffs, including a potential 100% tariff on semiconductors, is expected to impact consumer prices and business investments, with experts warning that the effects may become more noticeable in the coming months. Despite attempts by businesses to absorb costs and avoid passing them onto consumers, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs is causing hesitancy in long-term planning and investment.",
