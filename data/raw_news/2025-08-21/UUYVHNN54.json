  "content": "Spotify Vs Apple Music: Which App Offers Better Sound Quality?\n\nWhen it comes to music streaming, Spotify is the undisputed titan, its name nearly synonymous with on-demand music. But Apple Music is a compelling option, too. Apple guided the music industry into the digital age with the iPod and iTunes, giving it a strong track record here. Choosing between Apple Music and Spotify can feel overwhelming, so instead of comparing their equally large music catalogs or perusing their personalized playlists, it can be helpful to focus on what matters most. Which one sounds the best? Think of it this way: if you were picking between two restaurants for dinner, you'd probably choose the one with the best food, even if the other had a nicer atmosphere. Similarly, the most accurate AI playlists on Spotify or exclusive radio shows on Apple Music aren't going to mean much if the songs don't sound their best. I've been using both Apple Music and Spotify for several years, and while there are plenty of reasons to like both, there's a clear winner in terms of sound quality. Spotify's podcasts, AI features, and availability on nearly every platform \u2014 it works on everything from game consoles to smart speakers \u2014 may give it the edge in some ways, but sound quality is where Apple Music reigns supreme. Spotify's greatest weakness is its lack of a truly Hi-Fi experience. Here's what you need to know.\n\nIf you were expecting a deep and nuanced comparison between the sound quality of these two streaming apps, you won't find it here. There's no need to split hairs about soundstages and imaging, or to dive into subtle differences between the masters each service uses. The winner is Apple Music, and it's not even close. Apple offers high-resolution audio encoded at up to 24-bit/192kHz with Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) to please even the most fastidious audiophile, along with premium surround-sound formats like Apple Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos, all included with a paid plan. Spotify offers none of those features and delivers music in the lossy Ogg Vorbis format at a maximum bitrate of 320 kbps. Things get even worse for Spotify when you remember that its promised high-resolution streaming has yet to materialize as of 2025, despite being announced in 2021. With that said, there are a few more things to keep in mind when deciding which service to use. If you only stream music from your iPhone via Bluetooth, you won't hear a difference between Apple Music and Spotify. Because iPhones do not support high-resolution Bluetooth codecs, Apple Music's best quality audio only works with wired headphones. It's a different story for Android, which supports high-resolution codecs like Sony's LDAC and versions of Qualcomm aptX. However, Bluetooth is technically never lossless, and wired headphones are technically superior to Bluetooth of any kind, all else being equal.\n\nShould you care that Apple Music has better sound quality? If you're getting ready to cancel your Spotify subscription in favor of Apple Music, hold your horses. There are plenty of good reasons to ditch Spotify, from the infamously poor wages it pays independent musicians to the fact that artists have been pulling their music off it because of CEO Daniel Ek's links to a company manufacturing military drones. However, if audio quality is your primary concern, you should test both and choose the one that sounds best to you personally. As mentioned above, if you're among the many Americans who own an iPhone, you'll need to invest in some good-quality wired headphones to take advantage of high-resolution audio on Apple Music, or any other hi-fi audio source. AirPods won't cut it. But even should you invest in audiophile headphones, research shows that the average person cannot hear the difference between a song encoded at 320 kbps, the highest quality available from Spotify, and a Hi-Res Lossless song from Apple Music at its highest quality of 24-bit/192 kHz. That said, many listeners will likely be able to tell the difference between Spotify's Ogg Vorbis format and Apple's far superior ALAC, even without particularly fancy playback equipment. The latter delivers better dynamic range and depth, which translates to a more airy sound with a much more detailed soundstage. Ultimately, if you're looking for the best audio quality, Apple Music is the clear choice over Spotify. However, some music fans may find that Spotify's other features offer quality-of-life improvements that make it worth the reduced audio quality.",

      "text": "What Is Spotify AI Playlist & How Do You Use It?\nWith Spotify's insanely large library of 100 million songs, odds are you'll easily find your favorite tracks on the platform. Just type the song title in the search bar, hit play, and start enjoying your music. However, finding a specific song on Spotify is one thing; creating a playlist is an entirely different story.\nSometimes, you know exactly which songs you want to include in your playlist, so building it is a piece of cake. But more often than not, you don't have a clear idea of the specific tracks to use. You just know what kind of vibe you're in the mood for at certain instances \u2014 maybe something upbeat for cleaning the house, mellow tunes for a relaxing Sunday morning, or soulful ballads for a romantic dinner.\nNormally, you'd either spend hours doing your research on which songs to add or rely on a third-party tool like PlaylistAI, the ChatGPT-powered Spotify playlist generator. Fortunately, there's now an easier, official way to make your playlists on Spotify: Using the all-new AI Playlist. Here's a closer look at what this feature is, how it works, and how you can start using it.\nSpotify's all-new AI Playlist explained\nThe AI Playlist is a Spotify feature designed to help you with your next playlist. However, it's unlike the Discover Weekly and AI DJ features that automatically curate the tracks based on your listening history. Instead, you get to play an active role in creating the playlist by giving the AI Playlist some prompts to base the song selection on. These prompts are similar to what you'll typically use on AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. But for better results, Spotify recommends adding specifics like artists, genres, and decades, alongside non-musical details like places, activities, colors, and even movie characters.\nThe songs in the AI-generated playlist are then chosen based on two things: What the AI thinks fits your prompt and what your previous streaming activities are on the app. You might see a mix of music you frequently listen to and tracks from artists you're unfamiliar with. As of this writing, the AI Playlist feature is still in beta and exclusive on the mobile app (both Android and iOS) for Premium subscribers. Also, only users in the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland can currently access this feature.\nHow the Spotify AI Playlist works\nTo build a playlist that fits your needs, the Spotify AI Playlist uses several inputs you provide. The first input is your initial prompt. You can send a simple description of what you want the playlist to have, such as \"instrumental jazz for studying\" or \"awesome covers.\" You can also be more elaborate, like, \"I'm hosting a dinner party for my friends. Make me a playlist with some 2000's pop songs to play while we're enjoying our meal.\" Or \"Give me an inspiring and motivational playlist for my gym workout session.\"\nAfter sending the first prompt, the AI Playlist will proceed to build an initial list of songs. From there, you can opt to send more prompts to refine the generated playlist. These extra prompts can be something like \"add more chill songs,\" \"include female artists only,\" or \"make the playlist 40 tracks long.\"\nThe tool also gives you the option to keep or delete specific songs from the selection. Songs you choose to include will stay in your playlist even after you submit more prompts, while those you remove won't be recommended again. If you don't keep any of the songs, the AI might replace some or all of the initially included tracks once you refine the playlist.\nHow to use AI Playlist in Spotify\nTo unlock the AI Playlist feature, you'll need to get Spotify Premium first. Once you do, simply follow these steps to use the tool:\n- Launch the app on your mobile device.\n- Go to AI Playlist by navigating to Your Library, pressing the plus icon in the upper right corner, and choosing AI Playlist in the popup menu. Alternatively, simply type \"AI Playlist\" into the search bar and select the result labeled Genre. You will then be redirected to the AI Playlist chat window.\n- In the chat window, tap one of the premade prompts under Try asking if you're unsure what kind of playlist you want to make. Just scroll left to browse more options.\n- If you already have a specific playlist in mind, tap on the prompt box to input your request.\n- Hit the green arrow to send your prompt.\n- Curate your list. Tap the plus icon next to the ones you want to keep or press the minus icon on specific songs to delete them from your current playlist and any future refined versions.\n- To modify your playlist even further, press Refine this playlist at the bottom and type a new prompt. You can keep polishing the list until you're happy with the selection.\n- To add this playlist to your Spotify library, press Create.\nIf you want to make any changes later, you can still do so by navigating to Your Library, opening the AI-generated playlist, and tapping the Refine playlist at the top. If you're in a country where the AI Playlist is already available but you can't find it in your app, try updating Spotify to the latest version. If the feature is still missing, it might not be rolled out to your account yet, so check back in a few days."

      "text": "Spotify Vs. Apple Music: Streaming Service Giants Face-Off\nSpotify paved the way for this form of consuming music that lets one stream over the internet and enjoy based on mood, genre, and personal traits across various platforms. It is one of the fastest growing music streaming services \u2013 with no intention of slowing down \u2013 but not the only one. There are a handful of options, of which Apple Music is the most potent competitor. Both giants have a few things in common, from a monthly subscription to smart speaker support, but there are certain differences that make Spotify and Apple Music unique and valuable for certain types of audiophiles.\nLargely the preference will be divided over how cost-effective one service is over the other and which one really steals the show on account of music collection, quality of streaming and other value additions. We have tried to detail the possibilities of each of these aspects \u2013 comparing Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 on the parameters. This will give you a fair idea of what to expect from the service and help you arrive at a decision, instead of committing to one of the two randomly.\nWho has more on the table\nA major reason for using any streaming service is access to new music. While both Apple Music and Spotify have a large growing catalog, the difference boils down to how convenient it is for the user to interact. Of course, both services open the flood gates to premium music at a subscription cost (after three month trial period); Spotify makes it a tad flexible with the option to stream songs free of cost. The free tier is loaded with advertisements, however, it gives you an option to stream music without upgrading to the premium version.\nInterestingly, Spotify has a catalog of over 70 million songs, which Apple Music betters with way over 75 million songs. In addition, the latter also allows you to access the iTunes library and play it across devices whenever you're signed in with Apple ID.\nSpotify does allow the user to play music saved on their devices via its app, but there's no option for cloud storage. So there is a certain limitation here. It's pertinent to note, both services offer access to new music releases. Apple Music also provides access to certain exclusive music videos as well.\nIn addition to the free pass, Spotify tips the scale in its favor for being the only streaming service that offers podcasts within the app. For a comparison \u2013 Apple has a separate Podcast application. But if you're here just for music, Apple Music and Spotify are both compatible with Android and iOS and you get to use them across a range of devices from phones to smart speakers to PC and Mac.\nWho is more promising for the cost\nSpotify and Apple Music, to be fair, are subscription-based music streaming services. To that account, both charge the same $9.99 a month. In our favor, the services do give a free three-month trial before pushing the subscription gates open.\nWith the paid option you can stream any song in the catalog at any time of the day. There is an option to play songs offline, so you're covered even when you're not in the connectivity zone. The subscription option in both the services extends to family and student plans. While the student plan is chargeable at $4.99 in both services, the family plan has a subtle difference. Apple Music family plan is for $14.99 a month, Spotify offers a similar service at $15.99.\nAs previously mentioned, where Spotify edges out Apple Music is in the free, ad-supported option where users can listen to songs without a premium charge. The only free option for Apple Music customers is the Beats1 radio, which is separate of the radio stations accessible on Spotify and Apple Music both. You can stream Beats1 radio on Apple Music and listen to curated shows by real DJs. If it counts, Apple Music also gives users the option to listen to songs from their iTunes library.\nAll said and done, Spotify sweeps the arena clean with its option of Podcast. Spotify Podcast has seen tremendous progress over time. It is in fact expected to surpass Apple Podcast's monthly listener figures in the US. The idea of merging music and podcast under one roof has really worked miracles for Spotify, which is now introducing machine learning algorithm to seep in the concept of suggesting songs based on past history in Spotify music to podcasts.\nWho is better in streaming quality\nWhat good is a music streaming service with mediocre audio quality? Though the credit here depends on the platform in use, still the streaming service should have the right footing.\nSpotify looks better on paper but Apple Music has real intentions to change that in the very near future. While Spotify streams at up to 320Kbps AAC on mobile and desktop, it trickles down to 256kbs when playing music through the web. The bitrate is even lower at 128kbps in free streaming. Apple Music streams files at 256Kbps AAC and is expected to add option for lossless audio streaming and Dolby Atmos spatial audio from June this year at no additional charge. Apple Music could potentially scale to a new level with this interesting addition when it does make it to the service.\nOf course, the scenario will change When Apple Music launches these new features. For now, we will stick with Spotify for the ready specifics. Note: Spotify is also planning on introducing HiFi lossless audio streaming which should scale up the bitrate for streaming songs to 1,411kbps.\nWho offers better experience\nTo keep it precise, Apple Music and Spotify both have a clean and easy-to-use interface. Spotify has a dark appearance; the challenger has a fresh white app but both are designed to make the real purpose of searching music, navigating the library and switching to radio seamless.\nWhen playing your favorite track, both streaming services offer the option of displaying the lyrics for your karaoke practice. Searching music to your liking at any particular time of the day shouldn't be a problem if you know the name of the song; but what if you don't. Spotify here has an edge with the option to let you search songs based on lyrics.\nThe final thought\nApple Music and Spotify learn from what you listen to, your likes and dislikes, and then tailor themselves to serve you recommended music. Both the services take substantial time to pick up your taste but Spotify somehow does a better job at serving specific recommendations. Apple Music may allow you to interact and mix your iTunes library but Spotify is an outright winner with its free streaming option. If you don't mind paying a premium your decision may roll back to personal preference, but again, you can put Spotify on the higher step, for better compatibility with different devices across iOS and Android platforms."

      "text": "Do Wired Headphones Really Sound Better Than Bluetooth? Here's What You Need To Know\nFun fact: Bluetooth has Viking origins. Creator Jim Kardach was inspired by Danish king Harald Bluetooth, famous for uniting his people and conquering Norway. According to National Geographic, Harald got his curious moniker for having a \"dark\" tooth \u2014 the adjective for a dark color in Old Norse also means \"blue.\" Kardach found a use for this historical analogy of uniting or conquering all the different \"tribes\" and placing them under one \"banner,\" and thus Bluetooth was born. Even the logo is Viking \u2014 it's a combination of King Bluetooth's runic initials. Fast forward to today, and the technology is the default wireless audio standard across all devices. It's convenient, takes seconds to set up, and helps you get rid of all those snaggly cables. But the moment you so much as mention buying a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones, someone is bound to push their glasses up the bridge of their nose and point out, \"Yeah, but Bluetooth is worse than wired, actually.\"\nIt's a common refrain in online audio communities. Bluetooth compression just ruins your songs, people say, and therefore you should always opt for wired audio devices. Does Bluetooth actually sound worse, though? Taking a closer look, you'll find that this assumption is not as cut and dried as it first may seem. We're here to set the record straight. Let's discuss the truth in the claim, and whether it's worth your money to invest in wireless cans.\nHow Bluetooth works\nTo better answer the question, let's do a quick primer on Bluetooth technology, because this stuff is black magic. Bluetooth uses low-power radio waves in the 2.4 GHz frequency band (encompassing 79 channels) to transmit wireless music, send files, control peripherals, print documents, and so much more. The tech operates within a tiny bandwidth between 2.4 and 2.4835 GHz yet can transmit about 3 Mbps (megabits per second). And though its range is typically about 33 feet, it can reach over a kilometer in certain applications.\nWhere Bluetooth really boggles the mind is how it transmits your data of choice. Once two devices are paired, they share keys so they can recognize each other in the future and keep data encrypted. Then, they do \"frequency hopping,\" switching channels up to 1,600 times per second to avoid signal collisions, reduce interference, and strengthen security against malicious interception. Bluetooth employs codecs to send the data (these determine sound quality and performance), which can be swapped on the fly in response to changing conditions such as physical obstacles and interference.\nThis is why you can have a half dozen Bluetooth devices working in the same small space that still function just fine alongside Wi-Fi and other radio signals. The technology is also constantly evolving, with new versions improving encryption, range, power efficiency, and stability. But how does it compare to wired headphones?\nWired headphones are technically superior to Bluetooth\nYes, wired headphones, sonically speaking, are better than Bluetooth. Wires are the fastest way to transfer data of any kind, so you can get full, uncompromising, lossless 32-bit sound at 196 kHz \u2014 in layman's terms, the best music quality that current tech can reproduce. This allows you to hear music the way the artist intended, almost as if you were there in person. Not a single detail goes missing. Bluetooth can't hold a candle to this \u2014 the creme-de-la-creme LDAC codec allows for a max of 32-bit/96 kHz, and that's before accounting for Bluetooth's weaknesses.\nWired headphones also exhibit almost no perceptible latency. Electricity is the speed limit of your sound, which in a wire travels at up to 90% of the speed of light. So, wired headphones \u2014 assuming you're not using an amp and/or digital-to-analog converter (DAC) \u2014 usually get about 5 milliseconds of latency. Bluetooth gets about 34 to 200 milliseconds depending on the codec and version of the tech you use, primarily due to the audio compression/decompression process. This is noticeable, and though it may not be a problem for music, it can make watching videos (dialogue in particular) bothersome.\nNow, this isn't to say wired headphones reign supreme in reproducing sound at all times, in all situations. It's naive to assume that a cheap pair of gas station earbuds is going to outperform anything without a headphone jack. But more on that later.\nBluetooth can produce high-quality audio\nThere are a lot of caveats when using Bluetooth: Its narrow bandwidth limits the sample rate, bit depth, and bit rate of music files; it suffers unstable data rates from signal interference, physical obstacles, and distance between devices; its psychoacoustic compression algorithms sometimes eliminate (typically imperceptible) data to save space. The point here is that Bluetooth is going to be lossy barring perfect conditions.\nYet Bluetooth can still produce high-quality audio. A common misunderstanding is that codecs always ruin music quality, but this is not necessarily true. If you're using the same codec on both your headphones and audio device, the codec has enough bandwidth for your music files, there's minimal interference, and the units are close, then sound quality should be virtually identical to a pair of wired headphones.\nCompression means a lot of things these days (such as YouTube's compression to reduce video size), so it's important to understand how Bluetooth does it. The key word here is \"codec,\" short for compression/decompression. Akin to a .zip file, Bluetooth packages data in a smaller space for the trip and unpacks it at the other end, preserving a song in transit. Audio degradation (aside from the factors we've already mentioned) occurs mostly if you're using two different codecs, which results in an effect similar to re-encoding a lossy MP3 file. So if you're listening to, say, a high-quality 264 kbps AAC file using the AAC Bluetooth codec on wireless headphones, it likely won't sound any worse than wired.\nThe average person probably won't hear the difference\nThe core premise of the \"Bluetooth is worse\" argument tends to be an audiophile one. After all, Bluetooth is, apples to apples, technically worse than wired audio. But does that distinction mean much in the case of real-life use for the average person? Not really. For starters, most people can't even tell the difference between a lossy and lossless audio file. Surveys using A/B tests have shown that only a minority of people can. Even professional musicians (like Benn Jordan) have admitted that they cannot distinguish a high-quality MP3 from a lossless file.\nTests comparing Bluetooth and wired headphones have yielded similar results, suggesting people usually can't differentiate them. Only someone with above-average natural hearing acuity (or rather, ears trained by experience) may find ever-so-slight frequency differences between the two. There's a very good chance that human psychology is at play here. If you've been told for years that Bluetooth is worse and then put on a pair of Bluetooth headphones to listen, you may be unwittingly conditioned to agree with that assessment.\nIt's important to note here that technology has improved drastically over time. Lossless digital music used to be a night-and-day difference from lossy, but these days compression algorithms are exceptionally good at delivering pristine audio at lower bitrates. The same goes for Bluetooth codecs. Even with all this being the case, let's look at some things you can do to ensure your Bluetooth music sounds its best.\nThe Bluetooth codec you use is the primary deciding factor\nAbove all else, the Bluetooth codec in your headphones and listening device will determine how good your sound is. There are many to choose from \u2014 SBC, AAC, aptX, LDAC, and more \u2014 and your devices automatically choose and switch codecs for the best balance of quality and connection strength. If you want to select them yourself, though, you can. If you're using an Android, you have to enable developer options. Unfortunately, most other platforms like iPhone, Mac, and Windows won't easily let you.\nNot all codecs are equal, so going with the default may not ensure the best audio quality. SBC, the baseline codec available on almost all devices, tends to produce the lowest-quality audio of the bunch at 328 kbps max. LDAC, on the opposite end of the spectrum, has a variable bitrate that can reach 990 kbps. In simpler terms, that's two-thirds of the way to CD quality. It goes without saying you should choose LDAC if precision, hi-fi audio is your aim.\nThen there's the issue of compatibility. Not all headphones and devices support all codecs. iPhones, for example, only support AAC, as does Apple's Bluetooth AirPods lineup. Even Sony's top-of-the-line XM5 only supports SBC, AAC, and LDAC. Remember: Using two different codecs will cause data loss and spoil your audio quality, so you should check to ensure both your streaming device and headphones are on the same page. Changing codecs manually, as we've mentioned, tends to be difficult unless your headphones app allows it.\nA bad audio source results in poor quality regardless\nEven if you've optimized your Bluetooth to use the best codec possible, it will mean nothing with a shoddy source. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out. Take YouTube, for example, a way many people listen to free music. You might be quick to blame your Bluetooth headphones for spoiling your YouTube music playlist, but the true culprit would be YouTube's comparatively low 126 kbps bitrate.\nSuppose that you pay for a streaming service like Spotify. If you don't have its lossless HiFi plan, the service won't necessarily provide high-quality audio. Spotify's \"very high\" option with the standard plan (which streams at 320 kbps) isn't enabled by default, and many people leave it off to avoid eating up their mobile data. So if you listen to Spotify at default settings, you're getting a measly 160 kbps \u2014 again, Bluetooth is not the weak link here.\nIf you're hell-bent on having the best wireless audio experience possible, load up your listening device with lossless audio files such as FLAC and make sure your phone is using a high-bitrate codec like LDAC. All things considered, you'll probably be fine with a 320 kbps MP3 file, and you'll save space on your mobile device as well. Premium streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music also let you download music offline so you don't have to worry about your audio quality automatically downgrading when the cell signal is bad.\nSound quality depends in great part on your headphones\nAt the end of the day, using Spotify's HiFi lossless streaming tier won't mean a thing if you go with those no-brand gas station earbuds that cost all of $5. You want the best audio quality? You'll need to invest in the gear that can provide it. While there are audiophile headphones for sub-$100, many easily approach $2,000 and beyond. The point is that music quality is more dependent on headphone engineering than on wired versus Bluetooth.\nGenerally speaking, better headphones are more forgiving of Bluetooth's deficiencies. High-end Bluetooth headphones like Sony's WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra will bring out the best even a lowly MP3 using the SBC codec has to offer \u2014 though you'll have to pay through the nose to get them. If you can't (or don't want to) shell out almost $400, then there are plenty of wonderful budget-friendly alternatives. Keep in mind that many Bluetooth headphones include ANC (active noise canceling) to remove unwanted ambient sound. This ANC may alter music quality ever so slightly, especially for more perceptive listeners, and degrade your Bluetooth listening experience. Try switching off your headphones' ANC if the sound quality seems insufficient.\nAnd in truth, headphones aren't even the gold standard among audiophiles since most treat speakers as the end game. If you're looking to headphones as the solution for an unparalleled listening experience, you're going in the wrong direction.\nYour listening environment will impact Bluetooth quality\nWired headphones sound the same everywhere. As we've previously established, Bluetooth's limited bandwidth means it's always at risk of interference from other radio sources and physical obstacles that impede its signals. The average home is full of Bluetooth-disrupting radio sources like smart TVs, Wi-FI routers, appliances, and more. Even if you've only got typical gypsum walls, they'll still serve as hurdles for Bluetooth.\nLeaving your house, you'll likely be using your wireless headphones in areas packed with radio signals and physical obstructions, like a busy mall or a crowded public subway train. Don't forget that Bluetooth operates on only 79 channels, so imagine the challenge when you have just a couple dozen Bluetooth devices in close proximity. Of course, the FCC is working to widen the spectrum of unlicensed bands (frequencies any device can use), so this problem may be mitigated with time.\nThe distance between your headphones and streaming device will also impact sound quality. Suppose you leave your phone in one room and go into another. It won't be just the walls causing intermittency and poor audio quality \u2014 these issues will crop up the closer you get to a maximum recommended distance. To sum up, Bluetooth users pay for the convenience of audio quality that depends heavily on their environment. If you want the best wireless audio quality, you'll need to get away from the places that ruin it.\nWireless music can already be lossless\nBluetooth may never be able to produce lossless music, but that doesn't mean that wireless music as a whole is a lost cause for audiophiles. In fact, you can listen to lossless music wireless right now \u2014 if you have the right gear. Qualcomm's Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless bypasses Bluetooth's limitations by sending the music over Wi-Fi instead. Wi-Fi is broad enough that aggressive compression isn't necessary, so the only compromise you'll be making is slightly increased battery consumption.\naptX Lossless is in its infancy and is only supported on about 45 Android phones at the time of this writing \u2014 none of which are made by major manufacturers like Samsung and Google Pixel. Only Qualcomm Snapdragon-chipped devices can run it, and less than a dozen headphones and earbuds are currently able to decode it. Apple users who own the AirPods 2 Pro (USB-C version) may get Apple's own proprietary lossless, wireless audio sometime in 2024, though only on the costly Vision Pro at first. We don't have any news on when it will hit other devices. To be fair to wireless audio, this is brand-new tech just barely dipping its toes in consumer markets. There's good reason to hope this standard will see major improvements in the coming years alongside more widespread adoption.\nTaking a different approach\nIt's time to take a step back and look at this discussion from a bird's eye view. At the end of the day, music is a highly subjective thing. Audiophiles (like elitists in any community) often make the mistake of assuming that their high standards apply to the world at large. They don't. Most people listen to music on whatever headphones are readily available, in noisy environments, often with their attention divided. These circumstances are not conducive to hearing music at its best, so adding Bluetooth on top won't make a difference.\nAs we've demonstrated, Bluetooth can produce high-quality audio, so when people say \"Bluetooth is worse,\" they're not just oversimplifying in a way that's not true. They're also making an argument that's been spearheaded by marketers in the music gear and music streaming industries. Companies exploit the feeling that we're missing out on sound at its best and convince us to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment and software to rectify the situation. Yet many audiophiles know from experience that you can spend thousands of dollars on equipment and never get to a point where you're satisfied enough to stop.\nPeople listen to music for enjoyment. They like their music whether it's on those gas station headphones or a $20,000 pair of speakers. Our suggestion is this: Listen to music however you like. Don't get too hung up on the technicalities between wired and Bluetooth headphones.\nHow to decide on the best headphones for you\nIt's pretty clear at this point that Bluetooth versus wired shouldn't be the linchpin of your headphone purchasing decision unless you're a sound engineer, professional musician, or audiophile. Instead, focus on what makes music listening enjoyable and what fits your budget. If Bluetooth comes into the equation, let it be for added convenience (or lack thereof, since it's another device to charge) rather than a compromise in the audio department.\nThe most important thing you can focus on is fit and weight. A good pair of headphones shouldn't put too much pressure on your ears, get too hot in the cups, or lead to neck strain. Avoid headphones with an over-tight band \u2014 especially one that digs into the top of your head \u2014 or you'll probably experience headaches. The second most important thing is finding a frequency response you like. Most enjoy the Harman curve, but your mileage may vary. After that, consider useful features. Look for cans that fold up for transport or come with a removable cable.\nA good reason to buy Bluetooth is ANC (active noise canceling), which is ideal for protecting your hearing in our noise-polluted cities. You may also have to bite the bullet if your phone lacks an audio jack, though a good USB-C dongle is an easy solution. Apple users with multiple devices will love AirPods for ecosystem benefits like fast, automatic device switching. Simply put, make the decision that's best for you."

  "argos_summary": "Apple Music outperforms Spotify in audio quality, offering lossless 24\u2011bit/192\u202fkHz ALAC and Dolby Atmos/Spatial Audio, while Spotify\u2019s best is a 320\u202fkbps Ogg Vorbis stream and its promised Hi\u2011Fi tier has yet to launch. Spotify excels in other areas such as a free ad\u2011supported tier, podcasts, and AI\u2011generated playlists, but users seeking the best sound must use wired headphones or high\u2011resolution Bluetooth codecs. Wired headphones deliver the highest fidelity and lowest latency, whereas Bluetooth can approach similar quality if the same codec is used on both devices and the source is high\u2011bitrate. Ultimately, the choice hinges on whether audio fidelity or convenience and feature set is the priority for the listener.}",
