      "feedback": "The draft ambitiously applies a three-regime framework but falls short of a tight, world-class presentation: the causal chain from platform economics to valuation is not consistently anchored to first-principles drivers, the four-line Movers/Scenarios format is not satisfied (no exact 2 Up/2 Down quartet with the required fields), and the Trade/Outlook plan is underdefined or misaligned with the tradability of ACMR. Actionable edits: rebuild Movers & Scenarios into exactly four lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with the format Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and attach every factual claim to source IDs (e.g., base GMV/revenue dynamics to QFDWCTAYB; labor/policy channels to 4LQD15CFU and S5GX78VMT; 2025 guidance, long-run path, and catalysts to SK994CBWR/GX057ADL7; macro/cloud/AI backdrop to 0G3A). Build a crisp first-principles chain: platform breadth and network effects drive GMV growth → revenue uplift → margin leverage and cash flow → higher valuation multiples; explicitly tie upside to monetization of AI/marketing/fulfillment across layers and downside to GMV deceleration or misallocation, citing QFDWCTAYB for base signals and the regime-sensitive catalysts (e.g., AI monetization progress; labor/policy cost discipline) from 4LQD15CFU and S5GX78VMT. Quantify with exact numbers from the material (GMV +27% to $163B; revenue +29% to $5.0B; OI +51%; 2025 rev guide $850–$950M; long-run path to $1.4B by 2028) and attribute them to the relevant lines, while pruning or bracket­ing contested / off-topic items (e.g., Ford auto-history claims in JVKCZAPVG or peripheral macro notes) unless they feed ACMR’s thesis. For the Outlook/Trade plan, deliver a single tradable-line Swing if ACMR is liquid (e.g., Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability | Confidence) using SK994CBWR anchors, or a concise one-line Outlook if not tradable, ensuring the Trigger and Invalidation are concrete (e.g., a Q2’25 print or a 2025 guidance update) and all numeric references carry IDs. Finally, sharpen the watch-list into 3–4 tightly scoped, ID-tagged signals (GMV trajectory, AI monetization milestones, policy/labor cost discipline, export-control risk) and ensure the prose adheres strictly to the horizon/style constraints, with no trailing citation lists and no extraneous macro-threads.",
