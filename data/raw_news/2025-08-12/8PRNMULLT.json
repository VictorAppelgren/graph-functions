  "content": "Mexico turned over 26 cartel members wanted for crimes in the US to American authorities as part of the latest deal with the Trump administration.\n\nThe prisoners include leaders and managers of several Mexican drug cartels and they\u2019re facing charges like murder, hostage-taking, human smuggling and kidnapping, the US Department of Justice announced Tuesday.\n\nOne of the \u201cfugitives\u201d sent to the US is Abigael Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, a high-ranking leader of the \u201cLos Cuinis\u201d organization that helped finance and grow the notorious cartel Jalisco New Generation, better known as CJNG, according to the DOJ.\n\nValencia is also the brother-in-law of CJNG leader Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, a top target who the US government is offering $15 million just for information that could lead to his capture or conviction.\n\nAnd one of Valencia\u2019s brothers, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Valencia, was sentenced in Washington\u2019s federal court to 30 years in June after pleading guilty to international cocaine trafficking. He was originally busted in 2017 while vacationing at a beach resort in Brazil under a fake name.\n\nRoberto Salazar, another prisoner shipped to the states, had been sought in connection to the murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Juan Escalante in 2008, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAnother man, Abdul Karim Conteh, is a national from Sierra Leone who was held in Mexico for allegedly smuggling migrants from countries in and around the Middle East, according to the DOJ. He had no listed affiliation with a cartel.\n\n\u201cToday is the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s historic efforts to dismantle cartels and foreign terrorist organizations. These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores \u2014 under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country. We are grateful to Mexico\u2019s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter,\u201d Attorney General Pamela Bondi said.\n\nUS Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson added: \u201cThese fugitives will now face justice in U.S. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.\u201d\n\nIn February, 29 cartel figures were handed over to the US, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero who was previously linked to the murder of a US Drug Enforcement Administration agent in 1985. Since then, many have begun to face terror charges for their alleged crimes.\n\nThat same month, the Trump administration classified CJNG and seven other Latin American-based crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations and secretly authorized the military to fight them by land and sea.\n\nThe second round of inmates were all flown to US soil after the DOJ agreed not to seek the death penalty against any defendants or cartel affiliates in February\u2019s transfer, a source close to the matter told The Associated Press.\n\nThe ongoing deal and second transfer is the culmination of ever-increasing pressure from the Trump administration to curb drug trafficking and smuggling across the US-Mexico border.",

      "text": "Warning graphic content\nWild daylight brawl breaks out among swimsuit-clad boaters at Florida lake in front of families, kids: video\nA wild brawl broke out among a group of swimsuit-clad boaters at a Florida lake over the weekend \u2014 in which one man was knocked unconscious and left floating face down in the water, shocking video shows.\nThe unruly fight happened at Lake Winterset in Polk County, in front of young children relaxing on the lakeside with their families, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nSeven men and a 17-year-old boy were arrested, Sheriff Grady Judd announced Tuesday, as he vowed to make an example out of the hooligans.\nThe dramatic footage starts when one of the men is slugged twice by another before he flops to the ground and appears to be unconscious. Once he went face down, the others started swinging.\nPunches fly seemingly at random as a woman in a pink bikini attempts CPR on the knocked-out man, the clip played by the sheriff shows.\nThe chaos stilled for a moment as one of the taller men wearing a gigantic gold chain tried to hold back another man who thrashed wildly in his arms.\nThe two tripped over a ledge and into the lake before the man who threw the first punch dove in out of nowhere and started walloping another man, who was also knocked unconscious face down in the lake.\nMason Land, Nate Land, Payton Ely, Timothy Gooding, Richard Carden, Garrett Ore, Garrett Hiltabidel and an unidentified 17-year-old have since been arrested for the violence and all face charges for rioting, affray, trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\nAll of the men were in their late teens and early 20s, except for Carden, who is 40 years old.\nThe fed-up sheriff promised an unflinching crackdown on delinquency throughout the county, specifically on properties like the Winterset sandbar.\n\u201cYou can knucklebust and create brain injuries to each other on your own property without creating a disturbance to your neighbors. It\u2019s over, folks. I think I\u2019ve said that enough,\u201d Judd said.\n\u201cThe conduct is reprehensible and, obviously, you don\u2019t believe us when we try to warn you. So you have unleashed the teeth of the dog, and now we\u2019re going to start biting you, just like we bit these guys here.\u201d\nRabble-rousing young people tend to crop up near the Winterset sandbar for all types of criminality, including public displays of indecency and sexual activity captured by neighboring property owners, the sheriff said.\nIn May, the Polk County Commission passed an ordinance that would keep boaters away from the shoreline at specific lakes, including the sandbar on Lake Winterset. It has just reached the final stages of state approval by early August, Judd said, but it hasn\u2019t gone into effect yet.\nIn the wake of the fight, Judd added that the sheriff\u2019s office will be meeting with the county attorneys to explore imposing an extra noise ordinance at the lake.\nLake Winterset is just 2 miles away from LEGOLAND Florida, a theme park resort based on the popular children\u2019s toy."

Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Centre, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"

      "text": "Mexican cartel borrows brutal new tactics from Middle East terrorists\nMexico\u2019s most powerful drug cartel has turned to al Qaeda- and Taliban-inspired guerrilla tactics in a bloody new phase of its battle to wipe out its rivals.\nThe Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known by its Spanish-language acronym, CJNG, is using landmines and explosives-laden drones to kill other gang members, cops and soldiers in a savage campaign of murder. The gang is also working with Middle Eastern jihadi \u201ctechnical advisers,\u201d according to Mexican law enforcement and security sources.\n\u201cTheir philosophy is basically if you are not with us, you are against us,\u201d said Robert Almonte, a Texas-based security consultant and expert on Mexican cartels.\n\u201cThat includes the police that refuse to be on their payroll, local communities and their rivals. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that they are consulting with terrorists because what they are engaging in are acts of terrorism.\u201d\nThe Mexican army defused 12 handmade landmines last week in Tepalcatepec, in Michoacan state, where the CJNG is dominant, according to Milenio, a national newspaper based in Monterrey. One powerful explosive damaged an armored vehicle and injured 10 soldiers, the paper said.\nThe state is heavily controlled by the Jalisco cartel and is among the most dangerous areas in the country, with 200 homicides reported this year. Last year, the state recorded more than 2,700 murders, according to law enforcement data.\nMexican security experts cited by Milenio described most of the CJNG explosives as metal pipes filled with gunpowder and attached to a battery and detonator. The devices are buried underground and explode upon contact with a vehicle.\n\u201cJalisco Nueva Generacion was the first to use drones with explosives attached to them, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that they are now using landmines and taking a page from al Qaeda,\u201d Almonte told The Post.\n\u201cThe mines are something new for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey appear to be similar to the ones used against US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\nLast month, the Jalisco cartel used a drone to drop explosives on an encampment of displaced people in a Michoacan forest, according to El Universal newspaper. The video footage, taken from the drone, shows dozens of people running for their lives as the explosives ignite trees in a fiery blaze near the municipality of Tepalcatepec.\nThe municipality is at the crossroads where the CJNG is fighting a turf war against its main rival, the Carteles Unidos, a criminal organization made up of gangs, including Cartel de Tepalcatepec, Los Viagras and other groups bent on destroying the CJNG, according to InSight Crime.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now had four months of insecurity,\u201d said Tepalcatepec Mayor Martha Laura Mendoza last month. \u201cBut nobody turns around to see [what\u2019s happening]. This is the only municipality where there are more than 3,000 displaced people. Four months and no one provides a solution.\u201d\nIn September 2021, five men who were guarding a checkpoint to keep cartel members out of the region were decapitated by CJNG, according to reports. The Jalisco cartel also warned local residents in audio recordings to keep out of their way.\nLed by Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes (aka El Mencho), CJNG is among Mexico\u2019s most violent cartels, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\nThe cartel is particularly known for its bold attacks on Mexican security forces. A 2015 ambush by the cartel left 15 officers dead. The group was also behind an assassination attempt on Mexico City\u2019s police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch in 2020, when the top cop was shot at 414 times but wasn\u2019t hit, though two bodyguards and one passerby were killed.\nEl Mencho is the most wanted man in Mexico and among the most wanted in the US, with a DEA bounty of $10 million for information leading to his capture.\nIn November, Mexican security forces arrested El Mencho\u2019s wife, Rosalinda Gonzalez, who headed up the criminal organization\u2019s finances. She was released on $78,000 bail."

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger whines about being kept up at night by \u2018relentless\u2019 inmate taunts at maximum security lockup: report\nConvicted killer Bryan Kohberger has whined that he\u2019s \u201cextremely annoyed\u201d and losing sleep at the maximum security prison he now calls home \u2014 thanks to fellow inmates who constantly yell through vents into his cell in a \u201crelentless\u201d taunting campaign, according to a report.\nKohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month for slaying four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement.\nAnd the prisoners at Kohberger\u2019s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it out for the convicted criminology student \u2014 taking turns shouting into the vent that leads into his cell most hours of the day, a law enforcement source told the Daily Mail.\nKohberger, 28, has made multiple complaints to prison guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep, according to Chris McDonough, a retired homicide detective who works for the Cold Case Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough told the outlet. \u201cThe inmates are tormenting him at night and almost all hours of the day \u2014 taunting him through the vents in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cThey are literally getting up into the grate and yelling at him. The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one-hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact he copped to such abhorrent crimes makes him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop said.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail that Kohberger was previously kept in while he awaited trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking showers upwards of an hour long and staying awake at night only to nap during the day.\nOnce, he confronted another defendant who yelled \u201cyou suck\u201d at a sports player on the TV because he thought the man was insulting Kohberger and his mom as they spoke on the phone.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of facing the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted to killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow."

      "text": "DEA\u2019s most wanted drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero arrives in NYC to face charges after Mexico hands him over to US\nA drug cartel kingpin, known as the US Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s top target for his role in the killing of a DEA agent, was moved from Mexico to New York City on Thursday and is expected to face a judge on Friday, according to officials and sources.\nRafael Caro Quintero was among 29 cartel members the Mexican government released into US custody as President Trump has threatened to slap imports from Mexico with a 25% tariff on March 4 if the country doesn\u2019t do more to crackdown on illegal immigration drug smuggling.\n\u201cObviously, this is one of the biggest days in decades for DEA agents,\u201d Ray Donovan, the former head of New York\u2019s DEA office, told The Post. \u201cThis is very near and dear to every DEA agent.\u201d\n\u201cThis is bigger than Chapo for me and every other DEA Agent,\u201d Donovan added, referring to Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, whom he\u2019s credited with capturing. \u201cThis was personal.\u201d\nDEA Acting Administrator Derek Maltz said there is \u201cone name\u201d in the group of 29 cartel members \u201cthat stands above the rest for the men and women\u201d of his agency \u2013 Quintero.\nQuintero, 72, arrived in the Big Apple Thursday night and will likely be moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Donovan said.\nThe cartel kingpin is expected to arraigned on Friday in Brooklyn Federal Court on drug-trafficking charges, sources said.\nQuintero was convicted in Mexico for being the mastermind of the 1985 killing of US DEA agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena and for the last two years has been sitting in a Guadalajara prison, sources said.\nHe was sent to New York while some of the other cartel members were flown to other US cities.\n\u201cThe defendants taken into US custody today include leaders and managers of drug cartels recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\u201d the Justice Department said in a statement.\nThe DOJ noted that many of the many of the defendants had longstanding extradition requests that \u201cwere not honored\u201d during the Biden administration and that the Mexican government complied as a direct result of Trump ordering drug cartels to be designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\n\u201cThey are no longer just criminals,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThey are terrorists.\u201d\n\u201cI do think that drug trafficking as we know it will change,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis action is part of the work of coordination, cooperation and bilateral reciprocity within the framework of respect for the sovereignty of both nations,\u201d the Mexican government said.\nDonovan noted the transfer of custody of a Mexican drug lord is easier if they\u2019re labeled a terrorist since they don\u2019t have the legal protections of someone being extradited.\nThe Justice Department said it will evaluate whether terrorism charges are appropriate for the 29 individuals.\nQuintero is following the same path as \u201cEl Chapo,\u201d who was moved to the US and held in 2017 at the maximum-security wing of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He was sentenced in US District Court to life in prison.\nDonovan said he sees the parallels between \u201cEl Chapo\u201d and Quintero\u2019s path to US custody.\nThe arrest of RCQ could bring some closure to the slain DEA agent\u2019s wife who is still alive and son who is a San Diego-based judge, sources said.\nThere are pending charges in New York, Texas and California against Quintero but none are for murder, sources said.\n\u201cWhen he goes to trial the Kiki homicide will come out and the fact he ordered the killing will be revealed,\u201d Donovan said.\n\u201cAs President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\u201cWe will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers \u2014 and in some cases, given their lives \u2014 to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels. We will not rest until we secure justice for the American people.\u201d\nThe transfer of custody of the cartel members was announced by both the US and Mexican government on the same day Trump announced that he plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican goods on March 4.\n\u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday.\n\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\u201d the president added."
