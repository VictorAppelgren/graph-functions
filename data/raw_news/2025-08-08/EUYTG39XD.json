  "description": "\u201c\u2018Natural\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean safe,\u201d Dr. Joseph Volpicelli warned.",
  "content": "At least according to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who\u2019s launching a federal crackdown on 7-OH \u2014 a synthetic byproduct of the kratom plant.\n\nSold widely in gas stations, convenience stores, and smoke shops, the opioid-like substance is drawing scrutiny for its potent effects and high risk of abuse.\n\nKratom is an herbal extract made from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tree called Mitragyna. Users chew the leaves, brew them into tea or take it in powder, capsule or extract form, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cKratom affects the brain like a stimulant at low doses \u2014 boosting energy, focus and mood,\u201d Dr. Joseph Volpicelli, a clinical adviser for Oar Health, told The Post. \u201cSimilar to a sedative at higher doses, it also provides pain relief and euphoria.\u201d\n\nIts popularity has soared in the US in recent years, with many turning to it as a so-called natural fix for pain, anxiety, depression and even to kick opioid addiction.\n\nKratom is legal for adult use at the federal level, though the FDA hasn\u2019t approved it for any medical purpose. Several states \u2014 including Alabama, Rhode Island and Wisconsin \u2014 have banned its sale and possession outright.\n\nKratom can cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dry mouth, itching and loss of appetite \u2014 with heavier use sometimes leading to seizures, hallucinations, liver damage and even death, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nNational poison control centers documented 1,807 calls about kratom exposures between 2011 and 2017, a number that\u2019s \u201conly been increasing since then,\u201d Dr. Michael Greco, an emergency medicine physician, told The Post this week.\n\nA Washington Post analysis found kratom listed in at least 4,100 deaths from 2020 to 2022. Last year, the Tampa Bay Times uncovered more than 580 kratom-related deaths in Florida alone since 2013.\n\n\u201cIt can be especially risky when mixed with other substances or used in high doses, like we have seen in the drink \u2018Feel Free,\u2019\u201d Volpicelli noted.\n\nThough some people say that it has helped them wean off or manage other dependencies, including to opioids and alcohol, kratom can be highly addictive in its own right \u2014 especially for people who already struggle with addiction.\n\n\u201cIn the past two years, I have noticed an increased number of people coming to my clinic for the treatment of kratom addiction,\u201d Volpicelli said.\n\n\u201cThese people find it difficult to control their use of kratom and experience opioid-like withdrawal symptoms when they stop.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because kratom\u2019s active ingredients \u2014 mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) \u2014 bind to the same brain receptors as morphine and alcohol, triggering a rush of dopamine, the body\u2019s \u201cfeel good hormone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat creates a dangerous, addictive cycle where kratom use increases the craving for more use,\u201d Volpicelli said.\n\nOver time, users can build a tolerance and face withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, muscle pain, irritability and even involuntary jerky movements, according to American Addiction Centers.\n\nWhat is 7-OH \u2014 and is it more dangerous?\n\nWhile 7-OH can be found naturally in kratom in small amounts, manufacturers have figured out how to supercharge it \u2014 boosting its concentrations in capsules, powders, liquids and edibles.\n\nSome of these souped-up products contain 109% to 509% more 7-OH than what\u2019s naturally in the plant. Experts warn that means they will have stronger effects \u2014 and a greater risk for addiction and harm.\n\n\u201c7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine,\u201d FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement.\n\nThe synthetic byproduct isn\u2019t legal in dietary supplements or food products. There are no approved drugs containing it, and no legal basis for companies to claim it helps with pain or anxiety, according to the agency.\n\n\u201cConsumers who use 7-OH products are exposing themselves to products that have not been proven safe or effective for any use,\u201d the FDA warned.\n\nWhat is the federal government doing about 7-OH?\n\nThe FDA is pushing to add the opioid-like ingredient to the federal controlled substances list.\n\nThe agency wants 7-OH classified as Schedule I, a category reserved for illicit drugs with no medical use and a high potential for abuse \u2014 alongside heroin and LSD.\n\nIn a recent report, the FDA said it\u2019s still concerned about kratom in general, but 7-OH\u2019s heightened risks demand urgent action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not targeting the kratom leaf or ground-up kratom,\u201d said Makary. \u201cWe are targeting a concentrated synthetic byproduct that is an opioid.\u201d\n\nNext up, the DEA will review 7-OH and decide whether to officially label it an illicit drug. A national ban wouldn\u2019t kick in until new rules are drafted and finalized.\n\n\u201cVape stores are popping up in every neighborhood in America, and many are selling addictive products like concentrated 7-OH,\u201d Makary warned. \u201cAfter the last wave of the opioid epidemic, we cannot get caught flat-footed again.\u201d\n\nThe American Kratom Association (AKA), which has fought restrictions on the plant for years, praised the FDA\u2019s crackdown on 7-OH.\n\n\u201cThese 7-OH products are not kratom. They are chemically altered substances that carry potent opioid-like effects and pose an imminent threat to consumers,\u201d Mac Haddow, senior fellow on public policy at AKA, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis move sends a clear and long-overdue message: the safety of the American public comes first.\u201d",

      "text": "Notes from the Field: Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths with Kratom Detected \u2014 27 States, July 2016\u2013December 2017\nWeekly / April 12, 2019 / 68(14);326\u2013327\nEmily O\u2019Malley Olsen, PhD1; Julie O\u2019Donnell, PhD1; Christine L. Mattson, PhD1; Joshua G. Schier, MD1; Nana Wilson, PhD1 (View author affiliations)\nView suggested citationKratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant native to Southeast Asia, contains the alkaloid mitragynine, which can produce stimulant effects in low doses and some opioid-like effects at higher doses when consumed (1). Use of kratom has recently increased in popularity in the United States, where it is usually marketed as a dietary or herbal supplement (1). Some studies suggest kratom has potential for dependence and abuse (1,2). As of April 2019, kratom was not scheduled as a controlled substance. However, since 2012, the Food and Drug Administration has taken a number of actions related to kratom, and in November 2017 issued a public health advisory*; in addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration has identified kratom as a drug of concern. During 2011\u20132017, the national poison center reporting database documented 1,807 calls concerning reported exposure to kratom (3). To assess the impact of kratom, CDC analyzed data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS).\nCDC funds 32 states and the District of Columbia to abstract into SUDORS detailed data on unintentional and undetermined intent opioid overdose deaths from death certificates and medical examiner and coroner reports, including postmortem toxicology results.\u2020 Although kratom is not an opioid, overdose deaths involving kratom (including nonopioid overdose deaths) are included in SUDORS.\u00a7 Although postmortem toxicology testing varies in scope among medical examiners and coroners, SUDORS records all substances detected on postmortem toxicology testing, along with overdose-specific circumstances. CDC analyzed overdose deaths in which kratom was detected on postmortem toxicology testing and deaths in which kratom was determined by a medical examiner or coroner to be a cause of death in 11 states during July 2016\u2013June 2017 and in 27 states during July\u2013December 2017.\u00b6\nData on 27,338 overdose deaths that occurred during July 2016\u2013December 2017 were entered into SUDORS, and 152 (0.56%) of these decedents tested positive for kratom on postmortem toxicology (kratom-positive). Postmortem toxicology testing protocols were not documented and varied among and within states. Kratom was determined to be a cause of death (i.e., kratom-involved) by a medical examiner or coroner for 91 (59.9%) of the 152 kratom-positive decedents, including seven for whom kratom was the only substance to test positive on postmortem toxicology, although the presence of additional substances cannot be ruled out (4).\nIn approximately 80% of kratom-positive and kratom-involved deaths in this analysis, the decedents had a history of substance misuse, and approximately 90% had no evidence that they were currently receiving medically supervised treatment for pain. Postmortem toxicology testing detected multiple substances for almost all decedents (Table). Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs were the most frequently identified co-occurring substances; any fentanyl was listed as a cause of death for 65.1% of kratom-positive decedents and 56.0% of kratom-involved decedents. Heroin was the second most frequent substance listed as a cause of death (32.9% of kratom-positive decedents), followed by benzodiazepines (22.4%), prescription opioids (19.7%),** and cocaine (18.4%).\nKratom-positive deaths accounted for <1% of all SUDORS overdose deaths during July 2016\u2013December 2017. Identification of kratom is method-dependent (5); therefore, these data might underestimate the number of kratom-positive deaths, although the extent cannot be determined. However, because SUDORS records results of jurisdiction-specific postmortem toxicology testing, as well as overdose-specific circumstances, it is possible to ascertain that kratom was present primarily in deaths that occurred as a result of overdoses related to substance misuse and that kratom was most often detected in combination with multiple other substances.\nThe type and number of substances detected in kratom-involved deaths can inform overdose prevention strategies (6). Documentation of postmortem toxicology testing protocols is needed to further clarify the extent to which kratom contributes to fatal overdoses.\nAcknowledgments\nStates participating in the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System and participating state agencies, including state health departments, vital registrar offices, and coroner and medical examiner offices; Bruce Goldberger, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.\nCorresponding author: Emily O\u2019Malley Olsen, eolsen@cdc.gov, 404-498-0716.\n1Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.\nAll authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\n* https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm584952.htm.\n\u2020 Whereas most states in SUDORS submit data on 100% of their unintentional and undetermined intent opioid-involved overdose deaths, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Washington submit data on a subset of counties that reflect at least 75% of drug overdose deaths in the state.\n\u00a7 SUDORS records data on fatal unintentional and undetermined intent overdoses in which at least one opioid contributed to death, as well as fatal overdoses with no contributing opioid, if substances that have opioid-like properties (currently, kratom is the only such substance) contributed to death. For all included deaths, SUDORS records all substances testing positive on postmortem toxicology testing (including those that did and did not contribute to death).\n\u00b6 Twenty-seven states reported data for the period July 2016\u2013December 2017. Eleven states reported deaths that occurred during the entire period: Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Sixteen additional states only reported deaths that occurred during July\u2013December 2017: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. Data were current as of January 22, 2019.\n** Substances coded as prescription opioids were oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, tramadol, buprenorphine, methadone, meperidine, tapentadol, dextrorphan, levorphanol, propoxyphene, pentazocine, and phenacetin. Also coded as prescription opioids were brand names (e.g., Opana), metabolites (e.g., nortramadol) of these substances, and these substances in combination with nonopioids (e.g., acetaminophen-oxycodone). Morphine and codeine were coded as prescription opioids if the scene or other evidence indicated their presence as a result of consumption of prescription morphine or codeine, rather than as a result of metabolism of or impurities of heroin, respectively. Fentanyl was coded as a prescription opioid if the scene or other evidence indicated likely consumption of prescription fentanyl rather than illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Decedents might have tested positive for other nonopioid substances. This analysis does not distinguish between prescription drugs prescribed to the decedent and those that were diverted.\nReferences\n- Singh D, Narayanan S, Vicknasingam B.

He loved doing things outdoors,\u201d Mauldin told The Post.\nThen, on the day of his death, McKibban went to his longtime job at an organic food distributor. When he got home, he mixed a tablespoon of a powdered kratom supplement into his lemonade.\nMarketed as an \u201call-natural\u201d way to ease pain, anxiety, depression and more, kratom can appeal to health-conscious people like McKibban, who Mauldin says wouldn\u2019t even take ibuprofen for the arthritis in his hands.\nBut on that Tuesday in April 2022, a compound in the substance called mitragynine took McKibban\u2019s life, an autopsy report later showed.\nWhen Mauldin broke into his bathroom after a call from her grandson that day, she found McKibban lifeless. She performed CPR on her own son and shielded her eyes when medics carried his gray body away.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my son. I\u2019ve lost my grandchildren that I could have had, I\u2019ve lost watching him walk down that aisle, watching him have a life that I get to watch with my other kids. I\u2019ve lost enjoying these years with him,\u201d Mauldin said.\n\u201cI have to go to the cemetery, and I hate going to the cemetery. He shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d she added.\nFrom dizziness to nonresponsiveness\nKratom products \u2014 sold in powders, gummies and energy-looking drinks \u2014 come from a plant native to Southeast Asia and can act like a stimulant at lower doses and a sedative at higher ones.\nWhile they\u2019re readily found online, in brick-and-mortar stores and even gas stations as catch-all solutions to everything from fatigue to opioid withdrawal, the Food and Drug Administration says kratom and its key components are \u201cnot lawfully marketed\u201d in the US as a drug product, dietary supplement or food additive.\nThe products, though, are gaining attention on social media, as TikTokers reveal disturbing interactions with teens going great lengths to get their hands on drinks like Feel Free.\nThe shot-like capsules of kratom and other \u201cbotanic\u201d ingredients look innocent enough and line some gas station checkouts.\nNational poison control centers documented 1,807 calls about kratom exposures between 2011 and 2017, and \u201cit\u2019s only been increasing since then,\u201d Dr. Michael Greco, an emergency medicine physician in Florida, said.\nPatients on kratom \u201ccan have a lot of agitation, sometimes even psychosis,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get sweating, you get dizziness, you get very high blood pressure or elevated heart rate.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, he noted, \u201cpeople might be totally unresponsive or just extremely drowsy and out of it.\u201d\nWhile documented deaths from kratom are rare and typically involve other substances like fentanyl, critics say consumers are unaware of kratom\u2019s potential dangers. Manufacturers aren\u2019t required to verify if what is listed on the label accurately reflects what\u2019s inside the product.\nMcKibban, for one, was told it was impossible to overdose on kratom; that he\u2019d just throw up if he took too much, Mauldin said. The green cellophane bags he left behind had no instructions or warnings.\n\u201cI find it so frustrating when I get a recall from Costco over lettuce or they have a recall over some potato chip \u2026 and they pull it all off the market,\u201d Mauldin, whose lawsuit alleges kratom is 63 times more deadly than other \u201cnatural\u201d products sold to consumers, noted.\n\u201cThere have been hundreds of people killed from this, and they don\u2019t pull it. The government doesn\u2019t step in,\u201d she added.\nAn even more potent danger\nExperts are especially concerned with a highly potent, highly addictive kratom offshoot called 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, which seems to have infiltrated the market in the past few years, said Dr. Robert Levy, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota who\u2019s board-certified in both addiction and family medicine.\nMany people don\u2019t know the difference.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been concern around kratom because if you take enough of it, kratom does act like an opioid, and people can become addicted to it and have withdrawal from it and overdose on it and ruin their lives on it, like anybody else that has a substance use disorder,\u201d Levy said.\n7-hydroxymitragynine, though, \u201cis much more addicting and much more problematic.\u201d\nIn fact, just last week, the FDA recommended classifying 7-OH as an illicit substance.\n\u201c7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine,\u201d FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in a press release. \u201cWe need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.\u201d\nIn the meantime, according to Levy, parents should be having open conversations with their kids about the appeals, dangers and addictive potential of kratom \u2014 and the fact that \u201call-natural\u201d or \u201cplant-based\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean safe. \u201cArsenic is also from a plant,\u201d he says.\nAs for people who say kratom helps them wean off other substances \u201cand they can control their use and they\u2019re getting their life back together, then who am I to judge?\u201d Levy said.\n\u201cI just worry that because they can\u2019t control the use of something, the part of their brain that controls the use of psychoactive drugs is fundamentally broken, and I worry they\u2019ll continue to take more and more of it until they develop a kratom use disorder.\u201d\n\u201c[If] the part of their brain that controls the use of psychoactive drugs is fundamentally broken, I worry they\u2019ll continue to take more and more of it until they develop a kratom use disorder,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf your child or you or whoever is suffering from a substance disorder, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Levy added. \u201cLots of people suffer from substance disorder. There is help, treatment works.\u201d\n\u2018No money on my child\u2019s life\u2018\nFor Jennifer Young, that message came too late.\nThe mom in Columbus, Ohio, first googled kratom a few years ago after her son, Johnny Loring, mentioned he was using it for anxiety. What she found didn\u2019t alarm her.\n\u201cI saw it\u2019s this \u2018all-natural, safe alternative,\u2019 and then people are like, \u2018It\u2019s wonderful, it saved my life, helps with my anxiety, helps with my pain, it\u2019s a cure-all,\u2019\u201d Young remembered. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t really think it was that bad.\u201d\nPlus, Loring, a delivery driver for a flooring company who loved fishing and playing guitar, found kratom helped him stay alert and communicate with his customers. He valued those relationships.\n\u201cEverybody loved Johnny,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe was the kind of guy that would give you the shirt off his back, the last dollar in his pocket. He didn\u2019t care if you needed a ride, he\u2019d give it to you. Anything you needed, he would be there for you in a heartbeat.\u201d\nEven when Loring started having seizures, neither Young nor clinicians traced them back to kratom. At the hospital, \u201cthey told me that everything was fine and they referred me to a seizure clinic,\u201d Young added.\nLoring never got the chance to go. Weeks later, at age 27, he collapsed during an annual mushroom hunting trip with the men in his family and his new girlfriend. By the time the ambulance got to him, he was dead.\nA toxicology report revealed deadly levels of mitragynine and gabapentin, a prescription painkiller, in his system.\n\u201cThe level of kratom shocked me. It overwhelmed me. It made my gut sick,\u201d said Young, who later found about 20 packs of kratom, which he drank with orange juice, around Loring\u2019s room. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so addicting.\u201d\nLike Mauldin, Young is pursuing a wrongful death lawsuit. But, she added, \u201cthere\u2019s no amount of money I could put on my child\u2019s life.\u201d\nAfter Loring\u2019s death last spring, she spent a year in bed and got on antidepressants for the first time. One of her other children has been hospitalized for panic attacks. Christmas was \u201cmiserable,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur house is silent now. The void of Johnny is just loud,\u201d Young added. \u201cI just hope that someday I can get back to enjoying things, because I know he would want me to. But right now, I don\u2019t enjoy anything.\u201d"

      "text": "Part 1: Hundreds died using kratom in Florida. It was touted as safe.\nThey found him early in the morning: slumped on the couch, vomit on his shirt, face pale, eyes halfway shut.\nA roommate told paramedics he feared Jonathan Dampf had relapsed on painkillers and overdosed. This time, though, the 33-year-old had taken something new.\nDampf came to Florida more than a decade earlier in the throes of addiction. Alcohol, pills, anything he could get his hands on.\nWithin months, he got sober and became a leader at his Fort Lauderdale church\u2019s recovery program. He married and had a daughter.\nHe was everything to them. His wife had his number saved in her phone as \u201cSuperman.\u201d\nBut life\u2019s pressures became suffocating. His daughter was born with a condition requiring around-the-clock care. His home needed repairs. Bills added up. Depression took hold.\nHe decided to try kratom, a dusty green psychoactive powder from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tree. It was marketed as a safe way to ease anxiety and mimic the effects of opioids. It was legal, virtually unregulated and described as all-natural. He could find it at gas stations, cafes, smoke shops or online.\nHe took it regularly, including before paramedics were called to his home in April 2021.\nEarlier that evening, he streamed \u201cGodzilla vs. Kong\u201d with his wife. She stayed upstairs at their Broward County home, sick in bed, while Dampf watched from the downstairs couch. They pressed play at the same time.\nDuring the movie, Dampf was quiet. He didn\u2019t answer texts. His wife figured he\u2019d fallen asleep.\nHours later, he was gone.\nA medical examiner determined he took a lethal amount of kratom. No other substances were detected in his system. His family and friends couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 how could something so available be so dangerous?\nA Tampa Bay Times investigation found that more than 580 people in Florida have died from kratom-related overdoses during the past decade \u2014 even as the industry has touted the safety of its products. Most of the deaths were caused by a fatal mixture of kratom and at least one other substance, but 46 people overdosed solely on the herb.\nThe Times\u2019 review of kratom\u2019s toll is the first of its kind by a news organization in Florida. Reporters analyzed thousands of pages of autopsy and toxicology reports, police documents and company records. They interviewed over 150 scientists, doctors, policy experts, regulators, industry players, consumers and relatives of overdose victims. Reporters also had 20 kratom products tested by researchers.\nAmong the findings:\n- Companies sell kratom without dosing instructions, a list of ingredients or, sometimes, any label at all \u2014 leaving customers to determine product safety on their own. Vendors often brag about the strength of their kratom, marketing powders and liquid shots as \u201cpowerful,\u201d \u201cmost potent\u201d and \u201clong-lasting.\u201d Yet the majority of products tested by the Times failed to disclose their intensity on labels. One packet of pills was so enhanced a scientist compared it to \u201clegal morphine.\u201d\n- At least a fifth of those who overdosed solely on kratom used products manufactured to be more concentrated than traditional, fresh leaf forms of the herb. A 39-year-old mother had an alarming level of kratom\u2019s main ingredient in her blood when she was found lying dead next to her baby on the living room floor. Police discovered at least three pouches of kratom powder inside her Palm Beach County home.\n- Nine in 10 people who died had a substance in their system that could be harmful when mixed with kratom, including common medications used to treat anxiety or depression. Makers of prescription and over-the-counter drugs must notify consumers about the potential danger of combining their products with other substances. The kratom industry doesn\u2019t have to issue such warnings.\n- Kratom companies and lobbyists sell the plant as a safe way to escape opioid addiction, but people with a documented history of drug use accounted for the majority of kratom-only overdoses. More than half of them had misused opioids like oxycodone or heroin. After a car crash shattered his spine, a Port Richey man got hooked on prescription painkillers, then overdosed on kratom while trying to wean himself off hard drugs.\nFor years, the American Kratom Association, which is the most influential kratom lobbying and advocacy group in the world, has told the public and legislatures across the country that the herb cannot be fatal, unless it\u2019s contaminated or laced with drugs like fentanyl.\nC. McClain \u201cMac\u201d Haddow, the organization\u2019s chief lobbyist, called the Florida death toll \u201cgrossly overstated.\u201d He described it as the result of \u201canti-kratom propaganda.\u201d Underlying medical conditions or other substances may be the real culprits, he said.\nHaddow acknowledged that some overdose victims had dangerously high levels of kratom\u2019s major chemical compound in their blood. But he placed the blame for deaths on consumers, saying they used the herb \u201cirresponsibly.\u201d\nMillions of Americans take kratom, and the industry is estimated to be worth roughly $1.5 billion. Many consumers laud the herb as an effective way to treat pain, depression and addiction. In Florida, the state\u2019s role in the opioid epidemic \u2014 including the shutdown of once-thriving pill mills and a flourishing drug treatment industry \u2014 helped create a lucrative market for kratom companies in search of customers.\nThe federal government tried to ban the substance in 2016 after an uptick in calls to poison control centers. But the American Kratom Association, consumers, scientists and dozens of lawmakers objected to the restrictions, which would have curtailed kratom research and made possession a crime. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration abandoned its plan to temporarily make mitragynine, kratom\u2019s main chemical compound, a Schedule 1 substance like heroin or LSD.\nPublic health officials have recorded more than 2,000 fatal kratom-related overdoses since 2021, according to data collected from 40 states and Washington, D.C. Federal authorities have said there\u2019s no evidence to establish the safety of kratom and have issued an import alert for the herb, meaning arriving shipments could be refused entry onto U.S. soil.\nYet little else has been done to regulate kratom at the national level.\nScientists believe kratom\u2019s chemical compounds show therapeutic promise. Some want to use the herb to create a gentler treatment for opioid addiction and a painkiller that comes with a lower risk of overdose than medications on the market. Many also view kratom as a safer alternative to drugs like fentanyl, which claim tens of thousands of lives each year.\nBut much remains unknown about how to safely consume kratom and whether taking it could lead to long-term effects. Scientists are working to determine safe doses and to better understand why people die. Consumers face a vacuum of definitive scientific information about the plant, which has been linked to seizures, increased heart rates and liver injuries.\nIn the last decade in Florida, there have been:\nAmong all kratom-related overdose victims:\nIn recent months, wrongful death lawsuits filed against kratom companies have drawn national attention. A jury in southern Washington state handed down a multimillion-dollar verdict, and in Florida, a Palm Beach County family was awarded $11 million.\nToday, the substance remains widely available across the state. Competing businesses often deploy an array of marketing messages with limited scientific backing.\nA shop in St. Petersburg hands out flyers advertising the plant\u2019s \u201copiate withdrawal relief.\u201d Kava bars, from Gainesville to Miami, sell kratom teas with promises to increase energy or calm nerves.\nThe claims can be enticing \u2014 and impossible to vet.\nAt first, Dampf believed every word he read, family members said. The narrative he\u2019d found online described kratom as a natural cure for his debilitating anxiety and depression.\nBut when he tried to wean himself off it, he couldn\u2019t stop. The ensuing headaches and stomach pain prompted him to reach for kratom again.\nAfter coming clean to his wife, Dampf confessed to his boss and lost his job at the recovery program. Crushed and humiliated, he wasn\u2019t sure where to turn.\n\u201cWe just didn't know what to do,\u201d his wife, Kristi Krause, said. \u201cHe did not want to be taking this stuff. He truly, truly didn\u2019t.\u201d\nOn the morning of his death, she showed police her husband\u2019s stash of kratom in the garage. One package had no dosing instructions. Another, next to it, boasted it was the \u201cfreshest and most potent in the world.\u201d\n\"Very little knowledge\"\nKratom has been used for hundreds of years but only started gaining popularity in the U.S. in the 2000s.\nIt comes from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tropical tree, Mitragyna speciosa, and has been taken to substitute opium, boost the energy of laborers and treat medical issues from diarrhea to diabetes since at least the early 1800s across parts of Malaysia and Thailand. In small amounts, the substance can act like a stimulant with effects that alleviate fatigue, improve stamina and sharpen focus. At higher doses, it more closely mirrors a sedative.\nThe plant\u2019s best-studied chemical compound, mitragynine, binds to the brain\u2019s \u03bc-opioid receptors, making it similar to painkillers like fentanyl and oxycodone. But it\u2019s not as powerful. Mitragynine and other chemical compounds in the herb, called alkaloids, also interact with serotonin receptors linked to mood enhancement.\nPeople in Southeast Asia chew fresh plant leaves, boil them for tea or use them to make chilled juice. Overdose deaths have not been reported in Malaysia or Thailand like they have in the U.S.\nBut most Americans consume the herb differently.\nSUPPORT GREAT JOURNALISM\nPlease consider donating to help the Tampa Bay Times bring you more\ninvestigations like this one.\nYour support means a lot.\nHere, kratom is widely available in more concentrated forms, such as capsules and liquid extracts. Dried leaf powder is commonly brewed into teas and mixed with other drinks like coffee or orange juice.\n\u201cA lot of consumers out there in America, I believe that they have very little knowledge about kratom,\u201d said Darshan Singh, who studies the plant at Universiti Sains Malaysia. \u201cYou just have to follow the traditional approach, and you will not encounter any problems.\u201d\nThe Times requested evidence photos for every kratom-only overdose death investigated by a law enforcement agency in Florida. Police officers didn\u2019t always document the herb at the scene, but in cases where they did, they mostly discovered powder or capsules.\nReporters purchased 20 kratom products from online vendors, gas stations, smoke shops and other businesses around Tampa Bay and had them tested by researchers at the University of Florida. Eight of the products were the same types as those found at fatal kratom-only overdoses.\nPackage labels varied widely. Five had no information about ingredients. Eleven had no dosing instructions. Thirteen had no details about potency.\nOne product shipped by mail arrived coated with a dusty material. The vendor included a complimentary packet of powder with only \u201cTrainwreck\u201d written on it. Another company\u2019s return address was blacked out.\nSeveral of the products tested by the Times contained what experts consider to be high levels of mitragynine and other alkaloids, including one called speciociliatine that companies failed to identify and quantify on package labels. University of Florida researchers believe the alkaloid has more opioid-like effects than mitragynine and could play a role in determining a product\u2019s safety.\nA small liquid product bought by the Times, called K Shot Black, contained 114 milligrams of mitragynine and 24 milligrams of speciociliatine. Neither amount was listed on the bottle.\nOverall, powders and capsules were far less potent than liquid shots but often came in packages that included large amounts of mitragynine.\nThe Times tested 12 powders. The strongest per gram was from Remarkable Herbs, which bills itself as the oldest kratom brand in the country. The popular vendor sells bags of leaf powder containing more than 2,600 milligrams of mitragynine. Its products were linked to at least seven fatal overdoses in Florida, involving either kratom alone or the herb and one other substance.\nFive of the products bought by the Times were highly concentrated. One was a packet of pills with extreme levels of 7-hydroxymitragynine, a potent kratom alkaloid. The product, 7\u03a9HMZ, cost $29.99 and came with three tablets.\nAbhisheak Sharma, a University of Florida scientist who studies kratom, likened the pills to \u201clegal morphine.\u201d\n\u201cThis should not be in the market,\u201d he said.\nSome concentrated extracts tested by the Times were made by the industry\u2019s biggest names. The pocket-sized vials, filled with a few milliliters of dark liquid, cost roughly $20. They\u2019re displayed near cash registers in gas stations and on shelves at vape shops.\nCompanies often compete to make the most potent concoction. MIT45, a popular brand, sells an extract called Super K Extra Strong, which it has claimed is the \u201cstrongest kratom shot.\u201d Such products, its label says, can be \u201cmuch more powerful\u201d than regular kratom powder.\nThe Times tested the extract and found it contained 367 milligrams of mitragynine. That amount is equivalent to over 70 capsules of O.P.M.S. Silver Maeng Da, a popular kratom product linked to at least three deaths in Florida.\nOne bottle of MIT45 Super K Extra Strong extract has about as much mitragynine as:\nThe potent products have captured the interest of scientists trying to understand how \u2014 and why \u2014 people are dying.\n\u201cWhen you use a concentrated extract, you\u2019re getting a lot more material all at once,\u201d said Christopher McCurdy, a kratom researcher at the University of Florida.\nHe compared it to \u201cdrinking a Miller Lite versus drinking 12 ounces of Everclear.\u201d\nMcCurdy believes the extracts shouldn\u2019t be sold to people using kratom for the first time. Though some include vague health warnings on their packaging, the instructions are written in tiny type that can easily be missed. Many of the products come in bottles that are smaller than single-serving energy shots.\nThe little kratom vials, Sharma said, can contain several times more mitragynine than he thinks is safe to consume over an entire day.\nPolice found three bottles of O.P.M.S. Gold Liquid, a potent extract, at the scene of Ellen Benditcha\u2019s death last year. A medical examiner later determined the 58-year-old Broward County woman had taken a fatal mixture of kratom, antidepressants and medications used to treat anxiety and epilepsy.\nSome online retailers selling the extract suggest using just a drop or two. But the vials provide no serving size.\nInside Benditcha\u2019s bedroom, two bottles were empty.\nAlarming levels\nTracking kratom-related deaths in Florida is fairly new. The state required medical examiners to record cases starting in 2020 after a University of Florida toxicologist recommended it. But many had already begun looking for mitragynine as part of toxicology testing.\nOverdoses attributed to kratom alone, or in combination with other substances, took off across Florida after 2016.\nThe Times requested Florida autopsy reports since 2010 that cited kratom or its most prominent ingredient as a cause of death or contributing factor, analyzing cases deemed accidental overdoses.\nOrange, Palm Beach and Broward counties had the highest death tolls. When adjusted for population, several counties near or on the state\u2019s Treasure and Space coasts saw the worst overdose rates, with Okeechobee, Martin and Volusia as the top three.\nOf the 587 kratom-related overdoses through June 2022, medical examiners identified 38 in Tampa Bay, including eight from the herb alone.\nThe Times shared autopsy and toxicology data from kratom-only overdoses with four independent pathologists and kratom researchers. They noted variations in how people died. Some of the overdoses looked more like those caused by stimulants, with victims suffering sudden cardiac issues. Others resembled deaths attributed to opioids, with people experiencing too much fluid in their lungs and swollen brains.\nFourteen people who overdosed solely on kratom had at least one medical problem listed as a contributing factor. Five had heart disease. Companies generally aren\u2019t required to warn consumers about whether existing medical conditions could put them at increased risk when taking the herb.\nScientists haven\u2019t yet agreed on a fatal dosage for kratom.\nAmong kratom-only overdoses, about half involved people who had what experts described as alarming levels of mitragynine in their system: concentrations higher than 1,000 nanograms per milliliter of blood.\nA 28-year-old St. Augustine man had a blood-mitragynine concentration of 2,500 nanograms per milliliter. His ex-girlfriend found him on the living room floor.\nA 56-year-old Miami Beach woman had a blood-mitragynine level of 4,300 nanograms per milliliter. A co-worker found her inside a T.J. Maxx break room.\nA 46-year-old Delray Beach man had a blood-mitragynine concentration of 7,182 nanograms per milliliter. His roommate discovered him on the bathroom floor.\nToxicology labs test for mitragynine because it\u2019s the best-studied alkaloid in kratom. Scientists are still working to determine whether mitragynine itself is to blame for deaths or if another alkaloid is the problem.\nHow chronic kratom use affects people also remains unclear.\nFlorida poison control centers logged 450 calls reporting concerns about the herb from 2017 to May 2023. Across the country, more than 5,200 calls occurred during the same period.\nStudies using poison control data have shown harmful symptoms include agitation, increased heart rates and seizures.\nIn the deaths reviewed by the Times, 10 people who overdosed solely on kratom had previously suffered at least one seizure. Four had an apparent seizure when they died.\nAt least two people started experiencing seizures after they began using the substance, according to their families.\nJessica Speranza was one of them. To help with chronic pain, the 30-year-old tossed back spoonfuls of kratom powder with a chaser.\nHer roommate told police he brought her Bali Red kratom powder from a kava bar in St. Petersburg where he worked. Speranza, who had a history of using drugs, developed a high tolerance and didn\u2019t show adverse side effects, he said.\nBut her mother saw something different. After her kratom use started, so did her seizures, Linda Speranza told the Times.\nThe seizures became more frequent. Her health deteriorated. She\u2019d tremble. Sometimes, she could hardly walk.\n\u201cThe more seizures she was having,\u201d her mother said, \u201cthe more kratom she was taking because she was in pain.\u201d\nShe was rushed to the hospital multiple times. But doctors couldn\u2019t identify the cause of her seizures, her mother said. Further tests were scheduled in the summer of 2021.\nBut before she could go, Speranza had another seizure, overdosed on kratom and died.\nDeadly mixtures\nThe warning consumers receive about the potential danger of combining kratom with other substances depends entirely on the brand. There are no rules, either in Florida or at the federal level, requiring that companies alert people to the risk.\nMore than 530 people in Florida died from mixing kratom with one or more substances. Over three-quarters involved fentanyl. Six died from combining the plant with alcohol.\nMedical examiners attributed more than 30 overdoses to a lethal mixture that included kratom and at least one drug used to treat anxiety or depression.\nBoth prescription and over-the-counter medications must include clear warnings about the potential for interactions with other substances.\nThe allergy drug Benadryl, for example, says on its packaging that mixing tablets with alcohol may increase drowsiness. Tylenol warns about consuming its product while drinking because of the risk of severe liver damage.\nTwelve of the 20 kratom products tested by the Times had no warnings on their packages about potential interactions with prescription medications or other substances.\nTen products had disclaimers telling consumers to consult their doctors before using kratom.\nThree products provided specific disclosures, including the K Shot Black extract, which warned customers not to combine it with alcohol, large amounts of caffeine or other stimulants, prescription drugs or illicit substances.\nThe main danger of mixing kratom with drugs lies in how the body processes the substances.\nResearch has shown that kratom can slow certain enzymes in the intestine and liver as the body works to flush the herb\u2019s alkaloids out of its system. The enzymes break down thousands of medications and illicit drugs: antipsychotics, anti-anxiety pills, cocaine and opioids such as oxycodone.\nThe enzymes act like revolving doors with drugs passing through them. If mitragynine, for example, blocks one of the doors as it\u2019s moving along, another substance could build up in the bloodstream. Over time, it could become toxic.\nThose consuming large amounts of kratom are likely at higher risk, experts say.\n\u201cPeople see this as some random supplement,\u201d said Albert Garcia-Romeu, a kratom researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how much to take, and they don\u2019t know how it works, and they don\u2019t know that it might mess with their medications.\u201d\nAt least one kratom brand, O.P.M.S., has warned consumers to ask their doctors about \u201cenzyme inhibition\u201d in a lengthy disclaimer on its website. The language was not included on product packaging reviewed by the Times.\nDesperate to understand how to take kratom safely, Jonathan Roby would devour videos and forums online.\nThe 38-year-old Navy veteran sought a natural route to treat his post-traumatic stress and crippling anxiety, his girlfriend said. He wanted to replace his antidepressants and anxiety medication, prescribed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRoby started to increase his kratom dose while taking his prescriptions \u2014 not knowing the combination could be fatal.\nJust before sunrise one day in June 2021, Roby started convulsing inside his Deltona home. Cardiac arrest followed.\nA medical examiner determined he died from mixing kratom with venlafaxine, a common antidepressant. Heart problems, liver disease and obesity were contributing factors.\nKratom may also add to the danger of opioids like fentanyl when they're combined, said Mary Paine, a researcher at Washington State University who studies interactions between kratom and other substances. Fentanyl is mostly broken down by one of the enzymes that the herb can slow.\nJapheth \u201cJay\u201d Rhodes, a former combat engineer in the U.S. Army Reserve, started using kratom to get off hard drugs \u2014 but wound up taking them together.\nRhodes was supposed to deploy to Afghanistan in the late 2000s, but he injured his knee during training. He started taking oxycodone and became addicted.\n\u201cHe tried everything he could to stay clean,\u201d his mother, Sheryl Rhodes, said. \u201cHe told me he got on kratom.\u201d\nHe said it was helping.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all natural, Mom,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt balances me out.\u201d\nBut eventually, he relapsed.\nA week before his 41st birthday, in December 2020, his mom and wife discovered him inside the bathroom of his Myakka City home. A medical examiner found he had a large amount of mitragynine in his system along with fentanyl. The mix was enough to kill him.\nSeeking a salve\nAsk someone why they use kratom and the specifics vary. But often, there is a common theme: to self-medicate and soothe an ailment.\nFor many, it\u2019s to deal with symptoms of opioid withdrawal or cravings.\nFederal law prohibits kratom companies from making medical claims because the substance is not an approved drug. But the herb is often marketed as a way to treat anxiety, pain and opioid addiction. Online, for example, a vendor called Phoria said people can use kratom to \u201cstep down off of dangerous prescription drugs.\u201d (The company recently removed the language from its website.)\nA car crash had left Jason Lay with a shattered spine and years of painkiller addiction.\n\u201cHis whole back was plates and rods,\u201d his sister, Nicole Zambetti, said. \u201cHe was in a ton of pain, so then came the opiates.\u201d\nLay tried to switch to over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen, but his stomach bled so severely it almost killed him. He went back to opioids before turning to kratom.\nMany products don\u2019t come with instructions for how to treat opioid addiction. And in October 2020, 44-year-old Lay took too much of the herb inside his Port Richey home.\nLay is among at least 135 people in Florida who overdosed on kratom after previously struggling with drug use, the Times found. Eight died while they resided in sober living settings.\nSelling to people who\u2019ve used opioids contributed to kratom\u2019s rise.\nThe crackdown on pill mills a decade ago in Florida helped create a customer base looking for alternatives to prescription painkillers. In that climate, kava bars that sold kratom began to blossom. The herb\u2019s popularity also grew.\n\u201cWe did see a huge growth during the opioid epidemic,\u201d said Nick Bauer, an industry consultant who manages a kava bar in the Miami area.\n\u201cI think (that\u2019s) what made it so big, especially in South Florida,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cHere\u2019s an alternative: you can stop doing \u2018blues,\u2019 you can stop doing \u2018Roxys.\u2019 You can go get a tea and feel so much better.\u201d\nMany in recovery from opioid use, like Tyler Rook, say kratom is the only thing keeping them from slipping back into addiction. The 31-year-old Tampa resident overdosed on heroin two years ago and now uses kratom daily.\n\u201cWhen you stop drinking and you stop doing drugs,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve almost seen death \u2014 it looks like coffee in the morning.\u201d\nThe American Kratom Association has maintained that banning kratom would worsen the opioid epidemic, driving people to use dangerous drugs. The organization has cited a widely circulated study from Johns Hopkins researchers, who surveyed more than 2,700 people who use kratom.\nThe scientists turned to the kratom association and sites like Reddit to recruit study participants. They found that 4 in 10 consumed the plant to stop or limit opioid use. The vast majority said kratom effectively alleviated withdrawal symptoms.\nPain, though, was the most common reason people took the herb. And almost two-thirds said they were treating depression.\nAt least one product warns against doing that.\nK Shot Black tells consumers on its bottles: \u201cDo not try if you have a history of mental illness.\u201d\nThe Times found that at least 19 people who overdosed on kratom alone had struggled with their mental health, including with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nLuke Larsen was seeking a salve for his anxiety, his family believes.\nThe same mind that helped the 27-year-old nurse excel throughout school had betrayed him, and during the pandemic, Larsen\u2019s anxiety and depression surged. He moved back home to Valrico from his master\u2019s program at Johns Hopkins.\nBy August 2020, though, Larsen seemed to improve. He\u2019d let his anti-anxiety medication run low and planned to start work as a nurse in Asheville, North Carolina. Weeks before he was supposed to move, he texted a fellow nurse a map of all the places they\u2019d Frisbee-golf in the city.\nThe next day, his mother found him dead sitting at his computer, his limbs rigid and askew.\nSo many questions raced through Karen Larsen\u2019s mind.\nBut the biggest one was: Why?\nKaren Larsen at first believed her son died by suicide. In the days and weeks after his death, his parents searched for a reason. A medical examiner determined he accidentally overdosed on kratom. No other substances were found in his system.\nHis parents didn\u2019t know anything about kratom, so they initially weren\u2019t sure what to make of the bag filled with green capsules labeled O.P.M.S. Silver or the packages of Choice Botanicals kratom powder they\u2019d found on his desk after he died. They figured the substance was just another one of his supplements, sitting next to a bottle of turmeric.\nBut a simple internet search revealed the herb\u2019s possible appeal. Online, health claims about kratom\u2019s power to treat anxiety abound.\n\"It takes control\"\nOne of the central arguments made by supporters of the kratom industry is that the plant isn\u2019t dangerously addictive.\nHaddow, the kratom association lobbyist, has acknowledged that dependency is possible. But he called it \u201cvastly different\u201d from opioid addiction, likening the experience to consuming a \u201cbenign\u201d substance like caffeine.\nOnline forums with thousands of people who use kratom say the same. One commenter praised the herb as \u201cno more addictive than coffee.\u201d Others described mild withdrawal symptoms, ranging from a runny nose to headaches. But threads on Facebook and Reddit also include pleas from those looking for tips on how to quell their addictions.\nThere are complaints of debilitating withdrawals. Of bank accounts drained and families torn apart.\nFor many, escaping one addiction only means falling into another.\n\u201cThese days, kratom and opioid dependency go hand in hand,\u201d said Andrea Raab, the program supervisor at Nextep, an outpatient substance use provider with locations in Southwest Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of people using kratom to get off opioids, not realizing just how addictive it is.\u201d\nWithdrawal symptoms from kratom can mimic those typically experienced with stimulants or opioids, such as chills, nausea, insomnia, irritability and restless legs syndrome.\nResearchers say a person\u2019s level of dependency relates to how much kratom they consume. Two products bought by the Times, powders from Lipht Kratom and Sembuh Kratom, had labels warning that \u201cprolonged use\u201d could be habit-forming.\nThe Johns Hopkins survey found that a small percentage of kratom consumers experienced withdrawals, which were typically mild. But such studies, scientists say, can skew toward enthusiasts deciding to participate. Animal research suggests that tea made from kratom leaves produces less dependence than opioids like morphine.\nSome people start consuming large amounts of kratom after developing tolerance, said McCurdy, the University of Florida researcher. Then, when they stop taking the herb, they get sick.\nThe Times surveyed a dozen substance use providers in Florida about kratom treatment. The majority said they\u2019ve noticed an increase in patients seeking help for kratom use over the last five years, often in combination with other substances. But some were in recovery from the herb alone.\nThere is no widely recognized diagnosis or treatment plan for \u201ckratom use disorder.\u201d But most of the providers said they treat kratom patients as if they\u2019re experiencing a form of opioid use disorder, prescribing drugs like Suboxone, which can ease the effects of withdrawal.\n\u201cA lot of people are very unaware that it\u2019s something that can require detoxed medical intervention, because it\u2019s not marketed as something really that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Frank Galimidi, chief clinical officer at Sunset House Inc., a treatment center in Palm Beach Gardens. \u201cI've seen people legitimately get themselves thrown out of treatments, or out of halfway houses, spend all kinds of money that they don't have to continue getting kratom, because they do become physiologically and psychologically dependent.\u201d\nAfter Jay Bankston pulled a muscle in his rotator cuff, a friend suggested he try kratom.\nIt was \u201cbasically OxyContin or heroin in a liquid shot,\u201d the friend explained, but with one difference: You couldn\u2019t get addicted.\nIt had been roughly 10 months since Bankston\u2019s last drink. Exercise dulled the then-32-year-old\u2019s urge for alcohol, but his success felt fragile.\nThe friend said kratom shots had the most powerful effects and one brand was king: O.P.M.S. Its extract vials cost $20.\nAfter the first shot, Bankston knew he was in trouble.\nThe pain in his shoulder evaporated. He felt a rush of euphoria. One shot gave him enough energy to carry him through shifts as a truck driver. But within weeks, the amount he relied on to start his morning wasn\u2019t getting him past lunchtime.\nAs he developed a higher and higher tolerance, Bankston was taking four to six kratom shots a day. Without them, withdrawal symptoms struck within hours: crippling nausea, digestive distress, muscle aches, sleeplessness.\nBankston began spending more and more \u2014 sometimes upward of $100 a day \u2014 to fuel his habit. His wife thought he was drinking again. Soon, they were living paycheck to paycheck.\nHis wife threatened to leave if he didn\u2019t quit. He couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt takes control of your entire life when it gets to that point,\u201d Bankston said. \u201cEverything revolves around it.\u201d\nBankston and his wife eventually divorced, and he moved out. For five years, he struggled to stop using kratom \u2014 he\u2019d quit and then relapse, quit and then relapse, again and again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how powerful this stuff is,\u201d said Bankston, who\u2019s since found a sober living community in Pensacola. \u201cI beat alcohol the first try successfully. But this stuff just took me down.\u201d\nBankston said he hasn\u2019t had a drink since Thanksgiving Day 2017.\nHe\u2019s tried to quit kratom 10 times. He\u2019s hoping this time will be his last.\nEditor\u2019s note: If you or someone you know is dealing with addiction, the following resources are available to help:\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\nThe Crisis Center of Tampa Bay: Call 2-1-1\nCove Behavioral Health: 813-384-4000; covebh.org\nTimes staff writer Kirby Wilson contributed to this report.\nFormer Times staff writer Eli Murray contributed reporting before joining another news organization.\nLead photo by Times staff photographer Dirk Shadd.

      "text": "Kratom: Unsafe and ineffective\nUsers swear by kratom for lifting mood and boosting energy, but there are many safety issues and questions about whether kratom works.\nIf you read health news or visit vitamin stores, you may have heard about kratom. Kratom is a supplement that is sold as an energy booster, mood lifter, pain reliever and remedy for the symptoms of quitting opioids, called withdrawal. But the truth about kratom is not so simple. And there are safety problems linked to its use.\nKratom is an herbal extract that comes from the leaves of an evergreen tree called Mitragyna speciosa. The tree grows in Southeast Asia. Kratom users can chew the tree's leaves, swallow or brew dry kratom, or add the extract to a liquid.\nPeople who use kratom report that at low doses, kratom acts as an upper, called a stimulant. That means it makes them more alert and gives them more energy. At higher doses, people who use it report that it reduces pain and makes them feel calm and less anxious, also called a sedative.\nSome people take kratom to ease the symptoms of quitting opioids, called withdrawal. Kratom may be easier to get than prescription medicines. But it carries its own risk of addiction.\nPeople who use kratom to relax or to be more social most likely think that kratom is natural and safe because it comes from a plant. But the amount of the active part in kratom leaves can vary greatly. So it's hard to know the effects of a given dose.\nSome studies have found that some kratom sellers add more of the active ingredient than kratom naturally has. And because kratom products lack clear labels, it's not possible to know how much kratom people who use it take.\nKratom starts to work in minutes. The effects last a few hours. The more kratom you take, the stronger the effects are.\nDepending on the amount of active ingredient in the product and the health of the user, taking kratom can be harmful. There are too few studies to be able to rate the claims about the benefits of kratom.\nSide effects and safety concerns\nPeople who take kratom believe that it helps them. But kratom hasn't been shown to be safe or to treat any medical conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned people not to use kratom because of possible harm it can cause. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration calls kratom a drug of concern.\nPoison control centers in the United States received more than 3,400 reports about use of kratom from 2014 through 2019. These included reports of death. Side effects reported included high blood pressure, confusion and seizures.\nKratom has known side effects, including:\n- Weight loss.\n- Dry mouth.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\n- Constipation.\n- Liver damage.\n- Muscle pain.\n- High blood pressure.\nKratom also affects the mind and nervous system. It causes:\n- Dizziness.\n- Drowsiness.\n- Smells, tastes, sights, touches or sounds that seem real but aren't, called hallucinations.\n- False beliefs, called delusions.\n- Depression.\n- Trouble breathing.\n- Confusion, tremors and seizures.\nKratom products have been linked to a small number of deaths. That's small compared with deaths from other drugs. Nearly all deaths from kratom also involved other drugs or substances that might have been harmful.\nMany of the problems linked to pain medicines happen when people take them at high doses or for a long time. Experts don't know what level of kratom can cause those problems. People can overdose with kratom, but it's rare.\nResearch continues\nResearchers continue to study the effects of kratom. Studies so far have found that kratom has many safety issues.\nKratom has been reported to react with other medicines. This may lead to severe effects, such as liver damage and death. More research is needed.\nIn a study testing kratom as a treatment for symptoms of quitting opioids, called withdrawal, people who took kratom for more than six months reported withdrawal symptoms like those from opioid use. And people who use kratom may begin craving it. They may need treatments given for opioid addiction, such as buprenorphine (Brixadi, Sublocade, others) and buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone, Zubsolv).\nKratom also affects babies during pregnancy. When a pregnant person uses kratom, the baby may be born with symptoms of withdrawal and need treatment.\nKratom products have been found to have heavy metals, such as lead, and harmful germs, such as salmonella, in them. Salmonella poisoning can be fatal. The FDA has linked more than 35 deaths to salmonella-tainted kratom.\nKratom is not regulated in the United States. But federal agencies are taking action to fight false claims about kratom. In the meantime, your safest choice is to work with your healthcare professional to find other treatments.\nJune 18, 2024\n- Drug fact sheet: Kratom.

      "text": "Addictive natural drink Feel Free is hooking young people with horrible consequences: \u2018Literal flakes of skin flying off\u2019\nFeel Free appears as innocuous as a trendy new Kombucha, and it\u2019s billed as a natural way to get a little boost.\nManufacturer Botanic Tonics advertises the drink as filled with \u201cplant ingredients\u201d and perfect for \u201cwhenever you want a mood lift, a caffeine-free energy boost, or a little extra focus.\u201d\nBut some hapless customers who picked up a little blue bottle at a convenience store or gas station learned the hard way that the drinks \u2014 which contain kava and kratom extracts \u2014 can be severely addictive.\nJasmine Adeoye cut out alcohol in 2022 for a \u201clifestyle change,\u201d and heard about Feel Free on the Skinny Confidential podcast, where it was billed as a good alternative to social drinking.\n\u201cThe two hosts were actually taking a hiatus from alcohol and they were talking about Feel Free and how it was a really great alcohol alternative for sober people, and I was looking for something like that,\u201d said Adeoye, 30, of Austin, Texas.\nWhen she heard about it yet again on Joe Rogan\u2019s show, she decided to try it.\n\u201cI wanted to overcome the social anxiety of not having alcohol anymore, and it made me feel really good, but from then on, it was just a slow progression,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had no idea, going into it, that it was addictive.\u201d\nShe was able to use it moderately for a year when in social drinking situations, but then a stressful job as an account manager pushed her into addiction in 2023.\n\u201cIt started to progress to, one a day slowly, and then two to three a day, and then upwards of five or six, and at the absolute worst, like 12 bottles a day,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI was spending easily $3,000 a month.\u201d\nPharmacist Ethan Melillo warns that the combination of kava and kratom, both of which are legal ingredients in the US, is highly addictive.\n\u201cThis combination is something you don\u2019t want to be mixing together,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cI definitely think it should be banned. They\u2019re both regularly available supplements, but what concerns me is the combination of the two of them.\u201d\nKava is a depressant, while Kratom is a stimulant \u2014 which means they have opposite effects on the body.\nMelillo, who is based in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, explained that kratom and kava each bind to different receptors in the brain, and can be extremely overstimulating in combination.\nKava, which is used to reduce stress and anxiety, binds to the same receptors as benzodiazepine drugs, like Xanax and Valium. Kratom interacts with the same receptors as opioids, which poses a risk of addiction and withdrawal.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is people [consuming] like two, three, four [drinks] a day, because once you build that tolerance, your body will want more of it,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that people are getting addicted to this, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so concerning about supplements. Usually they will only get pulled after people are having side effects.\u201d\nAdeoye went to great lengths to hide her dependence: \u201cI would hop around from gas station to gas station because I was so embarrassed about the amount that I was buying. I would even get them on UberEats sometimes so I didn\u2019t have to face anyone.\u201d\nShe says her addiction took a toll physically and emotionally.\n\u201cI was lethargic, depressed, anxious, barely able to get out of bed,\u201d she said. \u201cI was throwing up from the kratom, and the kava can make your skin dry, like alligator skin, literal flakes of skin just like flying off.\u201d\nBut she finally fessed up to her fianc\u00e9 and her mom in March 2024 and cut herself off cold turkey. She went through four days of miserable withdrawal, followed by two weeks of strong cravings, and finally felt fully back to herself after six months.\nAlthough FeelFree is a 21+ age-restricted item, kids have been figuring out how to get their hands on it.\nInstagram creator Michael Brown posted a video to his followers warning about the drink after he says he was approached by \u201ca child\u201d who was \u201cmaybe 14 years old\u201d at a gas station begging him to purchase a Feel Free for him.\n\u201cHe comes up to me and he says, \u2018Hey, can you buy me some Feel Free,\u2019\u201d Brown alleged. When he informed the attendant, he was told she has some customers coming in five to six times a day to purchase it and that \u201cpeople act like \u2026 they have heroin addictions over this little drink.\u201d\nSome users of Feel Free start using the product because they think it\u2019s a healthy alternative to other drugs.\nChris Oflyng first started using kratom powder at age 19, as a natural way to ween off prescribed Adderall. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, [the Adderall] is not a positive thing in my life, it\u2019s something I should stay away from,\u2019\u201d he told The Post.\nFive years later, in 2021, Feel Free hit the market \u2014 and Oflyng found himself hooked on its combination of kava and kratom.\n\u201cProducts like Feel Free are really, really awful,\u201d said the 28-year-old from Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cI developed a codependency of using kava and kratom, due to the introduction of that product, and I don\u2019t think I knew it was as addictive as it could be in that combination.\u201d\nHe describes the sensation as \u201csomething like relaxation, but also stimulation.\u201d\n\u201cAt first it worked really, really well and gave me what I perceived to be an enhanced focus,\u201d said Oflyng, who works in donor development. \u201cI was able to accomplish more. But then the effect started to fade, and once you\u2019re addicted to it, it\u2019s just chasing the relief after cravings.\u201d\nOflyng has struggled with addictions to Feel Free \u201con and off for the past couple years\u201d and has been in and out of treatment for his addiction.\n\u201cI would buy Feel Frees every time I would relapse,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou could just get them from a smoke shop or a gas station. It\u2019s just so readily accessible.\u201d\nOflyng says Feel Free derailed his life.\n\u201cThe biggest downside was the depression that came with it for me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but, looking back and talking about it now, it\u2019s just like, why haven\u2019t I seized a lot of opportunities in my life? And I can point it all back to kratom and kava.\u201d\nOflyng estimates he\u2019s spent \u201cat least $40,000 over the years\u201d between kratom powder and Feel Free drinks.\n\u201cA lot of people might be like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a plant, it\u2019s natural,\u2019 but it will catch up with you,\u201d he warned."

      "text": "\u2018My mom thought kratom was healthy. It killed her\u2019: Fears over growing toll of \u2018health supplement\u2019\nKrystal Talavera thought she was drinking a healthy supplement to her morning coffee.\nBut the supplement she was taking, kratom, killed the registered nurse, a mother of four, from respiratory failure brought on by opioid-like effects.\nHer death is the latest involving the herbal substance, which is widely sold at gas stations and online despite the FDA warning it can cause liver damage, seizures and even death, and the CDC linking it to more than 100 deaths in just 18 months.\nNow relatives of people who have died after taking the drug say they want more government regulation\u2014and for people to be aware how dangerous a widely-marketed herbal product can be.\nTalavera\u2019s eldest son Devin Filippelli sued the makers of the supplement found beside her body at the family home in Palm Beach County she shared with her partner and four children.\nTalavera, 39, was a nurse who had just been promoted at the hospice care company where she worked.\nBut in June 2021, the day after celebrating Filippeli winning a place at Florida State University, her partner found her collapse beside a cup of hot coffee and an open bag of \u201cSpace Dust,\u201d one of the names under which kratom is marketed.\nParamedics could not revive her and she was declared dead at Bethesda Hospital East, Boynton Beach, Fl. An autopsy said she had suffered acute \u201cmitragynine\u201d intoxication, caused by the active ingredient of kratom, leading her to suffer respiratory failure.\nFilippelli, 21, and his family won an $11 million judgment in a wrongful death federal lawsuit last week against Kratom Distro and distributor Grow LLC, saying the supplements his mom purchased produced \u201copioid-like effects\u201d which the company should have known about.\nThe companies denied breaking laws by not notifying people of the potential dangers of their products, but withdrew their attorneys from the case, leading to a default judgement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like buying a drug. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting,\u201d Devin Filippelli, 21, told The Post.\n\u201cIf I had a message, I\u2019d say don\u2019t take it at all. Every time you take it you\u2019re playing Russian roulette with your life. Is that worth it?\u201d Filippelli told The Post.\nFilippelli said his mother started using kratom believing it to be a healthy. Kratom Distro, the website she purchased the supplement \u201cSpace Dust\u201d promotes products on its website as having an \u201cuplifting and energetic\u201d effect.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no labels on this stuff. No one knows what\u2019s in it. They\u2019re concentrating it. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d Filippelli said, noting the substance his mother consumed had no instructions regarding serving-size or ingredients.\nThe night before his mother\u2019s death, Filippelli and his mother were celebrating his high school graduation. She was thrilled he\u2019d be attending the University of Florida.\n\u201cI woke up the next morning and had a text from her saying \u2018good morning my graduate.\u2019 I responded and I never got a text back,\u201d he said.\nKratom, made from the leaf of the kratom tree, a species common across Southeast Asia, is at the center of dozens of wrongful death lawsuits.\nThe most recent estimate, from 2021, is that 1.7 million Americans aged 12 and older used kratom that year.\nA CDC study in 2019 found that its use had caused 107 deaths in 32 states between July 2016 and December 2017.\nWhile some report kratom can help relieve pains, depression and anxiety and reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal, at higher doses, the herbal substance can mimic an opioid.\nHowever there are few rules around kratom, and none apply nationwide. Six states\u2014Alabama; Arkansas; Indiana; Rhode Island; Vermont and Wisconsin\u2014outlaw its possession and sale and some cities or counties ban retailers from stocking it.\nDoctors urge buyers to beware as its active ingredient, mitragynine, can be highly addicting, and has shown up in toxicology reports of some individuals who have died after ingesting the substance.\n\u201cIt acts on the same part of the brain as morphine does, as fentanyl does. It\u2019s completely unregulated. At a minimum, I think we should end the free for all,\u201d Dr. Tucker Woods, chair of the emergency department and medical director of Lenox Health Greenwich Village told The Post.\n\u201cRight now when you buy kratom you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting because it\u2019s not regulated. If you\u2019re buying kratom when you look at these packages they don\u2019t tell you the recommended dose you just have to guess how much you\u2019re supposed to take. It\u2019s a free for all.\u201d\nWoods, who has treated patients with kratom addictions, recalled a patient who went from taking 7 kratom pills a day to 80 capsules within minutes of waking up.\n\u201cPeople will develop a tolerance with kratom that goes up 10-fold. It\u2019s an emerging threat out there gaining popularity for its euphoric effects. They\u2019ll say it\u2019s a herbal product capable of giving you a legal high\u2026 there\u2019s zero regulation right now.\u201d\nMelissa Vidrine, a licensed clinical social worker from Lafayette Parish, Louisiana says the kratom product she believes killed her 26-year-old son, Daniel Vidrine in February, 2021, is still on sale at the local gas station\u2014at eye level at the register under the label Whole Herbs, which mimics the Whole Foods logo.\nHer son Daniel, an Air Force veteran, was 26 when he died from acute mitragynine toxicity, also known as a kratom overdose.\nVidrine said her son found out about kratom when he was looking for a remedy for anxiety and insomnia.\n\u201cHe said it helped him with his depression and anxiety. He said it helped him with sleep, but there was no evidence that it really did because it made his behavior more erratic,\u201d she said.\nHe suffered side effects including sweating, a red rash that broke out all over his back and trouble sleeping.\n\u201cHe said \u2018they wouldn\u2019t be selling it if it wasn\u2019t okay.\u2019 I told him, \u2018Daniel, not everything they sell is good for you,\u2019\u201d Vidrine said, noting that her son had no history of drug use and was not drinking alcohol at the time of his death.\nHe would buy a 500-capsule bottle every few days at the gas station near his home. He died in the early morning hours after Vidrine say him last.\n\u201cWe got a phone call at 2:30 a.m. It appeared he had a seizure and ultimately died,\u201d she told The Post, noting that his son\u2019s wife filed a lawsuit against the company in 2022. The company has never responded to the suit. Attempts to reach it for comment by The Post were unsuccessful.\n\u201cThe kratom sold in the United States is not the same kratom leaf plucked from a plant and used as a tea in South East Asia. [It] may be contaminated, degraded, and may not be safe for human consumption,\u201d she said urging users to consult with a doctor as, she says, it can cause dependency.\nLinda Mautner, a nurse from Delray Beach, Fl., told The Post she blames Kratom for her 20-year-old son Ian\u2019s suicide in 2014.\nMautner said her son first started consuming kratom at Purple Lotus Kava Bar in Delray Beach serving chilled tea drinks where kratom is on the menu and marketed on its social media page as a \u201cmiracle leaf.\u201d\nBut soon, Ian started buying the powder from various establishments and making it at home, Mautner told The Post.\n\u201cI would find packets of the powder. He would get the powder, mix it at home and I\u2019d find traces of it. At first we didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d she told The Post of her son\u2019s kratom use that began two years before his death in 2014.\n\u201cAt one point in the beginning, he\u2019d come home talking 100 miles an hour another time he\u2019d be lethargic.\u201d\nHe had kratom and antidepressants in his system at the time of his death, according to a toxicology report.\n\u201cI wish I had known what this was, period,\u201d she told The Post of making it her mission to raise awareness of the dangerous herb."

      "text": "Kratom \u2014 an herbal supplement used to manage chronic pain and treat opioid addiction \u2014 is more dangerous than previously suspected, according to a new study linking it to dangerous side effects and even deaths.\nBinghamton University researchers reviewed statistics from the National Poison Data System and found over 2,300 people had called poison control centers across the US to report concern over Kratom-linked illness. The most common symptoms reported were agitation, rapid heartbeat, and drowsiness. However, others reported more serious symptoms like seizures, hallucinations, and even comas.\n\u201cKratom is not reasonably expected to be safe and poses a public health threat due to its availability as an herbal supplement,\u201d a June study concluded in the Pharmacotherapy journal.\nThe supplement was identified by the coroner as a cause or contributing factor to death in four cases, according to records from a county medical examiner\u2019s office in New York State,\nKratom was a cause in 91 overdose deaths in 27 states from July 2016 to December 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited in an April report\n\u201cWhat we found was alarming for something that\u2019s widely available as an herbal supplement,\u201d William Eggleston, lead author of the study told Insider.\nIn addition, the study\u2019s findings indicated the supplement put patients at risk for withdrawal, respiratory depression, and death.\nThe study did not examine how much Kratom was taken by users.\nIn 2017, the Food and Drug Administration issued a health advisory on the \u201cdeadly risks\u201d associated with Kratom.\nThe supplement, which is legal in New York City, is sold as both capsules and powders has recently grown in popularity for what users tout are its myriad benefits.\n\u201cKratom may have a role in treating pain and opioid use disorder, but more research is needed on its safety and efficacy,\u201d Eggleston said in a statement.\n\u201cOur results suggest it should not be available as an herbal supplement,\u201d he added.\nKratom is derived from the Mitragyna speciosa plant native to Southeast Asia."

      "text": "Soccer moms apparently love this trendy, plant-based drug\nThis hot, plant-derived substance is big with partiers, former opioid addicts and, apparently, soccer moms.\n\u201cA third of our clientele are looking for a caffeine-free alternative to get them through their day,\u201d licensed kratom business owner Faith Day recently told Wired. \u201cI\u2019m talking soccer moms.\u201d\nKratom is a tropical tree that has been used as a holistic remedy in Southeast Asia for centuries and, in the last 15 or so years, has also been widely adopted as a mostly legal curative in the US and Europe. The drug \u2014 possession of which is only criminalized in six states and for members of the US Army and Navy \u2014 is used as everything from a caffeine alternative to a chronic pain reliever, a substitute for those quitting opioids or alcohol, and a nootropic (or cognitive \u201csmart drug\u201d) credited with a slew of health benefits.\nWhile the natural substance is often associated with former heroin users and partying, Day says a significant percentage of customers at her Oregon shop, Clean Kratom Portland, are, in fact, mothers who prefer the herb to their daily cup of joe.\nThat may come as a surprise to those who know about kratom from headlines linking it to serious, sometimes lethal, side effects and overdoses, as well as dealers being busted for illegally peddling it. But Day believes the fatalities are not because of kratom, but because of what black-market sellers are cutting it with.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very vocal that I think kratom should be regulated like marijuana,\u201d said Day, who is among only two Department of Agriculture-licensed kratom businesses in the US. She added that the fact that versions of a Kratom Consumer Protection Act have been passed in three states is proof the substance needs regulation, not to be banned.\n\u201cIf it was as dangerous as the media says, I don\u2019t think that would be happening,\u201d Day said. \u201cNobody\u2019s passing a heroin consumer protection bill.\u201d\nSome scientists approximate that the US has somewhere in the ballpark of 10 million to 15 million kratom users.\n\u201cWhen millions of people say they\u2019re using kratom, and it\u2019s helping them with conditions that are really difficult to help people with, we have to listen,\u201d University of Rochester therapeutic drug-use researcher Marc Swogger told Wired. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that a single death has been the result of kratom.\u201d"

      "text": "RFK Jr. launches crackdown on kratom \u2014 the \u2018legal morphine\u2019 substance often found in smoke shop products\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced plans to crack down on kratom, a plant ingredient whose opioid-like qualities have rattled health officials.\nKratom is often marketed as a painkiller and energy booster and sold with flashy packaging in gas stations, smoke shops, and liquor stores.\nBut in recent years, manufacturers have found ways to enhance the potency of a compound in Kratom, 7-OH or 7-hydroxymitragynine, which latches onto opioid receptors in the brain, increasing dependence.\n\u201cI became an addict because [heroin] was so available, but I had to go to the South Bronx or the Lower East Side. But now you can go to any gas station,\u201d Kennedy, 71, told reporters during a press conference July 29.\n\u201cThey\u2019re marketing them to children: They\u2019re gummy bears, they\u2019re bright colors, they\u2019re candy-flavored. This is really a sinister, sinister industry.\u201d\nKennedy and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the FDA would begin pushing to schedule 7-OH as a controlled substance.\nFrom there, the Drug Enforcement Agency will conduct a review and determine whether or not 7-OH will become classified as an illicit drug.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Makary said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lot we don\u2019t know. This may be the calm before the storm. It may be the tip of the iceberg, but let\u2019s be aggressive and proactive.\u201d\nWhat is kratom?\nExtracted from leaves of an evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, kratom is used as a painkiller and an energy booster in various drinks, powders, gummies and capsules.\nKratom has been used in herbal medicines dating back at least to the 1800s. But the advancements in synthesizing 7-OH have raised red flags.\n\u201c7-OH is not just \u2018like\u2019 an opioid \u2026 it is an opioid,\u201d said Makary, describing the compound as 13 times more potent than morphine. \u201cAnd yet it is sold in vape stores, in smoke shops, in convenience stores, in gas stations that are popping up around the United States. And no one knows what it is.\u201d\nAccording to the FDA, 7-OH is not lawfully approved as a dietary supplement or food additive, and companies aren\u2019t being truthful if they claim otherwise.\n\u201cConsumers who use 7-OH products are exposing themselves to products that have not been proven safe or effective for any use,\u201d the agency warned last month.\nThe FDA has blasted out warning letters to at least seven companies over products that have 7-OH added to them.\nIs kratom legal?\nFor now, kratom is technically legal, though some states are launching their own crackdown.\nAt least seven states have already moved to ban kratom: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.\nThe FDA also has not approved kratom for us in drugs.\nDangers of kratom and kratom withdrawal\nKratom, particularly with 7-OH, is known to be highly stimulative and addictive.\nIt can cause symptoms such as rapid weight loss, liver damage, high blood pressure, dizziness, depression, seizures, and more, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nBetween 2011 and 2017, national poison control centers fielded 1,807 calls about kratom exposures, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWarnings about the addictive nature of kratom have gone viral on social media platforms such as TikTok amid the spread of drinks like Feel Free, a tonic with kratom in it.\nRecently, The Post reported on the case of Johnny Loring, who consumed large amounts of kratom and died with high levels of mitragynine and the prescription painkiller gabapentin in his system.\n\u201cThe level of kratom shocked me. It overwhelmed me. It made my gut sick,\u201d said Loring\u2019s mom, Jennifer Young, after discovering 20 packs of kratom near Loring\u2019s room. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so addicting.\u201d"

      "text": "What to know about dangerous \u2018black tumor\u2019 cancer as Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband Brandon Blackstock dies at 48\nKelly Clarkson\u2018s ex-husband, talent manager Brandon Blackstock, has died after a three-year private battle with melanoma. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,\u201d Blackstock\u2019s management company, Starstruck, said in a statement on Aug. 7, 2025.\n\u201cBrandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family.\u201d\nThe Post tapped two experts for insight into melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Known as \u201cblack tumor,\u201d melanoma sends about 8,000 Americans to the grave each year \u2014 here\u2019s what you can do to avoid becoming one of them.\nWhat makes melanoma so dangerous?\n\u201cMany skin cancers \u2014 for example, basal cell carcinoma \u2014 grow only on the skin and do not commonly spread,\u201d Dr. Viktoryia Kazlouskaya, CEO of the Dermatology Circle, told The Post.\nMelanoma, meanwhile, is a whole different beast.\n\u201cMelanoma is considered the most dangerous type of skin cancer because it has a high potential to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early,\u201d said Dr. Adarsh Vijay Mudgil, a dermatologist.\nThis is because melanoma cells act differently than other skin cancer cells, quickly spreading to other organs and tissues via the bloodstream and lymphatic system, Mudgil explained.\nThe risk of melanoma spreading depends on several factors, Kazlouskaya added, including the size and stage of the tumor, the patient\u2019s age and other medical conditions they might have, such as a suppressed immune system.\nFor \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d alum Teddi Mellencamp, who was diagnosed with melanoma in 2022, doctors discovered several tumors in her brain in February 2025, which they believe \u201chad been growing for at least six months.\u201d\n\u201dThese are all a direct result of my melanoma,\u201d she shared via Instagram in March. Since then, doctors have also found tumors in her lungs.\nWhat does melanoma look like?\n\u201cMelanomas can appear as a new mole, a changing mole or a spot with an irregular shape, border or color, often with shades of brown, black, or even pink, red or white,\u201d Mudgil said.\n\u201cThings to look for are the \u2018ABCDE\u2019s\u2019 of melanoma \u2014 asymmetry, border irregularity, color variability, diameter greater than 6 mm (which is the size of a pencil eraser), and last, evolution of an existing mole to exhibit any of the aforementioned qualities,\u201d he recommended.\nWhile it\u2019s helpful to keep an eye on your skin for any changes, Kazlouskaya pointed out that in many cases, you\u2019ll need a professional to evaluate suspicious spots.\n\u201cMany common moles can be large or slightly irregular but are not dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd vice versa \u2014 melanomas are not always very atypical and sometimes don\u2019t even have pigment.\u201d\nWho\u2019s at risk for melanoma?\n\u201cMelanoma can affect folks of all skin colors and ethnicities,\u201d Mudgil said.\nHowever, lighter skin significantly raises your chances of developing the disease. In fact, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is 1 in 33 for white people, compared to just 1 in 1,000 for black people, according to the American Cancer Society.\nThis is because lighter skin contains less melanin, the pigment that protects against UV damage. Among those with lighter skin, the risk is especially higher for people with red or blond hair, blue or green eyes or skin that freckles or burns easily.\nThe risk of melanoma also increases with age. The average age of Americans diagnosed is 66, but it\u2019s one of the most common cancers in people under 30 \u2014 especially young women.\nOther risk factors include being male, having several moles, a personal or family history of the disease and a history of blistering sunburns, particularly in childhood. People who spend a lot of time outdoors may also face higher risk due to increased sun exposure.\nHow can I protect myself from melanoma?\nMost skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet rays.\nTo lower your risk of melanoma, it\u2019s essential to be mindful of how much UV exposure you\u2019re getting.\n\u201cDaily sunscreen and protective clothing when the sun is extreme are simple prevention measures,\u201d Kazlouskaya said.\nThe sun\u2019s rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., so try to avoid being outside during these hours or stay in the shade.\nBut don\u2019t be fooled by cloudy or cool days \u2014 UV rays can still reach you, and they reflect off surfaces like water, cement and snow.\nThat\u2019s why you should wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, no matter the weather.\nAnd never, ever step foot in an indoor tanning bed. They emit harmful UV radiation, and studies show that using one before the age of 35 can increase your risk of melanoma by up to 75%.\nFinally, prevention is key.\n\u201cYearly skin checks and self-exams may help detect a suspicious spot early on,\u201d Kazlouskaya said.\nWhat are my odds of surviving melanoma?\n\u201cMelanoma is among the \u2018deadliest\u2019 cancers we know.\u201d Kazlouskaya said. The key to successful treatment is early detection.\n\u201cThe earlier we catch it, the better,\u201d she explained. \u201cAt early stages, it can often be cured with just a simple excision and has a wonderful prognosis.\u201d\nBut once the cancer spreads, those odds change dramatically.\nIn cases where melanoma hasn\u2019t spread beyond the skin, 99 out of 100 patients will survive for five years after diagnosis, according to the ACS.\nThat number drops significantly to just 35 out of 100 patients when the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, like the lungs or liver.\nIn 2025, the ACS estimates that around 104,960 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in the US, with approximately 8,430 Americans expected to die from the disease.\n\u201cIf you see something unusual on your skin, get in to see a board certified dermatologist ASAP!\u201d Mudgil said."

      "text": "This \u2018dictator\u2019 of hormones has a major impact on sleep and metabolism \u2014 how to tell if your levels are out of whack\nStop the stresses!\nCortisol is known as the body\u2019s primary stress hormone, but it has many essential functions. It naturally peaks in the morning to help you wake up and feel alert and then gradually decreases throughout the day to eventually prepare your body for sleep.\nElevated cortisol over a long while can lead to increased appetite, weight gain, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, mood swings, a higher risk of diabetes, sleep troubles and skin problems.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know your cortisol patterns. Enter Eli Health, a Montreal-based health tech startup that recently soft-launched an at-home instantaneous cortisol test.\n\u201cWe started the company six years ago, initially out of a personal need,\u201d Marina Pavlovic Rivas, cofounder and CEO of Eli Health, told The Post.\n\u201cWe started with this hormone, given the wide-reaching impact it has on health.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at how the test works \u2014 and how to improve cortisol levels.\nWhat does cortisol do?\nCortisol is made and released by the adrenal glands in response to stress.\nLight exposure, diet and sleep also significantly influence cortisol levels.\nThe hormone dictates the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response, while helping to manage blood pressure and blood sugar levels and regulate immune function.\n\u201cIt goes way beyond stress \u2014 it has an impact on all bodily functions,\u201d Pavlovic Rivas said about cortisol.\n\u201c[It\u2019s been] said that hormones are not a democracy, and that cortisol is the dictator,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen cortisol is dysregulated, it has a trickle-down impact on all other hormones that also play a role in health.\u201d\nHow does the Eli Health test work?\nEli Health recommends testing at least every two weeks to monitor your cortisol curve.\nA test should be taken in the morning, ideally 30 minutes after waking, and in the evening before bedtime. A monthly four-pack costs $32.\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple test that resembles a COVID or pregnancy test \u2014 except it\u2019s with spit, which has long been used to measure cortisol levels.\nFirst, you download the Eli Health app, which reads test results and logs data.\nThe app walks users through the process. A test is placed under the tongue for a minute to collect saliva.\n\u201cWhat we like to say is to imagine that you\u2019re filling a tube,\u201d Pavlovic Rivas said.\n\u201cInstead of just leaving the pad on your tongue passively, do like if you\u2019re filling a tube or a glass with saliva, by pushing that saliva onto the pad,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhen you think there\u2019s enough saliva, put twice as much.\u201d\nThen, you pull a tab on the test until you see a blue dot. Now, it\u2019s a 20-minute waiting game.\nA line appears during that time, but it\u2019s not like a COVID or pregnancy test where you know the outcome right away.\nYou have to use the app to take a picture of the line to get the reading.\nThe app tells you if your measurement is within range and generates your score.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the intensity of color of the line,\u201d Pavlovic Rivas said. \u201cWe use computer vision algorithms to translate an image and the information present in that image into a hormone level.\u201d\nIf you didn\u2019t get a line because there wasn\u2019t enough saliva or the tab wasn\u2019t pulled correctly, the test is useless.\nHow to improve cortisol levels\nA feature in the app lets users document activities that can influence cortisol. This helps to identify patterns so adjustments can be made to achieve optimal levels.\nA healthy diet, moderate-intensity exercise, consistently adequate sleep, mindfulness practices, time in nature and supportive relationships can contribute to healthy cortisol levels.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this again and again in the user base,\u201d Pavlovic Rivas said. \u201cFor some people, for example, just being out in nature would be enough to have a very significant impact on cortisol.\u201d\nPavlovic Rivas said that users have also noted that their late-night high-intensity workouts may not be as helpful as they thought.\n\u201cAt night they feel tired but wired, don\u2019t have a great night of sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cBy being able to see that their cortisol curve is dysregulated with higher levels in the evening, [they can] prioritize lower intensity exercise in the evening or do it earlier in the day.\u201d\nCortisol testing is slated to be fully available to the public at the end of September.\nEli Health also plans to launch its testing system for the fertility hormone progesterone \u2014 which regulates the menstrual cycle and influences mood, sleep and energy \u2014 in the fall."

      "text": "James Van Der Beek reveals the minor colorectal cancer symptom he dismissed before his diagnosis\nJames Van Der Beek is sharing the subtle colorectal cancer symptom he ignored before his shocking diagnosis.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any red flag or something glaring,\u201d he told Healthline this week.\nThe 48-year-old \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum publicly shared the news of his diagnosis last November.\n\u201cBefore my diagnosis, I didn\u2019t know much about colorectal cancer. I didn\u2019t even realize the screening age dropped to 45; I thought it was still 50.\u201d\nRates of colon cancer among young people have been steadily rising over the past three decades, even as diagnoses among older people decline. A staggering 20% of colorectal cancer cases in 2019 were discovered in people younger than 55, up from 11% in 1995.\nPrior to his diagnosis, Van Der Beek noticed a change in his bowel movements, which he attributed to his coffee consumption.\n\u201cI thought maybe I needed to stop coffee,\u201d he told People last year. \u201cOr maybe not put cream in the coffee. But when I cut that out and it didn\u2019t improve, I thought, \u2018All right, I better get this checked out.\u2019\u201d\nA colonoscopy confirmed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer.\nCommon colorectal cancer symptoms\nChanges in bowel movement are among the six telltale signs of colorectal cancer. Experts maintain that a tumor in the colon or rectum will, similar to \u201ca clog in a pipe,\u201d alter bathroom habits.\nThese changes can include frequent constipation, diarrhea, or both. In many cases, patients don\u2019t feel \u201cempty\u201d after going number 2 or notice that their stools look different.\nOne possible symptom among colon cancer patients is pencil-thin poop. This defining defecation tends to present if tumors are present near the end of the colon or line the inside of the organ, as it narrows whatever stool passes through.\nOthers include fatigue, anemia, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.\nExcluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. The number of early-onset cases is on the rise, with diagnoses in people under 50 expected to double by 2030.\nJames Van Der Beek\u2019s cancer advice\nFor his part and in the spirit of early detection, Van Der Beek has partnered with Guardant Health to raise awareness about the Shield blood test.\n\u201cWhat I love about the Shield test is it\u2019s convenient, simple, FDA approved \u2014 it\u2019s a simple blood draw and it could be done at your next doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\nWhile colonoscopy is considered the standard test for colorectal cancer, blood tests like the one offered by Shield are providing a different avenue for early detection.\n\u201cPeople are three times more likely to adhere to [screening] advice when it\u2019s just a blood test. It\u2019s convenient for people who either can\u2019t take off work to do a colonoscopy or who [face] other barriers to some of the other testing methods,\u201d said Van Der Beek.\nAccording to the FDA, a study showed Guardant\u2019s Shield test detected 83% of colorectal cancers\n\u201cI really want to impress upon people that you don\u2019t need symptoms to get screened. If you are 45 or older or have a family history, talk to your doctor about your screening options,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the Colon Cancer Alliance, 82% of young colon cancer survivors were initially misdiagnosed, and 67% consulted at least two doctors before getting the right diagnosis.\nAnd early detection equals increased survival.\nThe colon cancer mortality rate in people under 55 has been rising about 1% annually since the mid-2000s, while deaths among older adults have declined.\nThis is partly due to the fact that cancer in younger people is often detected at more advanced stages, according to the American Cancer Society.\nIn regards to prevention and early detection, Van Der Beek shared, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a big part of my healing process to spread the word and to help anybody I can from having to go through what I have been through.\u201d"
