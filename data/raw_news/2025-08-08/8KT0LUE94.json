Forecasts ranged from 1.10% to 3.10%.\n\nIf correct, this will mark the ninth straight month inflation has fallen.\n\n\"We are expecting food inflation to be lower, to contract on a year-on-year basis...we continue to see this moderation on the back of healthy supply coming from last year - that's bringing about this disinflationary trend,\" said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank.\n\n\"Although on a month-on-month basis, certain vegetable prices have gone up - for instance, onion and tomato prices - but that increase has been very moderate and lower than the usual seasonal trends.\"\n\nInflation was expected to average 3.40% this fiscal year, slightly above the RBI's 3.10% forecast, a recent separate Reuters poll showed.\n\nThe benign inflation outlook gives the RBI more room to support the economy, which is under pressure after U.S. President Donald Trump sharply raised tariffs on Indian goods.\n\n\"Given the challenging external environment, high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, a general environment of economic uncertainty and weakening domestic activity indicators growth may disappoint,\" said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ. \"Inflation could undershoot the RBI's revised projections but is unlikely to drive further easing.\"\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile components like food and fuel and better reflects domestic demand, was expected to have fallen to 4.20% in July, down from an estimated 4.30% in June.\n\nThe Indian statistics agency does not publish official core inflation data.\n\nInflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) was expected to have edged down to -0.30% in July from -0.13% in June, the poll showed.",
