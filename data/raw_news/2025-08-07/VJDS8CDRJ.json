  "content": "FORT LEE, N.J., Aug. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Kedrion is proud to announce that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to investigational treatment for Congenital Aceruloplasminemia, a rare genetic disorder affecting iron metabolism. Kedrion launched their new logo on April 14, 2025. (PRNewsfoto/Kedrion Biopharma) This designation marks a significant milestone in Kedrion's commitment to addressing the unmet medical needs of patients living with ultra-rare diseases and exemplifies sustainable innovation in plasma-derived therapies. Aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CP gene, leading to a deficiency or absence of ceruloplasmin, a protein essential for iron transport. The condition results in iron accumulation in the brain, liver, and pancreas, causing a range of symptoms including: Due to its rarity and complexity, Aceruloplasminemia is often misdiagnosed, delaying access to care and treatment. The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation recognizes the potential of Kedrion's plasma-derived ceruloplasmin to address an unmet need in treatment. This achievement is particularly significant because Kedrion is using industrial plasma processing waste to extract and purify new candidate therapeutic proteins. This milestone builds on Kedrion's ongoing research efforts aimed at understanding ceruloplasmin biology and Aceruloplasminemia mechanisms, including two recent publications conducted in collaboration with a network of academic institutions, clinical research centers, and national biomedical organizations. \"Receiving Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA is a fundamental step in our journey to bring hope to patients affected by Congenital Aceruloplasminemia,\" said Andrea Caricasole, Chief Research and Innovation Officer at Kedrion. For Kedrion, this designation reinforces our long-term commitment to innovation in the field of ultra-rare diseases and is in line with our strategy of systematically leveraging unused plasma fractions to develop novel therapies to maximize the value of donated plasma, a precious and limited resource. We believe this progress will inspire further discoveries and collaborations, ultimately expanding the horizon of possibilities for patients who have long been underserved.\"\n\nKedrion is committed to advance plasma-derived therapies and to support patients with rare and ultra-rare conditions. The Orphan Drug Designation for ceruloplasmin is a testament to the power of scientific collaboration, sustainable innovation, and the importance of advocacy in rare disease communities.

Currently, GARD aims to provide the following information for this disease:\nPopulation Estimate:Fewer than 5,000 people in the U.S. have thisdisease.\nSymptoms:May start to appear as an Adult and as an Older Adult.\nCause:This disease has more than one possible cause.\nOrganizations:Patient organizations dedicated to this rare disease are available on GARD, or you may contact a GARD Information Specialist for additional information.\nAceruloplasminemia is caused by genetic mutations, also known as pathogenic variants. Genetic mutations can be hereditary, when parents pass them down to their children, or they may occur randomly when cells are dividing. Genetic mutations may also result from contracted viruses, environmental factors, such as UV radiation from sunlight exposure, or a combination of any of these. Learn more about genetic diseases from the National Library of Medicine (NLM).\nIf you suspect you may have this disease, you may want to start collecting your family health history. Information such as other family members who have had similar symptoms, when their/your symptoms first appeared, or exposures to any potential disease-causing environmental factors should be discussed with your medical team. This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history.\nCan This Disease Be Passed Down From Parent to Child?\nIt is possible for a biological parent to pass down genetic mutations that cause or increase the chances of getting this disease to their child. This is known as inheritance. Knowing whether other family members have previously had this disease, also known as family health history, can be very important information for your medical team. This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history.\nThere are multiple ways, or patterns, a disease can be inherited depending on the gene(s) involved. Based on GARD's current data, this disease can be inherited in the following pattern(s):\nAutosomal Recessive\nAutosomal means the gene involved is located on one of the numbered chromosomes. Recessive means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each biological parent, to be affected by the disease. A carrier is a person who only has one copy of the genetic mutation. A carrier usually doesn't show any symptoms of the disease.\nIf both biological parents are carriers, there is a 25% their child inherits both copies of the mutated gene and is affected by the disease. Additionally, there is a 50% chance their child inherits only one copy of the mutated gene and is a carrier.\nSymptoms of this disease may start to appear as an Adult and as an Older Adult.\nThe age symptoms may begin to appear differs between diseases. Symptoms may begin in a single age range, or during several age ranges. The symptoms of some diseases may begin at any age. Knowing when symptoms may have appeared can help medical providers find the correct diagnosis.\nPrenatal\nBefore Birth\nNewborn\nBirth-4 weeks\nInfant\n1-23 months\nChild\n2-11 years\nAdolescent\n12-18 years\nAdult Selected\n19-65 years\nOlder Adult Selected\n65+ years\nSymptoms may start to appear as an Adult and as an Older Adult.\nSymptoms\nThe types of symptoms experienced, and their intensity, may vary among people with this disease. Your experience may be different from others. Consult your health care team for more information.\nThe following describes the symptom(s) associated with this disease along with the corresponding body system(s), description, synonyms, and frequency (Note: Not all possible symptoms may be listed):\nNervous System Nervous System\n33 Symptoms\n33 Symptoms\n33 Symptoms\nNervous System\nThe nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Common symptoms of problems in the nervous system include trouble moving, speaking, swallowing, breathing, or learning. Problems with memory, senses, or mood may also occur. Nervous system diseases are usually diagnosed and treated by neurologists.\nMedical Term\nAbnormality of the nervous system\nFrequency\nUncommon\nVery frequent\nVery frequent\nAlways\nDescription\nAn abnormality of the nervous system.\nSynonym\nAbnormality of the nervous system; Neurologic abnormalities; Neurological abnormality\nOn average, it takes more than six years to receive an accurate diagnosis for a rare disease. Many primary care providers (PCPs) may not be familiar with these diseases, and reaching the correct diagnosis often requires seeing multiple specialists. Advocating for yourself can help shorten this timeline. To combat common challenges, consider the following steps:\nFind disease-specific information to discuss with your healthcare providers.\nAsk about diagnostic testing that could help narrow down the cause.\nRequest referrals to specialists who have experience with your symptoms or suspected disease.\nKnowing how to start and what steps to take can make a significant difference in reaching a diagnosis sooner.\nYour Diagnostic Team\nHow can a diagnostic team help?\nEstablishing care with a dedicated primary care provider (PCP) is an important early step in your rare disease journey. A PCP can help improve care and shorten the time to diagnosis by providing referrals to the appropriate specialists. These specialists, with advanced training in different body systems or types of diseases, can offer the specialized diagnostic procedures you need.\nDiagnostic team for Aceruloplasminemia may include:\nMultidisciplinary Care Centers\nIs it time to find a multidisciplinary care center?\nIf you've visited your PCP, met with specialists, and undergone the recommended tests, but still do not have a confirmed diagnosis, it may be time to visit a multidisciplinary care center. Multidisciplinary care centers are usually teaching, university, or research hospitals that have teams of medical experts and specialists working together in the same location. This means a wide range of diagnostic tests and clinical knowledge are available at one facility, which can help increase communication and collaboration among your care team. The additional resources often available at multidisciplinary centers may help speed the time to diagnosis for rare diseases.\nUse this tool to find hospitals that may partner with medical schools and programs in your area.\nMultidisciplinary Care Centers\nIs it time to find a multidisciplinary care center?\nIf you've visited your PCP, met with specialists, and undergone the recommended tests, but still do not have a confirmed diagnosis, it may be time to visit a multidisciplinary care center.
