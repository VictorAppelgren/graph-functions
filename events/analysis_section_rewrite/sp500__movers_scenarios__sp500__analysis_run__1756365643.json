      "feedback": "Your draft mixes broad macro themes with company‑level detail but falls short on the precision, causal depth, and citation rigor required for a world‑class outlook. First, replace vague “Fed dovish stance” with a concrete trigger such as “Fed’s 25‑bp cut on 28 Aug” (OGK8WLL69) and quantify the AI rally impact by citing Nvidia’s 3.5 % pre‑/post‑earnings swing (MSPXAOHU8). Second, the “Q3 2025 earnings” line conflates ad‑tier revenue and P/E contraction; split these into separate Up items: one for ad‑tier revenue >3 % of total (61SVFUKBY) and another for a 10 % P/E contraction (A88B7V8PY), each with distinct probabilities. Third, the “EV losses + tariff” Down item is too generic; anchor it to Ford’s 4.3 % EBIT (W2622L6WW) and the 2.5 % tariff increase on EV components (W2622L6WW), and cite the 1.3 bn loss (W2622L6WW). Fourth, the 12‑mo Down about Japan’s aging population should reference the 120.7 trillion‑yen bank asset base (PA57YBYVQ) and the 49 % growth in overseas partnerships (PA57YBYVQ). Finally, tighten probabilities by tying them to historical event frequencies (e.g., 70 % probability of a Fed cut given CPI <3.5 % per OGK8WLL69) and ensure every fact or number has an in‑text ID. Remove filler, keep each line to one sentence, and double‑check that all cited IDs exist in the source material.",
