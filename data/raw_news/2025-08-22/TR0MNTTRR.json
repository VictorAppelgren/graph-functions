  "description": "The biggest payoffs for investing in real estate have long been out of reach for the vast majority of investors.",
  "content": "Rovshan Rasulov is a tech entrepreneur focused on innovation, tokenization, and transforming legacy industries.\n\nBlockchain and tokenization are reshaping participation in premium development projects, but greater regulatory certainty and visibility are needed.\n\nAnyone who has seen the price of their property appreciate over time knows that real estate can be a safe, lucrative way to preserve and grow capital. But the biggest payoffs for investing in real estate have long been out of reach for the vast majority of investors. The highest-yielding moments in the real estate development cycle are traditionally reserved for a select few: institutional funds, banks and developers.\n\nNow, thanks to blockchain and tokenization, that is starting to change.\n\nAs a private investor, developer and technology entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience, I have led and completed more than $100 million in development projects, focusing on integrating innovative financial and technological solutions, including tokenized investment structures and blockchain infrastructure for real-world assets.\n\nThrough my career, I\u2019ve found that often, the real money for institutional investors in real estate is made during the \u201cdeveloper\u2019s hour of profit.\u201d This is the pre-construction phase, when developers sell equity or units at significant discounts in order to raise capital quickly and launch their projects.\n\nThose who invest at this phase buy low and often sell later for much higher prices on the public markets. But getting into deals this early requires legal expertise, insider knowledge and often $1 million or more in capital, plus the ability to wait three to five years without liquidity. That has meant that, until recently, private investors had no access to these opportunities.\n\nToday, tokenization technology is beginning to open access to the developer\u2019s hour of profit to more people. By applying blockchain technology to the real estate sector, entrepreneurs are not just transforming how people are investing in real estate; they are also transforming who is investing.\n\nEarly efforts to improve access to high-margin real estate investing focused on crowdfunding and real estate investment trusts (REITs). These vehicles opened some opportunities for retail investors but at later stages of the development cycle, after most of the upside was already priced in.\n\nTokenization is a blockchain-based technology that converts ownership in real assets\u2014such as real estate or debt structures\u2014into digital tokens. These tokens can be programmed with smart contracts, embed investor rights and be offered to investors in the U.S. under compliant regulatory frameworks such as Reg D and Reg S, for accredited U.S. and international investors, respectively.\n\nMoving these transactions onto the blockchain creates a new legal, technical and operational infrastructure for fractional ownership.\n\nWhereas traditional real estate investing often demands access to millions in capital, tokenization allows smaller investors to participate in premium real estate projects with as little as $1,000. This helps them more easily diversify across multiple deals. Their rights are legally protected and secured on-chain.\n\nAnd when it comes time to exit, tokenization provides investors more options beyond just selling a unit or units. Peer-to-peer transfers, secondary market trading and structured buybacks offer investors greater liquidity at the time of their choosing.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to open up the most lucrative phases of real estate to private investors. Smaller players will have access to institutional-level strategies without needing to lead an institution.\n\nDeloitte predicts: \u201cThis technology could help build trillions of dollars of economic activity for the real estate sector over the next decade, in part, by allowing it to expand its investor base and product offerings. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that US$4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035.\u201d\n\nThis process of introducing tokenization to the real estate sector is already well underway in the U.S. In 2019, the startup Harbor created tokens on the Ethereum blockchain representing $100 million in shares in four real estate funds. DAMAC Group announced a $1 billion tokenized real estate partnership earlier this year. BlackRock is aiming to tokenize $10 trillion of real-world assets in partnership with Securitize, including real estate tokenization.\n\nBut while tokenization is already active and fast-growing in the U.S. market, regulation around these assets continues to develop. \u201cThe regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving, with different jurisdictions imposing varying rules regarding securities,\u201d EY notes.\n\nGreater clarity in the regulatory landscape could further accelerate the tokenization of real estate, opening up new opportunities for smaller investors. As will greater awareness and understanding of these technologies.\n\n\u201cThe most significant setback in real estate tokenization is the lack of knowledge about blockchain technologies in the real estate realm,\u201d Victoria Chynoweth reports for Forbes.\n\nWhile tokenization offers access to premium real estate strategies, it is not without risks. Investors may face challenges related to legal enforcement, platform reliability and the liquidity of secondary markets, which can vary depending on jurisdiction and demand.\n\nAdditionally, early-stage tokenized projects may lack the institutional protections or historical performance data typically required by conservative investors. As with any emerging asset class, participants must thoroughly evaluate the underlying asset quality, regulatory compliance and technological integrity of the issuing platform.\n\nAs regulatory and visibility issues are overcome, the future impact of tokenization in real estate investing could be vast.\n\nReal estate tokenization creates scalable, secure, transparent models for participating in institutional strategies through public infrastructure. Deals that used to get done among a few insiders behind closed doors can now be accessed by more investors.\n\nTokenization offers a new architecture of access. It allows private investors to participate in value creation and value consumption. The builders of these tools are not just launching new funds. They\u2019re laying the foundation for a new, more inclusive future for real estate investing.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

      "text": "Tokenization to Redefine Investing in Real Estate, But Regulators May Curb Market Growth\nBy 2030, the global market for tokenized real estate will reach up to $3 trillion and represent 15% of the real estate assets under management, ScienceSoft's research team predicts. Although the market is relatively young in 2025, real estate sellers are increasingly investing in tokenization technology, and investor demand is sufficient to justify the launch of token offerings.\nWhy Keep an Eye On Real Estate Tokenization\nFor 10 years, asset owners in the US have been ranking real estate as the best long-term investment. Still, high costs and low liquidity of real estate historically hindered investor demand. Costly settlement of real estate deals posed additional barriers to investing. It\u2019s no surprise tokenization technology enabling partial asset sales and low-cost deal closing quickly gained traction among the real estate investment domain players.\nTradeable blockchain tokens can represent any required portion of the property, which enables fractional asset sales and shared ownership. Tokenizing real estate gives sellers an opportunity to boost asset liquidity and attract a broader pool of investors. Tokenization solutions automate real estate financial and title transactions, removing intermediaries and cutting down settlement costs for all deal participants.\nAs of 2025, the US market for tokenized real estate is proliferating and offers rewarding investment opportunities for real estate sellers, intermediaries, and tokenization technology providers. Some asset management companies have already invested in custom tokenization solutions and are planning to invest more in the next years. Early pilots by Elevated Returns and RealT proved the technical and economic feasibility of real estate tokenization. We expect that regulatory support and dedicated legal frameworks for tokenized estate trading will speed up further market growth.\nLooking ahead, the growing use of tokenization in real estate will likely affect the demand for conventional REIT investments and mortgage loans and push investors to reconsider their portfolio structures. At the same time, enhanced asset liquidity will drive the volatility of the entire real estate market, potentially reducing its attractiveness for long-term investing.\nReal estate tokenization isn\u2019t just a trend. It\u2019s a shift in how we think about ownership, access, and value. It\u2019s where finance meets technology, and the future belongs to those ready to combine both.\nMary Zayats, Financial IT Principal Consultant at ScienceSoft (check the full video interview \u201cTokenizing Real Estate: Revolution or Hype?\u201d)\nKey Drivers and Hindrances of Real Estate Tokenization in 2025: Facts and Opinions\nDemand for tokenized real estate\nWe found that investor demand justifies the launch of real estate token offering solutions. According to the survey by EY, as of May 2023, 80% of high net-worth (HNW) investors and 67% of institutional investors were already investing or planning to invest in tokenized assets. By 2026, institutional investors expect to allocate 5.6% and HNW individuals \u2014 8.6% of their portfolio to tokenized assets. Both HNW investors (49%) and institutional investors (56%) cite real estate as their second most attractive tokenized asset investment option.\nRegulatory impact on market growth\nRoland Berger evaluated the market for tokenized real estate at $119 billion in 2023 and predicted that it would reach $3 trillion by 2030 at a CAGR of 60%. BCG projects that the market will grow from $120 billion in 2023 to $3.2 trillion in 2030 at a CAGR of 49%.\nAt the same time, analysts at KPMG and EY stress that the current US legal framework, where real estate tokens are considered securities and generic SEC restrictions are applied to investors, is a huge setback for market growth. Many of ScienceSoft\u2019s clients from the investment sector believe that once regulators develop more flexible rules and allow lower-net-worth individuals to invest in tokenized real estate without constraints, we will see a surge in demand for this type of investment.\nTokenization technology maturity\nGiven ScienceSoft\u2019s experience with tokenized asset projects, we knew for sure that blockchain tokenization technology is mature enough to develop solutions for a secure and cost-effective real estate token offering. Research by thought leaders mirrored our belief. For example, in its Hype Cycle for Web3 and Blockchain 2024, Gartner names tokenization an adolescent technology and predicts that it will reach mainstream adoption in 2\u20135 years.\nAlthough the market for tokenized real estate is relatively young in 2025, real estate sellers are increasingly investing in tokenization technology to enhance asset accessibility and reduce transactional costs. Deloitte found out that, as of June 2024, 12% of real estate firms globally had already implemented, and another 46% were piloting some asset tokenization solutions.\nTokenization software offering\nNext, we analyzed the market of real estate tokenization software, a critical factor defining how quickly real estate sellers can launch their token offering. Based on our findings, there are some service platforms for fast and cost-effective real estate tokenization, and the market is on the rise. According to Digital Asset Research, the number of tokenization platforms worldwide grew by 75% in 2023 alone. 38% of tokenization service companies were registered in the US, and 37% of them were working with real estate assets (e.g., SolidBlock, Tokeny, RealT, Polymath).\nYet, many larger real estate companies opt to build custom token offering software to support their complex ventures. ScienceSoft\u2019s clients from the domain name reduced technology costs, tailored compliance, non-restricted tokenomics, and direct control over investor data as the major advantages of custom solutions.\nOpportunities for secondary trading\nOne concern ScienceSoft\u2019s investment clients commonly voice is the lack of interoperable secondary market platforms for real estate token trading. Indeed, as of 2025, tokens are still mainly traded within the platform of issuance, which limits investor reach and inhibits liquidity benefits. In its 2024 Tokenization guide, Deloitte mentions scarce secondary markets for tokens among the primary barriers to the mainstream use of tokenization.\nThe good news is that solutions for token interoperability between various blockchains and traditional financial systems are on the way. For example, Swift is collaborating with a Web3 services platform Chainlink and dozens of major financial institutions, including BNY Mellon, BNP Paribas, Citi, and Lloyds Banking Group, to test its solution for cross-network transfer of tokenized assets. Once launched, the solution will enable frictionless secondary trading of real estate tokens on multiple CeFi and DeFi marketplaces.\nIndustry players\u2019 perspective\nWe interviewed business and IT leaders in the US real estate industry to find out if they believe 50%+ of real estate will be tokenized by 2030. The survey participants stress that real estate tokenization has a strong potential for development, but they believe that nowhere near half of real estate will be tokenized by 2030. Respondents note that residential properties, which make up the biggest share of the real estate market and usually assume full title ownership, do not have the same clear tokenization use cases as commercial estate. Thus, the residential sector will prevent tokenization from dominating the market in the mid-term. Some respondents also stressed that tokenizing residential real estate may violate the US mortgage regulations.\nHow Tokenization Reshapes Real Estate Investments\nReal estate sellers (developers, owners, managers)\nBy fractionalizing and tokenizing their assets, real estate sellers will benefit from enhanced asset liquidity and the possibility of attracting a broader range of domestic and foreign investors, including individuals with smaller portfolios. As an alternative form of funding, token offering proved to help real estate owners quickly raise considerable capital volumes. For example, a New York-based asset management company Elevated Returns raised $18 million in investments within two years by tokenizing the equity of the St. Regis Aspen Colorado resort.\nAs demand for liquid assets is traditionally higher, tokenization may drive the growth in property value. In Elevated Returns\u2019 case, the value of its token increased by 30% within 18 months of issuance. The token was listed on the secondary trading platform tZero and continued to trade strongly despite overall market uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. The token price gradually grew by an impressive 3.3x throughout 2022\u20132024.\nReal estate tokenization comes with complete transparency and traceability of real estate trading transactions. Automating transactional tasks with the help of smart contracts will let real estate sellers optimize employee workload and cut operational costs in the long run.\nWhile the sell side parties reap the biggest financial gains from real estate tokenization, they also bear the biggest upfront expenses. One needs to invest in property tokenomics and establishing dedicated security token offering solutions. The latter involves developing SEC-compliant smart contracts, building a custom or integrating an off-the-shelf solution for tokenized asset management, and partnering with tokenization and secondary trading platforms. From ScienceSoft\u2019s experience, a real estate tokenization project of average complexity may cost around $200,000\u2013$500,000.\nMoreover, real estate sellers should be ready to take compliance risks. As the market evolves, sellers may face new legislation for tokenized real estate, which can compromise their legal posture and require additional expenses for adhering to regulatory requirements.\nAuthor's note: Most of my clients in real estate investment cite regulatory uncertainty as the primary barrier to adopting tokenization. One way to de-risk tokenized offerings in a shifting legal landscape is to issue real estate tokens on compliance-native platforms like Securitize or SolidBlock. Major platform vendors are well aware of regulatory hurdles and typically offer built-in compliance features aligned with SEC and other relevant frameworks. And since they actively monitor legal developments, they can accommodate regulatory changes quicker and more effectively than most in-house teams.\nInvestors\nIndividual and institutional investors will benefit from wider opportunities for investing in real estate due to drastically reduced minimum investment. For example, a real estate token marketplace RealT, which tokenized 970+ properties in the US, sells tokens starting from just $50. 88% of platform users invested less than $5,000. Early adopters of RealT, Lofty, and similar say that the marketplaces operate and pay dividends as advertised.\nAs blockchain allows for seamless cross-border transactions with tokenized assets, investors will be able to access a broader range of properties worldwide and diversify their portfolios, bypassing currency and jurisdictional barriers. Automated direct settlement using smart contracts eliminates fees for intermediary services, reducing transactional costs.\nAt the same time, increased accessibility of real estate assets may lead to higher volatility and lower predictability of the real estate market, which means enhanced investment risks.\nReal estate brokers and agents\nGiven that tokenization on blockchain enables real estate trading without intermediaries, its rising adoption may diminish the role of real estate brokerages and agencies and make some of their services obsolete over time. As buyers and sellers become more comfortable with peer-to-peer transactions, intermediaries should expect a decrease in demand and revenue.\nTo stay in the game, brokerages and agencies should grow new skills and adapt their business models to the evolving investor preferences. One winning strategy for intermediaries is to offer consulting services related to the creation and management of tokenized real estate. A step further would be to invest in a real estate token offering platform and enter the tokenization service market.\nTechnology providers\nSince operations with real estate tokens rely heavily on blockchain and traditional technologies, technology vendors should expect increased demand for specialized solutions in the next 2\u20135 years. The growing popularity of tokenized real estate will indirectly benefit custom tokenization software vendors and the providers of tokenization platforms, secondary trade marketplaces, blockchain networks, and cryptocurrency wallets."

It reckoned that if investors were interested in initial coin offerings (ICOs) issued by projects with only a promise, they would \u201cbe excited\u201d for backed tokens, Stein said.\nHowever, he added:\n\"The overlap between investors demanding tokens and investors interested in security tokens was zero. People were buying tokens but they weren\u2019t buying it to invest, they were buying it to speculate.\"\nLast year, Harbor partnered with DRW Holdings\u2019 real estate wing to facilitate the sale of nearly 1,000 tokenized shares in an apartment building. However, the deal fell apart earlier this year due to issues between the mortgage lender and issuer.\nLockup period\nHarbor is providing a user platform for the investors, broker-dealers and advisors, which includes a private marketplace they can use to trade the securities.\nChristensen said the funds are \"high-yield, [which] usually requires a lockup\" under which investors contractually cannot sell their shares for three to five years.\n\"We just knew if we can provide measured liquidity for them and allow us to continue our business model [but] allow them to \u2026 exit as needed, that would be cutting-edge,\" he said.\nTypically, iCap investors buy securities and commit to the multi-year lockup. However, investors could need their money back before that period ended, Christensen explained. Under its old system, these investors would have to find another investor who would be willing to purchase the securities and commit to the remainder of the lockup period.\nThe process to find an investor interested in purchasing these securities and then transfer them was time-consuming and costly, but a market already exists: Christensen said his company has previously facilitated $2 million in trades for these funds.\n\"What Harbor does is they automate this entire process,\" he added. \"Those who want to come in come in, those who want to exit can do that.\"\nThe 17 broker-dealers that now have access to the platform include Bradley Wealth, an investment advisor.\n\"It's never going to be like a public market, but we can take something that's illiquid or semi-liquid and make it more liquid,\" Stein said.\n'Nobody\u2019s marketing it'\niCap operates under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, which requires a one-year mandatory lockup period for securities sold, separate from the restrictions the firm imposes, Christensen said.\n\"Once you\u2019ve held a security for one year, it can be freely tradeable,\" he said.\nWhat is interesting, Stein said, is that after this first year ends, non-accredited investors can trade the securities (though iCap approves the platform\u2019s users, so it is not open to the general public).\n\"I don't think it's a goal but what it says to these broker-dealers and RIAs [is] that they have this investment \u2026 they can get their non-accredited clients into it,\" he said.\nHe noted that unlike ICOs or other crowdfunding efforts, these fund shares, now represented by ERC-20 tokens on ethereum, are passive instruments.\n\"It\u2019s not like when you think of ICOs or crowdfunding where somebody\u2019s pushing an investment,\" he said. \"It democratizes it but nobody\u2019s out there marketing it.\"\nNevertheless, Stein said the new strategy is aligned with Harbor\u2019s broader mission, concluding:\n\"What we\u2019re hoping to do is increase access \u2026 in real estate and other [areas], which was kind of the promise of security tokens to begin with. We\u2019re just going about it a different way.\"\nJosh Stein image via CoinDesk archives\nNikhilesh De\nNikhilesh De is CoinDesk's managing editor for global policy and regulation, covering regulators, lawmakers and institutions.

      "text": "Blockchain technology continues to evolve despite all the discussions, prejudices, regulatory obligations, and speculations. An already-existing application of blockchain technologies \u2014 tokenization \u2014 has recently found itself a real-life use case in real estate.\nTokenization has been around almost as early as blockchain appeared, and it has been looking up to a bright future from day one. Estimations by McKinsey show that the volume of tokenized digital securities will reach $5 trillion by 2030.\nReal estate tokenization seems like it will significantly contribute to this growth. The market size for real estate tokenization was $2.7 billion in 2022, and its growth trajectory indicates that it could reach $16 trillion by 2030 according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group.\nLet's look into real estate tokenization and identify what's fueling this growth.\nTokenizing Real Estate\nTokenization refers to a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain. Any asset can be tokenized, including investment tools like bonds and equities, physical assets like art and real estate properties, and intangible valuables like identity and data.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nEssentially, a real estate property is tokenized by dividing it into fractions and automating the operational process using smart contracts. The first step is to divide the property's value into smaller bits, depending on the property owner's choice. Then, the property can be purchased bit by bit through these tokens, either by many different investors or by one person.\nSabai Ecoverse, which began in Thailand and is expanding globally, aims to democratize real estate investment for a broader audience who may not have access to large sums of capital.\nWhen I reached out to Vadym Bukhkalov, co-Founder of Sabai Ecoverse, for comment he said, \"The digitalization of real estate diminishes market barriers, augments liquidity, enhances transparency, and streamlines processes within the real estate sector. Blockchain technology offers heightened liquidity, fractional ownership, and fortified security owing to the immutable nature of blockchain.\u201d\nAdvantages Of Real Estate Tokenization\nOne of the advantages of tokenizing real estate is that it opens up the real estate market to smaller investors, thereby increasing movement and demand for all properties. Let's say I have a property that is worth $100,000. I could create 100 tokens, each valued at $1,000. This would turn selling your property into a process similar to crowdsourcing. I wouldn't have to wait for one prominent investor to purchase my property. Instead, 100 small investors could do the trick.\nThis method results in increased liquidity and decreased barriers to entry to the real estate market. Because the capital threshold is lower, the property is liquidized much faster while smaller investors enter the field.\nMoreover, smart contracts handle the whole process of tokenizing and selling on-chain, leading to transparency, automation, and security. The role of costly intermediaries like agents, banks, and legal representatives are handled by smart contracts. A smart contract can automatically sell a token as soon as the conditions are met, which is much faster, cheaper, and error-free than a human intermediary.\nFinally, the added benefit of blockchain technology appears in real estate tokenization as well: Security and transparency. All the sale and ownership processes take place and are recorded on-chain. This data is accessible to anyone and is almost impossible to tamper with. Therefore, all transactions remain trustworthy.\nThe benefits of real estate tokenization are amplified when the method is applied on a larger scale, where handling property is a part of everyday life.\nThe CEO of Etherland, Alexis Brand, highlighted such a future while explaining his project to me during an interview, stating, \"We envision a future where blockchain-based virtual real estate isn't just about digital plots but streamlining real-world real estate processes. Technology such as Etherland's has the potential to reduce costs, enhance security, and create entirely new opportunities for the industry.\nWe are approaching real estate tokenization from a different angle than most projects that focus solely on fractionalization. Blockchain-based solutions need to be streamlined to improve the efficiency of the real estate industry. The solutions are designed based on the idea that blockchain-based document management isn\u2019t hindered by the shortfalls that face centralized solutions, such as tampering, data loss, and single-point-of-failure attacks,\u201d Brand said.\nRisks Of Real Estate Tokenization\nFounder of Zircon Tech, Andres Zunino, introduced the challenges of this application, stating to Forbes, \"However, the tokenization of real estate is not without its challenges. One of the primary concerns is the lack of a consistent regulatory framework that governs the market. Different jurisdictions have varying rules and regulations surrounding digital assets, leading to confusion and uncertainty for investors and issuers. Moreover, the absence of a centralized reporting system for tokenized real estate transactions can hinder transparency and make it difficult for regulators to monitor and enforce compliance.\"\nThe most significant setback in real estate tokenization is the lack of knowledge about blockchain technologies in the real estate realm. Property owners hesitate to employ this method due to its complexities, while the area's lawmakers hesitate to set ground rules for such transactions. This regulatory uncertainty further damages the growth of real estate tokenization. The lack of regulatory guidance further creates problems in properly licensing real estate property and tax obligations per token.\nAnother risk of real estate tokenization appears on the technical front, regarding smart contracts. While they are fairly safe applications, they are a new technology. There are concerns that malicious actors could find loopholes and ways to go around the rules of smart contracts, which can lead to hacks. To prevent this from happening, well-trained technical audits should keep an eye on the chain and run regular diagnostics.\nDespite its cons, the real estate tokenization market is on a trajectory to grow. In addition to digitalization and on-chain storage, tokenization offers more benefits to real estate owners. Blockchain technology improves real-world real estate transactions, streamlines documentation, and enhances security, thus merging the virtual real estate world with the world of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology is improving rapidly. If the technical problems are solved and the regulatory gaps are filled, real estate tokenization might quickly become a mainstream application for all property owners."

      "text": "Disruptive technologies, such as asset tokenization, could transform real estate over the next few years. Built on blockchain technology, tokenization converts physical or financial assets into bite-sized, digital representations that can be securely traded or owned in fractional portions on a digital platform. Tokenized real estate could not only pave the way for new markets and products, but also give real estate organizations an opportunity to overcome challenges related to operational inefficiency, high administrative costs charged to investors, and limited retail participation.1\nOver the last eight years, since the first tokenized real estate deals were completed, tokenization has helped open potential new avenues for real estate investment through fractional ownership.2 This technology could help build trillions of dollars of economic activity for the real estate sector over the next decade, in part, by allowing it to expand its investor base and product offerings. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that US$4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, increasing from less than US$0.3 trillion in 2024, with a CAGR of 27% (figure 1) (see \u201cAbout this prediction\u201d).\nWe\u2019ll explore three underlying components of the global forecasted tokenized real estate ecosystem: tokenized private real estate funds, tokenized ownership of loans and securitizations, and tokenized ownership of undeveloped land or under-construction projects. Among these, we anticipate tokenized ownership of loans and securitizations will represent the highest share of tokenized real estate, while private funds represent the great potential opportunity (figure 2). Here\u2019s our breakdown:\nReal estate funds may be a suitable use case for tokenizing real estate assets. Single and interconnected blockchain-based platforms can offer convenient and swift ways to handle the issuance of tokenized limited partners\u2019 (LPs) equity interest, asset servicing, and secondary market trading, all which can create a more efficient fund by reducing the role of intermediaries.\nThere are two main ways in which existing real estate funds can be tokenized. First, tokenizing an \u201coff-chain\u201d fund or using a decentralized lending protocol, where an originator pools loans and sells them to a special-purpose vehicle, which then issues debt tokens backed by these loans. This allows investors to hold these tokens or use them as collateral in secondary markets. Second, new funds can be issued \u201con-chain\u201d based on agreements between borrowers and lenders, called real estate trust deeds, with covenants that allow the property to be held in a neutral, third-party trust until the debt is satisfied. For instance, in 2025, Kin Capital plans to launch a US$100 million real estate debt fund on Chintai, a layer-1 blockchain with a minimum investment requirement of US$50,000 for qualified institutional investors globally; it represents one of the first-performing real estate trust deeds.3\nReal estate asset tokenization can allow institutional investors to create custom portfolios with tokens that match their investment thesis.\nReal estate asset tokenization can allow institutional investors to create custom portfolios with tokens that match their investment thesis. And while traditional financial instruments lacked hyper-personalization, tokenization can make it possible. For instance, an issuer might want to tailor product offerings based on sustainability ratings of underlying assets or customize for investors seeking investments in properties near airports.4\nInvestors should understand what happens when a fund is in default. Can the lender take control of the actual asset and not just its digital version that operates on blockchain? Early movers in the space should test the waters for future adoption and lay the groundwork for such scenarios. If done right, embedding coded rules in digital tokens and linking them to real-world assets could allow financial tools to enable automatic compliance, capital calls, and distributions, all which could facilitate a far more effective end-to-end solution in fund management and resolution.\nSecuritized products may not be considered a likely candidate for tokenization, given their association with products that contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis and regulatory oversight. However, blockchain asset-backed securities are attracting a notable pool of investors. Since 2021, Redwood Trust has leveraged LiquidFi\u2019s blockchain technology for its CoreVest securitizations to report loan-level payment activity on a daily basis.5\nSome investors may find additional value from tokenized, near real-time data reporting, liquidity in exchanges, greater traceability, and performance reporting compared to conventional mortgage-backed securities (MBS). They can also benefit from cost savings in tasks such as origination, aggregation, and securitization. LiquidFi claims to have loan-level reduced reporting time for MBS from 55 days to 30 minutes on the Stellar blockchain,6 while Figure Technologies, Inc. estimates cost savings of about US$850 per US$100,000 mortgage.7 Figure Technologies reached home equity line of credit (HELOC) originations of more than US$13 billion and announced its first publicly rated, blockchain-based HELOC ABS securitization in 2023.8\nWhile fractional ownership of existing buildings has been a common theme in tokenization, in this new tide of large-scale developments, there appears to be a renewed interest in infrastructure projects and under-construction residential and data centers. This could enable bit ownership of capital-intensive development projects with potentially attractive upside returns. In 2024, T-RIZE Group signed a US$300 million deal to tokenize Project Champfleury, a 960-unit residential development in Canada.9 Another India-based investor recently unveiled a US$1 billion fund that integrates tokenized equity and debt for global data center property investments.10\nReal estate financing needs can vary significantly across the project life cycle, depending on requirements for energy efficiency upgrades, technology improvements, and other property enhancements. Tokenization can allow for capital generation across the capital stack including debt, equity, and hybrid funding on a single platform. For instance, New Silver managed bridge loan financing for residential real estate in the United States; it leveraged Centrifuge\u2019s securitization protocol to bundle loans into pools, and MakerDAO provided liquidity.11\nA differentiator for more recent adoption of tokenization can be the growth of tokenized marketplaces and exchanges that provide real-time visibility into asset performance. These include options such as World Property Exchange, Redswan, ABC Tokens, RETokens, Uniswap Exchange, Securitize, and Tokenise, which have launched or are preparing to launch their marketplaces.12\nTokenization can allow for capital generation across the capital stack including debt, equity, and hybrid funding on a single platform.\nAs blockchain technology advances and more real-world assets are tokenized, there is expected to be a coexistence of ledgers on different blockchains, each with their own unique characteristics. For instance, some ledgers may be good for debt issuance; others may be better for distributions or as an exchange platform. Others may have lower transaction fees, which could make them more accessible for retail investors. To establish a cohesive tokenized ecosystem, these chains should be interconnected. This could enable tokens to be exchanged from one ledger to another and end-to-end workflows, from issuance to trading, to be achieved seamlessly while maintaining investors\u2019 privacy and confidentiality and meeting regulatory compliance.\nThe DeFi ecosystem continues to grow with the adoption of layer-2 solutions, cross-chain protocols, and real-world asset integration. Layer-2 solutions refer to infrastructure built on top of an existing layer-1 blockchain that can execute transactions off-chain with improved speed of transaction at lower costs with more affordable participation in blockchain networks.13 The regulatory void around crypto assets and uncertainty around their treatment as financial instruments or securities historically posed a challenge to mass adoption, but this may no longer be the case. In the United States and elsewhere, regulatory frameworks are being established to govern the issuance and operation of digital assets, stablecoins, permissionless blockchains, and distributed ledger technologies.14 These developments suggest a shift toward a more permissive regulatory environment for financial institutions to engage with digital assets in the near future.15\nOverall, real estate asset managers and investors should assess how they might engage and what their risk appetite is for digital assets in their portfolios. When considering tokenizing their assets or investing in tokenized assets, companies should consider the following:\nOur prediction is based on a meta-analysis of several total global real estate market size forecasts over the next decade for key subsegments of the industry. We then applied potential for tokenization penetration rates to each subsegment based on Deloitte\u2019s Center for Financial Services assumptions of potential impact by subsector within commercial real estate.\nThis article contains general information and predictions only and Deloitte is not, by means of this article, rendering accounting, business, financial, investment, legal, tax, or other professional advice or services.

      "text": "We are currently witnessing a digital transformation as traditional finance and investments undergo a seismic shift towards greater efficiency and accessibility.\nLeading the charge, BlackRock\nThis move highlights BlackRock\u2019s commitment to innovation and signals a broader trend that could redefine investment strategies fundamentally: the rise of Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization.\nRWA tokenization converts the rights of diverse assets, from bonds and equity to real estate and cultural assets, into blockchain-based digital tokens. This innovation promises enhanced liquidity, evidence of ownership, and transparency, aimed at democratizing traditionally inaccessible investment avenues.\nIn March 2024, BlackRock announced the launch of its first tokenized fund issued on an Ethereum blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. \"This is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy,\" said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s Head of Digital Assets. \"We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.\" The partnership underscores BlackRock\u2019s strategic focus on technology as a growth lever, consistent with its substantial holdings in tech giants and its $10 trillion asset portfolio.\nReal estate tokenization, with BlackRock managing around $39 billion in assets, promises to redefine property investment. Tokenization, through the use of security and utility tokens, seeks to enhance market liquidity and accessibility, enabling fractional ownership and bringing a new level of fluidity and flexibility to real estate investment.\nSecurity Tokens: Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance\nSecurity tokens represent ownership or an interest in real-world assets and are subject to regulatory oversight. The adoption of security tokens in real estate allows for the buying and selling of tokenized property shares, opening up opportunities for income generation and asset value growth. This approach dramatically enhances market liquidity, facilitating dynamic investment strategies and widening the investor circle.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nUtility Tokens: Enabling Access and Participation\nConversely, utility tokens serve as an ownership representation to the whole asset: this asset token, similar to a single family home, is not a security, so there\u2019s no need to file the offering with the SEC. It's typically called an NFT\nBoth types of tokenization of RWAs require a KYC/AML verification for the wallets participating in assets\u2019 acquisition, to comply with securities and, in this example, real estate related laws.\nA recent discussion I initiated about asset tokenization has sparked considerable interest, reflecting the growing interest and excitement around the potential of asset tokenization. As we stand on the cusp of this significant shift, the implications for investors, companies, and the broader economy are profound. By breaking down barriers to investment and offering new levels of flexibility and accessibility, tokenization has the potential to expand the investment landscape dramatically.\nAs BlackRock and Securitize move forward with their plans, the eyes of the world will be watching closely. The success of their endeavor could pave the way for a new era of investment, where digital and traditional finance converge to create a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent marketplace. The journey towards tokenizing $10 trillion in assets is a bold stride towards leveraging innovation to redefine the financial landscape."

      "text": "The real estate industry is on the brink of a major transformation, driven by technological advancements. One of the most promising innovations is real estate tokenization, which leverages blockchain technology to create digital tokens representing ownership in real estate assets. The introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (\u201cMiCA\u201d) and Luxembourg's adoption of Blockchain Law IV are expected to significantly impact the landscape for real estate tokenization. This article examines the concept of real estate tokenization, its benefits and challenges, and the regulatory framework in Luxembourg that supports its growth.\nWhat is Real Estate Tokenization?\nReal estate tokenization is the process of converting the value of a physical property into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or traded on a blockchain platform. Each token represents a fractional ownership stake in the property, allowing investors to participate in real estate markets without the need for substantial capital. This innovative approach not only enhances accessibility to real estate investments but also improves liquidity and transparency within the market.\nThe Advantages of Real Estate Tokenization\n1. Increased Liquidity: Traditional real estate investments often require significant capital and can be difficult to sell quickly. Tokenization allows investors to buy and sell fractional shares, making it easier to enter and exit investments.\n2. Lower Barriers to Entry: With tokenization, the minimum investment can be as low as $1,000, compared to the tens of thousands typically required for traditional real estate investments. This opens the market to a wider range of investors.\n3. Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent method for recording ownership and transactions. Many industry executives believe that blockchain will greatly enhance transparency in the real estate sector.\n4. Global Access: Tokenized real estate can be accessed by investors around the world, fostering a diverse investor base and enabling cross-border investments. The global real estate market is projected to reach an astounding $280 trillion with assets under management (AUM) totaling $3.7 trillion . Tokenization could unlock a significant portion of this market for international investors.\n5. Efficient Transactions: Tokens enable more cost-effective transactions, increasing efficiency by speeding up the processing of buying and selling properties. The latest survey from EY revealed that 58% of high-net-worth investors view lower transaction costs as a key incentive to invest in tokenized assets.\nChallenges of Real Estate Tokenization\n1. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving, with different jurisdictions imposing varying rules regarding securities. The introduction of MiCA is a pivotal development, providing a unified regulatory framework for crypto-assets in the European Union. According to EY's survey, 72% of institutional investors and 62% of high-net-worth investors see regulatory uncertainty as a significant barrier to adopting tokenization.\n2. Market Adoption: While tokenization is gaining traction, widespread adoption is still in its early stages. Educating investors and industry stakeholders about the benefits and mechanics of tokenization is crucial for its growth.\n3. Technology Risks: Like any technology, blockchain comes with its own set of risks, including potential vulnerabilities and the need for robust cybersecurity measures. Implementing strong security protocols is essential to mitigate these risks.\n4. Valuation and Pricing: Determining the value of tokenized assets can be challenging, especially in volatile markets. Establishing reliable valuation methods is vital for maintaining investor confidence.\nLegal Considerations\nMarkets in Crypto-Assets Regulation\nThe MiCA is a new set of rules from the EU aimed at regulating crypto-assets, effective from June 2023 and fully implemented by December 2024. MiCA seeks to establish a clear legal framework that protects investors and ensures market integrity, which is especially crucial for the safe tokenization of real estate by providing well-defined guidelines for digital assets. Under this regulation, tokenized real estate will be treated like other financial products, necessitating specific licensing and compliance measures to protect investors. MiCA also emphasizes transparency by requiring issuers to disclose detailed information about their assets, while crypto-asset service providers must be authorized and continuously supervised to ensure fair practices. Additionally, it includes rules to prevent market abuse, fosters a fair-trading environment, offers consumer protection against fraud and scams, and encourages collaboration among EU regulators to maintain a consistent regulatory approach across Member States.\nLuxembourg's Legal Framework\nLuxembourg has enacted several blockchain laws to facilitate digital securities and the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT). On 19 December 2024, Luxembourg adopted Blockchain Law IV, a significant legislative action aimed at strengthening the legal framework for blockchain within the financial sector.\nThis legislation authorizes the digital management of equity securities and allows for the tokenization of physical assets, such as real estate. By incorporating DLT into the administration of dematerialized securities, Luxembourg aims to enhance the efficiency of financial markets while ensuring legal certainty for both issuers and investors.\nAs a result, Luxembourg is positioning itself as a model for blockchain integration in financial regulation, striking a balance between innovation and security. Through Blockchain Law IV, the country asserts its pivotal role in the future finance sector, enhancing the competitiveness of its financial industry while promoting investor protection and adherence to European standards.\nInvestor Trends and Preferences\nTokenization has gained significant traction in the financial services industry. Investors indicate they may allocate 7% to 9% of their entire portfolios to tokenized assets by 2027. Recognizing this opportunity, some of the largest financial services companies are investing heavily in the space and bringing new offerings to market.\nThe allocation of tokenized assets in real estate portfolios is expected to grow from 1.3% in 2023 to 6.0% by 2027 and beyond, reflecting increasing confidence in the potential of tokenized real estate investments."
