      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural requirements but lacks evidence‑based citations for the probability figures and for the trade‑line confidence. Add (us_core_cpi)(fed_policy) after the 45 % and 35 % probabilities in the Up/Down lines to tie them to the CPI‑Fed‑rate link. For the 20 % and 25 % probabilities, cite (tariff_policy) and (B1KYJ1GPU)(97MD1FHW8)(Z7O1DCHS7) respectively. In the trade line, append (us_core_cpi)(fed_policy) after the 45 % probability and (KX6AOMQZ5) after the 70 % confidence to reference the confidence estimate. Also add (B1KYJ1GPU)(97MD1FHW8)(Z7O1DCHS7) after “Fed cut in September” (invalidation) and (us_core_cpi) after “CPI < 2.5% on Aug 1” (trigger). Ensure the entry (101.5), stop (101.3), and target (102.0) remain tied to the base‑case projection from XTQIQRP5K. No other content drift is present; keep the four Up/Down lines and the single trade line exactly as formatted.",
