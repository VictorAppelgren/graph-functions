  "description": "Years after the pandemic, chronic absenteeism persists in K-12 education.",
  "content": "Students are flocking back to school\u2014well, most of them. Too many aren\u2019t.\n\nThe Education Department defines \u201cchronic absenteeism\u201d as missing at least 10% of a school year, or about 18 days. It\u2019s associated with poor educational outcomes, both for those who miss classes and for regular attendees whose teachers must spend time helping absentees catch up. When students who miss classes have pre-existing behavioral problems, these issues tend to be worse when they return. In line with common sense, recent research shows that the more days a student misses school, the more negative the effect on his academic performance.\n\nIn the two years before the pandemic, national rates of chronic absenteeism stood at 15%, a level widely regarded as a crisis. Post-pandemic, this rate had nearly doubled, to 28.5% by 2022.\n\nLike many Americans, I made an assumption about school attendance\u2014call it the \u201cfire drill\u201d model. We told students to stay away from school when the pandemic raged, and they did. But I assumed that when we told them to come back, they would.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out that way. After 2022 the rate of chronic absenteeism remained high. As a recent report by Nat Malkus of the American Enterprise Institute shows, the rate came down by about 3 percentage points in 2023, and by even less\u2014a mere 2 points\u2014in 2024. Absenteeism in 2024 hit 23.5%, a startling 57% higher than it stood shortly before the pandemic.\n\nWith few exceptions, chronic absenteeism rose at similar rates in most states and school districts. When Mr. Malkus compared low- and high-achievement schools, as well as schools of different sizes and locations, he found that the increase as a share of the pre-pandemic baseline has been similar.\n\nThe same is true for race and ethnicity. Between 2020 and 2022, chronic absenteeism more than doubled for white, black and Hispanic students. Since the peak, it has declined at similar rates across races and ethnicities. By 2024, nearly 95% of all students attended school in districts where absenteeism still exceeded its 2019 level.\n\nWhy has chronic absenteeism remained so high? Researchers aren\u2019t sure, but reasonable hypotheses have emerged. The pandemic was a shock to society, and many underestimate its continued effects. It disrupted long-established patterns of behavior, including the habit of getting up and going to school every weekday.\n\nThe proliferation of online classroom materials has led many students and parents to view physical presence in school as optional. Years of remote learning had an unanticipated effect: Classrooms became more visible to parents, and many didn\u2019t like what they saw. Some observers argue that this weakened the bond of trust between parents and schools.\n\nMoreover, during the pandemic, children and adolescents were physically isolated from one another, connected only by their cellphones. This had negative effects on their mental health. Many students experienced high levels of stress when they were finally reunited with one another in school, diminishing their incentive to attend. Social life rests on skills, many habitual and invisible, that withered from disuse during the pandemic. They aren\u2019t easy to rebuild.\n\nWhile the causes of chronic absenteeism aren\u2019t all certain, one thing is clear: This is a national problem. The U.S. will pay a high price until it gets it under control.\n\nMr. Malkus is looking for solutions. He has joined forces with two leading education organizations, Attendance Works and the Education Trust, to promote the goal of reducing chronic absenteeism by 50% over the next five years. As of June, 15 states and the District of Columbia have endorsed this goal. Every state should do so.\n\nA recent Attendance Works report highlights an encouraging trend: Most states now use data to assess progress on chronic absenteeism and enhance accountability. They\u2019re collecting data more frequently in ways that facilitate better policy. In Georgia, for instance, school districts with rates above 10% and schools with rates above 15% are required to convene teams and create plans for corrective action.\n\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go. Mr. Malkus found that, in 2024, 43% of students attended schools in districts that weren\u2019t on track to reduce chronic absenteeism by 50% between by 2027.\n\nThe longer chronic absenteeism persists, the more students will experience poor academic outcomes, reducing their economic prospects and diminishing the quality of their personal and social lives. It will take engaged parents, civil-society organizations, government officials and school leaders working together to fill empty seats at schools.",

      "text": "Lingering Absence in Public Schools: Tracking Post-Pandemic Chronic Absenteeism into 2024\nJune 12, 2025\nDownload PDFLingering Absence in Public Schools: Tracking Post-Pandemic Chronic Absenteeism into 2024\nKey Points\n- Chronic absenteeism spiked during the pandemic and remains a serious problem. In 2024, rates were 57 percent higher than they were pre-pandemic and only 2 percentage points lower than they were in 2023.\n- Disadvantaged districts\u2019 absenteeism rates were higher, and increases were larger, over the pandemic. However, in proportional terms, districts of all types\u2014high- and low-achieving, affluent and poor\u2014experienced a nearly 90 percent increase in chronic absenteeism rates in 2022 and have had similarly modest declines since.\n- Chronic absenteeism rates are not falling fast enough. Only about one-third of students are in districts on pace to cut 2022 absenteeism in half by 2027, a target 15 states have officially adopted.\n- Chronic absenteeism rates improved more slowly in 2024 than they did in 2023, raising the very real possibility that absenteeism rates might never return to pre-pandemic levels.\nIntroduction\nIt has been over five years since the US shut down for COVID, and in many ways, the country has moved past the pandemic. For US schools, however, the pandemic\u2019s toll has not passed so quickly. Student academic achievement remains depressed, and chronic absenteeism continues to hover substantially above the pre-pandemic baseline.\nMeasured as the percentage of students who miss 10 percent or more of a school year, chronic absenteeism was a serious concern even before the pandemic. In 2018 and 2019, about 15 percent of K\u201312 public school students in the US were chronically absent\u2014a number so high that numerous observers and the US Department of Education labeled it a \u201ccrisis.\u201d1\nThen the pandemic struck and took this crisis to unprecedented levels. In January 2024, I issued a report, Long COVID for Public Schools: Chronic Absenteeism Before and After the Pandemic, which documented these post-pandemic changes in absenteeism.2 I found that during the 2022 school year, 28.5 percent of students were chronically absent, an increase of about 90 percent (or more than 13 percentage points) over pre-pandemic rates. (In this report, I refer to school years by the spring year\u2014for example, \u201cthe 2017 school year\u201d\u2014instead of \u201cthe 2016\u201317 school year.\u201d) The data then available showed that by the 2023 school year\u2014the first fully post-pandemic school year\u2014that rate had fallen, but only to 26 percent. Now, more complete data for the 2023 school year show that rate was 25.4 percent, with the difference due mostly to rounding.\nWith data from 44 states and Washington, DC, through the 2024 school year, I show in this report that in 2024, the chronic absenteeism rate fell almost 2 percentage points, to 23.5 percent. This 2024 decline still fits well with the description I gave over one year ago, when I argued that \u201crates are falling, but not nearly fast enough.\u201d3\nIn this report, I use more complete data from 2023 and new data from 2024 to update my findings in Long COVID for Public Schools and describe how the chronic absenteeism trends identified in that report, and others, continue to develop.4 As before, the data show widespread pandemic increases in chronic absenteeism that were larger in more-disadvantaged districts and districts that had higher rates of chronic absenteeism before the pandemic. In many of these districts, chronic absenteeism rates remain alarmingly high.\nAdditionally, the data in this report continue to show that despite tremendous variation in chronic absenteeism rates before and after the pandemic, the relative increases in absenteeism during the pandemic were\u2014and remain\u2014conspicuously even across groups.\nAll told, the data continue to demonstrate that chronic absenteeism rates remain substantially elevated and that hopes of post-pandemic academic recovery still require getting students to attend school more consistently.\nThis report draws on data from the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Return to Learn Tracker (R2L), which I created at the beginning of the pandemic to collect weekly data on the remote-learning status of 8,600 school districts that collectively educated 89 percent of public school students. Five years after the pandemic began\u2014and three years after nearly every school in the US returned to in-person instruction\u2014chronic absenteeism rates continue to suggest that the \u201cReturn to Learn\u201d name remains apt: Too many students do not attend school consistently.\nThis report consists of six sections. I begin with a basic overview of research on chronic absenteeism. Then, I report chronic absenteeism rates throughout the pandemic, overall and by state. In the third and fourth sections, I examine changes in absenteeism by district characteristics and student race. In the fifth section, I gauge states\u2019 progress since 2022 against two benchmarks. And in the final section, I discuss these results and why they warrant urgent and sustained attention. Further information on the data and methods I use in this report and additional tables are in the appendixes.\nChronic Absenteeism Before the Pandemic\nThe vast majority of states began collecting and reporting chronic absenteeism data following 2015, after the Every Students Succeeds Act (ESSA) went into effect, as a required \u201cnontraditional measure of student progress.\u201d5 Before ESSA, states typically collected only average daily attendance, a measure that often fails to account for severe absenteeism. As Robert Balfanz and Vaughan Byrnes illustrated, \u201cit is possible for a school to have 90 percent average daily attendance and still have as many as 40 percent of its students chronically absent because on different days different students are in school.\u201d6\nWell before the pandemic, and even before states routinely collected data on it, chronic absenteeism rates were a problem. One 2012 study estimated that each year, between 5 million and 7.5 million of the roughly 50 million US students in pre-K\u201312 schools were chronically absent.7 Research has consistently shown that chronic absenteeism rates are higher for low-income students; black, Hispanic, and Native American students; and students with special education designations.8\nUnsurprisingly, chronic absenteeism is associated with poor outcomes for students, including lower standardized test scores.9 Emma Garc\u00eda and Elaine Weiss found that eighth graders who missed three or more days of school in the month before the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress scored between 0.3 and 0.6 standard deviations lower than those with no absences during that period.10 These effects tend to add up over time: Chronic absenteeism is strongly predictive of course failure and high school non-completion.11 It is also negatively associated with social and emotional outcomes, perhaps particularly in middle school.12\nChronic absenteeism does not just affect the students who miss school. Indeed, there is evidence that when students are chronically absent, their non\u2013chronically absent peers suffer as well.13 Michael A. Gottfried found that chronically absent students may negatively affect their peers\u2019 achievements in reading and math.14 Gottfried also suggested that chronically absent students are more likely to have academic and behavioral problems when they return to school, forcing teachers to spend more time addressing their needs at the expense of other students\u2019 needs. Several studies have also noted that students who were chronically absent in earlier grades were more likely to continue to be chronically absent in later grades.15\nWhile chronic absenteeism is this report\u2019s focus, its associated negative effects apply to absences at every level\u2014in other words, every day of absence matters for students\u2019 academic progress. Multiple studies and forthcoming research show how lower academic achievement is consistently linked to absences at every level, indicating that while chronic absenteeism is a significant problem, every day of absence affects students\u2019 academic progress.16\nReducing absenteeism, then, is an important goal for schools\u2014both for chronically absent and non\u2013chronically absent students. Luckily, several school-based interventions have been shown to reduce absenteeism. Low-cost approaches, such as targeted communication with families, tend to yield relatively modest reductions in absenteeism.17 Meanwhile, more aggressive strategies, including expanded transportation services and sustained mentoring supports, produce larger gains at a higher expense.18 Given the scope of the chronic absenteeism problem, it\u2019s likely that broad, systemic efforts\u2014not merely isolated student- or school-level programs\u2014are needed to substantially reduce chronic absenteeism levels.\nChronic Absenteeism Nationally and by State\nChronic absenteeism was a serious issue before the pandemic, with about 15 percent of students chronically absent in 2018 and 2019, both years with ample data coverage. Given school closures, remote instruction, and questionable reporting, I treat data from the two subsequent years, 2020 and 2021, as unreliable. Accordingly, I treat 2022 as the first year since the beginning of the pandemic with reliable data. That year, chronic absenteeism peaked at 28.5 percent nationwide. The following year, the chronic absenteeism rate fell by just over 3 percentage points to 25.4 percent, with 46 states reporting data. And in 2024, the chronic absenteeism rate declined another 1.9 percentage points to 23.5 percent, with 44 states reporting data (Figure 1).19\nThis pattern of declines can be seen as a glass half full or a glass half empty. The 3 percentage-point decline from 2022 to 2023 was substantive progress. However, this change occurred between 2022\u2014a year when COVID case rates peaked during the Omicron surge\u2014and 2023, when COVID had receded dramatically. In that light, a 3 percentage-point decline could be considered disappointing. Similarly, the almost 2 percentage-point decline from 2023 to 2024 was a smaller step in the right direction.20 This slowing pace of improvement calls into question whether chronic absenteeism rates will return to their pre-pandemic baseline in the near future.\nChronic absenteeism shows similar patterns but different absolute measures across states (Figure 2). While the large differences among states, both pre- and post-pandemic, make it tempting to compare them to one another, such comparisons should be made with considerable caution. Chronic absenteeism is a fairly consistent metric across states, but it is built from counts of absences, which are not consistently measured from one state or district to the next. In one district, an absence might mean missing a whole day, but in another, missing part of a day may be sufficient to count as an absence. Likewise, some districts count absences by the day and others by the half day. Such measurement differences can yield different rates for the same attendance behavior.\nStates also differ in whom they include in their absenteeism counts. Some states\u2019 chronic absenteeism data include all students enrolled for at least 10 days, while others include only students enrolled for at least 100. Since mobile students often have higher rates of chronic absenteeism, this means states that more credibly record absences can appear to have higher rates because they have stricter metrics.\nFor these reasons, comparisons across states should be treated with significant caution. For example, Alaska and Alabama, which had 2024 chronic absenteeism rates that differed by 26 points, likely have meaningfully different chronic absenteeism rates. Alabama and Tennessee might not, despite a difference of 3 percentage points.21\nIn my view, what is more important for understanding the current state of absenteeism is change in states over time, and along these lines, states are quite similar. Nonetheless, examining differences across states and identifying common patterns over time is informative.\nIn 2019, Alaska had the highest rate of chronic absenteeism among the states, at 28 percent, and all states with state-supplied data were above 10 percent.22 Nationwide, the average chronic absenteeism rate was 15 percent; the middle 50 percent of students attended districts with rates between 9.5 and 18.8 percent, and the middle 80 percent of students attended districts with chronic absenteeism rates between 6.6 and 25.2 percent.23\nBy 2022, the national average chronic absenteeism rate jumped above 28 percent, an increase of 88 percent from 2019. To put this increase in perspective, this national average exceeded Alaska\u2019s average from 2019, when it was the state with the highest chronic absenteeism rate. In 2022, Arizona and Washington, DC, each at 48 percent, had the highest rates of chronic absenteeism, followed closely by Alaska at 46 percent. Alabama and New Jersey, each at 18 percent, had the lowest reported rates (Table B2). Despite such wide differences in states\u2019 rates, the patterns of change were similar. Every state\u2019s rate was higher in 2022 than its pre-pandemic baseline, and 46 states had increases of at least 50 percent above their 2019 rates.\nThe range of chronic absenteeism rates across districts also grew by 2022, when the middle 50 percent of students attended school in districts with chronic absenteeism rates between 19.5 and 36.7 percent. This range is remarkable not only because the 25th percentile in 2022 was well above the average chronic absenteeism rate in 2019 but also because the 2022 interquartile range, at 17 points, is larger than the 2019 mean. Similarly, by 2022, the range between the 10th and 90th percentiles had grown considerably, with districts in the 10th percentile experiencing chronic absenteeism rates of 13.7 percent\u2014slightly lower than the 2019 mean\u2014 and districts in the 90th percentile experiencing chronic absenteeism rates of 43.7 percent.\nIn 2023, rates declined in 45 of 51 states (including Washington, DC), but not by much. Only 22 of 51 states saw their 2022 rates decline by at least a tenth. Five states (Arizona, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Michigan) saw declines of more than 5 percentage points, and another six had declines of 5 points. In addition to the six states where absenteeism grew in 2023, 10 states saw declines of less than 2 points. In short, in 2023, rates mostly declined, but in most states they did not decline sharply.\nBy 2024, the average chronic absenteeism rate fell to 23.5 percent. Half of students attended school in districts with rates between 15.8 percent (still above the pre-pandemic national average) and 30.3 percent.24 Six of the 45 states reporting data actually saw increases in chronic absenteeism in 2024 relative to 2023, and four had record highs. Just one state saw a decline of more than 5 percentage points (New Mexico), and two had declines of 5 points. Beyond the six states where rates increased in 2024, 22 states saw declines of less than 2 points. Like in the prior year, rates mostly declined in 2024, but these declines were even more modest.\nPost-pandemic chronic absenteeism rates are hard to put in perspective, but Table 1 helps contextualize them by indicating where each state\u2019s post-pandemic average would rank in its own 2019 distribution of chronic absenteeism rates. In other words, for each state, the table reports the percentile position of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 state averages when measured against that state\u2019s 2019 chronic-absenteeism percentiles.\nConsider Alaska. If a district\u2019s 2019 rate had matched Alaska\u2019s 2022 state average, it would have landed in the 94th percentile of Alaska\u2019s districts in 2019, and if a district\u2019s 2019 rate had matched Alaska\u2019s 2024 state average, it would have landed in the 91st percentile of Alaska\u2019s districts in 2019.\nNationally, the US average mapped to the 95th percentile in 2022 and to the 91st and 86th percentiles in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Put simply, a 2019 district with a 23.5 percent absenteeism rate\u2014the 2024 national average\u2014would have outranked 85 percent of districts that year.\nPercentile patterns are fairly similar across states relative to their pre-pandemic baselines. In Massachusetts, the 2022 state average exceeded the rate of 98 percent of districts (weighted by enrollment) in 2019, then slid to the 85th percentile in 2023 and the 81st percentile in 2024. Given that states\u2019 averages would cluster around the 50th percentile in 2019, all these shifts represent striking increases.\nIn 2022, of the 41 states in Table 1, 31 had average chronic absenteeism rates above their own 90th percentile rates from 2019, seven states were between the 80th and 90th percentiles from 2019, and just three were below the 80th percentile. Most states improved in 2023 and 2024. However, in 2024, no state was below its own 2019 72nd percentile. Twenty-two states remained at or above their 2019 90th percentile rates, 12 states remained between their 2019 80th and 90th percentile rates, and just seven fell below their 2019 80th percentile rates.\nWhat Kinds of Districts Struggle the Most?\nWith district-level data from across the country, I next examine what district characteristics are associated with higher chronic absenteeism rates. The broad picture is stark: In 2024, 94.7 percent of US students attended a district with an absenteeism rate exceeding its 2019 level. Districts that already had high absenteeism before the pandemic recorded the largest jumps in 2022, and, despite some improvement, still posted the highest rates in 2024.\nFor every characteristic I examine\u2014prior achievement, poverty, urbanicity, and several others\u2014I group districts into student-weighted terciles so each category contains roughly one-third of the nation\u2019s enrollment. When I refer to \u201chigh-poverty\u201d or \u201clow-achievement\u201d districts, therefore, I am speaking of a large share of students, not just those at the extremes. (See Figure 3.)\nFirst, I examine the relationship between a district\u2019s pre-pandemic student achievement and its chronic absenteeism rates over time. In the bottom-achieving tercile, chronic absenteeism rates climbed from 19 percent in 2018 to 35 percent in 2022, a 16-point jump. Middle-achieving districts rose from 16 percent to 29 percent, and the highest-achieving tercile went from 10 percent to 19 percent\u2014increases of 13 and 9 points, respectively. Between 2022 and 2024, absenteeism declined everywhere, but the lowest-achieving districts registered the largest drop\u20146 points, compared with 4 and 3 points in the middle and top terciles. Despite such an impressive decrease, the lowest-achieving tercile still ended 2024 with the highest rates of chronic absenteeism.\nAlthough these absolute changes vary, the relative changes are surprisingly similar. By 2022, absenteeism in low-, middle-, and high-achieving districts stood roughly 80 percent to 93 percent above their 2019 baselines. (See Table B4.) By 2024, those figures had fallen but were even closer proportionally, at 52 percent to 60 percent above pre-pandemic levels. The same proportional pattern appears when districts are grouped by poverty, minority-student percentage, duration of 2021 remote instruction, single-parent percentage, district size, and urbanicity. Districts that entered the pandemic with higher absenteeism rates saw the steepest increases through 2022 and somewhat sharper declines thereafter, yet their percentage movements relative to the baseline track closely across categories.\nTogether, these comparisons bear out the sobering conclusions I first highlighted in Long COVID for Public Schools. Chronic absenteeism has risen severely and almost universally: No district type saw an increase of less than 70 percent relative to its 2019 baseline. At the same time, however, chronic absenteeism has risen most, in absolute terms, among disadvantaged students\u2014the very groups that suffered the greatest learning losses during the pandemic and can least afford the additional harms of chronic absenteeism. Although the subsequent declines are somewhat larger in the districts that experienced the biggest spikes, those declines are proportional to pre-pandemic levels, meaning that gaps between district types remain substantial.\nChronic Absenteeism by Race\nSo far, I have examined how chronic absenteeism has differed by district characteristics. In this section, I examine how chronic absenteeism has differed by student race. The US Department of Education\u2019s EDFacts data provide chronic absenteeism counts for each school, overall and by student race, for the 2020 through 2023 school years. I aggregated these numbers to estimate chronic absenteeism rates for Asian, black, Hispanic, and white students using counts from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD) files. Note that these data, displayed in Table 2, should be interpreted with caution, but they remain the best available national data for comparisons by student race.25\nThe changes in chronic absenteeism rates by race resemble the patterns in chronic absenteeism rates by district type: Racial groups with higher pre-pandemic rates also had higher absolute increases. In 2020, 19 percent of black students\u2014the highest rate of any racial demographic that year\u2014were chronically absent. By 2022, that number had jumped to 39 percent, a 20-point increase.\nChronic absenteeism among Hispanic students also rose 20 points, from 16 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in 2022. White students\u2019 absenteeism rates stood at 11 percent in 2020 before climbing to 24 percent in 2022, a 12.5-point increase. Chronic absenteeism rates for Asian students increased by 8 points, from a pre-pandemic low of 7 percent in 2020 to 15 percent in 2022. Interestingly, Asian students\u2019 chronic absenteeism rates did not decrease at all from 2022 to 2023, while white, black, and Hispanic students\u2019 rates fell by 2.1, 3.3, and 3.4 points, respectively.\nIn short, chronic absenteeism increased dramatically for all students between 2020 and 2022 and declined slightly in 2023. But the demographics with the highest 2020 levels experienced the largest absolute gains in chronic absenteeism by 2022 and larger declines a year later, reflecting similar patterns in disadvantaged school districts.\nPost-Pandemic Progress on Absenteeism\nI have argued that post-pandemic absenteeism is the most urgent challenge facing US schools. Reducing it to acceptable levels will require a sustained, coordinated push by governors, state and local education leaders, teachers, and parents. Clear goals and regular monitoring are essential to that effort. Over the past year, I have partnered with Attendance Works and the Education Trust, two leading education advocacy and research organizations, to persuade states and districts to adopt a concrete target: Cut chronic absenteeism rates in half within five years. To date, 15 states\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia\u2014and Washington, DC, have formally embraced this benchmark, and more are expected to follow.26\nThe target of 50 percent in five years rests on three simple ideas. First, even the pre-pandemic chronic-absence rate\u2014about 15 percent of students\u2014was unacceptably high. Second, every state experienced a broadly similar surge of roughly 90 percent by 2022. Third, if states do not bring rates down quickly, higher levels could become normalized for schools and families, locking in an unacceptable post-pandemic plateau. The five-year time span, which ends in 2027, is intended to promote urgency and focus over time.\nIn Table 3, I track each state\u2019s progress toward the five-year goal, identifying the percentages of students in 2023 and 2024 who are on track to reach that goal by 2027. I also track progress toward each state\u2019s 2019 baseline because, while I view those rates as a timid benchmark for success, they provide a more immediate measure of post-pandemic recovery.\nThe 50 percent target for 2027 remains daunting. Across all districts with 2024 data, 43 percent of students attended schools in districts that were not on track\u2014that is, not on pace to meet the goal by 2027\u2014in either 2023 or 2024 to cut chronic absenteeism rates by 50 percent by 2027. (Table 3). Among the 45 states reporting 2024 figures, 15 had more students on track in 2024 than were on track in 2023 only or than were off track in both years. California led the pack, with 79 percent of its students in on-track districts in 2024. Ten other states\u2014Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Virginia\u2014had a majority of students in districts on pace to cut absenteeism by half within five years.27\nDistricts fare somewhat better against the softer benchmark of merely returning to their own pre-pandemic levels by 2027. (This benchmark is easier to reach in some, but not all, states, as some had 2022 rates that were more than double their pre-pandemic baseline.) Based on this benchmark, 39 percent of students were in on-track districts in 2024, and 38 percent were in districts that were not on track in either 2023 or 2024. Of the 45 states with 2024 data, 22 had more students in 2024 on track to match their 2019 baseline than were in either of the other two categories. Now, 17 states have a majority of students in districts projected to reach their 2019 absenteeism rates within the five-year window. (See Table 4.)\nDiscussion\nThe newest attendance data confirm that chronic absenteeism remains a problem\u2014one I continue to argue is the most urgent challenge confronting US schools. Declines since the 2022 peak have been modest, and the pace of improvement appears to be slowing. What would have counted as progress before the pandemic now looks meager next to the massive spike in chronic absenteeism during and since the pandemic.\nThe basic pattern I documented last year in Long COVID for Public Schools still holds. Chronic absenteeism remains high for nearly all students: Across all student subgroups and over the two post-pandemic years, absenteeism has been retreating at strikingly similar rates, just as it rose at similar rates during the peak year of 2022. Still, the students with the highest chronic absenteeism rates before the pandemic continue to miss the most school.\nThis report focuses on chronic absenteeism, but chronic absenteeism is merely the most visible edge of a broader problem: Students at every attendance level are missing more school than they did before the pandemic. Even those who remain below the \u201cchronic\u201d threshold are accruing more absences, and every missed day chips away at student learning. The root problem schools are facing is a nationwide rise in absenteeism that affects far more than those counted as chronically absent.\nBeyond absenteeism\u2019s toll on students are the burdens it creates for teachers and administrators. Teachers face more demands to reteach content and differentiate instruction for students who are frequently absent. School and district leaders must divert more of their scarce resources to reengage students. Focusing on curbing absenteeism is surely not what teachers and leaders want to be doing\u2014nor is it the best use of their time.\nState and local governments should see that absenteeism functions as a tax. Public schools are among the largest line items in state and local government budgets. Absenteeism erodes schools\u2019 effectiveness, meaning governments are seeing worse outcomes from public schools, at similar rates of spending, than they were before the rise in absences. So long as elevated absenteeism persists, governments can either spend the same amount to receive less educational output or spend more to get back to the same (pre-pandemic) level of output. Either way, absenteeism is a cost that should be a compelling concern, over and above valid concerns for schools and students.\nI end with a profound question: After the pandemic, what will become the new normal for school attendance? Before the pandemic, a stable 15 percent of students were chronically absent; in 2022, the figure spiked to 28 percent. A year later, chronic absenteeism dropped to 25 percent. That 3-point drop offered hope that rates could fall quickly enough to meet both goals discussed above: to return to pre-pandemic levels and cut absenteeism\u2019s 2022 highs in half by 2027.\nBut in 2024, the decline slowed to just under 2 points\u2014even as many states rolled out stronger attendance initiatives. If this slower improvement rate holds steady, the pre-pandemic average will not be reached until 2029. Should the pace keep decelerating at the same rate it did between 2023 and 2024, the country could stall at over 20 percent around 2030\u2014with no guarantee of further improvements.\nOf course, predicting the exact trajectory matters less than accelerating it. Governors, district and school leaders, teachers, families, and students must act decisively to reverse the pandemic\u2019s lingering absence problem. If we fail in that effort, a crisis triggered in 2020 could define schooling for years to come.\nAbout the Author\nNat Malkus is a senior fellow, the deputy director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, and an affiliate of AEI\u2019s James Q.

Return to Learn Chronic Absenteeism Data and Methods\nState-sourced data serve as the primary data in R2L\u2019s chronic absenteeism tracker. I collected district-level chronic absenteeism data from each state, as available, for the 2017 through 2024 school years. To obtain chronic absenteeism rates, I collected the numerators (the number of students who were chronically absent) and denominators (the total number of students eligible for inclusion in chronic absenteeism counts for each district) and then divided them.28\nAll percentages in this report are drawn from district-level data and weighted by the percentage of students. Some percentages may differ slightly from state-reported totals because this report aggregates data across districts, I exclude districts that are identified as virtual or largely virtual, or missing data are supplemented from EDFacts data, as discussed below.\nSome states posted chronic absenteeism data only in select years. Currently, R2L includes state-sourced data for 23 states in 2017, 40 (including Washington, DC) in 2018, and 46 in 2019. Thirty-five states provided data for 2020, and 46 states did so for 2021. However, in both these years, due to the school closures in March 2020 that endured throughout that year and the remote instruction that varied considerably through the 2021 school year, attendance itself and traditional attendance-collection data systems were compromised enough to make questionable the quality and comparability of chronic absenteeism rates.\nFor 2022 and 2023, R2L has state-sourced district-level data for 47 states; for 2024, it reports data for 45 states. (Minnesota and Texas are the only states that regularly report chronic absenteeism but have not yet released 2024 data.) Data for additional states are added to the R2L chronic absenteeism collection as they become available. For the most up-to-date data, visit www.ReturntoLearnTracker. net/ChronicAbsenteeism.\nI supplement missing state-sourced data with chronic absenteeism counts from the US Department of Education\u2019s EDFacts data collection, which is available through its ED Data Express platform. These data include counts of chronically absent students at the local education agency (LEA) level for 2018 and 2019 and at the school and LEA level by student race for 2020\u201323. The EDFacts data provide the best available numerators for calculating chronic absenteeism rates, but unfortunately, they do not include matching denominators. After consulting with NCES staff, I merged the EDFacts data with NCES CCD K\u201312 student membership counts to obtain the denominators.\nAs noted in Long COVID for Public Schools, these CCD denominators are imperfect matches to the EDFacts numerators. At the direction of NCES, the EDFacts chronic absenteeism counts include the number of all students enrolled in a site for at least 10 days who were absent for any reason for 10 percent or more of their enrollment. In contrast, many states use denominators for their chronic absenteeism rates that include only students who were enrolled for a longer period, such as a semester or 100 days in the school year. In addition, the CCD enrollment counts do not include all students who were enrolled for 10 days or more, and thus the EDFacts counts for chronically absent students are drawn from a different, and larger, pool of students than are included in CCD enrollment counts.\nIf all students at a site were enrolled for the entire year, the two denominators would produce identical rates. However, schools and districts with more mobile students will have more students who could be in the EDFacts chronic absence counts than would be in the CCD enrollment, thereby overestimating chronic absenteeism.29 Consequently, the resulting rates lead to a potential upward bias in the EDFacts rates and, though relatively small, that bias is likely to be higher in schools with higher intra-year student mobility.\nAs such, I use estimates based on EDFacts data from ED Data Express for 2018\u201323 for districts where no state-sourced data are available. The portion of R2L data taken from ED Data Express, rather than state-sourced data, is shown in Table B1 and represents only a small share of districts in 2019, 2021, and 2022 and relatively larger shares in 2018 and 2020. In most years, over 95 percent of students were represented by state-sourced data; the remaining 5 percent of students primarily attended schools in states that do not report chronic absenteeism (Montana, New Hampshire, and Wyoming).\nI use several other data sources to compare rates of chronic absenteeism across districts. LEA location data come from CCD\u2019s Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) data files. Urbanicity, school district size, and minority percentage figures also come from CCD data. Poverty estimates for districts use Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates data from 2022.\nData on the duration of in-person instruction in the 2021 school year for about 8,500 districts come from R2L. Data on historic achievement come from the Stanford Education Data Archive\u2019s data for 2019 and thus reflect pre-pandemic achievement levels used to compare similar districts over time. Data on prevalence of single-parent households come from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey 2020 county-level estimates, which I then cross-walked to districts using EDGE data files.\nAll estimates in this report are student-weighted and represent the percentage of students attending districts with a given rate of chronic absenteeism. Unweighted estimates would treat differently sized districts with equal weight, giving a district with 200 students the same weight as a district with 200,000 students. Therefore, percentages reflect the percentage of students attending districts with a given average rate of chronic absenteeism rather than the average of district rates.\nAppendix B.
