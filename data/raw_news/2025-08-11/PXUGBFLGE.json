  "content": "You know, sometimes I think the people writing the textbooks live on a different planet. They write these beautiful, logical guides for handling a knocked-out tooth [2] [6]. Perfect little decision trees.\n\nThe phone rings, it\u2019s a parent screaming, and a seven-year-old\u2019s front tooth is lying in the dirt.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get. An avulsed tooth isn\u2019t like a broken arm. You can\u2019t just set it and wait. It\u2019s a fire. The moment that tooth is out of the socket, the house is burning. The \u201chouse\u201d is the collection of living cells stuck to the root\u2014the periodontal ligament. Those cells are what let the tooth live and breathe in the jaw. And when they\u2019re exposed to air, they start dying. Fast.\n\nWe have maybe an hour. Tops [2]. After that, the house is pretty much a pile of ash.\n\nSo when a parent tells a denist they wrapped the tooth carefully in a tissue to keep it \u201cclean\u201d they often wince. That\u2019s not cleaning it; it\u2019s fanning the flames. A dry paper towel sucks the life right out of those cells. A 2021 study basically proved what we see all the time: dry time is the enemy [7]. It leads to ankylosis.\n\nAnkylosis is when the tooth fuses to the bone. It\u2019s the dental equivalent of paving over what used to be your front lawn. The tooth is stuck. It won\u2019t move. In a kid, it\u2019ll look shorter and shorter as the rest of their face grows around it. It\u2019s a dead end.\n\nThe solution is so, so simple. It\u2019s a fire extinguisher that everyone has.\n\nThat\u2019s it. If you can\u2019t stick the tooth right back in the socket, drop it in a cup of milk. It keeps the cells alive. It buys us time. It\u2019s the single most important thing a person can do in that moment of panic.\n\nAnd nobody knows this.\n\nParents don\u2019t know it [5]. Coaches don\u2019t know it. Here\u2019s the kicker\u2014a study from just this year showed that a bunch of new dental school grads were fuzzy on the details [3]. Freshly minted dentists! If they\u2019re not sure, how can we expect a panicked mom on a playground to be?\n\nIt drives dentists crazy. We spend all this time in our own world, debating the finer points of splinting techniques or whether one antibiotic is better than another [1] [8] [9]. We\u2019ve got all these high-tech fire trucks ready to go. But we\u2019re failing to teach people the one thing that matters: don\u2019t let the house burn down in the first place.\n\nHandling the tooth by the root? That\u2019s like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. Just don\u2019t do it.\n\nLet\u2019s say they get it right. Tooth goes in milk. They get to the office fast. We get it splinted in. Great.\n\nNow the real work starts. Babysitting this tooth for the rest of its life.\n\nThis tooth is now a high-maintenance problem child. We have to watch it constantly for infection, for resorption\u2014that\u2019s when the body just starts eating the root for lunch. It takes a ton of work to keep one of these teeth going for the long haul [4].\n\nAnd the cost... oh, the cost. A study from 2023 put a number on it: an average of almost ten visits and over $1,600 in just the first two years for a kid [10]. And that\u2019s the best-case scenario. That doesn\u2019t count the root canal it will almost definitely need. It doesn\u2019t count the crown. And it certainly doesn\u2019t count the thousands for an implant when the tooth finally fails 15 years later.\n\nSo forget the fancy guidelines for a second. The real job isn\u2019t in the dental chair. It\u2019s getting the message out there.\n\nIf you see it happen, just remember this:\n\u2022 Stick it back in the hole.\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t, put it in milk.\n\u2022 Get to a dentist. Now.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s how you save the tooth. Everything else is just damage control.\n\n[1] Kostka, E., Meissner, S., Finke, C. H., Mandirola, M., & Preissner, S. (2014).

      "text": "Root Canals Demystified: What Research Reveals About Long-Term Success\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Root canals treat infected or damaged pulp tissue to save the tooth.\n- Success relies on patient-specific factors\u2014not just technical skill.\n- Technology like microscopes and 3D imaging improves outcomes.\n- Poor-quality fillings increase the risk of apical periodontitis.\n- Well-done root canals can preserve teeth for 20+ years.\nRoot canals have come a long way from their reputation as painful, last-resort procedures. Thanks to modern advances in technique, technology, and diagnostic precision, root canal therapy (RCT) is now one of the most reliable ways to save a tooth and stop infection in its tracks. But what exactly happens during a root canal, and why does the quality of the treatment matter so much for long-term success?\nThis article unpacks the latest research on root canal treatment\u2014from diagnosis to complications\u2014so patients and providers alike can understand what goes into preserving a tooth from the inside out.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is a Root Canal and When Is It Needed?\n- Anatomy Matters: Pulp, Root & Canal Considerations\n- Technology\u2019s Role in Success\n- What Determines Treatment Success?\n- Apical Periodontitis and Root Canal Quality\n- Do Root Canals Last? Long-Term Evidence\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat Is a Root Canal and When Is It Needed?\nAt its core, root canal therapy treats infection or inflammation in the tooth\u2019s pulp\u2014the soft tissue inside that houses nerves and blood vessels. If left untreated, that infection can spread to the root and surrounding bone, causing pain, swelling, or even abscesses. In these cases, a root canal removes the damaged tissue, disinfects the space, and seals it to prevent reinfection.\nNot every pulp issue calls for the same approach. According to the British Dental Journal [1], clinical decisions vary depending on whether the pulp is still alive (vital) or necrotic (non-vital). Customized care is key here.\nA 2019 study in the International Endodontic Journal [2] found that the top reasons for root canals include persistent pain, signs of infection like swelling or abscesses, and pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis (inflammation at the tip of the root). In short, if a tooth hurts, has been injured, or has deep decay, a root canal might be the best chance to save it.\nAnatomy Matters: Pulp, Root & Canal Considerations\nThink of a tooth like a tree: the crown is the visible part, but its roots anchor it below the gumline. Inside those roots are narrow channels\u2014or canals\u2014that house the pulp. Every tooth can have a different number and shape of canals, which makes precision crucial.\nA 2023 review published in Clinical Oral Investigations [3] emphasized the importance of understanding the tooth\u2019s internal anatomy. Dentists use this knowledge to decide whether a root canal, pulpotomy (partial pulp removal), or revitalization (encouraging regrowth of healthy tissue) is most appropriate.\nMissing a canal or under-cleaning a root can leave bacteria behind, leading to failure later on. That\u2019s why your dentist may take multiple X-rays or use advanced imaging before starting.\nTechnology\u2019s Role in Success\nModern root canal procedures look nothing like they did decades ago. One of the biggest game-changers? The dental operating microscope. A 2017 study in the Journal of Endodontics [4] showed that using a microscope significantly improves the outcome of nonsurgical root canals by allowing better visualization of small or curved canals.\nDigital imaging, 3D cone-beam CT scans, and electronic apex locators (which help find the tip of the root) are also part of the high-tech toolkit.\nBut even with top tools, complications can arise. Instrument separation\u2014when a file breaks inside the canal\u2014is one of the more common issues. A 2025 consensus paper [5] offers guidance on how to avoid this and what to do if it happens. The key takeaway? Prevention through technique and planning is everything.\nWhat Determines Treatment Success?\nGreat technology is important, but outcomes depend on more than tools alone. A 2024 cohort study [6] highlighted how a mix of factors\u2014like the initial health of the pulp, the quality of the filling, and even the patient\u2019s general health\u2014can influence whether the treatment succeeds.\nInterestingly, a 25-year cohort study published in 2023 [10] found that patient- and disease-specific factors (like how far the infection had progressed) were stronger predictors of success than pure technical precision.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean technique doesn\u2019t matter\u2014but it does show that personalized care, not a one-size-fits-all approach, leads to better long-term results.\nApical Periodontitis and Root Canal Quality\nApical periodontitis (AP) is inflammation or infection around the tip of a tooth root, often caused by bacteria lingering in or around a root-filled tooth.\nA 2020 cross-sectional study [7] found that AP was more common in teeth with short root fillings or poor restorations. Inadequate fillings allow bacteria to creep back in, undoing all the effort of a well-executed root canal.\nBacking this up, a meta-analysis published the same year [8] showed that treatment quality\u2014including filling length and sealing ability\u2014was strongly linked to AP risk. Simply put, when it comes to root canals, precision and follow-up matter.\nDo Root Canals Last? Long-Term Evidence\nMany patients worry that a root canal is only a temporary fix. But the data says otherwise.\nA 2018 historical cohort study [9] followed patients for 20 years and found that the majority of properly treated teeth\u2014with good fillings and crowns\u2014stayed functional and infection-free. This suggests that with high-quality care and regular dental checkups, root canal-treated teeth can last as long as natural ones.\nRoutine follow-up, excellent home care, and well-fitted crowns or restorations all play a role in longevity.\nClosing Thoughts\nRoot canal therapy isn\u2019t just a way to relieve pain\u2014it\u2019s a proven, long-term solution to save teeth that might otherwise be lost. The latest research shows that successful outcomes depend on far more than drilling and filling. It\u2019s about using the right technology, understanding each tooth\u2019s anatomy, making patient-specific decisions, and ensuring excellent post-op care.\nIf you\u2019re facing a root canal, don\u2019t think of it as the end of the line. With today\u2019s evidence-based practices and follow-up care, it\u2019s often the beginning of saving a tooth for life.\nReferences\n[1] El-Ma\u2019aita, A. M., Qualtrough, A.

That\u2019s some form of dental plaque\u2014a sticky film and plaque biofilm. But it\u2019s far more than just a bit of fuzz\u2014it\u2019s a city of microbes, a biofilm, that\u2019s the root of most dental problems like cavities and gum disease. Dental plaque is a type of dental biofilm, a community of microorganisms attached to tooth surfaces.\nThe main inhabitants of this biofilm are oral bacteria, which live and compete with each other in this environment. Biofilm formation is a multi-step process of microbial adhesion, co-adhesion and maturation of the microbial community. Over the last decade we\u2019ve learned so much more about how plaque forms, what it\u2019s made of and how it affects your long term oral health.\nThink of your mouth as an ecosystem. The oral cavity is the environment where biofilm forms, where dental biofilms can grow and mature. Depending on the residents and the environment it can thrive in health or descend into disease.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Dental Plaque?\n- Dental Caries: The First Sign of Plaque Buildup\n- Long-Term Effects of Plaque Control\n- Plaque and Periodontal Disease: A Strong Connection\n- Toothbrushing: A Necessary but Nuanced Tool\n- What Isn\u2019t Dental Plaque?\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat Is Dental Plaque?\nAt its heart, dental plaque is a microbial community that sticks to tooth surfaces. This community includes the resident microflora, the naturally occurring bacteria in your mouth and they play a big role in oral health. A 2011 study called it an ecosystem that can contribute to both oral health and disease depending on its makeup and the conditions in your mouth [1].\nBacteria in your mouth produce plaque by metabolizing food particles and food debris left on chewing surfaces and other areas of the teeth. This biofilm isn\u2019t static; it changes constantly based on what you eat, your daily hygiene habits and even your body\u2019s immune response. For example, a diet high in sugar can feed certain types of bacteria, like mutans streptococci and Streptococcus mutans, which are the key bacteria involved in caries development. These bacteria thrive on sugar and contribute to enamel demineralization.\nIn low pH environments created by sugar metabolism, acid tolerant species become dominant, increasing the risk of dental disease. Plaque formation is the microbial colonization of the tooth surface, if not regularly disrupted can lead to oral health problems. This transition from a healthy mouth to a diseased one is marked by big changes in these microbial communities.\nEnvironmental microbiology studies how diet, pH and hygiene influence these microbial communities in the oral cavity. As plaque is left undisturbed it matures, grows and diversifies. According to a 2019 review this maturation process often leads to a more pathogenic, or disease causing, environment. This shift is a big factor in the development of both cavities and periodontal (gum) disease [8]. It\u2019s not like a single invader and more like a neighborhood that gradually becomes more hostile over time.\nDental Caries: The First Sign of Plaque Buildup\nThe most common and earliest consequence of plaque accumulation is dental caries, otherwise known as tooth decay or cavities. When you consume carbohydrates and sugars bacteria in the plaque metabolize them and produce acids as a byproduct. As a 2016 perspective piece explains this acidic environment is the direct cause of enamel demineralization\u2014the process where the hard, protective outer layer of your tooth dissolves [2]. This process can result in developing carious lesions and if left unchecked established carious lesions. Imagine it like repeated exposure to an acidic substance slowly wearing away the paint on a car.\nInterestingly it\u2019s not just about having \u201cbad\u201d bacteria in your mouth. A fascinating 2013 study that sequenced the DNA of plaque microbes found that about half of the bacterial species were common to people both with and without cavities [3]. Oral pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans, are among the bacteria responsible for initiating dental diseases.\nThis suggests that the switch from health to disease is less about the mere presence of specific pathogens and more about the overall balance of the microbial community and other environmental factors. When the microbial balance is disrupted the risk of dental diseases increases. When the balance tips in favor of acid producing bacteria the risk of decay skyrockets. You can learn more about maintaining this balance from the American Dental Association (ADA).\nLong Term Effects of Plaque Control\nSo what happens when you manage plaque for many years? The results are amazing. A 30 year longitudinal study followed adults and found that those who practiced regular and effective plaque control had very low rates of tooth loss, cavities and periodontal disease [4]. Good oral hygiene and good oral health is key to preventing dental problems and long term oral wellness.\nThis study provides high level scientific evidence that simple consistent oral hygiene practices\u2014like brushing and flossing, daily brushing with a soft bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, using dental floss, and regular professional cleanings\u2014can reduce your risk of serious dental problems for your entire lifetime. These practices are designed to remove plaque and remove dental plaque which are key goals in oral hygiene routines.\nPreventive care prevents plaque buildup and keeps your teeth clean reducing the risk of tartar formation and gum disease. For optimal results you need to schedule regular dental cleanings and visit your dentist regularly and see a dental hygienist or dental professional for thorough care.\nIn addition to these practices you can chew sugarless gum or sugar free gum to stimulate saliva and prevent plaque buildup. Choose nutritious foods including healthy foods to support your dental health and strong teeth and gums.\nIt\u2019s a testament to the fact that preventive care isn\u2019t just a short term fix; it\u2019s a long term investment in your dental health.\nPlaque and Periodontal Disease: A Strong Connection\nThe link between plaque and gum disease is direct and well established. It all starts with gingivitis, the earliest stage of periodontal disease. A 2018 study officially defined plaque induced gingivitis as a site specific inflammatory condition offering clear clinical and microbiological markers for diagnosis [6]. This solidifies our understanding that plaque is the primary trigger for the red, swollen and bleeding gums characteristic of gingivitis.\nPlaque buildup can cause inflammation of the gum tissue and along the gum line. The body\u2019s immune system reacts to the bacterial buildup along the gumline causing inflammation. Gums bleed easily and gums swollen are common signs of early gum disease.This is true even for those in long term dental care. A 2021 analysis of patients with a history of periodontitis found a significant correlation between their plaque index (a measure of how much plaque is present) and their gingival index (a measure of gum inflammation) [5]. More plaque meant more inflammation.\nIf plaque is not controlled there is a risk of developing periodontal problems, severe gum disease and even tooth infection. This is why controlling plaque is the foundation of both preventing and managing gum disease.\nToothbrushing: A Necessary but Nuanced Tool\nEveryone knows you need to remove plaque but how you brush is just as important as if you brush. It\u2019s a great tool but improper technique can cause its own set of problems. A 2014 review found toothbrush abrasion (wearing away of tooth structure) and dental erosion when brushing is too aggressive [7]. Too much pressure or a hard-bristled brush can wear away enamel over time especially if your teeth are already softened by acidic foods or drinks.\nBe thorough but gentle. Think of it as cleaning a delicate surface\u2014you want to remove the debris without scratching what\u2019s underneath. When you brush pay special attention to the chewing surfaces of your teeth as these areas are prone to plaque accumulation and need to be cleaned carefully to prevent decay. A balanced and mindful approach to brushing is key to preserving your enamel and controlling plaque.\nWhat Isn\u2019t Dental Plaque?\nIt\u2019s also important to clear up a common point of confusion. The term \u201cplaque\u201d is used in other areas of medicine most notably in cardiovascular disease to describe atherosclerotic plaque\u2014the buildup of fats and cholesterol in arteries. This is completely different from dental plaque.\nTwo studies, one on the mechanisms of plaque rupture in arteries [9] and another on a medication for vascular disease [10] use the same word but are entirely unrelated to your oral health. Knowing this distinction can help you better understand health information and discussions with your healthcare providers. More on the link between oral and systemic health can be explored through resources like this article from PubMed Central.\nClosing Thoughts\nPlaque is at the root of most oral diseases. Left to itself it creates an environment for tooth decay and gum inflammation. But the good news is plaque is a modifiable risk factor. You can manage it. Through consistent and proper toothbrushing, daily flossing and regular professional cleanings you can break up this biofilm and maintain a healthy oral environment. Knowing plaque is living and dynamic helps you understand why these simple habits are key to preventing cavities and periodontal disease for life.\nReferences\n[1] Seneviratne, C. J., Zhang, C.

      "text": "How Often Should You Really Floss? What You Should Know\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Flossing at least three times per week is a realistic and effective goal for many adults who find daily flossing unsustainable.\n- Flossing before brushing is more effective for removing plaque and increasing fluoride retention from your toothpaste.\n- Flossing is proven to reduce plaque and gingivitis when added to a regular toothbrushing routine.\n- Professional flossing can reduce cavities in children by 40%, but the benefits of at-home flossing for kids are less clear.\n- The best interdental cleaner (floss, water flosser, etc.) is the one you will use consistently and correctly.\nOf all the daily habits we\u2019re told to do, flossing is often the first to get skipped. While brushing twice a day feels non-negotiable, fitting in that extra step to clean between your teeth can feel like a chore. But how important is it, really? Do you have to floss every single day to get the benefits?\nRecent research says no. While daily flossing is the gold standard, studies suggest consistency matters more than perfect attendance. Let\u2019s break down what the science says about how often you should floss and why it\u2019s so important for your oral health.\nTable of Contents\n- The Daily Flossing Dilemma: Ideal vs. Reality\n- Does It Matter When You Floss?\n- What About Kids and Special Cases?\n- Flossing Works\u2014Even if You\u2019re Not Perfect\n- Finding What Works for You\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nThe Daily Flossing Dilemma: Ideal vs. Reality\nWe\u2019ve all been there. You get home after a long day, brush your teeth and just can\u2019t bring yourself to floss. You\u2019re not alone. A 2025 randomized controlled trial found what many dentists already knew: most healthy adults don\u2019t floss every day, even when they\u2019re told to. The study found that on average participants only flossed regularly for about 5 out of 24 weeks [1]. Recognizing this, the researchers concluded that aiming for a more realistic goal\u2014like flossing at least 3 times a week\u2014might be a more achievable target for most people.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean daily flossing isn\u2019t valuable. A large 2020 study in the Journal of Dental Research found that people who cleaned between their teeth 7 or more times a week described their oral health as \u201cexcellent\u201d [2]. While this was self-reported, it shows a strong link between frequent interdental cleaning and good health outcomes. The takeaway is clear: more is better, but doing something is way better than doing nothing.\nDoes It Matter When You Floss?\nIt turns out the order of your oral hygiene routine matters. If you typically brush and then floss, you might want to switch it up. A 2018 clinical trial found that flossing before brushing is more effective at reducing the plaque that builds up between your teeth [3]. Why does this happen? Think of it like sweeping a floor before you mop. Flossing first loosens and removes food particles and plaque from those tight spaces between your teeth. When you follow up with brushing, your toothbrush can more effectively sweep away that debris. More importantly, clearing out that plaque allows the fluoride in your toothpaste to reach and strengthen those vulnerable surfaces, giving you more protection against cavities.\nWhat About Kids and Special Cases?\nFlossing is important for all ages, but the evidence around its impact on children can be a bit more complicated. For example, a 2006 systematic review found that when children had their teeth professionally flossed by dental staff, their risk of developing cavities between their teeth dropped by 40% [10]. But the key here is \u201cprofessionally flossed\u201d. The review noted that this benefit wasn\u2019t seen when kids flossed on their own at home, likely due to technique and consistency issues. Another review from 2017 found limited evidence that at-home flossing prevents cavities in primary (baby) teeth, and more research is needed in this area [6].\nThe story is different for people with dental implants. Keeping the area around an implant clean is crucial for its long-term success. A 2024 trial found that floss, along with other interdental cleaners, was effective in reducing plaque and gum inflammation around implant-supported crowns [8]. Whether you have implants, braces or other specific dental needs, cleaning between your teeth is a critical step in preventing complications.\nFlossing Works\u2014Even if You\u2019re Not Perfect\nSo, does flossing actually work? The answer is a definite yes. Multiple high-quality studies have shown that adding flossing to your routine reduces plaque and gingivitis (the earliest, reversible stage of gum disease) compared to brushing alone. A 2022 trial found that brushing and flossing together led to healthier gums [9]. Some people point to a 2019 Cochrane review that said the evidence for flossing was of \u201clow certainty\u201d [5]. But that doesn\u2019t mean flossing doesn\u2019t work. It means it\u2019s hard to do long-term studies on personal habits\u2014researchers have to rely on self-reporting and study designs vary widely. The consensus among dentists remains: mechanical cleaning between the teeth, as shown in many clinical trials, is essential for removing plaque a toothbrush can\u2019t reach.\nFinding What Works for You\nModern dentistry is moving away from one-size-fits-all. A 2021 literature review emphasized creating an individualized oral hygiene plan based on evidence [4]. Not everyone loves traditional string floss and that\u2019s okay. The market is full of interdental cleaning aids, from water flossers and interdental brushes to floss picks. A 2019 review found different tools have different strengths and the most effective one is the one you\u2019ll use consistently and correctly [7]. For more information on oral health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a great resource.\nIf you have big gaps between your teeth, an interdental brush might be better. If you have braces, a water flosser or orthodontic floss threaders could be a game-changer. Talk to your dentist or hygienist about what\u2019s right for your mouth.\nClosing Thoughts\nSo, how often should you floss? While daily flossing is the ideal, the evidence says flossing at least three times a week can still have big benefits for your gum health. More importantly, it\u2019s about finding a routine that works for you.\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway is that how and when you floss are just as important as how often. Remember to floss before you brush to maximize plaque removal and fluoride exposure [3]. And don\u2019t be afraid to try different tools to find the one you like best [7]. Ultimately, interdental cleaning is a cornerstone of good oral health, protecting you from cavities and gum disease one day at a time.\nReferences\n[1] Y\u0131lmaz, M., K\u00f6se, T., & Buduneli, N.

      "text": "Abstract\nTraumatic dental injuries (TDIs) of teeth occur frequently in children and adolescents. TDIs that impact the periodontal tissues and alveolar tissue can be classified into concussion, subluxation, extrusive luxation, intrusive luxation, lateral luxation, and avulsion. In these TDIs, management of injured soft tissue, mainly periodontal ligament, and dental pulp, is crucial in maintaining the function and longevity of the injured teeth. Factors that need to be considered for management in laxation injuries include the maturation stage of the traumatic teeth, mobility, direction of displacement, distance of displacement, and whether there are alveolar fractures. In avulsion, the maturation stage of the permanent tooth, the out-socket time, storage media/condition of the avulsed tooth, and management of the PDL should also be considered. Especially, in this review, we have subdivided the immature tooth into the adolescent tooth (Nolla stage 9) and the very young tooth (Nolla stage 8 and below). This consensus paper aimed to discuss the impacts of those factors on the trauma management and prognosis of TDI to provide a streamlined guide for clinicians from clinical evaluation, diagnostic process, management plan decision, follow-up, and orthodontic treatment for tooth luxation and avulsion injuries.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nTraumatic dental injuries (TDIs) most commonly occur in children and young adults. Twenty-five percent of all school children experience dental trauma1 and 33% of adults have experienced trauma to the permanent dentition.2 Overall, about one billion people have experienced TDIs.3 Luxation injuries are the most common TDIs in primary dentition, whereas crown fractures are more commonly reported for permanent teeth.2 Males suffer more TDIs than females.4 The most widely used dental trauma classification system was developed by Dr. Jens Ove Andreasen in the 1970s.5 Dr. Andreasen has classified TDIs into four types, injuries to the hard dental tissues and pulp, injuries to the periodontal tissues, injuries to the supporting bone, and injuries to the gingiva or oral mucosa. Among the four types, the injuries to the periodontal tissues are usually more complicated and require longer follow-ups. The injuries to the periodontal tissues are also known as tooth displacement injuries, including five different types of tooth luxation and tooth avulsion. The five different types of tooth luxation are concussion, subluxation, extrusive luxation, intrusive luxation, and lateral luxation.6,7 In Xi\u2019an, China, the prevalence of concussion, subluxation, extrusive luxation, intrusive luxation, and lateral luxation is 27.4%, 21.5%, 16.3%, 11.1%, 5.9%, and 17.8%, respectively, in tooth luxation and avulsion category.8 The prevalence of luxation in 1\u20136, 7\u201312, and >13-year-olds are 38.5%, 57.0%, and 4.4%, respectively.8 In Hongkong, China, the prevalence of tooth concussion, subluxation, extrusive luxation, intrusive luxation, and lateral luxation is 35.2%, 50.1%, 5.9%, 2.5%, 1.1%, and 5.1%, respectively, in primary school children tooth luxation and avulsion.9 If tooth luxation and avulsion have not been managed properly, this would lead to poor prognosis and generate lifelong impact on the patient.2 The understanding of pathologic changes and proper management would result in better outcomes. Therefore, the goal of this consensus is to discuss the soft and hard tissue changes in the occurrence and recovery of tooth luxation and avulsion and to provide suggestions for trauma management based on those changes. The clinical and radiographic observations, dental treatment, emergency treatment and post-trauma care, possible complications and countermeasures, and the orthodontic considerations for traumatic teeth will be discussed.\nPathologic changes and related symptoms\nThe series of pathological changes in soft tissue ischemia\nThe tissue cells\u2019 growth requires a proper physiologic environment, with a blood supply that brings nutrients and oxygen to the tissue. However, if the blood supply is compromised, known as ischemia, this will lead to damage of the cells and dysfunction of the tissues. In ischemia, the removal of metabolic wastes would also be compromised, leading to accumulated toxic metabolites in the tissue.10 In prolonged ischemia, due to the anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation, the ATP levels and intracellular pH would decrease. As a result, the ATPase-dependent ion transport system becomes dysfunctional, leading to increased intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels, cell swelling and rupture, and cell death through necrosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy mechanisms.11 In an extreme situation, with the presence of mono- or multiply-species bacterial infection, the necrotizing soft tissue infection may occur, leading to severe tissue inflammation and necrosis.12\nPulp tissue changes in luxation and avulsion\nThe dental pulp is the innermost tissue of the tooth. It contains blood vessels, nerves, connective tissues, and specialized cells, and provides nutrients for the tooth.13 Unlike the periodontal ligament, there is only one main blood vessel coming from the apical foramen of the root apex. The blood supply brings oxygen and nutrients to the pulp tissue.14\nSub-classification of immature tooth\nThe International Association for Dental Traumatology (IADT) guidelines have classified the tooth into immature tooth (apex open) and mature tooth (apex closed).7 The mature tooth refers to a tooth in Nolla tooth development stage 10, and the immature tooth refers to a tooth in Nolla stages 9 and below (Table 1). According to IADT guidelines, for an immature avulsed tooth, since the apex foramen is open, the proper treatment is to preserve the pulp and monitor the pulp condition in recalls.7 However, in clinic practice, we noticed that the outcome of pulp reservation is much worse in an immature tooth of Nolla stage 9 than an immature tooth of Nolla stage 8 or 7. Therefore, in the current review, we have subdivided the immature tooth into adolescent tooth (Nolla stage 9) and very young tooth (Nolla stage 8 and below). The adolescent tooth is like a froglet, which is in a transitional stage between a mature tooth and a very young tooth (Table 1).\nFactors affect the clinical outcome\nSeveral factors, stage of tooth development, distance of dislocation, and mobility of the traumatic tooth, are associated with the outcome of tooth luxation or avulsion.\nStage of tooth development\nThere are three factors that affect tissue healing, tissue dehydration, blood supply, and sepsis.14 Tissue regains blood supply via angiogenesis, in which capillary grows and vascular bedforms.15 In a luxation tooth, the recovery of pulp blood supply partially depends on the diameter of the apical foramen. The tooth with a larger foramen has a larger contact area for revascularization, therefore, the chance of successfully regaining blood supply is higher in a tooth with a large foramen than in a tooth with a smaller foramen. That is, a very young tooth is more likely to regain blood supply than an adolescent tooth and a mature tooth.16\nDistance of dislocation\nThere is limited elasticity of the blood vessel. If the dislocation distance has exceeded the elastic limit of the blood vessel, the blood vessel breaks. Therefore, in general, the shorter the tooth dislocates, the better the blood vessel recovers. A luxation tooth with less dislocation usually results in better outcomes.17\nMobility of the traumatic tooth\nAs stated above, there is limited elasticity of the blood vessel. If the force has exceeded the elastic limit of the blood vessel, the blood vessel breaks. The force is usually associated with tooth mobility. Therefore, in general, the less mobility the tooth is, the better the blood vessel recovers. A luxation tooth with less mobility usually results in better outcomes than one with more mobility.18\nIndicators of pulp status\nBlood flow, also known as hemoperfusion, is a direct indicator of pulp status. Laser Doppler flowmetry can be used to measure the blood flow.19 However, if laser Doppler flowmetry is not available, the tooth discoloration may reflect the blood supply and pulp status to a certain extent. If the tooth is pale, this indicates less blood flow rate, usually accompanied by low blood oxygen saturation.20 If the tooth is reddish or pinkish, this indicates the hemorrhage, as the blood is accumulated in the site with high carbon dioxide concentration, which is usually accompanied by edema.21 If the tooth is grayish, this usually indicates a necrotic pulp status. Since some dark discolored primary teeth can be preserved for a long time in some cases, it is still a dilemma if the endodontic treatment should be carried for a dark-colored tooth.22 But for the light discolored tooth, the color change of the tooth should be followed until there are some other evidence coming up to support the estimation of the pulp status. In some cases, the light-discolored tooth would recover by itself.23\nContinuous root development is another direct indicator of live pulp status in immature teeth. This can be observed through radiographs in follow-up dental visits.\nDental pulp post-trauma healing\nThere are three types of dental pulp post-trauma healing, normal pulp, pulp necrosis, and pulp canal obliteration.\nNormal pulp\nThis usually happens in mild luxation or very young teeth. The dental pulp maintains the normal function and the shape of the pulp canal is normal.\nPulp canal obliteration\nThis usually happens in moderate or severe luxations, such as extrusive luxation, intrusive location, and lateral luxation, with an open apex.6,24 When soft tissue continuously suffers ischemia or trauma, the odontoblastic secretory activity will lose neural control, resulting in accelerated dentin deposition and pulp canal obliteration.25\nPulp necrosis\nThis usually happens in severe luxation or avulsion, when infection presents.24\nPeriodontal ligament changes in luxation and avulsion\nPDL injury in luxation and avulsion\nThe periodontal ligament is a connective tissue in between of cementum and periodontal bone (alveolar process). The main components of the periodontal ligament are principal fibers, including alveolar crest fibers, horizontal fibers, oblique fibers, apical fibers, and inter-radicular fibers.26 The periodontal ligament provides the tooth attachment to the alveolar bone, and the width of the periodontal ligament is around 0.15\u20130.21 mm on radiographs.27 The periodontal ligament can disperse the occlusal force from the tooth crown to the alveolar bone, protecting the tooth from extra force load.28 Three major blood vessels nourish the periodontal ligament. They are perforating vessels, apical vessels, and gingival vessels, from which the periodontal ligament gets nutrients and removes waste away, in order to maintain the physiologic functions of the cells in the periodontal ligament.10\nIn tooth luxation, no matter with or without tooth dislocation, since the periodontal ligament attaches to its blood supply, laceration presences in some cases, and the overall recovery of the periodontal ligament is good.6\nIn tooth avulsion, since the periodontal ligament has been cut from its blood supply, the recovery of the periodontal ligament depends on how long the tooth has been kept dry outside the alveolar socket and whether it gets contaminated by the soil or not.7 Usually, if the tooth can be put back immediately, the status of the periodontal ligament is usually good. If the tooth has been kept dry for less than 60 min, the status of the periodontal ligament is fair, with some cells having already died. If the tooth has been kept dry for more than 60 min, the status of the periodontal ligament is poor, with the majority of cells having already died.7 Therefore, it is critical to put the tooth back into the alveolar socket as soon as possible. If on-site replantation is not available, the tooth should be kept in a physiologic media and sent to the dental clinic quickly. Milk, saline, and some commercial tooth preservation kits are usually used to preserve the avulsed tooth. One meta-analysis indicated that Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS), oral rehydration salts, propolis, and even rice water and cling film have been proven to be more effective in cell viability preservation than milk, yolk is similar compared to milk, but saline is less effective.29\nPDL Treatment\nIt is still controversial whether the periodontal ligament should be removed or not from the root surface if the avulsed tooth has been kept dry for more than 60 min. If the periodontal ligament has been removed, the cementum would contact with the alveolar bone directly, in this case, ankylosis will easily happen. However, if the periodontal ligament has been preserved since some cells and tissue have already become necrotic, inflammation may happen, which can also lead to root resorption and tooth ankylosis. In 2012 IADT guidelines, the periodontal membrane on the tooth surface was suggested to be removed30 while in 2020 IADT guidelines, the membrane was suggested to be cleaned by agitation but not removed.7 In some studies, concentration growth factors (CGF) membrane and platelet-derived growth factors, which are derived from blood, have been used in periodontal ligament regeneration.31 The application of CGF in avulsed tooth treatment need more large-scale clinic research support before it is widely recommended.\nPDL post-trauma healing\nThere are three types of PDL post-trauma healing, normal PDL, ankylosis, and external resorption.\nNormal PDL healing\nThis usually happens in mild luxation or on-site tooth replantation of a very young tooth. This is the best PDL healing with normal functional PDL tissues.\nAnkylosis\nIt is a condition that the periodontal ligament disappears totally or partially and the cementum fuses with the alveolar bone. The bone tissue replaces the periodontal ligament, leading to a fixation of the tooth to the bone.32 Since the craniofacial bones continuously develop until adulthood, if the ankylosis happens in children and adolescents, the traumatic tooth usually becomes \u201cshorter\u201d than the unaffected ones because it cannot erupt properly. The root is held back by the alveolar bone during craniofacial development, and the tooth cannot move to its ideal occlusal position. If the ankylosis happens in adulthood, although the root fuses to the bone, since there is no more craniofacial development, the traumatic tooth usually looks \u201cthe same height\u201d as a normal companion tooth. But the high-metallic sound is present in the ankylosed tooth, no matter whether the trauma happens in childhood or in adulthood, since this indicates the fusion of root and alveolar bone. For the treatment of an ankylosed tooth, please refer to the \u201cFollow-up, prognosis, and management of complications\u201d section of this review.\nExternal inflammatory resorption\nThe external inflammatory resorption is aggressive and destructive.33 If the microorganisms are present on the root surface, they generate toxins, which will recruit osteoclasts and inflammatory cells and result in bone resorption. Moreover, the lack of blood supply to the affected tooth would aggravate this process.33 Corticosteroid-antibiotics can be used intracanal to control the external resorption. Calcium hydroxide should not be firstly used because of its toxicity to the cells, but it can be used after the corticosteroid-antibiotics to stimulate root hard tissue deposit.34\nClinical evaluation and diagnostic process\nHistory\nMedical history\nThe medical history is used to acknowledge the patient\u2019s past or current health status. It usually includes past and present diagnoses, medical care, treatments, and allergies.\nMedication information\nThis is also known as drug therapy. The dentist should review this information and decide the medication that the patient would take. If the dentist is not certain about some special medications, he should refer to the patient\u2019s physician for more information.\nFamily history\nFamily history may help to hint at some genetic or hereditary diseases. Since tooth luxation or avulsion are traumatic diseases, a protruded anterior tooth may be genetically acquired and contribute to the occurrence of TDIs.8\nTreatment history\nIt usually includes chief complaints, history of illness, vital signs, physical examination, surgical history, medical allergies, immunization history, habits, etc.\nClinical evaluation\nPercussion\nIn dentistry, a percussion test is usually used to assess apical inflammation. However, for a traumatic tooth, a percussion test is usually used to assess the periodontal membrane status. If percussion generates tenderness, it indicates a traumatic status of the periodontal membrane. While if percussion does not generate any discomfort, it indicates a healthy status. This is useful especially when the percussion is tender in the first visit but recovers in follow-ups, which indicates good healing of the periodontal ligament. For intrusive and lateral luxation, it gives a high metallic (ankylotic) sound, because the root is stuck in the alveolar bone and becomes immobile.\nGingival bleeding\nGingival bleeding indicates periodontal ligament laceration.\nMobility\nMiller\u2019s tooth mobility grading system is adopted in this review.35 Briefly, 0 = no mobility, 1 = greater than normal (physiological), 2 = <1 mm in buccolingual direction, and 3 = >1 mm in buccolingual direction and depressible (apicocoronally movable). Teeth with more mobility have a higher risk of pulp damage, especially in a mature tooth with a closed apex.24\nTooth dislocation\nThe direction and distance should be recorded. The direction of tooth dislocation partially determines tooth diagnosis. The distance indicates the severity of tooth dislocation. In some treatments, such as intrusive luxation, the distance partially determines the treatment plan.6\nDental pulp testing\nDental pulp testing is discussed in a separate subsection \u201cThe application of dental pulp testing\u201d.\nRadiographic evaluation\nFor radiographic evaluation, a periapical radiograph is the first choice.36 However, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) radiograph can also be used to estimate the three-dimensional direct of tooth displacement and the alveolar socket wall fracture or compression and assess whether the dental displacement is accompanied by or results in jaw fracture or damage of surrounding tissue such as maxilla sinus, nasopalatine nerve, etc.36 For a very young child, the CBCT should be used with caution because of ionizing radiation. CBCT is usually not the first choice of radiographic evaluation in most cases.\nTooth dislocation\nThe direction and distance should be recorded.\nPeriodontal space\nThis is used to facilitate estimating the direction and severity of tooth dislocation and periodontal ligament damage.\nRoot fracture\nNeed to rule out root fracture.\nThe application of dental pulp testing\nThe dental pulp testing has been widely used to estimate the status of dental pulp. Dental pulp testing can be classified into pulp sensibility test and pulp viability. The pulp sensibility test assesses the pulp\u2019s sensory response, in other words, tests whether the pulp has a neural response to a stimulus or not. The typical pulp sensibility tests are electric pulp testing (EPT) and thermal testing. The pulp viability test assesses the pulp\u2019s blood supply, in other words, tests whether the blood supply to the pulp has been compromised or not. The typical pulp viability tests are pulse oximetry and Laser Doppler flowmetry.37 The pulp viability test is considered superior to the pulp sensibility test because it measures the true health of the dental pulp. However, since there are still some practical issues with the pulp viability test, the pulp sensitivity test is the most frequently used pulp test in clinical practice.37\nTypes of dental pulp testing\nThermal testing\nPulp thermal tests are divided into hot testing and cold testing. The hot testing applies a hot stimulus, such as heated gutta percha, on the tooth surface and tests if the tooth can sense this hot or not. Like hot testing, cold testing applies a cold stimulus, such as ice, dry ice, ethyl chloride, dichlorodifluoromethane, etc., on the tooth and tests if the tooth can sense this cold or not.37 For toddlers and young children, thermal testing is not recommended for the first dental visit, because toddlers and young children are not able to correctly express their feelings immediately after the trauma, moreover, the pulp is usually in shock status at this visit and the result is not that reliable. Especially, avoiding hot testing on toddlers and young children since this would generate pain and even iatrogenic injury on them.\nElectric pulp testing (EPT)\nThe EPT generates electrical stimuli, which cause ionic change across the neural membrane, and as the voltage increases the patient feels a \u201ctingling\u201d sensation.37\nPulse oximetry and laser Doppler flowmetry\nPulse oximetry is a noninvasive test for monitoring a tooth\u2019s blood oxygen saturation,37 and laser Doppler flowmetry is used to assess pulp blood flow.38 Pulse oximetry provides higher diagnostic accuracy than EPT and thermal testing.39 However, due to insufficient reports, the diagnostic accuracy of laser Doppler flowmetry cannot be predicted at present.40\nDental pulp testing decision tree\nFor traumatic teeth, especially for an immature traumatic tooth with an open apex, the result of dental pulp testing is not accurate.41 An open apex tooth can give a false negative EPT. A traumatic tooth in shock condition, with a sudden drop in blood flow, with lead to negative results in pulse oximetry and laser Doppler flowmetry. Even if false results are generated, the dental pulp testing should be carried out at the first dental visit and follow-up. If the pulp test is positive at the first dental visit, this indicates that the pulp is in good condition and the pulp is likely could be preserved.42 However, if the pulp test is negative at the first dental visit, the dental pulp testing should be carried out in each follow-up, until the result turns positive or there are other signs to support the pulp necrosis, which needs pulp therapy.6 For easier decision-making in each dental visit, a dental pulp testing decision tree has been generated (Fig. 1).\nSummary of clinical and radiographic observations and diagnosis\nClinical findings\nThe main clinical findings of tooth luxation and avulsion have been summarized in Table 2. Other important findings for a specific luxation or avulsion are listed below.\nConcussion\nThe tooth may be tender to percussion with minor gingiva bleeding, but mobility is within normal limits. The pulp sensibility testing is usually positive6 (Fig. 2).\nSubluxation\nThe pulp sensibility testing may be negative, indicating a transient pulp shock. Usually, no radiographic abnormalities are detected. However, in some cases, increased periodontal ligament space may be observed (Fig. 2).\nExtrusive luxation\nThe tooth displaced its socket in the incisal/axial direction and appears supper-erupted compared to the original position with increased mobility. The pulp sensibility testing is usually negative. Increased periodontal ligament space in the apical region is usually noted (Fig. 2).\nIntrusive luxation\nTooth intrusion It is usually associated with the alveolar socket wall fracture or compression.6 The pulp sensibility testing is usually negative. The periodontal ligament space is reduced or even absent. The cementoenamel junction dislocates apically than the adjacent non-injured tooth. In severe cases, the injured teeth can be embedded completely sublingually.\nLateral luxation\nThe tooth is displaced in a lateral direction, including palatal/lingual, labial/buccal, or mesial/distal direction, and it is usually associated with the alveolar socket wall or facial cortical bone fracture or compression.6 The tooth is usually immobile, but it can be mobile in some cases. If the tooth is stuck, it would give a high metallic (ankylotic) sound by percussion. The pulp sensibility testing is usually negative.\nAvulsion\nGingival crevice bleeding is present, with gingiva laceration. The alveolar socket is empty.7 Sometimes, alveolar socket wall fracture can be observed in radiographic exams (Fig. 2).\nThe diagnosis tree of tooth luxation and avulsion injuries has been summarized in Fig. 3.\nTreatments\nDental treatments of tooth luxation and avulsion\nConcussion\nNo treatment is needed at the first dental visit. For immature primary teeth or very young permanent teeth, the pulp status is usually good.16 Therefore, monitoring the pulp condition for six months or up to one year would be adequate to determine if the pulp survives or not. For mature primary teeth, monitor the pulp condition for at least one year. If the pulp becomes necrosis, symptoms, such as gingival pustules, abnormal tooth mobility, abnormal root resorption, and apical periodontitis, would develop. For mature permanent teeth, monitor the pulp condition for at least one year,6 or up to two years on the safe side.\nSubluxation\nIf the mobility of the tooth is within Grade 1, and the patient feels comfortable with the loose tooth, no treatment is needed.6 If the mobility of the tooth is more than Grade 1, or the patient feels uncomfortable with the loose tooth, a passive and flexible splint is recommended to stabilize the tooth for 2 weeks. The risk of pulp necrosis in subluxation is higher than that in concussion. An immature tooth usually has a better outcome than a mature tooth.43 Monitor the pulp condition for at least one year or even longer.6\nExtrusive luxation\nThere is a dislocation in the extrusive luxation. Therefore, the tooth needed to be repositioned and stabilized with a passive and flexible splint for 2 weeks. The risk of pulp necrosis in extrusive luxation is higher than that in concussion and subluxation, especially for a mature tooth with severe dislocation. An immature tooth usually has a better outcome than a mature tooth. Monitor the pulp condition for at least three years or even longer.6\nIntrusive luxation\nThe treatment of IADT guidelines for an intrusive tooth is summarized in Table 3.6 The immature tooth listed in Table 3 is an \u201cideal\u201d intrusive tooth, with a very young stage of tooth development and the direction of intrusion is exactly apical without any lateral dislocation. However, in a clinic, the situation varies. Make the treatment plan based on the specific situation.\nLateral luxation\nThere is a dislocation in the lateral luxation, the tooth needed to be repositioned with a gentle force under local infiltration anesthesia. In the repositioning process, if the tooth is stuck in the alveolar bone, it can be disengaged by a force in the occlusal direction. The tooth should be fixed with a passive and flexible splint for 4 weeks since the alveolar process or alveolar bone fracture is accompanied by lateral luxation. If excessive mobility exists after a 4-week splint, the fixation time can be extended.7 An immature tooth usually has a better outcome than a mature tooth, but in general, the dental pulp prognosis is poor. For the immature tooth, especially for very young permanent teeth, revascularization could occur. In this case, the dental pulp is not supposed to be removed at the first dental visit, but the condition of the dental pulp should be monitored in the follow-up visit. If there are signs of necrotic, the dental pulp should be removed. According to the IADT guidelines, for mature teeth, the risk of necrotic dental pulp is relatively high, therefore, the dental pulp should be removed for the prevention of inflammatory external resorption.6\nAvulsion\nAs mentioned above, the treatment plan for an avulsed tooth varies based on whether the tooth has been replanted before the clinic visit, if not, how long has it been kept dry? It also varies based on whether the tooth is a mature tooth or an immature one. Generally, the treatment plan has been listed in Table 4. For the step-by-step management of an avulsed tooth, please refer to the IADT guidelines.7\nUse of antibiotics\nAntibiotics have been widely used in infectious disease control, and the discovery of antibiotics has saved thousands of lives. However, since bacteria can generate resistance to antibiotics, antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a confirmed infection.44 For tooth luxation, since the tooth has not fallen out of the mouth, there is no indication for antibiotics. For tooth avulsion, since the tooth has fallen onto the floor and got contaminated by the soil and bacteria, antibiotics are recommended to control or prevent infection-related inflammation and root resorption.7\nSystemic antibiotics\nThe use of systemic antibiotics is recommended for tooth avulsion.7 Ask patients and caregivers for potential medical history of drug allergy and food allergy. Make sure to calculate children\u2019s weight for antibiotics prescription. Amoxicillin and penicillin are the first antibiotics choice because of their broad-spectrum antibacterial effects and relatively lower risk of side effects.45\nTopical antibiotics\nThere are two ways of topical antibiotic application. The first one is to apply antibiotics on the root surface before tooth replantation, while the second one is to apply antibiotics in the root canal. No significant improvement in clinical revascularization success rate has been detected in topical antibiotics application.46 Theoretically, antibiotics only play a role when there is a confirmed bacterial infection. For the avulsed tooth, if the bacterial infection is mild, such as the tooth failing on relatively clean ground or the tooth has been sent to a dental clinic very quickly in a physiologic media, the effect of antibiotics application would not be that significant.47 Dentists should also weigh the pros of minimizing infection by topical antibiotics application and the cons of prolonged tooth replantation by soaking the root in antibiotic solution. For very young avulsed teeth, since the pulp should be preserved, root canal antibiotics application is not practical. For mature avulsed teeth, theoretically, antibiotics can be kept in the root canal to control or reduce root resorption after the replantation.48 Further experiments should be conducted to test this hypothesis.\nTetanus vaccine\nTetanus is a bacterial infection disease, which causes muscle spasms and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The spasms usually last for several minutes and may cause bone fractures in some severe cases.49 Tetanus recovers in several months, but in some cases, it may cause death. It is vaccine-preventable and is rare in developed countries since people have received the vaccine in their childhood and boosters when they grow up.50 But on the safe side, a patient with a replanted avulsed tooth is recommended to refer to his physician to check if he needs a tetanus booster. In other luxation situations, since the tooth has not fallen on the ground, there is no need for a tetanus booster.7\nEmergency management and consultation on post-trauma care\nEmergency management\nWhen an emergency happens, the caregiver of children or adolescents would be the person who provides first-aid. For many emergencies, timely management by a general practitioner is more important than late management by a medical professional, i.e., the airway, breathing, and circulation management of resuscitation. The goal of emergency management is to relieve the emergency, to minimize side effects, to gain a better prognosis, or at least to gain more time before a medical professional arrives.51 In general, traumatic injuries can be divided into penetrating, blunt, decelerating, and thermal injuries.52 Blunt and deceleration injuries include general impacts from projectiles, such as falls, TDIs, etc. The goal of emergency management of a traumatic tooth is to preserve the viability of periodontal ligament and dental pulp, in the hope of a better prognosis. In most luxation and avulsion injuries, timely replanting the injured tooth back into the alveolar socket is critical for a better prognosis of the tooth.6,53 The emergency treatment has been summarized (Fig. 4).\nConcussion\nNo emergency management is needed.\nSubluxation\nAsk the patient to bite on a piece of gauze, a napkin, or a piece of soft clothing to stabilize the tooth and make the patient feel more comfortable before a dental visit.\nExtrusive luxation\nCarefully reposit the extrusive tooth back into its original position. Then, ask the patient to bite on a piece of gauze, a napkin, or a piece of soft clothing to stabilize the tooth.\nIntrusive luxation\nNo tooth repositioning is recommended. Ask the patient to bite on a piece of gauze, a napkin, or a piece of soft clothing if the tooth is mobile or an occlusal interference is present.\nLateral luxation\nCarefully reposit the lateral moved tooth back into its original position if possible. Then, ask the patient to bite on a piece of gauze, a napkin, or a piece of soft clothing to stabilize the tooth.\nAvulsion\nCarefully reposit the avulsed tooth back into its original position if possible. Then, ask the patient to bite on a piece of gauze, a napkin, or a piece of soft clothing to stabilize the tooth.7,53 However, if the situation does not allow for repositioning, keep the avulsed tooth in a physiologic media and send the patient to a dental office as soon as possible.7 The physiologic media include but are not limited to saline, milk, HBSS (buffer), saliva, propolis solution, oral rehydration salts, rice water, and cling film.29\nPost-trauma care\nOral hygiene\nMeticulous oral hygiene is recommended by the IADT guidelines to maintain the oral health of a dental trauma patient.2 Both the patient and the parent should be informed of the oral hygiene details. Especially, for children and adolescents, the application of an antibacterial agent mouthwash for 1\u20132 weeks is recommended, and for very young children, a cotton swab with an antibacterial agent for 1\u20132 weeks is recommended.2 Like the orthodontic bracket, the flexible splint can obstruct biofilm removal and oral hygiene maintenance.54 Therefore, a patient who wears a splint can use an orthodontic toothbrush to clear his tooth, and fluoride varnish should be applied to a patient who wears a prolonged splint.\nPsychological counseling\nDental and orofacial trauma impacts patients physically and psychologically. One systematic review suggests that trauma has a great impact on a patient\u2019s oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), especially, since the prevalence of OHRQoL is 88.4% among adolescents.55 The occurrence of dental trauma may impair the emotional balance, social functioning, and well-being of the patient.56 Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the patient\u2019s psychological changes, such as taciturn or sensitivity. Cooperating with the parents is a simple but effective way to reassure the patient, because parents can provide strong emotional support to the patient. Make both the parents and patient feel the traumatic situation has been properly managed and everything is under control.57 Try to positively reinforce the family, such as praising them for having sent the patient to the dental clinic on time before the situation gets worse, and give objective positive signs. Nevertheless, if the dentist feels the psychological problem is out of his control, referring the patient to a psychologist is a wise choice.\nOn-time recalls\nOn-time recalls ensure proper post-trauma clinical and radiographic observations. If signs or symptoms have been observed, intervention can be applied in time.\nPossible TDI prevention strategies\nEpidemiologic studies have revealed that maxillary central incisors are at the highest risk of dental trauma, and falls are the chief reason. Protruded anterior tooth (overjet) and gender significantly contribute to the occurrence of dental trauma.58\nMouthguard\nPeople who are participating in sports, especially in contact sports and winter sports such as skiing, are at high risk of dental trauma.59 It is necessary to inform the sport's participants to wear mouthguards.\nOrthodontic treatment\nThe protruded anterior tooth can be corrected by orthodontic treatment, especially for patients who have suffered two or more times on the same protruded anterior tooth.\nFollow-up, prognosis, and management of complications\nFollow-up\nThe purpose of follow-up is to monitor the status of the injured tooth and whether interventions should be applied. The follow-up time points of the primary tooth and permanent tooth have been listed in Table 5. The timeline of follow-up follows IADT guidelines with some modifications.2 We have unified the first follow-up time point of permanent and primary tooth luxation to 2 weeks. The follow-up time point of 8 weeks in primary tooth avulsion has been removed since the healing of gingival laceration has already been estimated in 2 weeks follow-up. If the root cancels therapy of the permanent tooth or pulpectomy of the primary tooth has been done, the risk of pulp infection-related root resorption is low. Therefore, the 8-week follow-up time point of extrusion and lateral luxation has been removed. Moreover, the yearly follow-up has been changed to every other year after one year because the traumatic situation usually becomes stable after one year (Table 5).\nPrognosis\nConcussion and subluxation\nUsually good. Monitor the pulp status in follow-up visits. If the pulp becomes necrotic, start the endodontic treatment.\nExtrusive luxation, intrusive luxation, lateral luxation, and avulsion\nDepends on the specific situation. If the pulp is preserved, monitor the pulp status in a follow-up visit. If the pulp becomes necrotic, start the endodontic treatment.\nTreatment of necrotic dental pulp\nPulp regeneration and pulp revascularization\nThe goal of pulp regeneration, also known as regenerative endodontics, is to regenerate the pulp\u2013dentinal complex. Basic research and preclinical research have successfully used dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and dental mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate the dental pulp. But at this moment, in clinical practice, it is pulp revascularisation rather than pulp regeneration. The pulp revascularisation restores the pulp chamber with blood vessels, connective tissues, and some pulp cells but the pulp\u2013dentinal complex has not been regenerated.13 Pulp revascularization is recommended for necrotic very young permanent teeth. Detailed pulp revascularisation protocol can be found in the European Society of Endodontology position statement.60\nApical barrier\nThe apical barrier is recommended for very young permanent teeth and adolescent teeth. It uses biocompatible materials to seal the open apical foramen, therefore, the filling materials will be confined to the root canal.61\nApexification\nApexification is recommended for most types of immature teeth, and if other treatments, such as pulp revascularisation and apical barrier, fail. Unlike apical battier, the apexification requires frequent recalls to change the calcium hydroxide sealed in the root canal.62 If frequent recalls are impracticable, the patient is recommended for an apical barrier.\nRoot canal therapy\nRoot canal therapy is recommended for mature teeth. The crown of the traumatic tooth should be restored in the patient\u2019s adulthood (Fig. 5).\nTreatment of ankylosed tooth\nObservation\nIf the ankylosis happens to an adult, whose craniofacial development is finished, the tooth might not get submerged and could still maintain the normal occlusion. In this case, no intervention is needed.\nCrown restoration\nIf the ankylosis happens to a child or an adolescent, whose craniofacial development is not finished, the tooth might get submerged. In this case, a crown restoration can be used to extend the clinical crown length.\nTooth decoration and dental implant\nIf the root is severely resorbed, with the disappearance of periodontal ligament space, and the cementum fused with the alveolar bone, tooth decoration should be conducted. In tooth decoronation, the crown portion of the tooth is removed and the root canal is filled with blood drained from the periapical connective tissue. Over a certain time, the root structure disappears, but the alveolar width has been maintained. This is a conservative transitional method of bone width and height preservation. When the patient becomes an adult, the dental implant can be conducted.63\nOrthodontic treatment\nPlease refer to the \u201cConsiderations for dislocated dental injuries in orthodontic treatment planning\u201d section of this consensus.\nConsiderations for dislocated dental injuries in orthodontic treatment planning\nTooth root movement\nAssessment of the health status of traumatized teeth\nA detailed evaluation of traumatized teeth is required, encompassing the health of the dental pulp, the integrity of the root structure, and the healing process of the tooth and surrounding tissues.64 This includes assessing the extent of root resorption that has occurred, the stability of the tooth, and the condition of the periodontal tissues.65\nSelecting the appropriate timing for treatment\nIt is crucial to determine the most suitable start time for treatment to ensure ample recovery of the teeth and surrounding tissues. For the orthodontic movement of traumatized teeth, it is recommended to wait for a period post-trauma (such as 3 months to 1 year) to allow for the natural healing process to take place.65\nConsidering the limitations of tooth movement\nTeeth that have been traumatized or dislocated may respond differently to orthodontic forces compared to undamaged teeth. In such cases, tooth movement can be more complex, requiring precise control of forces and movement strategies to avoid further root resorption or other complications due to excessive force.65,66,67\nUtilizing light forces and progressive orthodontic techniques\nTo minimize the adverse effects of tooth movement on damaged teeth, it is advisable to use light and gradual forces, along with more refined orthodontic methods. Light-force orthodontics can reduce stress on the teeth and periodontal tissues, lowering the risk of further damage (Fig. 6).65,66\nRegular monitoring and treatment plan adjustments\nThroughout the orthodontic treatment process, regular monitoring of tooth movement and periodontal health is essential. This may require periodic clinical examinations and radiographic assessments to ensure that tooth movement is proceeding as planned and to adjust the treatment plan when necessary.66,67\nPatient communication and education\nCommunicating the treatment plan, potential risks, and expected outcomes to patients and their parents is of great importance. Patient understanding and cooperation are crucial for the success of the treatment.68,69\nRoot resorption\nMechanisms of root resorption\nOrthodontically induced external apical root resorption (EARR) is a common and detrimental side effect driven by inflammation during orthodontic movement. This type of root resorption can lead to irreversible loss of tooth structure.70 Studies indicate that 90% of teeth undergoing orthodontic treatment experience EARR, with over 80% of patients showing more than 1 mm of root resorption post-treatment, and one-third exceeding 3 mm.71\nTiming of orthodontic treatment\nFor dislocated teeth requiring both endodontic and orthodontic treatments, priority should be given to endodontic treatment as it lays the foundation for subsequent orthodontic procedures.72 The optimal timing for orthodontic tooth movement depends on the healing of apical lesions post-endodontic treatment and the extent of trauma to the tooth. Comprehensive clinical assessment is crucial in selecting the most appropriate treatment method for optimal outcomes.71\nThe interval between orthodontic and endodontic treatments\nFor mildly traumatized teeth, a waiting period of 3\u20136 months may be necessary to allow the normalization of periodontal tissues and structures before initiating orthodontic movement. For moderately traumatized teeth, a minimum waiting period of 1 year is recommended until the apex radiograph or tomography shows normal results. In severe trauma cases, such as root fractures, the waiting period should be extended to 2 years or more. Studies suggest that starting orthodontic treatment 4\u20135 months after mild to moderate trauma does not increase the risk of root resorption.71\nTeeth post-endodontic treatment and orthodontic treatment\nTeeth post-endodontic treatment (RFT) exhibit relatively lower EARR compared to vital pulp teeth after orthodontic treatment. Therefore, initiating orthodontic movement post-endodontic treatment is considered a relatively safe approach. When both treatments are necessary, endodontic treatment should precede. The timing of orthodontic treatment should be determined based on the healing of the apical lesion and the severity of the trauma, and it is advisable to commence when the apical X-ray appears normal.71\nDental ankylosis\nDiagnosis and assessment\nInitially, an accurate diagnosis and assessment of the extent and range of dental ankylosis are required. This involves clinical examination (such as the metallic sound heard on percussion) and radiographic examination (such as X-rays, showing fusion between the tooth and the alveolar bone).73 This assessment helps to determine the mobility of the tooth and the feasibility of orthodontic treatment.66\nConsidering the limitations of tooth movement\nIn cases of dental ankylosis, orthodontic movement of the tooth will be limited. The tooth may be difficult to move using traditional orthodontic methods, as the fusion of the ankylosed tooth with the alveolar bone hinders the normal remodeling process of the periodontal bone.66\nExploring alternative treatment methods\nIn some cases, alternative treatment methods, such as surgical procedures (like surgical luxation or distraction osteogenesis) to break the fusion between the tooth and the alveolar bone, may need to be considered to allow tooth movement. These methods can be more complex and require precise planning and execution.66\nConsiderations of esthetics and function\nIn designing orthodontic treatment plans, special attention should be given to esthetic and functional requirements. For ankylosed teeth, it may be necessary to consider the movement of other teeth to improve the overall dental alignment and occlusion, while maintaining or enhancing esthetics.74,75\nLong-term monitoring and management\nOrthodontic treatment of ankylosed teeth requires long-term monitoring and management. Periodic radiographic assessments and clinical examinations may be needed during treatment to monitor the progress of tooth movement and the health of the teeth.66\nInstructions for patients and parents\nFor children and adolescent patients, it is crucial to explain the nature of dental ankylosis, the challenges of treatment, and the expected outcomes to patients and their parents. Ensuring that they understand the treatment process, potential complexities, and possible outcomes helps establish appropriate expectations and a collaborative relationship.66\nOther factors\nIn orthodontic treatment planning for teeth re-implanted after dislocation, besides considering root movement, root resorption, and dental ankylosis, the following key aspects should be meticulously considered:\nBiological recovery of the tooth\nRe-implanted teeth may require a period of biological recovery and stabilization. Before initiating orthodontic treatment, it is crucial to ensure that the periodontal environment of the tooth has sufficiently healed and the health of the pulp has been confirmed.76\nAssessment of tooth stability\nThe stability of reimplanted teeth needs to be evaluated. If the tooth is not adequately stable in its socket, a longer period may be required for stabilization, or auxiliary fixation methods might be considered to provide additional support.76\nSensitivity testing of the tooth\nReimplanted teeth may be more sensitive to temperature or pressure. This increased sensitivity needs to be considered in the treatment plan to avoid unnecessary discomfort or pain during orthodontic treatment.76\nConsideration of tooth position and adjacent teeth\nThe position of reimplanted teeth and their occlusal relationship with adjacent teeth might differ. When designing orthodontic plans, the alignment and positional relationships of the entire dental arch, and how to effectively incorporate the reimplanted tooth, should be considered.65\nConsideration of tooth position and adjacent teeth\nThe position of reimplanted teeth and their occlusal relationship with adjacent teeth might differ. When designing orthodontic plans, the alignment and positional relationships of the entire dental arch, and how to effectively incorporate the reimplanted tooth, should be considered.77\nRegular monitoring and adjustments\nThroughout the orthodontic treatment process, regular monitoring of the tooth\u2019s response and progress is needed, with timely adjustments to the treatment plan based on the tooth\u2019s movement and reactions.77\nOrthodontic treatment of teeth with dislocation injuries involves not only considerations of physical tooth movement but also a comprehensive assessment of the tooth\u2019s biological response, the health of surrounding tissues, and potential risks. These considerations together form the basis for effective, safe, and successful orthodontic treatment of patients.\nConclusion and expectation\nThe incidence of tooth luxation and avulsion is still high worldwide, and about one-third of the world's population has suffered TDIs.2 The traumatic injuries cause pain and uncomfortable, bring economic burdens, compromise quality of life, and generate trauma-related dental anxiety.2 Therefore, timely and proper clinical management would benefit the prognosis of the traumatic tooth, and this is the secondary prevention, the goal of which is to minimize complications and promote healing. On the other hand, preventing the occurrence of TDIs, known as primary prevention, by wearing a mouthguard and other protective equipment would be another goal of TDI prevention. Patients and physicians can also refer to the ToothSOS App, which was developed by the IADT, for emergency management guidelines. Future studies could focus on pulp regeneration techniques, methods of ankylosis prevention, orthodontic treatment of a traumatic tooth, propaganda of public awareness of TDI prevention, and first-aid procedures.\nReferences\nPatnana, A.

      "text": "Scaling and Root Planing: Why This Deep Cleaning Is Vital for Gum Health\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- SRP is the frontline treatment for periodontitis and involves removing plaque below the gumline.\n- It significantly reduces inflammation, bleeding, and bacterial infection in the gums.\n- Adjunctive antibiotics may improve results, but their use requires caution.\n- Probiotics show promise as a complement to SRP, though more research is needed.\n- Long-term success depends on excellent home care and ongoing dental maintenance.\nGum disease often flies under the radar\u2014quietly progressing until tooth loss or bone damage becomes a real threat. Fortunately, one of dentistry\u2019s most trusted solutions, scaling and root planing (SRP), offers a powerful way to stop this process in its tracks. As a non-surgical yet highly effective treatment for chronic periodontitis, SRP plays a critical role in preserving gum health, reducing inflammation, and preventing long-term oral complications.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Scaling and Root Planing?\n- Why It Matters: The Clinical Importance of SRP\n- Adjunctive Therapies: Antibiotics and Probiotics\n- Post-Treatment Expectations\n- Limitations and Maintenance\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat Is Scaling and Root Planing?\nScaling and root planing is essentially a deep cleaning\u2014but far more precise and targeted than your standard dental hygiene visit. This two-part procedure focuses on clearing out harmful bacteria and smoothing tooth roots to help gums reattach properly.\n- Scaling is the first step. Using specialized tools, your dentist or hygienist removes plaque and hardened tartar (calculus) from both the visible tooth surface and beneath the gumline. This eliminates the biofilm that fuels inflammation.\n- Root planing follows. This involves gently smoothing the root surfaces of the teeth, which not only makes it harder for plaque to cling again but also encourages the gums to heal and reattach more firmly to the teeth.\nSince this procedure works below the gumline, it\u2019s usually done under local anesthesia for comfort and may take more than one appointment, depending on how advanced the disease is.\nAccording to a 2021 Journal of Periodontology study, SRP effectively disrupts subgingival biofilm and removes calculus\u2014both of which are linked to the progression of periodontal disease [4].\nWhy It Matters: The Clinical Importance of SRP\nScaling and root planing remains the frontline therapy for managing periodontitis for good reason. It\u2019s one of the most studied and trusted treatments in periodontics, and it tackles the source of the problem\u2014not just the symptoms.\nSRP has been shown to:\n- Reduce gum inflammation\n- Improve clinical attachment (how well the gum connects to the tooth)\n- Decrease bacterial load\n- Shrink periodontal pocket depths\n- Slow or stop bone loss\nA landmark 2004 clinical trial found that SRP combined with systemic metronidazole and ongoing plaque removal led to significantly better outcomes than SRP alone [5]. It\u2019s also worth noting that the microbial profile in the mouth shifts toward a healthier balance after treatment [6].\nAdjunctive Therapies: Antibiotics and Probiotics\nAntibiotics\nIn some moderate-to-severe cases, dentists may prescribe adjunctive antibiotics to boost the effect of SRP. These can be local (applied directly to the gum pocket) or systemic (taken by mouth), including options like tetracycline, minocycline, or metronidazole.\nWhile these drugs can enhance results, the improvements are generally modest. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes their role in select cases but emphasizes caution due to the growing concern over antibiotic resistance [1].\nProbiotics\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Emerging studies suggest that probiotics\u2014beneficial bacteria found in some supplements and yogurts\u2014might support periodontal healing when paired with SRP. They may help reduce pocket depth and support a healthier microbial environment in the mouth [2] [3]. That said, more long-term clinical studies are needed before probiotics become a routine recommendation.\nPost-Treatment Expectations\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to have some minor side effects after scaling and root planing. These might include:\n- Tender gums or mild soreness\n- Minor bleeding for a day or two\n- Temporary sensitivity to hot or cold\nMost of these symptoms are short-lived and manageable. Patients often find relief with:\n- Ibuprofen (400\u2013600mg every 6\u20138 hours)\n- Warm salt water rinses (\u00bd teaspoon of salt in 8 oz of warm water)\nA 2024 review in Clinical Microbiology and Infection confirms that SRP substantially reduces the bacterial colonies behind periodontitis and creates an environment where healing can begin [1].\nLimitations and Maintenance\nWhile SRP is highly effective, it isn\u2019t a permanent fix unless it\u2019s supported by good long-term care. That means:\n- Brushing twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush\n- Flossing daily or using interdental brushes\n- Attending routine cleanings every 3\u20134 months\n- Avoiding tobacco use, which worsens periodontal outcomes\nStudies show that without consistent maintenance, the gums can become reinfected, and pocket depths may return over time [6].\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that researchers have found an increase in antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and metal-resistant genes (MRGs) in dental plaque following SRP, which further supports the cautious use of antibiotics [7].\nClosing Thoughts\nScaling and root planing isn\u2019t just a deep clean\u2014it\u2019s a critical intervention that helps reverse the damage of gum disease before it becomes irreversible. It reduces inflammation, removes infection-causing bacteria, and gives your gums a chance to heal.\nWhen paired with proper home care and follow-ups, SRP gives patients the best shot at keeping their natural teeth and protecting their overall health. In fact, gum health has even been linked to systemic conditions like heart disease and diabetes\u2014making SRP a smart investment not just in your smile, but in your total well-being.\nReferences\n[1] Moja, L., Zanichelli, V., Mertz, D., Gandra, S., Cappello, B., Cooke, G.

      "text": "Halitosis (Bad Breath) Explained: Causes, Treatments, and What Works\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Tongue coating and gum disease are major causes of halitosis.\n- Regular tongue scraping and professional cleanings are frontline treatments.\n- Probiotics and antimicrobial rinses may help rebalance the oral microbiome.\n- Most evidence supports a combination of mechanical and chemical approaches.\n- Persistent halitosis may indicate systemic issues and warrant a medical referral.\nHalitosis\u2014bad breath\u2014isn\u2019t just a minor inconvenience. Halitosis is the medical term for bad breath. For many, it\u2019s a real social and emotional issue, leading to embarrassment, anxiety or avoidance of personal interactions. Chronic bad breath can impact quality of life. While occasional bad breath is normal, persistent halitosis may indicate deeper oral or systemic health issues and could be a sign of an underlying medical condition. But knowing the causes and staying up to date on science-backed treatments can make a big difference.\nTable of Contents\n- Understanding the Causes of Halitosis\n- Effective Management Strategies\n- Evidence-Based Interventions\n- The Role of the Microbiome\n- Education and Public Awareness\n- What Doesn\u2019t Help\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nUnderstanding the Causes of Halitosis\nBad breath can come from many sources but most are tied to the mouth. The most common culprits are bacteria on the tongue, gum disease, dry mouth and food particles decomposing. The main causes of bad breath or oral halitosis are coated tongue, tooth decay, periodontal disease and oral infections all of which are major oral health issues that contribute to bad odor and persistent mouth odor. According to a 2023 narrative review in Cureus tongue coating and periodontal issues are at the top of the list [3].\nSimilarly a study in Monographs in Oral Science says oral biofilms especially on the surface of the tongue are among the leading causes [9]. These biofilms are sticky layers of bacteria that release foul smelling gases like volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) during digestion of proteins in the mouth. A coated tongue is made up of dead cells and bacteria which can produce bad odor. Bacterial growth in these biofilms produces bad odor and persistent mouth odor.Factors like smoking, poor hydration or medications that reduce saliva flow can make the condition worse by drying out the mouth and allowing odor causing bacteria to thrive.\nWhen oral hygiene is not maintained food particles remain in the mouth and bacteria grows. Certain foods like garlic and onions can also cause bad breath as their compounds are absorbed into the bloodstream and affect breath until eliminated from the body. Systemic causes like postnasal drip, tonsil stones and dental caries are other oral health issues that can contribute to halitosis. When bacteria breaks down proteins in the mouth they interact with amino acids in food to produce volatile sulfur compounds further contributing to bad odor. Tooth decay and periodontal disease are major contributors to oral halitosis and chronic bad breath [4].\nEffective Management Strategies\nTreating halitosis starts with identifying its cause. In most cases improved oral hygiene goes a long way. Practicing good oral hygiene and regular brushing is key to preventing halitosis as these habits remove food particles and bacteria that cause bad breath.\nMechanical cleaning is the gold standard. A 2005 review in the South African Dental Association Journal recommends routine brushing and flossing and daily tongue scraping to physically remove odor causing bacteria [1]. Tongue scraping is an essential part of good oral hygiene as it removes bacteria and debris from the surface of the tongue.\nAfter brushing and flossing using mouthwash can help achieve a comprehensive mouth clean by reaching areas the brush may miss and make sure the whole mouth is fresh and germ free.\nProfessional treatment especially for those with gum disease is also important. Dentists will examine the whole mouth to identify all possible causes of halitosis. Deep cleaning procedures like scaling and root planing where tartar is removed from below the gumline can reduce bacterial load as mentioned in a 2013 review in the Journal of Natural Science, Biology, and Medicine [2].\nAntimicrobial and probiotic therapies are gaining ground. Recent studies in Clinical Oral Investigations show promise for antimicrobial rinses and probiotics that can rebalance the mouth\u2019s microbial environment [6]. These can reduce VSC producing bacteria and promote healthier strains.If halitosis persists after these interventions it\u2019s time to look beyond the mouth. Consult a primary care physician or primary healthcare provider to investigate underlying causes if dental interventions are not effective [7].\nAs Brazilian Oral Research says, gastrointestinal issues, sinus infections and even certain metabolic disorders can also be the cause. Halitosis is best treated by addressing the underlying cause whether it\u2019s oral or systemic. For those with dry mouth it\u2019s important to ensure there is enough saliva to maintain oral health. If natural saliva production is insufficient, artificial saliva can be used to keep the mouth moist and reduce the risk of halitosis.\nEvidence-Based Interventions\nWhat actually works? The 2019 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews is one of the most comprehensive reviews to date [5]. These interventions are primarily aimed at reducing halitosis or bad breath.\nHere\u2019s what the evidence says:\n- Mouth rinses and chewing gum may help temporarily especially those with chlorhexidine or zinc.\n- Systemic deodorizing agents like internal chlorophyll supplements offer moderate benefits.\n- Combination therapies like using a specialized toothpaste with a mouthwash are more effective than single interventions.\nDrinking coffee can worsen breath odor and may reduce the effectiveness of some treatments.\nHowever the review notes many of these studies have small sample sizes and varied designs. Bacterial proliferation often due to underlying conditions like dry mouth or infections can also reduce the effectiveness of some interventions. So while the results are encouraging the overall certainty is still low to very low.\nThe Role of the Microbiome\nOne of the most exciting developments in recent years is the focus on the oral microbiome\u2014the unique balance of bacteria in each person\u2019s mouth.\nA 2023 review in Clinical Oral Investigations highlights the connection between microbial imbalance and halitosis especially the role of anaerobic bacteria that thrive in low-oxygen environments like the back of the tongue [6]. These bacteria break down proteins into VSCs which produce the characteristic rotten egg or sulfur smell.Managing this bacterial ecosystem through diet, oral hygiene and targeted treatments may be the key to long term halitosis control.\nEating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables can support oral health by stimulating saliva production and maintaining a balanced oral microbiome. Eating healthy foods not only keeps the mouth moist but also reduces the risk of bad breath. Certain health conditions like sinus infections, diabetes, liver and kidney disease can also disrupt the oral microbiome and cause halitosis.\nEducation and Public Awareness\nDespite the prevalence of bad breath it\u2019s still widely misunderstood and under-discussed. That\u2019s where dental professionals come in\u2014not just to treat but to educate.\nAccording to a 2014 literature review in Oral Health & Preventive Dentistry many patients are unaware of tongue cleaning or the importance of mouth rinsing in managing odor [7]. Similarly a 2020 article in the Australian Dental Journal calls for standardized screening and diagnostic tools to help dental teams identify and address halitosis early [8].\nDentists are in a prime position to normalize these conversations and guide patients towards effective solutions.\nWhat Doesn\u2019t Help\nNot all research related to halitosis is clinically useful. For example a 2010 article on acidosis, hypoxia and bone health was reviewed but found irrelevant to the management of halitosis [10]. This highlights the importance of relying on targeted evidence-based sources when developing treatment plans.\nClosing Thoughts\nHalitosis is more than just a nuisance\u2014it\u2019s a multifactorial condition that deserves thoughtful evaluation and care. With proper hygiene, targeted therapies and guidance from dental professionals most cases can be managed or eliminated. While the science is still evolving the current evidence offers a clear roadmap for helping patients breathe a little easier\u2014both literally and socially.\nReferences\n[1] Feller, L., & Blignaut, E.

      "text": "What That Jaw Clicking Means: Causes and Relief for TMJ Disorders\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- TMJ disorders affect the joint that connects the jaw to the skull, causing pain, clicking, or jaw locking.\n- Common causes include bruxism, arthritis, trauma, and stress-related muscle tension.\n- Early diagnosis includes physical exams and sometimes MRI or X-ray imaging.\n- Home care like night guards, ice packs, and soft diets often help mild symptoms.\n- Advanced treatment options include physical therapy, medication, injections, and surgery in severe cases.\nJaw pain or that annoying clicking sound when you open your mouth might seem minor at first\u2014but they could be signs of a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. The TMJ acts like a sliding hinge, connecting your jawbone to your skull and allowing you to talk, chew, and yawn comfortably. When it\u2019s not functioning properly, even simple movements can become painful or feel out of sync. TMJ disorders (TMD) affect millions of people and often go undiagnosed or untreated for too long. Let\u2019s walk through what causes these symptoms, how they\u2019re diagnosed, and the wide range of treatment options available\u2014from simple home care to specialized medical interventions.\nTable of Contents\n- Common Causes of Jaw Pain and Clicking\n- Diagnosis and When to See a Doctor\n- At-Home Treatments for Mild TMJ Symptoms\n- Medical Treatment Options\n- TMJ and Systemic Conditions\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nCommon Causes of Jaw Pain and Clicking\nTMJ disorders are often the result of a combination of physical stressors and underlying health conditions. They don\u2019t always stem from one cause, but several common culprits include:\n- Teeth grinding (bruxism): Often done unconsciously during sleep or stress, grinding wears down teeth and puts extra strain on the jaw joint.\n- Jaw clenching: Like grinding, this builds tension in the surrounding muscles.\n- Poor bite alignment: Misaligned teeth or jaw structures can throw off the balance of the TMJ.\n- Injury or trauma: A hit to the jaw or face can directly affect joint function.\n- Arthritis: Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can damage the joint\u2019s cartilage.\n- Stress and tension: Emotional stress often shows up physically, especially in the jaw muscles.\nThe \u201cclick\u201d or \u201cpop\u201d you hear is typically due to the cartilage disc within the joint shifting out of place. In more severe cases, pain can radiate into the ears, temples, or neck, and may be accompanied by tinnitus (ringing in the ears), headaches, or dizziness [1] [2] [9] [10].\nDiagnosis and When to See a Doctor\nIf jaw pain or clicking doesn\u2019t go away on its own, it\u2019s worth getting evaluated. Dentists and medical professionals often start with a detailed history and physical exam. You may be asked about:\n- Pain patterns (e.g., when it occurs, how intense)\n- Habits like clenching or gum chewing\n- History of trauma or arthritis\n- Associated symptoms like earaches or difficulty chewing [6]\nIn certain cases, advanced imaging like MRI (to visualize the soft tissue disc) or panoramic dental X-rays may be used to spot structural issues or rule out other causes of facial pain [4] [5] [10]..\nSee a provider if you experience:\n- Persistent jaw pain lasting more than two weeks [7]\n- Difficulty eating, speaking, or opening your mouth fully\n- A locked jaw\n- Radiating pain into the head, ears, or neck\nEarly diagnosis can help avoid long-term complications and allow for more conservative treatment options.\nAt-Home Treatments for Mild TMJ Symptoms\nMild TMJ symptoms often improve with a few adjustments to daily habits and some simple self-care:\n- Over-the-counter medications: NSAIDs like ibuprofen (400\u2013600 mg every 6\u20138 hours) or acetaminophen (500\u20131000 mg every 6 hours) help reduce inflammation and pain.\n- Cold compresses: Applying ice packs to the side of the face for 10 minutes at a time helps relieve muscle tightness.\n- Soft diet: Eating mashed, cooked, or blended foods reduces jaw strain.\n- Jaw rest: Avoid wide yawning, chewing gum, or biting into hard foods.\n- Relaxation techniques: Try guided breathing, meditation, or gentle jaw stretches.\n- Night guards: If bruxism is suspected, a custom night guard from your dentist can reduce grinding and cushion the joint [1] [2] [10].\nThink of these methods as giving your jaw a \u201crest day\u201d\u2014just like you would for sore muscles after a workout.\nMedical Treatment Options\nWhen home remedies aren\u2019t cutting it, your dentist or physician may suggest additional therapies. The goal is to address both the symptoms and their underlying cause:\nNonpharmacologic Therapies\n- Patient education: Learning about proper jaw posture and behavior modification is surprisingly powerful.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Especially useful if stress or anxiety contributes to jaw tension.\n- Physical therapy: Includes jaw mobility exercises, soft tissue massage, and posture training.\nMedications\n- Anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants: Short-term use of NSAIDs or medications like cyclobenzaprine can calm acute flare-ups.\n- Tricyclic antidepressants: Used at low doses for chronic TMJ pain.\n- Gabapentin: May be considered if nerve pain is suspected.\nAdvanced Interventions\n- Injections: Therapies like platelet-rich plasma (PRP), sodium hyaluronate, or dextrose prolotherapy have shown promise in improving joint mobility and reducing inflammation.\n- Surgery: Reserved for severe, unresponsive cases\u2014such as joint degeneration or persistent locking [8] [11].\nMultidisciplinary care involving dentists, physical therapists, and sometimes pain specialists offers the best outcomes for complex cases.\nTMJ and Systemic Conditions\nIn some individuals\u2014especially children and teens\u2014TMJ disorders are linked to broader health conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). In these situations, managing the underlying disease is just as important as treating the joint. A collaborative care team including dentists, rheumatologists, and physical therapists ensures that the jaw and overall health are addressed simultaneously [3].\nClosing Thoughts\nJaw pain and clicking sounds are more than just an annoyance\u2014they can be signs of an underlying TMJ disorder that deserves attention. Whether it\u2019s stress, arthritis, or nighttime grinding, getting to the root of the problem helps guide the right treatment path. For most people, conservative care brings significant relief. And for those with chronic or severe symptoms, a team-based approach combining physical therapy, medication, and dental care can make a lasting difference. If your jaw isn\u2019t moving the way it should, don\u2019t ignore it\u2014talk to your dentist and start exploring your options today.\nReferences\n[1] Busse, J.

Children are commonly reported group due to frequent sports activities, trauma, accidents and falls. Prompt emergency management is vital for long term success and to avoid morbidity. The study was aimed to assess the understanding of intern dentists about the emergency handling of avulsed teeth cases as mostly they are first responders among health care personnel. In this study a fourteen-item questionnaire with predefined responses was shared as online Google survey form with intern dentists of 5 different dental teaching hospitals of Islamabad, Pakistan. The duration of the study was 6 months (01 March 2022 to 31 August 2022). The questions were intended to collect personal information and to check level of knowledge and awareness about the management of avulsed tooth among the dental interns. The data was analyzed by statistical methods and is presented through tables and descriptive methods. In total, 152 participants completed the shared questionnaire. The vast majority (71%) of them were aware of the initial management of avulsed teeth, 49% were aware of the ideal transport medium for an avulsed tooth, (43%) were aware of the critical time for successful replantation, while (62%) had knowledge of the multiple factors responsible for the outcome of the tooth replantation. For majority of the statements, female participants had better knowledge as compared to their male counterparts. Statistically significant difference was noted for the statement \u201cIf you found the knocked-out tooth and it is dirty what will be your initial approach?\u201d with female participants having better knowledge as compared to the male (p value = 0.005). Based on our study results, generally dental interns are well-informed but still lack expected level of awareness regarding the proper management protocol for avulsed tooth. Hence, improvement is needed regarding the effective handling of avulsed teeth cases.\nDental trauma; Emergencies; Tooth avulsion; Tooth injuries\nRizwan Qureshi,Azhar Iqbal,Sunitha Siddanna,Ujala Siddeeq,Farah Mushtaq,Bilal Arjumand,Osama Khattak,Saqib Sarfarz,Naif Abdulrahman Naif Aljunaydi,Abdulrahman Muharrab Mohammed Alkhaldi,Mosa Altassan,Esraa Ahmed Attar,Rakhi Issrani,Namdeo Prabhu.

Resorption, ankylosis and tooth loss could be minimized.\nINTRODUCTION\nAvulsion is a traumatic displacement of the tooth from its socket. It is an accident, representing 0.5% to 3% of traumatic injuries [1] in permanent dentition, mostly affecting children between seven and nine years of age [2]. An adequate management within the first half hour is most important for the prognosis of the tooth. Different medical storage media have been reported to be effective in maintaining [3] the periodontal ligament (PDL) cells in a viable state after avulsion, but milk remains one of the most commonly used and recommended storage media [4]. Its main advantages are high availability, a physiologically compatible pH and osmolality with the PDL cells. Depending on the injury to the PDL these replanted teeth often develop surrounding inflammation followed by severe resorption ending up in ankylosis [5]. Ankylosis affects alveolar bone development in younger patients [6]. A great resource of help for dentists in decision-making and choosing treatment procedures is the Dental Trauma Guide (www.dentaltraumaguide.org) [7]. Within this tool Andreasen also provides a prognosis for each form of trauma based on the analysis of innumerous cases. Meanwhile, there is some evidence-based literature that makes it favorable to modify some of these procedures regarding preparation of the root surface, timing of root canal treatment and systemic medication. A lot of research has been performed during the last years and guidelines for the management of avulsions have been published [8, 9]. Reviewing this literature it is possible to identify the best treatment procedure for every tooth, but the information is spread over journals and books of different disciplines in dentistry (endodontic, periodontal, orthodontic, pedodontic or surgical publications). For daily practice, it would be helpful to have structured recommendations for treatment protocols under different initial conditions (dry time, age, growth, tooth, hard and soft tissues) relying on existing evidence-based therapy concepts. The first goal of avulsion treatment is to keep the tooth vital or at least functional in place avoiding resorption and ankylosis resulting in normal growth of the alveolar ridge. If this cannot be achieved it is of utmost importance to prevent the alveolar bone from collapsing due to tooth loss. Alveolar bone structure is necessary for the the placement of an implant after completion of alveolar bone development up to the age of 21 or even later.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTextmining\nThe complete Medline/PubMed data was screened for articles about dental avulsion. Specific keywords were used to retrieve about 200 articles. Ten additional records were identified through other sources (books, articles not indexed in PubMed). The abstracts of those records were screened and 130 were excluded due to evidence-based criteria. About 80 full-text articles were included in the synthesis and divided into groups: Endodontics, Periodontics, Orthodontics, Surgery, Therapy and Reviews (Fig. 1). Specialists in the different disciplines read the articles and met weekly to find a consensus for each problem.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor easy understanding and fast access a flow chart was developed comprising a synthesis of the evidence-based literature about tooth avulsion. Fig. (2) summarizes the conclusions from the analysis of the literature and offers guidance in determining the optimal treatment concept for any form of tooth avulsion.\nInitial treatment\nFor the initial treatment it is important to get information about the dry time of the avulsed tooth, because cells of the periodontal ligament (PDL) are irreversibly damaged after 30-60 minutes [8, 10, 11]. Damaged PDL cells lead to fast inflammatory resorption accompanied by ankylosis and a negative influence on alveolar bone growth [6].\nDry time < 30min\nIf the tooth\u2019 dry time was under 30 minutes, it is likely that PDL cells have survived and will regenerate [8, 10, 11]. To minimize the risk of inflammatory or replacement resorption an anti-resorption therapy should be performed. This procedure aims onto defending against inflammation caused by bacterial contamination and/or necrotic cells and tissues. Different regimen have been described using antibiotics The anti-resorptive therapy consists of soaking the tooth into a storage media enriched with 800 \u00b5g doxycyline (50 \u00b5m/ml) and 640 \u00b5g dexamethasone (40 \u00b5m/ml) for 20 minutes [12, 13]. That time can be used to inspect and clean the alveolus with 0.9% physiologic saline solution. Afterwards, the tooth is replanted and splinted with a semi-rigid device for instance with a titanium trauma splint (TTS) for 10 days. Additionally the patient is prescribed doxycycline for 5 days. Children under 50 kg receive 100 mg as an initial dose on the first day and 50 mg on the following days [12]. Intolerances are rare, but if present, amoxicillin is a good alternative. Doxycycline leads to no or little tooth discolorations [14].\nAfter removal of the splint, the mobility of the tooth is tested and a vitality test is performed. The assessment of the vitality of traumatized teeth in younger patients is very challenging, due to the lack of reliability on the reaction of the children. Moreover, ice spray or solid CO2 snow are poorly reproducible during the first weeks after trauma, while electric pulp testing or pulse oximetry are more reliable over longer periods [15-17].\nPositive Vitality Test\nA radiograph should be taken with an individualized holder (Fig. 3) which helps to obtain comparable x-rays from the same angle in subsequent follow-ups. After one, three and six months a new x-ray is taken for early recognition of any signs of resorption. If there is no resorption, a recall examination including x-ray should be performed every year. If there are signs of resorption, a root canal treatment (RCT) might stop the inflammatory process [18]. Further treatment follows the procedure for the negative vitality test.\nNegative Vitality Test\nIf the vitality test is negative after 10 days, there is no chance for revascularisation and RCT has to be performed. To prevent resorption it is important to facilitate diffusion through the dentine by removing the smear layer in the root canal with EDTA irrigation and to put in Ledermix as an intermediate dressing twice for 7 days each time [19, 20]. The root filling should be performed with a dental microscope to insert the MTA apically [21-23]. The backfill of the remaining root canal can be done with gutta-percha. Radiographs should be performed with an individualized holder. After one, three and six months a new x-ray is taken to recognize signs of resorption.\nDry Time > 30min\nFor extraoral dry times over 30 minutes, it is certain that most PDL cells on the root surface are necrotic and resorptions are to be expected [24]. If possible, an orthodontist should be consulted regarding the expected alveolar bone growth, because there are inter-individual differences in age and growth with the poorest prognosis in children with mature teeth before pubertal spurt [6, 25]. These results suggest that replanting these teeth should be regarded as a temporary solution to preserve bone to gain time for a later prosthetic rehabilitation.\nApical Foramen > 1.3mm\nFor younger patients (<9 years) with wide apical openings (>1.3mm) an attempt should be made to preserve the tooth. To slow down the resorption process, the root surface is treated with 2% sodium fluoride for twenty minutes after mechanical cleaning [26]. The procedure according to teeth with dry time < 30 minutes and negative vitality test follows. The root canal treatment should be performed within one week after replantation with Ledermix as intermediate dressing, as it was found to result in significant less loss in root mass due to resorption [27, 28].\nApical Foramen < 1.3mm\nA tooth with a dry time over 30 minutes and a closed apex has a very poor prognosis, mainly resulting in ankylosis and infra-position due to ongoing skeletal growth. Therefore these teeth cannot be expected to be preserved. The root canal preparation is performed extraorally with Gates-Glidden burs 5-6 (ISO 130-150) and the root surface is treated with 2% sodium fluoride for five minutes to retard resorption. A decoronation is followed by coverage of the remnant root with a flap [29, 30].\nTooth not Found/ not to Replant/ Severe Periodontal Conditions\nIf the tooth is lost or not to replant due to complicated fracture or if there are poor periodontal conditions, the focus is laid on socket preservation with collagen and/or a biphasic alloplastic slow resorbable bone substitute and a collagen membrane for alveolar ridge preservation [31]. Implant therapy in children and adolescents may influence maxillary and mandibular skeletal and dental growth [32] and should be postponed until the completion of alveolar bone growth. An orthodontist should be consulted to assess the alveolar bone growth and discuss treatment options [33, 34]. Autotransplantation of premolars is also described as a successful treatment option after tooth loss [35].\nCONCLUSION\nWith the help of the flow chart, clinicians can choose evidence-based treatment procedures quickly and easily. Antiresorptive therapy methods are essential for therapy of the avulsed tooth to avoid/minimize growth retardation of the alveolar ridge. The clinician has a structured directory and pathway by which to validate the chances of success using the considered treatment regimen.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors confirm that this article content has no conflict of interest.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Anna-Katharina Gieren, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, for discussing about periodontal aspects after tooth avulsion."

      "text": "What to Expect During a Dental Extraction: Anxiety, Risks, and Recovery Tips\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- The primary reasons for tooth extraction in adults are severe dental caries and periodontal disease.\n- Studies show an 11% complication rate after extractions, with higher risks for smokers and patients with diabetes or hypertension.\n- For managing post-extraction pain, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) are proven to be more effective than opioids.\n- Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), derived from a patient\u2019s own blood, can significantly improve healing and reduce the risk of dry socket.\n- In children, socioeconomic factors like family economic hardship are strongly linked to the need for dental extractions under general anesthesia.\nTable of Contents\nExpectations\nOne in nine. That\u2019s roughly the chance of something going wrong after a tooth gets pulled [2]. That number\u2014about 11%\u2014comes from a 2025 hospital study, and it hangs in the air. For a procedure dentists do every single day, something so routine it\u2019s practically muscle memory, that isn\u2019t a trivial figure. It\u2019s a quiet reminder that pulling a tooth isn\u2019t a simple fix. It\u2019s an amputation. The end of a long, losing battle against disease. And for the person in the chair, it\u2019s never routine. It\u2019s the procedure they dread the most, tangled up in old stories about pain and a deep-seated fear of the dentist\u2019s chair [1].\nSo why does it come to this? The reasons are brutally consistent. It\u2019s almost always one of two things: runaway decay that\u2019s eaten the tooth from the inside out, or advanced gum disease that\u2019s destroyed the bone holding it in place [4] [8]. That gum disease, periodontitis, is a slow-motion disaster. The gums get angry, they pull back, and the tooth\u2019s foundation just crumbles. Some people seem to get a worse deal. Smokers. Men. They tend to lose more teeth [4]. It all points back to the same, frustrating truth. An extraction is a sign that prevention failed. That small problems were ignored until they became big, irreversible ones.\nThen comes the healing. Or the lack of it. The complication everyone\u2019s heard of is the dry socket. It\u2019s when the essential blood clot in the socket disappears, leaving raw bone and nerves exposed to the air. It\u2019s agony. But other things can go wrong, too. Bleeding that won\u2019t stop. Nerve damage [3]. The risk for all this isn\u2019t the same for everyone. It\u2019s higher if you smoke. It\u2019s higher if you have uncontrolled diabetes or high blood pressure [2]. The body is a connected system. A mouth isn\u2019t separate from the rest of it. An extraction isn\u2019t just a mechanical act; it\u2019s a biological event. A trauma. And sometimes, the body has trouble cleaning up the mess.\nSmarter Fixes for Pain and Healing\nFor the longest time, the playbook for pain was simple. Big procedure, big pain. That meant opioids. It seemed logical. But we were wrong. A huge 2023 review of studies blew that thinking up, confirming what a lot of us saw in practice: simple, over-the-counter NSAIDs\u2014think ibuprofen\u2014are better at controlling acute dental pain [9]. An NSAID combined with acetaminophen works better than an opioid. Better. And it doesn\u2019t bring along the baggage of addiction and heavy side effects. It\u2019s a massive course correction. With kids, the fix is even smarter. Give them pain medicine before you even start the procedure [5]. It heads the pain off at the pass. Simple. Effective.\nThat same spirit of \u201clet\u2019s work smarter, not harder\u201d is changing how we approach healing itself. The new tool here is platelet-rich fibrin, or PRF. It sounds high-tech, but it\u2019s beautifully simple. You take a little of the patient\u2019s own blood, spin it in a centrifuge for a few minutes, and you get this jello-like blob of concentrated healing goo. It\u2019s packed with the patient\u2019s own growth factors. You place that right in the empty socket. It\u2019s like giving the construction crew a perfect blueprint and all the best materials right at the start of the job.\nAnd it works. A 2025 analysis showed PRF makes the gums heal faster and\u2014this is the big one\u2014it seriously cuts the risk of getting a dry socket [7]. It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s just smart biology. Using the body\u2019s own engine to prevent the most common and painful complication. It\u2019s a long way from the old days of just packing the hole with gauze and hoping for the best.\nThe Tooth Is Just the Beginning of the Story\nThe whole equation gets turned on its head when the patient is a little kid. You have a diseased baby tooth. Do you pull it, or do you try to save it with what\u2019s basically a baby root canal, a pulpectomy? The decision used to be about mechanics. Can it be saved? What\u2019s the cost? But that\u2019s the wrong way to look at it. A 2025 review\u2014even though it was based on just a couple of studies\u2014found something important. The kids who had the tooth-saving procedure had less anxiety. A better quality of life [6].\nThink about that. You\u2019re not just fixing a tooth; you\u2019re shaping a future adult\u2019s entire attitude toward their own health. One bad, scary extraction can create a lifetime of dental fear. Saving that tooth, even a baby tooth that will fall out anyway, can mean the difference between a kid who\u2019s okay with the dentist and an adult who avoids checkups for a decade. The tooth itself is temporary. The experience is permanent.\nThis is where you have to zoom out. Way out. And you see the problem isn\u2019t in the mouth at all. Why are some kids, often very young ones, having teeth pulled under general anesthesia in a hospital? A 2025 study from the UK connected the dots, and they don\u2019t lead to the candy aisle [10]. They lead to a family\u2019s front door. Kids were more likely to be in that operating room if their family was struggling with money. If a parent was using drugs. If another adult at home had a chronic illness. Suddenly, a child\u2019s cavity stops being about sugar and starts being about poverty. About stress. About a system that\u2019s failing them long before they ever sit in a dental chair. And you can\u2019t fix that with a pair of forceps.\nReferences\n[1] Astramskait\u0117, I., Po\u0161kevi\u010dius, L., & Juod\u017ebalys, G. (2016).

      "text": "Do You Grind Your Teeth? A Guide to Understanding and Managing Bruxism\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Bruxism is a multifactorial condition, often caused by a combination of stress, anxiety, sleep disorders, and other physiological factors.\n- Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical exams, patient self-reports, and, in some cases, instrumental tools like EMG monitors or sleep studies.\n- Occlusal splints (night guards) are a primary treatment; they protect teeth from damage but don\u2019t necessarily stop the grinding habit.\n- Botulinum toxin (Botox) is an effective second-line treatment for reducing muscle activity and pain in severe cases of bruxism.\n- Treatment for bruxism should be personalized and may require a collaborative approach involving dentists, sleep specialists, and psychologists.\nOf all the things that can happen to your teeth, some of the most significant damage can occur while you\u2019re not even thinking about it\u2014often while you\u2019re fast asleep. We\u2019re talking about bruxism, the medical term for grinding or clenching your teeth. It\u2019s a common condition affecting both kids and adults, and if it goes unmanaged, it can lead to some serious issues like chronic jaw pain, worn-down teeth, and persistent headaches.\nBruxism can happen during the day (awake bruxism) or, more commonly, at night (sleep bruxism). Understanding what causes it and how to manage it is key to protecting your smile. Thanks to a growing body of research, we have a clearer picture of this complex condition and the best ways to tackle it.\nTable of Contents\n- What Causes Teeth Grinding? It\u2019s More Complicated Than You Think\n- How Do We Know If You Have Bruxism? The Diagnostic Process\n- Finding Relief: Effective Treatments for Bruxism\n- Gaps in the Research: What We\u2019re Still Learning\n- Closing Thoughts\nWhat Causes Teeth Grinding? It\u2019s More Complicated Than You Think\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why you grind your teeth, the answer isn\u2019t a simple one. Most experts agree that bruxism is a multifactorial condition, meaning it\u2019s triggered by a combination of things rather than a single cause [2] [6]. Think of it as a puzzle with several pieces that come together.\nOne of the biggest culprits is psychosocial factors. Everyday stress, anxiety, and even certain personality traits can manifest physically through jaw clenching and teeth grinding [1]. It\u2019s your body\u2019s way of subconsciously dealing with tension. Another significant link is with sleep disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sometimes, grinding is part of an arousal response when breathing is interrupted during sleep. Certain medications and neurological conditions can also play a role.\nFor years, dentists wondered if a \u201cbad bite\u201d or misaligned teeth (occlusal factors) were to blame, but the latest thinking suggests their role is less significant than we once thought [6]. Instead, a biopsychosocial model is now widely accepted, which basically means that bruxism arises from a mix of biological, psychological, and social factors all interacting with each other [1] [7].\nHow Do We Know If You Have Bruxism? The Diagnostic Process\nDiagnosing bruxism can be tricky because many people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re doing it, especially if it happens during sleep. The process usually starts with a conversation and a thorough clinical exam. Your dentist might ask if you\u2019ve noticed jaw soreness, morning headaches, or if a partner has ever commented on grinding sounds at night [11].\nDuring the exam, we look for tell-tale signs like:\n- Tenderness or fatigue in the jaw muscles\n- Flattened or worn-down surfaces on your teeth\n- Tiny fractures in the enamel\nWhile self-reports and clinical signs are a great starting point, they don\u2019t paint the whole picture. For a more definitive diagnosis, we might use instrumental tools [4] [10]. Portable devices with electromyographic (EMG) sensors can be worn at home to measure jaw muscle activity during sleep. For the most complex cases, an overnight sleep study in a lab, called polysomnography, is considered the gold standard. However, because it\u2019s expensive and intensive, it\u2019s usually reserved for situations where a sleep disorder like apnea is also suspected [4]. This tiered approach allows us to match the diagnostic tools to the complexity of your situation.\nFinding Relief: Effective Treatments for Bruxism\nBecause bruxism has so many potential causes, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all cure. Treatment is focused on protecting your teeth from damage and reducing the grinding activity itself. Here are some of the most effective approaches.\nOcclusal Splints (Night Guards): Your First Line of Defense\nAn occlusal splint, or night guard, is one of the most common and effective treatments. It\u2019s a custom-fitted device made of a durable, comfortable material that you wear over your upper or lower teeth while you sleep. The splint acts as a protective barrier, absorbing the grinding forces and preventing your teeth from wearing against each other.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that a night guard is primarily a defensive tool\u2014it protects your teeth from damage, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the grinding habit itself [1] [9]. However, by preventing wear and tear, it can save you from needing extensive restorative dental work down the line. You can find more information about dental health at the American Dental Association (ADA) website.\nBotulinum Toxin (Botox): A Targeted Approach for Severe Cases\nYou might associate Botox with cosmetic treatments, but it has powerful therapeutic uses, too. For severe, chronic bruxism where muscle pain is a major issue, injections of Botulinum Toxin Type A can be incredibly effective [9]. When injected into the large jaw muscles (the masseters), Botox works by reducing their activity. This doesn\u2019t stop you from chewing or talking normally, but it does weaken the muscles just enough to lessen the force of involuntary grinding and clenching [8].\nThis approach is typically considered a second-line treatment for patients who haven\u2019t found relief with more conservative methods [7]. The effects are temporary, usually lasting a few months, but can provide significant pain relief.\nBehavioral and Psychological Strategies\nSince stress and anxiety are major drivers of bruxism, especially the awake kind, behavioral therapies can make a huge difference. Techniques like stress management, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and mindfulness help you become more aware of your clenching habits during the day and give you tools to manage the underlying stress [3]. Learning to recognize your triggers and consciously relax your jaw is a powerful, long-term strategy for breaking the cycle.\nPharmacologic Options: A Cautious Approach\nIn some cases, medications like muscle relaxants or anti-anxiety drugs may be prescribed for short-term use to manage acute symptoms. However, the evidence supporting their long-term effectiveness is limited, and they can have side effects [5]. For this reason, pharmacologic therapy isn\u2019t a routine solution and is typically reserved for specific situations under careful professional guidance.\nGaps in the Research: What We\u2019re Still Learning\nOur understanding of bruxism has come a long way, but there\u2019s still more to learn. Many reviews of the scientific literature point out that we need more high-quality, long-term studies, particularly randomized controlled trials that directly compare different treatments [5] [9] [10]. As it stands, the evidence is still evolving, and there isn\u2019t a universal, standardized protocol for diagnosis and management. This is why a personalized approach is so critical. For more on oral health statistics and research, the CDC\u2019s Oral Health Division is an excellent resource.\nClosing Thoughts\nBruxism is far more than just a bad habit\u2014it\u2019s a complex medical condition with real consequences for your oral and overall health. Because its causes are so varied, your treatment plan should be just as unique as you are. The best approach is often a combination of strategies, starting with protective measures like a night guard and incorporating behavioral techniques to address the root causes.\nEffective management often requires a team effort. Your dentist can work alongside sleep specialists, physical therapists, and psychologists to ensure you get the comprehensive care you need. By taking a proactive and personalized approach, you can manage bruxism, protect your smile, and find lasting relief.\nReferences\n[1] Vavrina, J., & Vavrina, J. (2020).

      "text": "How Is Gum Disease Treated? Your Guide to Periodontal Therapy\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) is the foundational non-surgical treatment for periodontitis.\n- The use of systemic and local antibiotics can offer moderate benefits but raises significant concerns about antibiotic resistance.\n- A 2021 study in mSphere found that periodontal treatment can increase antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in dental plaque.\n- Long-term success hinges on periodontal maintenance appointments every 3\u20134 months and diligent home care.\n- The connection between periodontitis and systemic diseases like diabetes and heart disease elevates the stakes of treatment.\nThere\u2019s a tension in modern periodontics that we don\u2019t talk about enough. A clinical paradox. We have our primary enemy in sight: a pathogenic biofilm that destroys the structures holding teeth in place. And we have our primary weapon: mechanical debridement. But when that\u2019s not enough, we reach for the big guns. Antibiotics. And here\u2019s the problem that keeps me up at night: the very tools we use to quell the infection might be breeding a more resilient, more dangerous monster for the future.\nA recent study in mSphere put a fine point on it [8]. Researchers looked at the dental plaque of patients before and after periodontal therapy\u2014specifically Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) combined with systemic antibiotics. What they found was unsettling. The treatment didn\u2019t just reduce the bad bacteria; it significantly increased the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in the plaque that remained. It\u2019s like we\u2019re winning a battle but arming the enemy for the next war.\nThis isn\u2019t just some academic thought experiment. This is happening in our operatories every day. We write a script for doxycycline or metronidazole, hoping to give our SRP a boost [1]. Or we place minocycline microspheres directly into a stubborn pocket, targeting the bacteria locally [6]. And according to clinical guidelines, this can provide a \u201cmoderate benefit\u201d [7]. But at what cost? We\u2019re contributing to a global public health crisis of antibiotic resistance, all while trying to save a few millimeters of periodontal attachment.\nIt forces us to ask a fundamental question. Are we just managing symptoms, or are we truly solving the problem? The answer, I think, is complicated. Because the problem isn\u2019t just the bacteria. It\u2019s the host.\nBack to Basics: The Mechanical War on Biofilm\nBefore we get lost in the debate over antibiotics, let\u2019s get back to what we know works. The cornerstone of it all. Scaling and Root Planing. SRP.\nLet\u2019s be clear about what this is. It is not a \u201cdeep cleaning.\u201d I hate that term. It sounds like something you do to your carpets. SRP is a therapeutic procedure. It\u2019s a mechanical and biological reset for the tooth\u2019s root environment. We\u2019re going below the gumline into those periodontal pockets\u2014the pathological space created by the disease\u2014and meticulously removing the calculus (tartar) and plaque that coat the root surfaces.\nThe scaling part is brute force. Scraping away the hardened deposits that harbor billions of bacteria. But the root planing is the finesse. We\u2019re smoothing the root to remove bacterial toxins and create a surface that is less friendly to new plaque and more inviting for the gums to reattach. It\u2019s about disrupting the organized chaos of the biofilm. We can\u2019t sterilize the pocket, and we shouldn\u2019t try. The goal is to shift the subgingival ecosystem from a disease state (dysbiosis) back toward a healthier, more balanced one.\nBut here\u2019s the unglamorous truth: SRP is only half the battle. Maybe less. The other half, the part that determines long-term success, happens at home. In the patient\u2019s bathroom. Twice a day with a toothbrush, once a day with floss or an interdental cleaner. It\u2019s a non-negotiable partnership. I can perform the most technically perfect SRP, but if the patient doesn\u2019t maintain meticulous oral hygiene, the pathogenic biofilm will be back in full force within weeks.\nThis is why patient education is so critical. We have to move past \u201cbrush and floss more.\u201d We have to explain the why. Periodontitis isn\u2019t just gum disease. It\u2019s bone loss. Your foundation, crumbling [5]. And that crumbling foundation doesn\u2019t just threaten your teeth; it opens a gateway for chronic inflammation to enter your entire system, impacting your risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and maybe even Alzheimer\u2019s [2]. When patients understand that, the toothbrush and floss become medical instruments, not just cosmetic tools.\nAfter the active phase of treatment, the work continues with periodontal maintenance every three to four months. Not a \u201cprophy.\u201d Not a simple polish. It\u2019s a targeted re-instrumentation of those at-risk areas to keep the biofilm in check. As one study put it, this routine follow-up is as important as the initial therapy itself for lasting success [4].\nWhen Deep Pockets Persist: The Debate Over a Bigger Hammer\nSo what happens when you\u2019ve done everything right? You\u2019ve performed a masterful SRP. Your patient has become a home-care superstar. But on re-evaluation, you still find deep pockets\u20145, 6, 7 millimeters\u2014that continue to bleed on probing. The numbers aren\u2019t budging. This is the gray zone. This is where the clinical debates get heated.\nDo we go back in and do it again? Or do we escalate? This is where those adjunctive therapies come back into play. The systemic antibiotics [1]. The locally delivered agents [6]. The 0.12% chlorhexidine rinses. And this is where that risk-benefit calculation gets very real. Are the few tenths of a millimeter of pocket reduction we might gain from a course of doxycycline worth the risk of fostering resistance? For a systemically healthy patient with localized deep pockets, I\u2019m increasingly skeptical. For a diabetic patient with generalized, persistent inflammation, the calculation might change. The systemic implications are too severe to ignore [2].\nIf non-surgical approaches truly fail, we have to consider surgery. This isn\u2019t a failure, but a different tool for a different job. We can do traditional resective surgery, where we actually trim the gum tissue to reduce the pocket depth, making the area easier for the patient to clean. Or, in the right circumstances, we can attempt regenerative surgery\u2014using membranes and bone grafts to try and rebuild the bone and ligament that the disease destroyed [4] [5]. These are powerful techniques, but they are invasive and not without their own risks and limitations.\nAnd then there\u2019s the periphery. The world of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies that patients are always asking about. Green tea extracts, herbal rinses, and other botanicals [3]. Some preliminary research shows they might have some anti-inflammatory or antibacterial properties. But the evidence is thin. Very thin. Are they harmful? Probably not. Are they a replacement for SRP, meticulous home care, and proven therapies? Not even close. They should never be used as a substitute for treatments backed by decades of science.\nThis brings us back full circle to the original dilemma. The future of periodontics probably doesn\u2019t lie in a stronger antibiotic or a more exotic mouthwash. It lies in a deeper understanding of the oral microbiome and finding smarter, more targeted ways to modulate it without the collateral damage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.\nReferences\n[1] Moja, L., Zanichelli, V., Mertz, D., Gandra, S., Cappello, B., Cooke, G.

They\u2019re the ones who do everything right. Brushing. Flossing. Regular check-ups. You look at their chart, and it\u2019s perfect. Then you look in their mouth. And it\u2019s a mess. Puffy gums that bleed at the slightest touch. New decay hiding between the teeth. What gives?\nWe\u2019ve been stuck in the same conversation for decades. Brush better. Floss more. Avoid candy. We\u2019ve treated the mouth like a simple machine you just have to keep clean. But it isn\u2019t working. We\u2019re bailing out a boat with a teaspoon while there\u2019s a huge hole in the bottom.\nThe hole isn\u2019t in the tooth. It\u2019s in the diet. The science is getting ridiculously clear on this point. What you eat isn\u2019t just part of the story. It\u2019s the whole plot. We\u2019ve been obsessed with the aftermath\u2014the plaque and the cavities\u2014and almost completely ignored the fuel source [1].\nThe Real War Isn\u2019t About Plaque\nLook, a cavity is just the end result. A hole. The real war is happening on a totally different level, a microscopic one. Your mouth is a jungle. Billions of tiny bugs; a microbiome. And most of the time, they live in a fragile balance.\nBut a bad diet? That\u2019s like dumping toxic waste into the jungle [3]. All those processed carbs and sugars. The bad bugs love it. They multiply like crazy and start running the place. The good guys that protect you? They get crowded out. Scientists call it dysbiosis [6]. Some would call it a hostile takeover.\nAnd this isn\u2019t about a simple cavity anymore. We\u2019re talking about periodontitis. That\u2019s not just \u201cgum disease.\u201d It\u2019s bone loss. The actual bone that holds your teeth in place. It\u2019s crumbling. Why? Because that out-of-control microbiome is spewing inflammatory toxins 24/7 [8]. Your body is trying to fight back, and the battlefield is your own gums and bone. Poor nutrition just makes it worse, weakening your defenses and leaving you wide open for attack [1].\nThat\u2019s the real danger here. Not the filling you might need, but the foundation you\u2019re about to lose. The garden metaphor is the only one that works. You can pull weeds (plaque) all day long. But if the soil itself (your diet) is garbage? The weeds just come back with a vengeance.\nThis Isn\u2019t a Niche Problem\nAnd don\u2019t think this is just about people who mainline soda. Some of the worst cases seen were even athletes [2]. People trying to be incredibly healthy. But what are they actually doing? Chugging sugary sports drinks. Constant hits of simple carbs for fuel. Breathing through their mouth. A 2024 review basically called them a walking dental disaster waiting to happen [10]. They\u2019re creating a perfect acid-bath for their teeth while trying to win a race.\nThen there\u2019s the rest of us. Life is stressful. A study on COVID habits showed what we all knew instinctively\u2014our diets went completely off the rails [5]. More snacking. Less healthy food. You can draw a direct line from that stress to a decline in oral health.\nIt\u2019s a vicious cycle for older adults, too. Teeth get worn down, maybe some are missing. It gets harder to chew things like raw vegetables or a steak. So what do you reach for? Softer, processed stuff. That diet then makes your oral health even worse, which makes it even harder to eat well [7]. It\u2019s a downward spiral. It\u2019s no wonder other research shows a clear link between eating more fruits and vegetables and having fewer cavities [9]. It all connects.\nSo, Now What?\nThe bottom line? The game has changed. For dentists, just drilling and filling feels like malpractice now. It\u2019s patching cracks in a dam that\u2019s about to burst from the pressure behind it. We have to talk about food. It\u2019s our job now.\nFor you, it means you have to see food differently. Every single thing you eat and drink either helps the good guys in your mouth or feeds the enemy. It\u2019s that simple. Are you on team health or team disease? That \u201chealthy\u201d granola bar packed with hidden sugar? That smoothie? You have to start asking what it\u2019s really doing to the jungle in your mouth.\nThis isn\u2019t a fad. It\u2019s a massive shift in understanding how our bodies work. The mouth is an ecosystem, not a machine. And your most powerful tool for controlling it isn\u2019t in your bathroom cabinet. It\u2019s in your kitchen.\nReferences\n[1] Str\u0105czek, A., Sza\u0142kowska, J., Sutkowska, P., Srebrna, A., Puzio, N., Piasecka, A., Piskorz, N., B\u0142aszczyk, J., & Thum-Tyzo, K. (2023).

Getting a clean scan of a bleeding, distal margin on tooth #31 isn\u2019t in the training video. That part is on you to figure out. The promise of \u201cefficiency\u201d is there, sure, but it lives on the other side of a mountain of frustration and failed milling blocks [1].\nAnd here\u2019s the brutal truth about digital dentistry: it\u2019s unforgiving. A mediocre prep sent to the lab might come back looking okay because a great technician can work magic. A mediocre prep scanned into a CAD/CAM system is just a high-definition view of your own mediocrity [3]. The machine doesn\u2019t fix your mistakes. It just shows them to you in stunning detail. For years, the systems have gotten better and more integrated [2] [7]. But they still can\u2019t make up for bad dentistry.\nSo if single crowns are such a headache to master, what\u2019s the point? The point is what comes next.\nThink about implants. This is where the technology starts to feel less like a gimmick and more like a genuine revolution. You take a CBCT scan of the bone. You take a digital impression of the tissue. You merge them. Suddenly, you can design a custom abutment that perfectly sculpts the gums and supports a crown in a way a stock abutment never could [4]. It\u2019s predictable. It\u2019s precise. Some of the early academic papers on this were a bit thin, rightly calling for better long-term studies [6], but you can see the clinical advantage right there on the screen.\nBut then you get to complete dentures. And the wheels come off.\nThe promise is a fully digital workflow. The reality? Trying to get a stable impression of a loose, flabby ridge with a scanner is a nightmare. The technology struggles to capture the functional, movable nature of soft tissue, which is the whole ballgame for denture retention [9]. Can you print a pretty-looking denture? Yes. Will it have the fit and stability of one made from a masterfully taken analog impression? Probably not. Not yet, anyway [8].\nThe biggest challenges with this technology have nothing to do with the technology itself. They are human problems.\nThere\u2019s the training gap. New grads are coming out of school having barely touched alginate; they think in clicks and STL files [5]. Put them in a practice with a 30-year veteran, and you have two people speaking different languages. Who is right? Both. And neither. It\u2019s a genuine friction point in clinics everywhere.\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue that should make any practice owner lose sleep: data. What happens to that scan file after you hit \u2018send\u2019? Where does it live? Who has access to it? Is it secure? Every time you scan a patient, you are creating a detailed map of their anatomy and entrusting it to a third party. The profession has jumped headfirst into digital workflows without having a serious, collective conversation about the massive privacy and security implications [10]. It\u2019s a ticking time bomb.\nSo is the machine worth it? Yes, probably. You can\u2019t fight the future. But you have to go into it with eyes wide open, knowing that the slick machine in the corner is a demanding partner. It will challenge your skills, test your patience, and force you to be a better dentist. Just don\u2019t expect it to be easy.\nReferences\n[1] Ahmed K. E. (2018).

      "text": "Why Whitening Doesn\u2019t Always Work: A Different Take on Tooth Stains\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Tooth discoloration is classified into three main types: extrinsic (surface), intrinsic (internal), and internalized (stains that have penetrated the tooth).\n- Common causes include diet (coffee, tea), medications (like tetracyclines), trauma to the tooth\u2019s nerve, and genetic or developmental conditions.\n- A 2024 study found that coffee\u2019s acidity and color intensity directly correlate with its ability to stain teeth.\n- Treatment options are tailored to the type of stain and range from non-invasive professional cleanings and bleaching to minimally invasive microabrasion and restorative options like veneers or crowns.\n- A single dark tooth is often the result of trauma that has caused the tooth\u2019s pulp (nerve) to die, requiring specialized treatment like internal bleaching.\nThe conversation usually starts the same way. A patient points to their smile in the mirror, looking frustrated. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cThe whitening toothpaste, the strips... nothing works.\u201d Then they ask the million-dollar question: \u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d\nAnd I have to be the one to tell them they might not be doing anything wrong at all.\nThe entire dental world, and especially the consumer market, has pushed this idea that a bright smile is just a tube of whitening gel away. But it\u2019s not that simple. Not even close. We\u2019ve been trained to think of all tooth stains as one problem. A surface problem. Like a coffee spill on a white countertop\u2014just scrub it off [1].\nThese are what we call extrinsic stains. They live on the outside of the enamel, the tooth\u2019s hard, protective shell. They come from chromogens, the pigment compounds in things like coffee, tea, and red wine. Tannins in these drinks act like a primer, helping the pigments stick. A recent study really dug into this with coffee, showing how its acidity and color directly cause staining. So yes, your daily habit is part of the story. So is tobacco. So is just plain old plaque if you\u2019re not brushing well. For these extrinsic stains, a good professional cleaning and polishing can work wonders. Sometimes, professional bleaching\u2014either in-office or with take-home trays\u2014is the perfect fix. Simple.\nBut what happens when the stain isn\u2019t on the countertop? What happens when it\u2019s soaked into the granite itself? That\u2019s a whole different game. And it\u2019s where the real frustration begins.\nThe Inside Job: When Stains Come From Within\nA single dark tooth. Grayish, maybe a little brown. That\u2019s a different animal entirely. When we see that, we\u2019re not thinking about coffee. We\u2019re thinking about trauma.\nMaybe years ago, that tooth got knocked. The nerve inside, the pulp, died. As that tissue breaks down, blood pigments leak into the tooth\u2019s deeper layer, the dentin [4] [5]. The tooth is literally bleeding from the inside out. It\u2019s a classic sign of a dead tooth. Slapping whitening strips on the outside of it is like trying to paint over a water stain on the ceiling without fixing the leaky pipe. It\u2019s not going to work. The discoloration is coming from deep inside.\nThis is what we call an intrinsic stain. It\u2019s baked into the tooth\u2019s structure. And it has a lot of causes.\nOne of the most notorious is medication. We see it all the time in patients of a certain age\u2014the telltale gray or brown banding caused by tetracycline antibiotics they took as a child [2]. While their teeth were still forming, the drug became part of the tooth structure. It\u2019s permanent. Certain antihistamines can do it, too. This is why a medical history is one of the first things we ask about. It\u2019s not just paperwork; it\u2019s detective work.\nThen there are the stains that are there from the very beginning. Genetic conditions like amelogenesis imperfecta or dentinogenesis imperfecta mess with how enamel and dentin form, causing severe, built-in discoloration [3] [6]. Or there\u2019s fluorosis, from getting too much fluoride during childhood. In mild cases, it\u2019s just a few faint white spots. In severe cases, it can be brown pitting across the teeth.\nAnd finally, there\u2019s a tricky hybrid category: internalized stains. It starts as a simple extrinsic stain that finds its way into tiny cracks in the enamel. Over time, it seeps deeper and deeper until it becomes an intrinsic problem. It\u2019s stubborn. By the time the patient notices it, a simple polish won\u2019t touch it.\nThe Real Work: Diagnosis and Modern Solutions\nSo, you can see why \u201cjust whiten it\u201d isn\u2019t a real answer. The first and most important step is always a proper diagnosis. We have to figure out why the tooth is discolored. A 2024 survey showed that even dental specialists can have different approaches, which tells you how complex this is. There\u2019s no single playbook.\nThe process starts with a conversation and a close look. What color is the stain? Is it on every tooth or just one? Is it uniform, or is it banded? We combine that with your medical history, your diet, your habits. To get even more specific, we can use tools like a spectrophotometer, which digitally measures the exact shade of your tooth. No more guessing. This gives us a scientific baseline to track progress and make sure we\u2019re aiming for the right result.\nOnce we know what we\u2019re dealing with, we can talk solutions. Real ones.\nFor that single dark, traumatized tooth, we can do something called non-vital bleaching. We actually place the whitening agent inside the tooth to bleach it from the inside out [4]. For those superficial white or brown spots from mild fluorosis, a technique called microabrasion is fantastic. We use a special paste to gently polish away a microscopic layer of enamel, erasing the spot without damaging the tooth.\nFor the really tough intrinsic stains\u2014the tetracycline banding, the genetic issues\u2014bleaching often isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s when we move to restorative treatments. We can cover the stain. Composite bonding involves applying a tooth-colored resin directly to the tooth surface, sculpting it to mask the discoloration. It\u2019s a great, minimally invasive option.\nThe gold standard for a dramatic change is often porcelain veneers. These are super-thin, custom-made shells of ceramic that we bond to the front of the teeth. They let us completely redesign the color and shape of your smile. If a tooth is also structurally weak, a full-coverage crown might be the best bet, restoring its strength and its look at the same time.\nIt\u2019s a step-by-step process. Logical. The goal isn\u2019t just to make teeth \u201cwhiter.\u201d It\u2019s to understand the root cause of the discoloration and choose a treatment that actually solves the specific problem. So before you get discouraged by the latest whitening fad that didn\u2019t work, talk to a professional. The real solution starts with a good diagnosis. It\u2019s less about a magic potion and more about good dental detective work.\nReferences\n[1] Hattab, F. N., Qudeimat, M. A., & al-Rimawi, H. S. (1999). Dental discoloration: an overview.
