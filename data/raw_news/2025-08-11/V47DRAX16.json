  "description": "Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors.",
  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors.\n\nThe Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the \u201cobsolete\u201d H20 chip to China. The president credited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for negotiating him down to 15%.\n\n\u201cSo we negotiated a little deal. So he\u2019s selling an essentially old chip,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNvidia did not comment about the specific details of the agreement or its quid pro quo nature, but said they would adhere to the export rules laid out by the administration.\n\n\u201cWe follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\u201d Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. \u201cAmerica cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America\u2019s AI tech stack can be the world\u2019s standard if we race.\u201d\n\nAMD did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it \u201ca dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.\u201d\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.\n\n\u201cOur export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,\u201d he said. \u201cChip export controls aren\u2019t bargaining chips, and they\u2019re not casino chips either. We shouldn\u2019t be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.\u201d\n\nDerek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for this, probably because export taxes are unconstitutional, \u201d said Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThey call it a fee, but 15% of sales revenue is about a standard a tax as it comes. For this reason, I don\u2019t think the \u2018arrangement\u2019 is at all durable. \u2018\u2019\n\n\u201cIf it were to last, it has two possible implications. First, there\u2019s a possible export tax that high-profile companies and goods must consider. Or the tax only applies in exceptional situations, such as changing export controls. Then we\u2019d risk national security for the sake of tax revenue, which is effectively the same as cutting the defense budget,\u201d Scissors said.\n\nBack in July, Nvidia argued that tight export controls around their chip sales would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. They\u2019ve argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology, and have also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia\u2019s chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.\n\nRestrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world\u2019s two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead. Meanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes - and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Shawn Chen, Didi Tang and Paul Wiseman contributed to the reporting.",
