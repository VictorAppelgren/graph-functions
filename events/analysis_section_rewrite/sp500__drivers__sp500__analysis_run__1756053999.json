      "feedback": "The draft lays a solid regime-based scaffold and correctly anchors the long-horizon story to automation exposure (NL5YYTLF2) and the EV-capex dynamic (22PL3Q360), but it underdelivers on (a) a crisp, first-principles causal chain from macro/policy to asset prices, (b) explicit, testable numeric triggers and ranges, (c) a formal, multi-horizon scenario structure with defined decoupling/invalidation points, and (d) integrated cross-topic synthesis that ties macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals into a single narrative; to fix, (1) define Regime A/B/C with concrete variables and thresholds drawn from the sources (e.g., inflation or wage-dynamics signals per 37UZC9X8I) and state how each regime alters Fed stance, risk premia, and rate-sensitive pricing; (2) deliver a transparent causal chain: Automation exposure (NL5YYTLF2) drives productivity and capex intensity, which shapes margins/ROIC (cite 22PL3Q360 Ford data and ACMR’s 2025 revenue ~ $900m with ~4% gross margin) and then feeds into 10Y yield dynamics; quantify plausible sensitivities rather than qualitative links; (3) formalize near-term catalysts with concrete data events and expected moves, not just direction, and tie them to regimes; (4) restructure EURUSD and cross-asset logic into a four-regime framework with explicit links to AI capex (5S9GJV2O3), governance risk (UVEQ2SJ0W), and consumer-margin dynamics (HWGNUP2XG) and provide forecast bands; (5) build a concise base/up/down scenario with a 2–3 paragraph per scenario, list trigger lines, and clear invalidation conditions; (6) produce an integrated watch-list of signals and data releases with timing windows and source tags, ensuring every claim cites one of the six IDs; (7) reconcile any tensions across sources by prioritizing the most direct signal (e.g., 37UZC9X8I for policy regime shifts) and explicitly noting any conflicts; (8) tighten prose to avoid repetition, ensure every claim maps to a source ID, and present the synthesis in a single coherent thread that fulfills the SECTION FOCUS by weaving macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals in lockstep; (9) add numeric ranges where possible (e.g., inflation/wage paths, capex intensity, margin trajectories) to anchor the narrative, while avoiding non-source conjecture; (10) keep the format lean but scannable, so a reader can extract the core regime-driven narrative and the decisive signals at a glance.",
