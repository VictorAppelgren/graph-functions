  "content": "WASHINGTON, Aug. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- This week at GridFuture 2025, CPower Energy's annual conference focused on advancements in demand response and distributed energy, key energy stakeholders tackled one of the grid's most pressing challenges: meeting the accelerating demand for electricity.\n\n\"Demand for electricity is growing, and rapidly, for the first time in decades. Although analysts disagree on how high demand will rise in the coming years, even the low-end projections are significant. And there is strong consensus that meeting this demand growth with new sources of supply will be a challenge,\" said Michael D. Smith, CEO, CPower.\n\n\"While putting more steel in the ground is often the default answer, building generation is too slow and too costly to address the immediate challenge. This is why demand response is so critical. It's fast, flexible, cost-effective and available to make a difference now,\" Smith continued.\n\nAs the leading virtual power plant (VPP) platform, CPower enables 23,000 customer sites across the U.S. to intelligently strengthen the grid while earning revenue and reducing costs through demand response and energy flexibility programs. Since June 1, CPower and its customers have provided ~34,000 MWh of load relief to meet peak demand during the hottest days of summer, stabilizing the grid when and where dispatchable resources were needed most.\n\n\"Meeting growing energy demand from data centers, reindustrialization and economy-wide electrification while protecting the planet requires all tools in the toolbox,\" said Morgan Scott, vice president, Global Partnerships and Outreach at EPRI. \"This includes better utilizing and strengthening existing generation and grid infrastructure, and leveraging emerging technologies while minimizing costs and enhancing system reliability.\"\n\nTop CPower Customers and Partners Recognized for Contributions to the Grid and Communities\n\nDuring GridFuture, CPower also announced the winners of its second annual Customer-Powered Grid\u00ae Awards, honoring the outstanding contributions of CPower customers and partners strengthening grid reliability, advancing flexible energy solutions, driving technological innovation and making a meaningful impact in their communities.\n\nHighland Electric Fleets, North America's leading provider of electrification-as-a-service, received the Flexibility Award. Highland led the first use of electric school buses in a commercial vehicle-to-grid (V2G) program and operates the largest electric school bus project in the U.S.",
