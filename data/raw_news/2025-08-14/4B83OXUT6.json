  "title": "The Unsung Hero of Media Storage: Why DVD Cases Reign Supreme",
  "description": "From brittle CD jewel cases to flimsy VHS sleeves, DVD cases revolutionized media storage with their durability and sleek design. But do they still hold up in the age of streaming? Find out why these humble containers deserve more respect.",
  "content": "Everyone fondly remembers their physical media, but don't really spend much time thinking about the containers that held that media. Well, I'm not everyone, and I like to appreciate a game-changing design that's better in almost every way compared to the thing it replaced.\n\nSo, while the continuing decline in streaming service quality marches on, and people are pining for the good old days when they owned their media, let's spend a minute appreciating just how good DVD cases are.\n\nDVD cases replaced not one, but two types of media container\u2014plastic CD jewel cases and plastic VHS cases or cardboard sleeves. To be honest, DVD cases have more in common with those premium plastic VHS cases, but they are certainly better than the cardboard VHS sleeves!\n\nWhere things really got a glow-up is when we compare DVDs to plastic CD jewel cases. These clear and brittle plastic cases are awful. They're made from multiple parts held together by tiny nubs and the power of prayer. One short drop and they crack or shatter. I'd say about 50% of the jewel cases I ever owned had some sort of crack or broken parts.\n\nA standard DVD case is injection molded all in one piece, they're extremely durable, and standardized the size of the cases, making them look way better on the shelf in my opinion.\n\nOne of the reasons CD jewel cases had to be clear, was because the written material needed to be visible. The little cover sheet or booklet and the rear cover had to be visible. DVD cases solve this neatly. There's an outer printed sleeve that goes under a plastic sheet, but the case itself doesn't have to be see-through. At the same time, there's ample space for a proper book-shaped booklet inside. Many DVD cases even had little retainer clips to hold it all securely.\n\nOpen a CD jewel case and half the time the album liner notes just fall out or stay behind on top of the CD itself. I also love that you can have reversible slipcovers with DVD cases, and that printing out your own slipcovers is pretty easy because the fit doesn't have to be as precise compared to making and cutting your own covers for a CD jewel case.\n\nThe whole point of a media case is to protect the actual media inside. DVD cases did a much better job of this than CD jewel cases. If you dropped a CD case, not only would the case itself probably split into shattered parts, but your actual CDs would scatter across the floor. DVD cases tend to retain their discs inside, even if the impact makes the disc go loose inside the case.\n\nSpeaking of which, that brittle clear CD jewel case plastic was terrible for its disc-retention mechanism. Those little fingers that hold the disc would inevitable start breaking off even with normal use. The plastic used in DVD cases is much more flexible, and so I've personally never had that happen with a DVD case.\n\nDVD cases also keep sunlight out, which can be a contributing factor to disc degradation, and the hinge design for a DVD case will last practically forever compared to the fragile CD jewel case approach.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most subjective points I'm trying to make, but as someone who likes to collect and display my media, I think the DVD and Blu-ray case format is much better than what came before. You have a nice long spine to make titles easy to browse. The cases are easy to stack vertically or horizontally, and because you have two nice portrait-shaped covers, there's plenty of space for nice artwork, and all the information you need. It also makes it easy for DVDs to share the same shelf space with my book collection.\n\nWhy They Still Beat Most Modern Packaging\n\nBlu-ray cases are obviously just an evolution of the DVD case, and so most of the good things about DVD case design also applies to them. However, I do feel that Blu-ray cases are a step backwards with the more brittle transparent cases. They also feel thinner and less robust. I don't hate them, but I still prefer the chunkier DVD cases for purposes of collecting and storing my disc long-term.\n\nOf course, I can just buy a pack of DVD cases and transfer my Blu-rays over with their slipcovers if I really wanted to, but it's no biggie in the greater scheme of things. However, I think that time will show that the simple and robust standard DVD case will be the best performer long-term compared to CD jewel cases, vinyl and laserdisc sleeves, and yes even modern Blu-ray cases.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nAs it dawns on us that the internet isn't forever, and you don't really have control over your digital media, it's becoming more popular to collect physical media. While DVDs and Blu-ray media are a non-issue, what about older formats like LaserDisc and VHS? Should anyone be collecting these? If so, which one makes the most sense?\nQuality and Format Differences\nLaserDisc is a higher quality format than VHS, period. LaserDisc offered almost twice as many horizontal lines of detail than VHS, so there really is no comparison. However, with LaserDisc you'll have to flip the disc over partway through most films. Like me, you probably have rose-tinted memories of what VHS looked like, but if you head to YouTube and look at digitized VHS recordings, you'll soon realize we could barely see what was going on. While LDs are still short of DVDs in quality, on the right equipment it can still look great.\nLongevity and Durability\nVHS tapes are not great from a longevity and durability perspective. Every time you play back a VHS tape, it gets a little more worn out. Not to mention that the tape itself will degrade over time, and it's susceptible to magnets.\nLaserDiscs, on the other hand, may also be analog in nature, but because the disc is read using a laser, there's no wear and tear, and the quality should not degrade through normal use. However, these discs are susceptible to their own form of \"disc rot.\" It's not entirely clear why some LDs get disc rot, but it's enough of a problem that enthusiasts maintain a list of problematic titles.\nOverall, I'd give this one to LaserDiscs on balance, especially since VHS seems to have its own inevitable decline as well.\nOne thing I do worry about is the longevity of the actual players, since LDs will eventually break down when the lasers don't work anymore, and VHS players are mechanically complex and were unreliable even when new. Well, at least the mainstream models my family could afford were. Whether there will be any way to play these media decades from now is debatable.\nRarity and Availability\nLaserDisc was a relatively rare format at the best of times. One of the main reasons VHS became so popular was affordability, and the sheer number of VHS titles released. So finding VHS from the late 90s and onward should still be relatively easy. That said, you'll find plenty of LaserDisc listings on sites like Ebay. Not as many as VHS titles based on my casual browsing, but they're still available.\nPackaging and Artwork\nThe truth about vinyl records is that the perceived \"quality\" advantage it has over digital music doesn't have a basis in reality, but I feel many people collect them because the shape and size of vinyl records lends itself to amazing packaging and artwork. Similarly, there's just no comparison to how beautiful LDs can be as objects, even if you never play them. From this perspective, they are highly collectible.\nVHS tapes, on the other hand, are ugly and spartan. Of course, that's just my opinion, but in this category I just find no merit to them at all.\nCost\nOddly enough, as I was looking for prices on both VHS players and LD players, it seems that things more or less even out. As for the prices of the media, LDs seem quite a bit more expensive. However, I'd hazard to say that if the LD is in good condition it's probably worth the additional asking price.\nCultural and Historical Significance\nLet's be honest, if any film or show that exists on either LaserDisc or VHS is available on DVD or Blu-ray, you're far better off getting those more modern formats. If something only exists on LD or VHS, then LD seems like the better choice, and then VHS should be a last resort.\nHowever, there is the nostalgia factor with VHS, and in the case of LDs, there might be historical value to some of them. After all, for a long time the widescreen LaserDisc releases of the original Star Wars trilogy was the only untouched version of the original theatrical edits of those movies, untouched by George Lucas' \"improvements.\"\nThere's no winner here, other than LD being the better option for preservation if no newer media of that content exists.\nCommunity and Fandom\nYou'd think that LaserDisc would have a more intense fandom, but as a crude metric, consider that r/VHS has over 60K members, while r/LaserDisc has a hair under 10K members. There are, of course, forums and groups dedicated to both media all over the web, but the size of the VHS community did surprise me a little.\nI think perhaps a part of it has to do with just how many VHS titles there are, and there's an endless flood of rare or obscure finds in the VHS world, whereas LDs are more about quality over quantity. A media nerd can get lost in either rabbit hole, so it's not like I want to say one is better than the other, but the two types of collector communities sure feel like they have different \"flavors\" for lack of a better word.\nPersonally, I think I'll stick to collecting DVDs and Blu-rays, though I am a little envious of my friends who do collect LDs, until I come to my senses. Even collecting DVDs is starting to feel like media archeology, so while going further back than that feels daunting. Whichever you might choose to collect, any preservation is worth it, and as long as you enjoy your hobby there's probably no objectively correct answer as to which is the \"right\" medium to invest in."

      "text": "Summary\n- DVDs from 2006-2008 by Warner Bros. are deteriorating due to \"disc rot,\" with replacements available.\n- Look out for playback issues like loading problems to identify affected DVDs from the late 2000s.\n- A YouTuber has compiled a list of over 300 affected titles identified and a possible manufacturing plant culprit.\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you've probably got a pile of DVDs somewhere, and those DVDs are most likely getting a little old. Well, Warner Bros. just confirmed a nasty little secret that might impact your collection: some of their DVDs from 2006 to 2008 are turning to dust.\nThe culprit is something called \u201cdisc rot.\u201d According to Sony, a well-kept DVD should last anywhere from 30-100 years, but the discs that succumb to disc rot are deteriorating much quicker. Warner Bros. has acknowledged the problem, offering replacements where they can. The company had this to say on the matter in a statement to JoBlo:\nWarner Bros. Home Entertainment is aware of potential issues affecting select DVD titles manufactured between 2006 \u2013 2008, and the company has been actively working with consumers to replace defective discs.\nWhere possible, the defective discs have been replaced with the same title. However, as some of the affected titles are no longer in print or the rights have expired, consumers have been offered an exchange for a title of like-value.\nConsumers with affected product can contact the customer support team at whv@wbd.com.\nSo, the big question is, how do you spot the rot? Playback issues are your first clue. Discs that won't load, freeze mid-movie, or have glitchy extras. However, if you don\u2019t feel like manually going through all of your late 2000s DVDs, YouTuber, Damn Fool Idealistic Crusader, has compiled a very handy list of known affected titles.\nThe list is made up of DVDs that have been reported online in various forums and support threads, as well as Damn Fool Idealistic Crusader\u2019s own personal collection. At the time of writing, this list has over 300 entries, including box sets, series, and individual titles.\nWarner Bros. said the affected titles were produced from 2006-2008, but Damn Fool Idealistic Crusader has found titles from 2009 as well. In a second document, he points a finger at a Cinram manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania. He claims discs made there, roughly from 2006 to 2009, are the culprits. You can check your discs for codes on the inner ring to see if they match. Warner Bros. hasn\u2019t confirmed this, but the evidence is compelling.\nCheck out the video below from Damn Fool Idealistic Crusader for more information on his findings.\nMany of us see physical media as a way to avoid losing access to our favorites. Sadly, even physical media isn\u2019t immune to failure\u2013it\u2019s just a very different type of failure. VHS tapes, for example, are susceptible to mold if left in damp environments over time. Warner Bros. is at least trying to make it right, but that\u2019s not something you can rely on every company doing. Ironically, the best way to save your physical media forever is to digitize it.\nSource: The Verge"

      "text": "Physical media is currently having a renaissance, and you might be thinking about joining the movement. But which format is right for you? When trying to decide, think more about your heart than what the trends say.\nWhy I Choose Physical Media\nAs a techy person, I've been quick to adopt new standards and ways of doing things. I hopped on the Netflix train early. I was a big fan of Google Play Music when it first launched. I signed up for Sling TV when it was the first of its kind. I've begrudgingly been a paying Spotify customer for many years. I could go on, but the point is I've been mostly happy with my media existing on the internet.\nIn recent years, I've started to think more about ownership of my media. As convenient as streaming video and music services are, you don't actually own any of the content. It's only available as long as you pay for it or you have an internet connection to stream it. I didn't care about that for a long time, but it started to bother me.\nCertain movies, albums, and artists have special meaning to me. They're not just movies to put on in the background while I scroll my phone or passively listen to while I work. I want to have a more tangible relationship with the media I love the most. That means being able to enjoy it whenever and however I want, but also giving it physical space in my home.\nDon't Follow Trends\nPhysical media is very trendy right now, especially in the music world. Vinyl has been surging in popularity for several years and now triples CD sales. I'll admit that I got caught up in the hype, too. I've always thought vinyl records and turntables looked cool, and I liked the idea of being a Vinyl Person.\nHere's the problem: vinyl doesn't mean anything to me. When I was old enough to buy music, CDs were the dominant medium. My parents had vinyl from their younger years, but we didn't even own a functional turntable. It simply wasn't a thing in the time of my life when I was developing a relationship with music.\nSo, when I started to collect some albums on vinyl, and I got a turntable, it fell flat. Without the nostalgia, it just felt like a cumbersome way to listen to music in worse quality. I appreciate vinyl from a historical sense, and I enjoy having some in my collection, but I can't say it moves the needle much for me.\nFollow Your Heart\nI was too concerned with the \"cool\" factor of vinyl, not how it made me feel. The same can be said for any type of physical media. Laserdisc is unquestionably cool and awesome for display purposes, but you might have more of a connection to VHS. Don't let the trends dictate what you collect.\nFor me, it was cassette tapes that opened my eyes. I grew up during the period of transition between cassettes and CDs. I mentioned that my parents had vinyl, but my dad also had a cassette tape collection. That is where my music memories begin. I vividly remember looking through cassette tapes in his leather carrying case.\nUnlike the turntable situation, I had a working cassette player thanks to the Talkboy Deluxe. So, I could actually listen to his cassettes, and the same type of music (classic rock) was always playing on the radio in our house. This is where nostalgia comes from\u2013something I did not have with vinyl.\nI decided to pull at this thread and bought a Sony Walkman from the 80s on eBay. I followed that with some cassette tapes that I remember from my dad's collection and my personal favorites. I still think vinyl is neat, but I have to admit I've enjoyed listening to cassettes so much more.\nIt's not because the quality is better (it's not), or that it's more convenient to use (only marginally), or that it's cheaper. It's because it means something to me. I have a deeper connection to cassettes, and I felt that when I listened to them for the first time in over 20 years. Cassettes allow me to tap into that nostalgic feeling we all love. Don't underestimate emotion when looking for physical media."
