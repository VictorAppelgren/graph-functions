  "description": "Canadian PM floats the possibility of \u2018presence of troops\u2019 from allied countries to protect Ukraine against Russia.",
  "content": "Canadian PM floats the possibility of \u2018presence of troops\u2019 from allied countries to protect Ukraine against Russia.\n\nCanada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney has expressed support for Ukraine\u2019s calls for security guarantees as part of any peace deal with Russia, including the possibility of deploying troops to the Eastern European country.\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv, where he met Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, Carney said a group of Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, known as the Coalition of the Willing, is working with the United States to bolster Ukrainian defences.\n\n\u201cIn Canada\u2019s judgment, it is not realistic that the only security guarantee could be the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces \u2026 that needs to be buttressed and reinforced,\u201d Carney told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are working through \u2013 with our allies in Coalition of the Willing and with Ukraine \u2013 the modalities of those security guarantees on land, in the air and the sea, and I would not exclude the presence of troops.\u201d\n\nThree and a half years since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, US President Donald Trump is leading efforts to end the war.\n\nFor its part, Kyiv is working with its European allies to secure post-war guarantees to protect Ukraine from the possibility of renewed Russian attacks, which Trump has also expressed openness towards.\n\nOn Sunday, Carney joined Zelenskyy for a ceremony in central Kyiv to mark Ukrainian Independence Day, which was also attended by Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.\n\n\u201cWe are all working to ensure that the end of this war would mean the guarantee of peace for Ukraine, so that neither war nor the threat of war are left for our children to inherit,\u201d Zelenskyy told a crowd of dignitaries.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said he wants future security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal to be as close as possible to NATO\u2019s Article 5, which considers an attack on one member state as an attack against all.\n\nZelenskyy and Carney signed an agreement on drone co-production. The Canadian prime minister said Ukraine would receive more than $1 billion Canadian ($723 million) in military aid from a previously announced package next month.\n\nCarney also called for an end to the fighting in Ukraine during his visit.\n\n\u201cWe need a cessation of hostilities. We need a ceasefire. We can call it a ceasefire, a truce, an armistice. That\u2019s necessary to stop the killing,\u201d Carney told reporters.\n\nWith the war already having claimed tens of thousands of lives, hopes for a ceasefire on the ground, however, remain dim as Kyiv and Moscow continue to exchange fire.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a drone attack on the nuclear power plant in Kursk near the Ukrainian border, igniting a fire.\n\nLocal authorities, meanwhile, said a Russian drone strike killed a 47-year-old woman in the eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nAfter a push by Trump to broker a Ukraine-Russia summit, hopes for peace further dimmed when Russia on Friday ruled out any immediate meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\nBut on Sunday, Zelenskyy said the \u201cformat of talks between leaders is the most effective way forward\u201d, renewing calls for a bilateral summit with Putin.\n\nThe Russian president met with Trump in Anchorage, Alaska in the US earlier this month, but the talks did not produce an immediate breakthrough to end the war.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused European leaders of undermining efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe want peace in Ukraine. US President Trump also wants peace in Ukraine. The reaction to the Anchorage meeting, the visit of these European representatives to Washington, and their subsequent actions indicate that they do not want peace,\u201d Lavrov said, according to Russia\u2019s TASS news agency.",

And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,\u201d Putin said, referring to last week\u2019s summit.\n\u201cThe next steps now depend on the leadership of the United States, but I am confident that the leadership qualities of the current president, President Trump, are a good guarantee that relations will be restored.\u201d\nPutin also said the two countries were discussing joint projects in the Arctic, but he did not give many details. He only said there were \u201chuge, huge\u201d mineral reserves in the region and noted that Russian liquefied natural gas company Novatek was already operating there.\n\u2018A very important decision\u2019\nBoth Russia and the US have said they see enormous economic opportunities if they can normalise relations after ties plunged to a post-Cold War low because of the war in Ukraine.\nOn Friday, however, Trump said he was unhappy about a Russian strike on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility\u2019s employees.\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about it, and I\u2019m not happy about anything having to do with that war,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\nHe also expressed frustration towards Moscow since there had been no progress in reaching a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks, despite his meeting about the war with Putin in Alaska.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a decision as to what we do and it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to be a very important decision, and that\u2019s whether or not it\u2019s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it\u2019s your fight,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump added that he had begun making arrangements for a meeting between Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, soon after concluding White House talks with the Ukrainian president and European leaders and after speaking to Putin by phone.\n\u2018No agenda\u2019 for Putin-Zelenskyy meeting\nEarlier on Friday, however, Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was no agenda for a potential summit between Putin and Zelenskyy and that there is no plan for such a meeting.\nSpeaking to NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker\u201d, Lavrov said that Putin had made clear he was ready to meet Zelenskyy to discuss a possible deal to end the war in Ukraine, provided there was a proper agenda for such a session, something he said was lacking for now.\n\u201cPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all,\u201d Lavrov told NBC, saying no meeting was therefore planned for now.\nLavrov said Russia had agreed to show flexibility on a number of issues raised by Trump at a US-Russia summit last week, but accused Ukraine of not showing the same flexibility in talks with Trump and European allies that followed in Washington.\n\u201cHe [Trump] clearly indicated \u2013 it was very clear to everybody that there are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no NATO membership [for Ukraine], including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelenskyy said no to everything,\u201d said Lavrov.\n\u201cHe even said no to, as I said, to cancelling legislation banning the Russian language. How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?\u201d\n\u2018Moscow wants eastern Donbas\u2019\nTrump had imposed an August 8 deadline for Putin to agree to an end to the war or face new sanctions against Russia and countries that buy its oil, but instead agreed to meet the Kremlin leader at a summit in Alaska last Friday.\nSince then, Russia has shown little movement, maintaining most of its longstanding demands while proposing to freeze the front line in two Ukrainian regions it claims as its own, and expressing a readiness to potentially hand back relatively small pieces of Ukrainian territory it controls.\nPutin wants Ukraine to give up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, three sources familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking told the Reuters news agency.\nZelenskyy, who has said he does not want to \u201cgift\u201d Russia any territory, said on Friday the Kremlin was doing everything it could to make sure that a meeting between him and Putin did not take place. He called on Ukraine\u2019s allies to apply new sanctions on Moscow if it showed no desire to end the war."

In June, 232 people were killed and 1,343 injured, according to the human rights mission in Ukraine.\nAfter announcing earlier this week that the US would resume shipments to Kyiv, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that his country was sending weapons to NATO, which could then be sent on to Ukraine by its member states.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on Friday that European nations could give some of their military supplies to Kyiv and order replacements from the US.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a [US] factory and get it there,\u201d Rubio said during a visit to Malaysia.\nMeanwhile, on the front line, the Russian military struck Ukraine\u2019s southern port city of Odesa on Friday morning, injuring at least eight people, according to Ukrainian local officials.\nOvernight Russian attacks on eastern Ukraine also injured nine and forced the evacuation of a maternity centre in Kharkiv, President Zelenskyy said.\nDrone attacks, shelling\nMeanwhile, Russian officials noted that Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks had killed three people in the Russian regions of Belgorod, Lipetsk and Tula on Friday.\nThe Ukrainian military said on Telegram that it had targeted a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region on Friday.\nBoth drone attacks caused explosions and fires, Ukraine added.\nThe US\u2019s decision to resume aid deliveries to Ukraine comes as Trump has signalled a growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAmid an apparent thaw in relations, Rubio met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Malaysia on Friday. \u201cWe are talking, and that is a start,\u201d Rubio said.\nLavrov later travelled to North Korea to hold talks. Pyongyang has been an important backer of Moscow, sending thousands of troops to Russia to help it in its war against Ukraine."

The attack also damaged several residential buildings in the city and the nearby city of Horlivka.\n- Russia attacked a gas compressor station in eastern Ukraine that is important for getting fuel into storage facilities for the winter heating season, two industry sources told the Reuters news agency, as Russian attacks escalate despite a push from the United States for peace.\n-\nRussian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov visited the \u201cnorth\u201d group of forces fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the battlefield situation there, Zvezda, the official media outlet of the Ministry of Defence, reported.\n-\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that large-scale Russian attacks overnight in various parts of Ukraine showed Moscow was avoiding negotiations about ending the more than three-year-long war.\n-\nRussia\u2019s latest strikes involved 574 drones and 40 missiles, President Zelenskyy said, and were one of the largest of Russia\u2019s attacks so far on Ukraine.

      "text": "Hungary, Slovakia fear oil cuts after Ukrainian attack on Russian pipeline\nOfficials warn Ukraine\u2019s strike on Unecha oil pumping station risks halting supplies for at least five days.\nHungary and Slovakia have raised the alarm over possible fuel shortages after a Ukrainian strike on Russia\u2019s Druzhba pipeline, saying deliveries could be suspended for several days.\nOn Friday, officials from both countries warned that the attack on the Unecha oil pumping station, a key hub in western Russia, risked halting supplies for at least five days. The Soviet-era pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Ukraine, is a crucial route for Russian oil to reach Central Europe.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsUkraine\u2019s Zelenskyy rules out China as security guarantor in any peace deal\nPutin optimistic about Russia-US relations as Trump threatens sanctions\nHungary\u2019s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and Slovakia\u2019s Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar wrote a joint letter to the European Commission urging Brussels to step in and guarantee secure energy flows. \u201cThe physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,\u201d they wrote.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also made the strike a political issue, releasing a letter he had sent to US President Donald Trump.\nIn it, Orban said Ukraine had attacked Druzhba just days before Trump\u2019s August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, calling the move a \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d escalation.\nA copy of the letter posted on Facebook appeared to include Trump\u2019s handwritten response: \u201cViktor, I do not like hearing this, I am very angry about it.\u201d The White House has not commented.\n\u2018Energy security\u2019\nUkraine\u2019s military confirmed late on Thursday that it had struck the Unecha facility, describing it as a vital node in Russia\u2019s export system.\nRobert Brovdi, commander of Ukraine\u2019s unmanned systems forces, posted a video on Telegram showing a large blaze at an oil depot, though the location could not be independently verified.\nThe strike was the second this week to disrupt oil deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia, following another halt earlier on Monday and Tuesday. Russian officials said the Unecha fire had been extinguished, but admitted flows could be disrupted for several days.\nThe European Union, which reduced its reliance on Russian energy after the 2022 invasion, has pledged to phase out Moscow\u2019s oil and gas entirely by 2027. But Hungary and Slovakia have resisted such moves, keeping close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and blocking some sanctions packages that Kyiv insists are necessary to pressure Moscow.\nGermany and Kazakhstan, which also use the Druzhba pipeline, reported their supplies remained unaffected. Berlin said deliveries to the PCK Schwedt refinery, which supplies fuel to the capital, were secure, while Kazakhstan confirmed its oil flows had not been disrupted.\nDespite EU investment in Croatian infrastructure meant to provide alternatives, both Hungary and Slovakia say Russian energy remains indispensable. \u201cThis is another attack against our energy security,\u201d Szijjarto wrote on Facebook."
