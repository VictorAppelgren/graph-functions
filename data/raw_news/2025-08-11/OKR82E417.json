  "content": "\u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased with the progess achieved during the second quarter as the Company enters a new phase in its life cycle. The data generated to date from 130 patients treated with DurAVR\u00ae across multiple settings, including complex anatomies, different annular sizes, bicuspids and valve-in-valve (including a double aortic and mitral replacement in the same patient) is highly compelling. By adopting a \u201ctotal disease management\u201d approach, the development of this first-in-class biomimetic transcatheter heart valve has delivered meaningful clinical benefits across a range of clinical use cases. As such, we are excited by physician enthusiasm across the globe to recruit into the PARADIGM study which is designed to further support the growing body of evidence demonstrating DurAVR\u00ae THV\u2019s impact on patients,\u201d said Wayne Paterson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Anteris.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nAnteris has continued to expand the level of global experience and build the body of clinical evidence with the DurAVR\u00ae THV System. At the end of the Second Quarter, there were 130 patients successfully implanted with the DurAVR\u00ae THV in rolling cohorts since start of clinical development, with 49 of these patients treated in the first half of 2025 and 21 in 2Q 2025. These additional patients continue to support the strong clinical benefits of our new class of biomimetic TAVR over current commercially available TAVR platforms.\n\nOver the Second Quarter, the Anteris team made considerable progress strengthening its clinical infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities in preparation for the Trial. A key focus was the qualification of trial sites, including feasibility assessments to confirm each site\u2019s access to a suitable aortic stenosis patient population and their capacity to conduct the Trial to the highest standards. Preparatory activities, including site contracting with planned centers across the U.S., Europe and Canada, are well advanced, with 79 sites now qualified to participate.\n\nIn May, Anteris hosted a European Investigator Meeting for the PARADIGM Trial to facilitate operational alignment of qualified sites across the European investigator network, with participation from principal investigators at leading sites in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nIn June, Anteris hosted a Global Investigator Meeting to formally initiate activities for the PARADIGM Trial ahead of anticipated regulatory clearance. Dr. Michael J. Reardon and Professor Stephan Windecker were confirmed as the Co-Chairs of the Trial during the meeting, held in conjunction with New York Valves. These physicians provide significant clinical and trial experience in interventional cardiology and TAVR.",
