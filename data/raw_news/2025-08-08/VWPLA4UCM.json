  "content": "In the charred aftermath of Malibu\u2019s January wildfires, one buyer has been moving in silence.\n\nWhile much of La Costa Beach remains a barren stretch of sand, a foreign investor has quietly acquired nine oceanfront lots \u2014 spending more than $65 million to secure some of the most coveted parcels along the Pacific Coast Highway, according to Realtor.com.\n\nWorking through luxury agents Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe of the Weston James Group, the buyer is targeting properties with at least 40 feet of frontage, betting that once the coastline is rebuilt, demand from wealthy buyers will return in force.\n\n\u201cHe started building a team on his end of expediters, architects and kind of figured out what the best size lots and frontage would be to build on to eventually resell,\u201d Littlefield told Realtor.com.\n\nMany of the most desirable sites weren\u2019t listed publicly, forcing the team to track down owners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say probably about 50% had sentimental value to their properties just based on memories, or their parents passed it down to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of them, ultimately, just didn\u2019t want to go through the rebuilding process because of how long they knew it was going to take to really come back.\u201d\n\nThe scale of destruction was severe: The fire razed 720 structures in Malibu, burning miles of beachfront homes to their foundations.\n\n\u201cMalibu was such a charming beach town, and all the homes that were on La Costa Beach had so much character\u2026 and for it all to just be gone and wiped out, down to the sand, is heartbreaking,\u201d Littlefield said.\n\nRebuilding is a long and costly process. The city estimates permit approvals can take 12 to 24 months, and coastal construction carries steeper requirements than inland projects.\n\nFees start at $11,579 for planning alone, before additional costs for site reviews or variances. Homes must generally match the original footprint, though up to 10% more square footage is allowed.\n\nDevelopers must also meet FEMA floodplain standards, replace noncompliant seawalls and install Advanced Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems instead of septic tanks.\n\nTimber piles are banned, and narrow La Costa Beach parcels are subject to strict view protections. The city has set up a Malibu Rebuild Center to help owners navigate the process, both online and in person.\n\nFor Littlefield, the investment is a calculated bet with a long horizon.\n\n\u201cOnce this beach is built back and it\u2019s all brand-new construction, I think it\u2019s going to be a very desirable spot for a lot of wealthy people to try to buy a beach house,\u201d he said.",

Panozzo, who is gay and has been open about living with HIV, bought the property for $305,000 in 2007.\nThe \u201970s rock band, known for hit songs like \u201cCome Sail Away\u201d and \u201cRenegade,\u201d is currently on tour. Panozzo co-founded the band with his fraternal twin brother, drummer John Panozzo, who died in 1996, and singer/keyboardist Dennis DeYoung.\nThe two-bedroom, three-bath home was built in 1952 and sits on just under a quarter of an acre. At 1,608 square feet, it features two bedrooms, a home office/convertible bedroom \u2014 plus a landscaped garden and a pool. And as an added bonus, it comes furnished.\n\u201cThis house is special to me because of the magic it has,\u201d Panozzo told Gimme Shelter by email.\n\u201cWhen I open the door and cross the koi pond and look around, I know I am safe and at home. It was a blank canvas on the perfect lot in the neighborhood, so I sold my Miami condo and I moved here. Every area became an environment that you can explore depending on your mood \u2014 whether I need to relax, reflect or turn up the volume after touring,\u201d he wrote.\nThe home, \u201cby the energy of Wilton Drive,\u201d was designed as a \u201cpersonal sanctuary.\u201d\nDesign details include wood finishes, and an indoor/outdoor flow.\nThe landscaped backyard also boasts fountains and coral-lined walkways, along with teak sculptures, bonsai and Ashoka trees, and animal-shaped hedges. Most of the sculptures and art are included in the sale, said listing brokers Juan Zapata and Susan Rindley of ONE Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nPanozzo loves the property but, he told Gimme, it\u2019s time for him to return to high-rise living.\n\u201cI am moving because after living in high-rises in Chicago and Miami, I realize that it\u2019s best for me to return to the sky,\u201d Panozzo said.\n\u201cI still actively tour with my band and while I have lived here for [more than] 15 years and made my home into my creative space, I am ready for a new challenge and a downtown balcony with a view.\u201d\nPanozzo will be staying in Fort Lauderdale. He is planning to move to a new luxury building in the downtown area.\nFort Lauderdale, Panozzo said, \u201chas this beautiful mix of natural beauty and cultural energy. There\u2019s great food, a growing arts and tech scene, and a rhythm to the city that feels both grounded and forward-thinking.\u201d\n\u201cAs someone who came up during a time when rock was pushing every boundary, I feel that same sense of possibility here now,\u201d he added."

      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce reportedly spotted house-hunting in Ohio \u2014 here are the ritziest areas even an A-lister could love\nLovebirds Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have reportedly toured at least two homes in Cleveland\u2019s Eastside suburbs in June.\nThe pop icon and football star were seen having lunch at a cute French bistro in Chagrin Falls, an idyllic village near Kelce\u2019s hometown in Cleveland Heights.\nSources told The Post that local consensus puts the pair in Hunting Valley, Ohio for their house hunt. The village in the Chagrin River Valley is known for its palatial properties and a 5 acre minimum.\nWhile the median sale price in Cleveland is just $131,675, prices skyrocket in these outer suburbs. Trust funds and lacrosse scholarships abound in areas like historic Shaker Heights, bucolic Waite Hill, ritzy Hunting Valley and affluent Bratenahl \u2014 all of which potentially boast the perfect home for a post-NFL retirement and another feather in Swift\u2019s $80 million real estate cap.\nFollow Taylor Swift live updates from Page Six for the latest news, photos, fan theories and more\nDavid Ayers of The Agency compared the idyllic Eastside villages under the couple\u2019s potential consideration to the Hudson Valley in New York, for one sixteenth of the price.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very stealth wealth, old money, and it\u2019s really an amazingly kept secret that no one knows about,\u201d Ayers told The Post.\nHoward Hanna broker Adam Kaufman sells some of the area\u2019s most expensive properties. Kaufman was skeptical of the pair\u2019s prospective purchase, despite their dining adventure in Chagrin Falls.\n\u201cI think that rumor got going, and it really just escalated,\u201d Kaufman said.\nBut Cleveland and its suburbs would, hypothetically, have a lot to offer the jet-setting couple, he added. The city offers a thriving arts scene, with enviable theatrical and orchestral offerings.\n\u201cIt is an amazing place, and it\u2019s really starting to get the recognition it deserves,\u201d he said, pointing to a strong seller\u2019s market in the area.\nBut should the pair consider an Ohio home, there are more than a few solid contenders.\nA stately manor in Hunting Valley\nThis sprawling estate in Hunting Valley comes with a private tennis court, a swimming pool and more than 7.5 acres of lush green land. Originally built in 1924, the $3.45 million property evokes \u201cgrandeur of a bygone era,\u201d according to The Agency listing.\nA Hamptons-style estate in Chagrin Falls\nThe village of Chagrin Falls, the site of Swift and Kelce\u2019s buzzy lunch date, hosts this custom-built \u201cHamptons style\u201d home on 2 riverside acres. The $6.5 million Howard Hanna listing features tasteful interiors across a roomy 13,600 square feet, including a two-island kitchen, four bedroom suites, a wine cellar and a guest house.\nA modern mansion in Moreland Hills\nThis contemporary home located half an hour from Cleveland comes with 2.44 acres of land and more than 16,000 square feet of living space. The $6.25 million listing, held by The Agency, dubs the property a \u201ccontemporary masterpiece,\u201d with open-concept living spaces, soaring ceilings and an impressive pool.\nA classic English tudor\nAnother possibility in Chagrin Falls comes with old English charm. The circa-1917 manor, listed by Howard Hanna for $3.39 million, comes with 24 acres of river frontage and a striking Tudor facade. The roughly 8,000-square-foot home features beamed vaulted ceilings, stately fireplaces and a billiards room.\nA Lake Eerie oasis\nThis Gilded Age \u201cgrande dame\u201d for $5.99 million is filled with modern upgrades and old world craftsmanship. The 3.5-acre, eight-bedroom property on the coast of Lake Erie boasts intricately carved millwork, cut glass leaded windows and marble flooring throughout its grand public rooms. The luxe Bratenahl property, listed by The Agency, also comes with a restored guest cottage and a massive pool patio."
