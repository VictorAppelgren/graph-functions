  "title": "You Can Now Pick Your Preferred News Sources on Google. Here's How",
  "description": "Publications you mark as 'preferred sources' will now appear directly in the Top Stories block.",
  "content": "Google is making it easier to spot news articles from your favorite outlets. A new feature now lets you set your \"preferred sources\" for the Top Stories block on the search results page.\n\nThe feature is rolling out to users in the US and India, with broader availability expected soon.\n\nTo get started, search for a topic on Google. If it's trending, you'll see relevant news stories in a Top Stories section. Click the icon that looks like two overlapping cards with a star on top.\n\nA pop-up will ask you to \"Choose your preferred sources\" by typing the name or URL of your favorite website ( like PCMag ). Tap Reload results at the bottom of the pop-up.\n\nTap the card star icon again to add more sources ; you can add as many as you like. To remove a source, return to the pop-up menu and uncheck a source in the list below.\n\nOnce set, if your preferred sources cover a topic you search for, they will appear more prominently in Top Stories or in a dedicated \"From your sources\" section below Top Stories, Google says. You'll still see articles from other sources as well.\n\nGoogle began testing the feature as a Labs experiment in June. During the test, more than half of users added four or more sources, Google says. This comes as many of Google Search's recent additions have been AI features that impacted publisher traffic. Google insists that \"AI in Search is driving more queries and higher quality clicks,\" though it's declined to offer specifics about which sites have been impacted.\n\nPublishers can use a shortcut link in social promotions or include a dedicated button on their website to ensure their readers add them as a preferred source. Instructions for both are provided on this support page .",

      "text": "6 ways to get a more customized Search experience\nWhen you're searching, staying up to date with your personal interests and favorite sites is top of mind. While our systems aim to automatically bring you the most helpful results, what's relevant for you might be different from someone else who's using Search. Whether you want to quickly pick up where you left off, shop your personal style, catch up on your local news or get the latest from your favorite sports team, here are some of the ways you can have a more customized Search experience and find the information you're looking for.\nStart with a new experiment in Labs, then explore options that we\u2019ve long offered in Search \u2014 and that people still find helpful today. Your personalization experience on Search is always in your control and you can adjust your settings at any time.\n1. New: See more content from your favorite sites\nWith a new \u201cPreferred Sources\u201d experiment in Labs (available in English in the U.S. and India), you can now choose to see more results in Top Stories from the sites you love, whether that\u2019s your favorite sports blog or local newspaper.\nIf you opt in to the experiment, you can tap the starred icon to the right of the Top Stories header. Then, you\u2019ll have the option to select your preferred sources (if a site is publishing fresh content). You\u2019ll start to see more of the latest updates from your selected sites in Top Stories when they have new articles or posts that are relevant to your search. Your sources will be clearly labeled and will appear in addition to other results in Top Stories, so you can see what your favorite sites have to say along with a range of sources.\nUpdate August 12, 2025: As of August 12, we\u2019ve rolled this out to users in the US and India, no labs sign-up required.\n2. Stay up to date on evolving topics\nWhen you have Search personalization turned on and you search for a topic you\u2019ve searched for before, features such as Top Stories and What People Are Saying will automatically update to show new content since your last visit. And when you look at your recent searches (in the drop down under the Search bar), we\u2019ll let you know if new updates are available in Top Stories.\n3. Pick up where you left off\nTo help you quickly find and visit your favorite sites, with personalization on Search, results you return to often will be promoted in your results when relevant for your search.\n4. Follow your favorite sports teams in Discover\nIf you\u2019re an avid sports fan, our systems will show a feature in Discover that allows you to pick your favorite teams to follow, across a range of different sports and leagues. Discover will then show you scores, game highlights and more.\n5. Shop for your personal style\nWhen you search for certain apparel, shoes or accessories, you\u2019ll see a section labeled \u201csave your favorite styles.\u201d Choose items that match your personal style, and Search will remember your preferences to provide a more personalized shopping experience next time.\n6. Curate your personal shopping feed\nGoogle Shopping makes it easy to shop what you love. The shopping homepage delivers a personalized feed of videos and products inspired by your interests and hobbies, like fashion, gaming, home decor and more. Just select categories you love to shop and you\u2019ll see products tailored to your interests. Easily browse deals, check prices and discover new trends in one convenient place.\nThese are just some of the ways that you can easily find and connect with the information and topics that are most relevant to you and your interests on Search."

      "text": "Search ain't what it used to be. In the not-so-distant past, your query would return a simple list of links, which you could peruse at your convenience. Now, a search can yield a myriad of result types, from AI summaries to obnoxious or even malicious ads, with the links buried in between. There are ways to make search more useful, but they aren't always obvious.\nThat's why I'm curious about Google's latest search addition. Last week, Google announced that its feature, Preferred Sources, is rolling out to all English users in the U.S. and India. If you frequently test features with Google Labs, you might remember trying this one out: Preferred Sources, as the name implies, lets you tell Google which websites you prefer to read news from. The goal, then, is to see pages from those sites in future Google searches about news stories, assuming those sites publish content related to your search.\nHow to choose your preferred news sources in Google search\nHere's how it works: When you search for something covered in the news, Google will display a \"Top stories\" section at the top of the search results page. While you can simply browse the stories that Google curates for you, you can also now click a new button to the right of the \"Top stories\" title. From here, you can search for any website, and click a checkbox next to its name to save it to your list of preferred sources. Google doesn't put a cap on the number of sources you can add, so you can fill your list with as many sites as you want. You'll also see any sources you previously saved here (including during the Labs experiment period) and you can uncheck them as you wish.\nNow, you can refresh your search results, which, with any luck, will populate with more of the sources you added to this list. Not only will they appear more frequently in the \"Top stories\" section going forward, Google may offer you a new \"From your sources\" section as well, which should only contain the websites you've added to your list. As this feature saves your preferences, you do need to be signed into your Google Account, though it seems to work across a variety of browsers. (Safari and Firefox both worked fine for me.)\nIt's not necessarily groundbreaking, but I do see the utility here. Any chance you get to personalize your search experience is probably worth taking advantage of, and with Preferred Sources, you can (and should) improve the odds the websites you know and trust appear alongside any given news story. It's also an interesting juxtaposition alongside other changes to Google Search, such as Web Guide, an AI-powered Search experience that automatically groups links into different categories.\nIt can be difficult to find high-quality information on the web these days, but I have to say, between these two features, Google is making some decent changes here."

      "text": "Facing criticism for degraded search results and angst from users wanting to avoid AI Overviews, Google has announced a new search feature that lets you choose the sites you want to see in your news and search results.\nGoogle said in a recent blog post that it's launching Preferred Sources in the US and India this month. The new feature can be accessed through a plus icon to the right of Top Stories panels or a direct link to your preferences.\n\"Once you select your sources, they will appear more frequently in Top Stories or in a dedicated 'From your sources' section on the search results page. You'll still see content from other sites, and can manage your selections at any time,\" Google said.\nThe new feature is the result of a Labs experiment. Google says that in that version, half of its users added four or more sources. Google offered advice to website publishers and owners on how to direct readers to add their site.\nHow you can select your own preferred sources on Google Search\nIt's simple to add preferred sources for Google Search. You can click the star icon to the right of any \"Top Stories\" panel in Google Search, which will spawn a pop-up window to add sources, or you can visit the settings page directly at https://www.google.com/preference/source.\nOnce you see the search box that says \"Search by name or website,\" type the name or URL of a site you definitely want to include in your search results -- such as CNET or its sibling tech sites ZDNET, Mashable, PCMag and Lifehacker -- then select the checkbox next to each site you want to add.\nTo view and manage your preferred sources, click on the \"Your sources\" link at the bottom of the preferences page. To remove any of your preferred sources, simply uncheck the checkbox for any sites you want to delete.\nYou can use any web browser on desktop or mobile to take advantage of Google's new preferred sources feature, but you will need to be signed in to your Google account.\nWhat it means for news sites and their readers\nNews organizations and other information sites have shifted before to cater to Google's search algorithm as well as those on other platforms including Facebook and Instagram. Publishers executed a pivot to video in the 2010s, and in recent years produced more bite-sized content suitable for sharing on platforms such as TikTok.\nThe addition of news preferences might be a double-edged sword, giving you more control over search results while further shutting out some legitimate news publishers as new echo chambers get built.\n\"It's almost like a tone-deaf move by Google in my point of view, because news organizations are already concerned about losing traffic to the AI overviews,\" said Alex Mahadevan, director of MediaWise at Poynter, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media literacy program. \"Now they have to figure out how to get people to pick their source in the source preferences.\"\nFor bigger news publishers who have a loyal audience, Preferred Sources might prove that audience engagement efforts can pay off. But Mahadevan says it will depend on how willing people are to effectively subscribe to and curate their own news sources list.\n\"I question how many people will actually use it,\" he said.\nPeople may see their own beliefs reinforced, not challenged\nPublishers who haven't cultivated engaged, loyal followers and don't have the means to steer their audiences might suffer, Mahadevan says.\n\"The thing that does concern me about this is you know for the organizations that may have not done that, it's just going to further erode the amount of Google traffic they get,\" Mahadevan said. \"If way more people want news from Fox News and are choosing Fox News among their source preferences, then that's going to be crowding out other news sites that might need that traffic.\"\nAs an experiment, Mahadevan says he set Breitbart News Network as a source using the Google Search feature, saying he chose the far-right news source because it has been known to share misinformation.\n\"I started Googling about tariffs, and the first thing I see is Breitbart,\" he said. \"So this concerns me also from a media literacy standpoint because I think it might further push people into echo chambers,\" where they only see beliefs that correspond with those they already hold.\n\"It just seems like a way for people to narrow down their news diet even more via Google Search,\" Mahadevan said.\nIf SEO, the way that websites have for decades drawn Google traffic by generating good, relevant content, is effectively out the window, what does that mean for the future of publishing and media?\n\"Is there a strong enough media literacy base for people to make sure they're choosing good, legitimate news outlets and a varied variety of news sources?\" Mahadevan asked. \"I don't know if we're quite there yet.\""

      "text": "AI in Search is driving more queries and higher quality clicks\nAI is driving the most significant upgrade of the Google Search experience ever. With AI Overviews and more recently AI Mode, people are able to ask questions they could never ask before. And the response has been tremendous: Our data shows people are happier with the experience and are searching more than ever as they discover what Search can do now.\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve recently heard some questions about what this means for traffic to websites from Google. So we wanted to share some insights on the data we\u2019re seeing, as well as more about our approach with AI in Search.\nTraffic trends from Google Search\nOverall, total organic click volume from Google Search to websites has been relatively stable year-over-year. Additionally, average click quality has increased and we\u2019re actually sending slightly more quality clicks to websites than a year ago (by quality clicks, we mean those where users don\u2019t quickly click back \u2014 typically a signal that a user is interested in the website). This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic \u2014 often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search.\nSo what\u2019s going on? With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked. For some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like \u201cwhen is the next full moon,\u201d people may be satisfied with the initial response and not click further. This has also been true for other answer features we\u2019ve added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase. This is why we see click quality increasing \u2014 an AI response might provide the lay of the land, but people click to dive deeper and learn more, and when they do, these clicks are more valuable.\nWhile overall traffic to sites is relatively stable, the web is vast, and user trends are shifting traffic to different sites, resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others. People are increasingly seeking out and clicking on sites with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts where they can hear authentic voices and first-hand perspectives. People are also more likely to click into web content that helps them learn more \u2014 such as an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective or a thoughtful first-person analysis. Sites that meet these evolving user needs are benefiting from this shift and are generally seeing an increase in traffic.\nBuilding AI in Search to highlight the web\nAs a search company, we care passionately \u2014 perhaps more than any other company \u2014 about the health of the web ecosystem. We continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day and believe that Search\u2019s value exchange with the web remains strong.\nWe take a distinct approach in how we build our AI experiences: they\u2019re built to highlight the web. In other words, it\u2019s not the web or AI \u2014 it\u2019s both. We\u2019ve trained our models to deeply understand the web and when and how to link to the most relevant sites. And our AI responses feature prominent links, visible citation of sources, and in-line attribution. This isn\u2019t just helpful for websites; it also helps users learn where information is coming from and how they can explore further. And websites always have control over how content is highlighted or included in Search with open web protocols, which we respect and follow. We\u2019re committed to highlighting high-quality content on the web and we will continue to refine how we do it.\nThe web has existed for over three decades, and we believe we\u2019re entering its most exciting era yet. Technology shifts bring change, but they also bring extraordinary opportunity. We believe that AI will be one of the most expansionary moments for the web, empowering us all to ask vastly more questions and creators to reach more deeply engaged audiences. We\u2019ll continue to help businesses, creators and websites seize these opportunities as we build this future together."
