Along the way, I\u2019ll explain the meanings of the trickier words and we\u2019ll learn how everything fits together. Beware, there are spoilers below for August 12, NYT Connections #793! Read on if you want some hints (and then the answer) to today\u2019s Connections game.\n\nIf you want an easy way to come back to our Connections hints every day, . (If you play , , or , check out our hints for those games, too.)\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll give you some oblique hints at today\u2019s Connections answers. And farther down the page, I\u2019ll reveal the themes and the answers. Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\n\nHere are spoiler-free hints that describe the type of each category in today\u2019s Connections:\n\nHints for the themes in today\u2019s Connections puzzle\n\nHere are some spoiler-free hints for the groupings in today\u2019s Connections:\n\nWe\u2019re about to give away some of the answers. Scroll slowly if you don\u2019t want the whole thing spoiled. (The full solution is a bit further down.)\n\nA heads up about the tricky parts\n\nBOWLING PINS, BOWLING BALL, BOWLING ALLEY, and BOWLING GREEN all belong to different categories.\n\nBOWLING GREEN is a specific landmark within New York City.\n\nSWIMMING POOL refers specifically to an Olympic-style one you might see at a YMCA.\n\nWhat are the categories in today\u2019s Connections?\n\nDOUBLE BEWARE: THE SOLUTION IS BELOW\n\nReady to learn the answers to today\u2019s Connections puzzle? I give them all away below.\n\nWhat are the yellow words in today\u2019s Connections?\n\nThe yellow grouping is considered to be the most straightforward. The theme for today\u2019s yellow group is GROUPS OF TEN and the words are: BOWLING PINS, COMMANDMENTS, DECADE, FINGERS.\n\nWhat are the green words in today\u2019s Connections?\n\nThe green grouping is supposed to be the second-easiest. The theme for today\u2019s green category is PLACES WITH LANES and the words are: BOWLING ALLEY, HIGHWAY, SUPERMARKET, SWIMMING POOL.\n\nWhat are the blue words in today\u2019s Connections?\n\nThe blue grouping is the second-hardest. The theme for today\u2019s blue category is LANDMARKS IN DOWNTOWN NYC and the words are: BOWLING GREEN, BROOKLYN BRIDGE, CITY HALL, WALL STREET.\n\nWhat are the purple words in today\u2019s Connections?\n\nThe purple grouping is considered to be the hardest. The theme for today\u2019s purple category is THINGS WITH HOLES and the words are: BOWLING BALL, COLANDER, GOLF COURSE, SPONGE.\n\nCITY HALL, BOWLING GREEN, BROOKLYN BRIDGE, and WALL STREET could all be locations within downtown New York City, but that seems a bit hyperlocal. I\u2019ll keep looking just in case.\n\nCOMMANDMENTS, FINGERS, BOWLING PINS, and DECADE seem like they go together as words made up of 10 things. 10 COMMANDMENTS, 10 FINGERS, 10 BOWLING PINS, and 10 years in a DECADE. \ud83d\udfe8\n\nMaybe BOWLING BALL, SPONGE, COLANDER, and GOLF COURSE go together as things with holes or pores. \ud83d\udfea Nice.\n\nAh, I\u2019ve got it now: HIGHWAY, SWIMMING POOL, SUPERMARKET, and BOWLING ALLEY are all things with lanes. \ud83d\udfe9\n\nThat means there is a New York category, with BOWLING GREEN, CITY HALL, WALL STREET, and BROOKLYN BRIDGE. \ud83d\udfe6\n\nI have a full , but here\u2019s a refresher on the rules:\n\nFirst, find the Connections game either on the New York Times website or in their Games app (formerly the Crossword app). You\u2019ll see a game board with 16 tiles, each with one word or phrase. Your job is to select a group of four tiles that have something in common. Often they are all the same type of thing (for example: RAIN, SLEET, HAIL, and SNOW are all types of wet weather) but sometimes there is wordplay involved (for example, BUCKET, GUEST, TOP TEN, and WISH are all types of lists: bucket list, guest list, and so on).\n\nSelect four items and hit the Submit button. If you guessed correctly, the category and color will be revealed. (Yellow is easiest, followed by green, then blue, then purple.) If your guess was incorrect, you\u2019ll get a chance to try again.\n\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly identified all four groups. But if you make four mistakes before you finish, the game ends and the answers are revealed.\n\nThe most important thing to know to win Connections is that the groupings are designed to be tricky. Expect to see overlapping groups. For example, one puzzle seemed to include six breakfast foods: BACON, EGG, PANCAKE, OMELET, WAFFLE, and CEREAL. But BACON turned out to be part of a group of painters along with CLOSE, MUNCH, and WHISTLER, and EGG was in a group of things that come by the dozen (along with JUROR, ROSE, and MONTH). So don\u2019t hit \u201csubmit\u201d until you\u2019ve confirmed that your group of four contains only those four things.\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck, another strategy is to look at the words that seem to have no connection to the others. If all that comes to mind when you see WHISTLER is the painting nicknamed \u201cWhistler\u2019s Mother,\u201d you might be on to something. When I solved that one, I ended up googling whether there was a painter named Close, because Close didn\u2019t fit any of the obvious themes, either.\n\nAnother way to win when you\u2019re stuck is, obviously, to read a few helpful hints\u2013which is why we share these pointers every day. Check back tomorrow for the next puzzle!\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Connections.",

To celebrate this exceptional loan to the museum\u2014the first time in 142 years that the painting will be seen in this city\u2014the exhibition will explore the circumstances surrounding the portrait\u2019s creation and its legacy in Philadelphia.\nJust as Whistler was inspired by Rembrandt\u2019s etchings of his own mother, so too were local artists spurred by Whistler and their own ambitions to make depictions of their mothers. Some would respond directly to Whistler\u2019s Mother while others took an entirely different approach. The installation will bring Whistler\u2019s iconic portrait into dialogue with paintings, drawings, and etchings by artists associated with Philadelphia\u2014Cecilia Beaux, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Dox Thrash, Alice Neel, Sidney Goodman, and others\u2014and invite consideration of the individual women represented and the relationship between artist and sitter; child and parent.\nGallery 251\nMain Building\nThe Artist\u2019s Mother: Whistler and Philadelphia is generously supported by the Laura and William C. Buck Endowment for Exhibitions and other generous donors.\nJennifer A. Thompson, Gloria and Jack Drosdick Curator of European Painting and Sculpture and Curator of the John G. Johnson Collection"

      "text": "The NYT's Connections is a brain-stretching game, the kind that will make you go \"well, of course these words belong together,\" and then: \"oh, wait.\" All you have to do is divide the 16 words or phrases into four groups of four, but the groupings can be tricky. I'm going to explain how the game works, but also how you'll need to think about it to play it well.\nI have an explainer here on the difference between Wordle, Strands, and Connections\u2014all are NYT word games, but each one has a different flavor of gameplay and rewards different skills. Connections is best if you like wordplay and references to general knowledge. But you also have to have a high tolerance for being tricked, because this game makes liberal use of words' double meanings, in deliberately devious ways. And if you get stumped, you can always check out our daily hints.\nWhere to play Connections\nConnections is a New York Times game, so it's available on the paper\u2019s Games page and in their Games app. A new, numbered puzzle is available every day, much like the daily Wordles.\nHow to play Connections\nThe game presents you with 16 tiles that each have a word or short phrase on them. On each move, your job is to select four tiles that you think form a group. Groups are usually the same type of thing (like HAIL, RAIN, SLEET, SNOW) but there\u2019s usually at least one grouping that relies on wordplay. For example, one puzzle grouped DOUBT, SHADOW, MOVIE, and VOTE\u2014those are all things you can cast.\nIf you\u2019re wrong, the tiles will shake. If you're close, you'll get a message that says \"one away\" to let you know you had three of them right. If you\u2019re right, a colored bar will appear near the top of the board (showing the four words as well as revealing their theme) and any remaining tiles in play will rearrange into the bottom of the board.\nYou have four mistakes available. When you run out, the game is over, and you\u2019ll get to see the answers you missed.\nEven though there are four groups, you only need to figure out three of them. By the end, there will be four tiles remaining that have to be in the same group. For some extra puzzle-y fun, try to figure out the theme before you submit that last group for your gimme point.\nWhy Connections can be so frustrating (and how to avoid dumb mistakes)\nThe game is designed to be tricky. The puzzle designers will often put in a group of five or more words that fit the same category, but obviously only four of them can make up a legal group. Or they'll take four things that could go together, but assign each one to a different category based on a double meaning that each word has.\nTo give you an example, in my first-ever attempt at this game, I submitted an obvious grouping: RAIN, HEAT, SNOW, and SLEET. Not a valid group, the game told me. Huh?\nBut a moment later that \u201cHuh?\u201d was replaced with an \u201cAha!\u201d as HEAT matched up with JAZZ, BUCKS, and NETS to make a set of NBA teams. Elsewhere on the board I saw HAIL was not there as a gesture or greeting, but was the proper partner for the wet-weather words. RACE CAR, which seemed to be an outlier\u2014there were no other vehicles\u2014turned out to be part of a set of palindromes.\nHow to win at Connections\nAs I discovered on my first play, the point isn\u2019t to look for just any four-word grouping, but to try to discover the groupings that the puzzle makers had in mind. So don\u2019t be too trigger-happy when you see your first possible connection. Look at the items you\u2019ve identified; could any of them fit elsewhere?\nIt\u2019s also strategic to mentally put a name to the thing your four potential matches have in common. The game\u2019s help screen hints that the categories will never be as broad as \u201cnames\u201d or \u201cverbs,\u201d so make sure you\u2019ve pinned down something specific. Note that my initial guess was just \u201cweather,\u201d but the real grouping turned out to be \u201cwet weather.\u201d The game will name the theme after you correctly guess the grouping.\nOne Redditor suggests jotting down potential groupings on a piece of scratch paper, even if you end up with more or fewer than four words in each of those groups. Once you see them all written down, something might jump out at you.\nI tried this on a Connections puzzle that had a bunch of words that might be cat names, and some religious words whose exact theme was unclear. The rest were a mystery to me. So I started writing down possible groups:\nCats: Sylvester, Chester, Felix, Garfield, Tom (Five? That's too many.)\nReligious words: altar, reliquary, abbey, temple, shrine (Again, too many!)\n???: high\n???: rocky\n???: silk\nPresidential first names: Grover, Calvin, Harry...and, wait, Chester!\nAs soon as I began writing that last group\u2014the presidential first names\u2014I realized that Chester could fit there too. Taking Chester off the cat list leaves me with only four cats, so I returned to my game board and guessed the presidents and then the cats. Both were correct.\nAll that was left to do was to figure out which of the religious words could fit with high, rocky, and silk. Those three are all (literal or metaphorical) roads, so their partner is Abbey Road. Get it?\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Connections."
