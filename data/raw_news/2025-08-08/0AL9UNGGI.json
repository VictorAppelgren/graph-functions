  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nAs global energy demand increases, researchers, industries, governments, and stakeholders are working together to develop new ways of meeting that demand. This is especially important as we address the ongoing climate crisis and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nOne very promising type of energy generation is solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Unlike batteries, which release stored chemical energy as electricity, fuel cells convert chemical fuel directly into electricity and continue to do so as long as fuel is provided. A common type of fuel cell with which many people are familiar is hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen gas into energy and water.\n\nWhile SOFCs are promising due to their high efficiency and long lifespan, one major drawback is that they require operation at high temperatures of around 700\u2013800\u2103. Therefore, the utility of these devices would require costly heat-resistant materials.\n\nIn research published in Nature Materials, researchers at Kyushu University report that they have succeeded in developing a new SOFC with an efficient operating temperature of 300\u2103. The team expects that their new findings will lead to the development of low-cost, low-temperature SOFCs and greatly accelerate the practical application of these devices.\n\nThe heart of an SOFC is the electrolyte, a ceramic layer that carries charged particles between two electrodes. In hydrogen fuel cells, the electrolyte transports hydrogen ions (a.k.a. protons) to generate energy. However, the fuel cell needs to operate at extremely high temperatures to run efficiently.\n\n\"Bringing the working temperature down to 300\u2103 would slash material costs and open the door to consumer-level systems,\" explains Professor Yoshihiro Yamazaki from Kyushu University's Platform of Inter-/Transdisciplinary Energy Research, who led the study. \"However, no known ceramic could carry enough protons that fast in such 'warm' conditions. So, we set out to break that bottleneck.\"\n\nElectrolytes are composed of different combinations of atoms arranged in a crystal lattice structure. It's between these atoms that a proton would travel. Researchers have explored different combinations of materials and chemical dopants\u2014substances that can alter the material's physical properties\u2014to improve the speed at which protons travel through electrolytes.\n\n\"But this also comes with a challenge,\" continues Yamazaki. \"Adding chemical dopants can increase the number of mobile protons passing through an electrolyte, but it usually clogs the crystal lattice, slowing the protons down. We looked for oxide crystals that could host many protons and let them move freely\u2014a balance that our new study finally struck.\"\n\nThe team found that two compounds, barium stannate (BaSnO ) and barium titanate (BaTiO ), when doped with high concentrations of scandium (Sc), were able to achieve the SOFC benchmark proton conductivity of more than 0.01 S/cm at 300\u2103, a conductivity level comparable to today's common SOFC electrolytes at 600\u2013700\u2103.\n\n\"Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Sc atoms link their surrounding oxygens to form a 'ScO\u2086 highway,' along which protons travel with an unusually low migration barrier. This pathway is both wide and softly vibrating, which prevents the proton-trapping that normally plagues heavily doped oxides,\" explains Yamazaki. \"Lattice-dynamics data further revealed that BaSnO\u2083 and BaTiO\u2083 are intrinsically 'softer' than conventional SOFC materials, letting them absorb far more Sc than previously assumed.\"\n\nThe findings overturn the trade-off between dopant level and ion transport, offering a clear path for low-cost, intermediate-temperature SOFCs.\n\n\"Beyond fuel cells, the same principle can be applied to other technologies, such as low-temperature electrolyzers, hydrogen pumps, and reactors that convert CO\u2082 into valuable chemicals, thereby multiplying the impact of decarbonization. Our work transforms a long-standing scientific paradox into a practical solution, bringing affordable hydrogen power closer to everyday life,\" concludes Yamazaki.",

      "text": "Abstract\nAdvances in electrochemical devices have been primarily driven by the discovery and development of electrolyte materials. Yet the development of high-performance and chemically stable proton-conducting oxide electrolytes remains a challenge due to proton trapping and the resulting trade-offs between ionic carrier concentration and conductivity in doped oxides. Here we demonstrate that cubic perovskite oxides with heavy Sc doping can overcome these limitations. BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 and BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2013\u03b4 are found to exceed the technological threshold of a total proton conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 for fuel cell electrolytes at 300 \u00b0C. The structural stability of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 is further validated under harsh chemical and fuel cell conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field illustrate rapid proton diffusion pathways along the ScO6 octahedral network, effectively mitigating proton trapping, while protons are preferentially associated with Sc. Lattice softness is proposed as a primary design descriptor for increasing Sc content in perovskite oxides and developing high-performance electrolytes for electrochemical devices.\nMain\nThe discovery and development of novel electrolyte materials has historically led to advancements in electrochemical devices1,2,3,4,5. Examples include lithium-ion conduction in the Li\u2013Ge\u2013P\u2013S system4 and proton conduction in SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite oxide1, which have paved the way for all-solid-state batteries5, intermediate-temperature proton ceramic fuel cells6 and electrolysers for fuel production7. An ideal electrolyte should exhibit both high ionic conductivity and enduring chemical and electrochemical stability during device operation. However, meeting these criteria remains a challenge. Liquid electrolytes8 offer high ionic conductivity but can compromise device integrity owing to potential leakage. By contrast, a solid electrolyte eliminates such risks but requires overcoming substantial activation barriers for ionic carrier migration. Hydride-conducting compounds9 offer a conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 between room temperature and 400 \u00b0C but are unstable under oxidizing conditions. Proton-conducting CsH2PO4 fulfils the requirements within only a narrow operating temperature and water solubility window of 233\u2013254 \u00b0C at a water partial pressure of 0.4 atm (ref. 10), limiting its broader application. Currently, no stable solid-state and/or protonic electrolytes exist that can operate under fuel cell and electrolyser conditions at 300 \u00b0C.\nProton-conducting perovskite oxides11,12 exhibit a high proton conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 at 450 \u00b0C with strong chemical stability, as reported for Y-doped barium zirconate2,13. Perovskite oxides with a cubic or pseudo-cubic structure represented by the general chemical formula ABO3, where A and B are cations, are characterized by a network of corner-sharing BO6 octahedra with A-cation sublattices. Upon doping with cations of lower valency (that is, acceptor doping), usually on the B site, oxygen vacancies are generated to maintain charge neutrality, as represented using the Kr\u00f6ger\u2013Vink notation:\nThese oxygen vacancies are filled with hydroxyl groups when exposed to moisture (hydration reaction):\nThe incorporated protons are often strongly associated with acceptor dopants14 that reside on the nearest or second nearest neighbour oxygen to the acceptor dopant14,15,16,17:\nFurther details of this general defect chemistry for acceptor-doped perovskite oxides can be found in Supplementary Section 1. This association effect acts to stabilize the hydrated state16, where the maximum proton content equals the amount of acceptor dopant in the case of a trivalent cation substituting at a tetravalent cation site. The protons can diffuse throughout the material via a combination of rotation and hopping to neighbouring proton sites (Grotthuss mechanism11) on the three-dimensional network of BO6 octahedra.\nThe development of proton-conducting perovskite oxides has followed a design principle aimed at enhancing proton conductivity by increasing lattice volume through the incorporation of larger host cations and acceptor dopants within the perovskite structure11 (Fig. 1a). However, the proton conductivity in barium zirconate peaks at a Y-doping level of 20 at.% (refs. 2,18), substantially below its solubility limit of approximately 50 at.% (ref. 19), and any further increase in Y doping reduces its conductivity20, which implies that carrier diffusivity also decreases (Fig. 1b,d). This has conventionally been explained as the detrimental effect of the proton\u2013dopant association leading to proton trapping14,16. More recent theoretical works have pointed out the formation of deeper proton traps surrounded by Y clusters as the underlying mechanism for the decrease in conductivity at high dopant concentrations21. This trade-off is inherent in proton-conducting oxides, where the proton\u2013dopant association stabilizes protons in oxides, enabling the hydration of oxides but impeding proton diffusion in the lattice (proton trapping), as found for proton-conducting barium zirconates2,14,18,20,22. A similar phenomenon is also observed for oxide-ion conduction in doped zirconia and ceria23.\nThe recent discovery of superior proton conduction in heavily (60 at.%) Sc-doped barium zirconate3 offers a promising avenue for overcoming the trade-off in doped ionic conductors. In BaZr0.4Sc0.6O3\u2013\u03b4, the proton concentration, diffusivity and conductivity all increase continuously up to approximately the solubility limit (Fig. 1b\u2013d). It is proposed that heavy acceptor doping facilitates proton diffusion in barium zirconates and analogous materials, based on computations24 and experiments3,25. These results suggest that heavy Sc doping promises to overcome the trade-off in doped ionic conductors.\nIn this study we performed systematic searches for Ba-based host perovskite oxides capable of dissolving substantial amounts of Sc. We found that heavy Sc doping, up to 70, 80 and 50 at.%, is possible in barium stannate, barium titanate and barium hafnate, respectively. The resultant total proton conductivities in the barium stannate and barium titanate exceed the technological threshold26 of 0.01 S cm\u22121 for fuel cell electrolytes at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 1a), overcoming the well-known and problematic H+ concentration\u2013conductivity trade-off in doped oxides. Doped barium stannates27,28 and barium titanates29 have long been overlooked due to their lower proton conductivities and less favourable hydration behaviour at dopant contents up to ~20 at.%, and proton conductivity investigations under heavy doping close to the solubility limit had not been attempted. Molecular dynamics simulations employing state-of-the-art machine learning force fields reveal that the heavy Sc doping creates proton diffusion pathways along the ScO6 octahedral network that mitigate the influence of proton trapping on diffusion. A correlation between reduced bulk modulus and increased ScO6 content in the perovskite framework provides a design guideline for developing such electrolytes.\nHeavy Sc doping of BaSnO3, BaTiO3 and BaHfO3 perovskites\nThe 20 at.% and 70 at.% Sc-doped barium stannates, 60 at.% and 80 at.% Sc-doped barium titanates and 20 at.% and 50 at.% Sc-doped barium hafnates were synthesized using solid-state reactions. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement for dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 (Supplementary Fig. 1) show that these compounds primarily exhibit cubic perovskite phases in the space group \\({Pm}\\bar{3}m\\) (structural parameters are provided in Supplementary Table 1). BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 contain 5.1 wt%, 2.3 wt% and 5.3 wt%, respectively, of secondary BaSc2O4. By using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and considering the secondary phase, the chemical composition of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite was determined to be Ba1.00Sn0.311Sc0.695O3\u2212\u03b4 (Supplementary Table 2). The substitutional acceptor Sc doping and vacancy formation for barium stannates, titanates and hafnates, described in equation (1), are validated by the monotonic increase or decrease of lattice volume upon Sc doping (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nProton conductivities from a.c. impedance\nThe a.c. impedance spectroscopy, conducted under a humidified Ar atmosphere, reveals that heavy Sc doping at levels of 70 at.% and 80 at.% in stannate and titanate, respectively, results in fast proton conduction at 300 \u00b0C. For 20 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate and 60 at.% Sc-doped barium titanate, the proton conductivity is only 0.001 S cm\u22121 at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 3\u20138). However, increasing the Sc content to 70 at.% and 80 at.% enhances the proton conductivity by a factor of ten, reaching 0.01 and 0.016 S cm\u22121, respectively (Fig. 1b). This tenfold increase represents a substantial improvement compared to the Y-doped barium zirconate system, which peaks at a dopant level of 20 at.% Y (refs. 2,18). Within the Sc-doped systems, barium stannate outperforms barium hafnate and barium zirconate3 in proton conductivity for all Sc contents by a factor of 2\u201330 and 2\u20134, respectively (Fig. 1b). The temperature dependence of the proton conductivity in the stannates, titanates and hafnates (Supplementary Fig. 9) also highlights the advantage of heavy Sc doping regardless of operating temperature.\nBaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 and BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2013\u03b4 exhibit high total proton conductivities, exceeding 0.01 S cm\u22121, at and above 300 \u00b0C under a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 15). The total conductivity comprises both bulk and grain boundary resistivities in the polycrystalline pellet. Large grains with a mean grain size of 16.7 \u03bcm for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 (Supplementary Fig. 16) minimize the resistive contribution across grain boundaries to the overall proton resistivity in the polycrystalline pellet.\nProton concentrations from thermogravimetry\nThe thermogravimetry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10) provides compelling evidence that the defect chemistry and hydration processes of these materials adhere to the principles governing acceptor-doped perovskite oxide proton conductors, as described by equations (1) and (2). Proton concentration at 300 \u00b0C nearly equals the Sc content (Fig. 1c) for all perovskite oxides examined excluding barium titanates, indicating almost complete hydration in those systems. The hydration enthalpies for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 are determined by van\u2019t Hoff plots as \u2212125 \u00b1 1, \u2212131 \u00b1 3, \u221299 \u00b1 5, \u221271 \u00b1 2, \u2212112 \u00b1 2 and \u221280 \u00b1 2 kJ mol\u22121, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3), which are in the range of reported values for acceptor-doped perovskite oxides30,12. When comparing among heavily Sc-doped samples, barium titanates exhibit a much lower proton concentration (Fig. 1c) and less negative hydration enthalpy (Supplementary Fig. 12) than barium stannate and barium zirconate. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for Sc-doped barium stannates and barium titanates (Supplementary Fig. 13) also provides direct evidence of the hydration reaction of equation (2).\nProton diffusivities\nSc-doped barium stannate displays high proton diffusivity across a wide range of Sc concentrations. By using the Nernst\u2013Einstein relationship and measuring proton conductivities and concentrations (Fig. 1b,c), the proton diffusivities in barium stannates with 20 at.% and 70 at.% Sc at 300 \u00b0C were determined to be 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121, respectively (Fig. 1d). These proton diffusivities are 2.3 to 3.4 times greater than those in Sc-doped zirconates3, depending on Sc content. By contrast, barium titanates display a steep Sc dependence in proton diffusivity, similar to that observed in barium zirconates. Sc-doped barium hafnate shows the steepest dependence of diffusivity on Sc content, but the Sc solubility of 50 at.% limits the proton diffusivity to 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121. The temperature-dependent proton diffusivity (Supplementary Fig. 14) in the range between 200 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C provides apparent activation energies, plotted against Sc content in Fig. 1e. In these perovskites, Sc doping lowers the activation energy. The reduced activation energy (Fig. 1e) and enhanced proton diffusivity (Fig. 1d) appear to be a general advantage of heavy Sc doping in the perovskites. As a result, heavy Sc doping overcomes the trade-off between proton diffusivity and proton concentration reported in conventional systems, leading to a high conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 at 300 \u00b0C in barium stannate and barium titanate (Fig. 1f).\nConfirmation of proton conduction in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4\nAn isotope exchange experiment between D2O and H2O moisture at 301 \u00b0C, while maintaining a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm, yielded an isotope effect of 1.95 (Fig. 2b). This strongly suggests that protons are the primary ionic carriers. The higher value (~2) than the square root of the mass ratio between a deuterium and a proton, 1.41, is likely attributable to a more profound influence of the zero-point energy between them31 at 301 \u00b0C. Recent calculations that incorporate both nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicity report an isotope effect of 1.9 at 227 \u00b0C in barium zirconate32, which closely aligns with our experimental result in 70 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate at 300 \u00b0C. A continuous isotope exchange experiment over 261 h at 301 \u00b0C confirmed the chemical stability of proton insertion and extraction in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 (Fig. 2b).\nA constant total conductivity across a wide range of oxygen partial pressures ranging from highly reducing to oxidizing conditions between 10\u221222 and 1 atm at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 2c) indicates a proton transference number close to unity. As proof of ionic conduction, the open circuit voltage for a BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 electrolyte-supported protonic ceramic fuel cell at 300 \u00b0C matches the theoretical value (1.194 V) calculated from the Nernst equation for the given conditions (Supplementary Fig. 17). An anode-supported fuel cell, consisting of a thin BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3 electrolyte that includes 5 at.% Ni (Supplementary Fig. 18), shows an open circuit voltage of approximately 1 V at 300 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 4). The equivalence of the X-ray photoelectron spectra for reduced BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 and undoped BaSnO3 (ref. 33; Supplementary Fig. 20) offers further evidence that the Sn cation remains tetravalent. All the results, including the isotope effect of Fig. 2b, confirm that BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 is purely proton conductive at 300 \u00b0C, fulfilling another crucial requirement for fuel cell electrolytes.\nAcross a broad temperature spectrum, BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 exhibits a proton diffusivity that is twice as high as that found for state-of-the-art 60 at.% Sc-doped barium zirconate3 (Fig. 2d) and is equivalent to that for 20 at.% Y-doped barium zirconate14. The nonlinear Arrhenius plot of proton diffusivity for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 suggests the existence of some sort of proton trapping.\nProton transport examined by machine learning force field\nMolecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field were performed with realistic dopant configurations determined by Monte Carlo simulations17. Diffusivities predicted by the simulations for 60 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate and barium zirconate between 227 \u00b0C and 527 \u00b0C are in good agreement with the experimental results, although the absolute values are slightly overestimated (Fig. 3a; the data for the zirconate are taken from the literature12). The observation of the trajectory of protons in the molecular dynamics simulations confirms the Grotthuss mechanism, a combination of proton rotation around the donor oxygen and hopping between the oxygens (an animation is provided as Supplementary Data 3). A clear tendency of protons to reside near dopant Sc compared with Sn, that is, a proton\u2013dopant association, is evident from the analysis of H\u2013Sc and H\u2013Sn pair distribution functions for the stannate (Fig. 3b; similar results for the zirconate can be found in the literature12). This is consistent with the conventional understanding of proton\u2013dopant association in acceptor-doped perovskites15,16,17. The H\u2013Sn distribution increases slightly with increasing temperature, indicating that protons are slightly more randomly distributed, but a strong preference for H\u2013Sc association remains at 527 \u00b0C. A high proton diffusivity is observed despite such a strong association, and this can be explained by the fast proton-conducting pathways formed along the three-dimensional network of ScO6 (Fig. 3c,d).\nAtomistic structure of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4\nAn analysis of the atomistic structure and chemical composition using transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte had a perovskite-type structure with a high Sc content. Electron diffraction patterns were acquired from one crystal grain of the dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte with two different electron incidence angles approximately 90\u00b0 apart (Supplementary Fig. 21). All the Bragg reflections were reasonably indexed assuming a perovskite-type structure with the space group \\({Pm}\\bar{3}m\\). The lattice parameter of 0.42 nm deduced from the electron diffraction pattern was consistent with the X-ray diffraction result of 0.4143 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Both high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 22) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary Fig. 23) imaged the sublattices making up the perovskite-type structure: that is, A sites occupied by Ba and B sites occupied by Sn and Sc, although the sublattice of O was unclear from these observations. The results showed neither cation ordering, expected in the double perovskite-type structure, nor oxygen-vacancy ordering in the brownmillerite-type structure. An analysis of the HAADF-STEM images revealed a negligible change in the intensity of the B sites, suggesting that the distribution of Sn and Sc at the B sites is random. An EDS analysis determined the atomic ratio of Ba/Sn/Sc to be 1:0.30:0.67 (Supplementary Fig 22c,f and Supplementary Table 2), indicating that Sc constitutes 69 at.% of the B-site cations (Supplementary Table 5). The results are in good agreement with the chemical analysis using ICP-OES, considering the 5 wt% BaSc2O4 (Supplementary Table 2).\nCO2 tolerance of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 at 300 \u00b0C\nAn accelerated chemical stability test, conducted under harsh, humidified CO2 conditions at 300 \u00b0C using in situ X-ray diffractometry, confirmed the chemical stability of hydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4. The diffraction patterns for hydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 powder did not vary at 300 \u00b0C under a flow of highly concentrated CO2 for 398 h (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 24). The amount of the secondary BaSc2O4 phase, shown by the peak intensity at 31.3\u00b0, did not increase during the test (Fig. 4c). These results show the chemical stability of the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 powder, in agreement with the stability expected for the perovskite phases34; it is yet to be determined whether these results indicate thermodynamic or kinetic factors or both.\nDiscussion\nA distinct characteristic of Sc, particularly at higher concentrations, is its ability to create rapid diffusion pathways even when protons are strongly associated with acceptor dopants in the oxide. The measured proton diffusivity versus Sc content for various host cations (Figs. 1d and 5d) shows that the diffusivity at low Sc content (~20 at.%) is lower than that at higher Sc content (>50 at.%). This, in turn, indicates that proton trapping, which is unfavourable for proton diffusivity, is prevalent at lower Sc content but is mitigated at higher Sc content. Also notable is that the diffusivities exhibit a clear dependence on the host B-site cation at lower Sc content but converge to similar values at higher Sc content; this is a natural consequence of Sc becoming the major B-site cation under heavy doping. The microscopic picture responsible for this effect is evident from our molecular dynamics data for 60 at.% Sc-doped BaSnO3 (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d) and BaZrO3 (ref. 12). Sc doping increases the population of ScO6 octahedra, forming oxygen sites corner-shared by ScO6\u2013BO6 and ScO6\u2013ScO6 pairs. A further increase in Sc concentration creates a connected network of ScO6 octahedra, to which protons preferentially associate, as seen in our simulated data (Fig. 3c,d) and discussed in the literature15,16,17. Despite such a clear association, the calculated diffusivity is rather high as a result of proton migration along the ScO6 network without the need to completely detrap itself from the acceptor dopant.\nTo highlight the difference between Sc and Y dopants, we compare local migration barriers for Sc-doped and Y-doped BaZrO3, obtained from ab initio calculations on the dopant configuration shown in Fig. 5a,b. We find that associated protons along ScO6\u2013ScO6 octahedra pairs from sites 5 to 8 (pink region in Fig. 5a) exhibit the lowest site energy (proton\u2013dopant association), and the values are almost equal. Transitions between these sites encompass both proton rotation and hopping (Grotthuss mechanism) in the oxide. By contrast, Y-doped barium zirconate, which exhibits the concentration\u2013conductivity trade-off2,18, shows a large difference of 0.18 eV in the site energies of protons at YO6\u2013YO6 octahedra pairs (between sites 5 and 8 in Fig. 5b). Similar tendencies are observed in the ScO6\u2013ZrO6 and YO6\u2013ZrO6 pairs across sites 2 to 4 (grey regions in Fig. 5a,b). The overall activation energies for protons to move from one of the lowest energy sites to site 4 or 9 at the YO6\u2013ZrO6 pair (0.42\u20130.51 eV) exceed those for Sc (approximately 0.3 eV). These results show the importance of forming an interconnected ScO6 octahedral network within the cubic perovskite structure for enhanced proton diffusion. Although heavy acceptor M-doping into perovskite oxides always leads to the formation of an MO6 octahedral network, creating a relatively flat energy landscape that mitigates proton trapping is a distinct benefit of using Sc as a dopant, while the cubic perovskite oxide retains structural stability under harsh chemical and fuel cell conditions.\nSaito and Yashima25 have recently proposed starting from a hypothetical BaScO2.5 and adding Mo6+ or W6+ as donors to control the oxygen content for stabilization of the cubic state. BaScO2.5 exists in a brownmillerite structure at ambient pressure with limited proton conductivities35, but the cubic perovskite structure can be stabilized by applying 4 GPa (ref. 36) or by adding Mo6+ or W6+ into the Sc3+ site to introduce oxide ions; the resultant BaSc0.8Mo0.2O3\u2013\u03b4 (ref. 25) and BaSc0.8W0.2O3\u2013\u03b4 (ref. 37) adhere to the principle of an interconnected ScO6 octahedral network facilitating rapid proton diffusion in cubic perovskite.\nA remaining issue is to characterize B-site cations that combine with Sc to stabilize Ba-based perovskite oxides with high Sc content. Although it becomes increasingly ambiguous whether BaScO2.5 or BaBO3 should be identified as the \u2018host\u2019 material at such high Sc content, considering the latter as the host turns out to be useful for our purpose; we find that the lattice softness (low bulk modulus) of \u2018host\u2019 BaBO3 correlates very strongly with high Sc \u2018solubility\u2019 (Fig. 5c). This experimental observation is also consistent with our ab initio calculations: the computed solution energy for Sc in the host oxides aligns with their maximum Sc content (Supplementary Fig. 25a) and decreases as the bulk modulus decreases (Supplementary Fig. 25b). The soft nature of the host lattice is also confirmed on a microscopic level by the lattice compression upon the formation of \\({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\rm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet }\\), which is linearly correlated with the bulk modulus (Supplementary Fig. 25c). This intrinsic lattice softness may reduce the energy increase associated with structural distortions induced by point defects, thereby facilitating Sc incorporation. A similar decreasing trend in solution energy for lower bulk modulus is also observed for Y (Supplementary Fig. 25d), indicating the general applicability of lattice softness as a descriptor for enhanced dopant content. Y doping of up to 50 at.% (ref. 19) with lower proton conductivities20 has been reported in BaZrO3, but this is not inconsistent with the above discussion; the solution energy is calculated for B-site substitution while experiments report partial substitution on the A site38 and/or phase separation19, which would lower the connectivity of the dopant network. We also considered the correlation between maximum Sc content and the ionic radius of the B-site cation in six-coordinate species, including Mo6+ and W6+, but the trend is not as clear (Supplementary Fig. 26).\nThe favourable impact of extremely heavy doping had been overlooked for almost half a century, since the first report of proton conduction in perovskite oxides1. Our work suggests that such heavy doping, enabled by the choice of host materials with \u2018soft\u2019 lattices, could open new avenues for high-performance materials for various solid-state devices.\nMethods\nSynthesis\nBaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method and sintered at 1,600 \u00b0C for 12\u201324 h in dry air. The resulting relative densities of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 pellets were 97%, 97%, 99%, 90%, 68% and 50%, respectively.\nStructural and chemical characterization\nCrystal structure data were obtained from sintered pellets using an X-ray diffractometer (D2 Phaser, Bruker AXS) equipped with a Ni filter. The DIFFRAC.TOPAS software (v.5, Bruker AXS) was used for Rietveld refinements. The chemical composition of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was determined using ICP-OES at the Center of Advanced Instrumental Analysis, Toshiba Nanoanalysis Corporation.\nThermogravimetry\nThe proton concentration of Sc-doped barium stannates, barium titanates and barium hafnates was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (STA449F3 Jupiter, NETZSCH). The proton concentration was determined in the temperature range 100\u20131,000 \u00b0C. The samples were first dehydrated at 1,000 \u00b0C for 2 h in dry Ar and subsequently exposed to a wet gas flow saturated with a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm. The proton concentration was calculated by assuming a weight gain from the dehydrated state to the hydrated state based on the hydration reaction \\({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet }+{{\\mathrm{O}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\times }+{{\\mathrm{H}}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}\\leftrightarrow 2{\\mathrm{O}}{{\\mathrm{H}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\bullet }\\). To reduce the buoyancy effect, each weight change measurement using thermogravimetric analysis was corrected by performing the measurement without the sample under the identical temperature and gas flow conditions.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThin-foil specimens of a dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 pellet, which were transparent to incident electrons, were prepared using a focused ion beam system with an acceleration voltage of 16 kV for shaping and 2 kV for thinning (at the final stage of polishing). In addition to polishing, electron backscatter diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses were carried out using a Helios 5 UX DualBeam (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Focused ion beam sample preparation was performed after dehydrating the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 pellet by ramping up the temperature to 1,000 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C min\u22121 under 1 \u00d7 10\u221210 atm and maintaining the temperature at 1,000 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. Transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, HAADF-STEM and EDS were carried out using a JEM-ARM300F2 (JEOL) microscope at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.\nElectrochemical characterization\nTemperature-dependent electrical conductivities of sintered BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 pellets were measured by a.c. impedance spectroscopy. The pellets were polished to ~500 \u03bcm thickness and coated with 650 nm Ag films on both surfaces by d.c. sputtering (Sanyu Electron, SC-701HMC II). Silver meshes (Niraco Corporation) affixed with silver paste (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo, TR-3025) acted as current collectors. Specimens were pre-annealed at 720 \u00b0C in dry Ar and then exposed to humidified Ar (pH2O = 0.02 atm). The impedance spectra were acquired with an electrochemical station (BioLogic VSP-300) in the temperature range of 35\u2013631 \u00b0C under the humidified atmosphere over a range from 10\u22121 Hz to 3 \u00d7 106 Hz and fitted to an equivalent circuit of serial RC components, where R and C were in parallel, for the grain interior, grain boundary and electrode regions using EC-Lab software (v.11.33, Biologic Science Instruments). Here, R is the resistance from an ideal resistor with impedance ZR = R, and C is a constant phase element with ZC = (Y(j\u03c9)l)\u22121, where j is \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\), \u03c9 is the frequency and Y and l are constants with 0 \u2264 l \u2264 1. H/D isotope effects were evaluated for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 at 300 \u00b0C by switching between H2O-saturated and D2O-saturated Ar streams (pH2O = pD2O = 0.02 atm). The oxygen partial pressure dependence of proton conductivities in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was determined at 300 \u00b0C under pH2O = 0.02 atm across the range from pO2 = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221222 atm to 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22121 atm.\nIn situ X-ray diffraction measurements under concentrated and humidified CO2 streams\nTo confirm the stability of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 against CO2, high-temperature X-ray diffraction (D8 DISCOVER, Bruker AXS) was performed in a high-temperature chamber (XRK900, Anton Paar). Cu K\u03b1 radiation was used in the measurement under humidified CO2 (pH2O = 0.02 atm, pCO2 = 0.98 atm) at 300 \u00b0C. Prior to exposure to humidified CO2, protons were introduced while maintaining the temperature at 300 \u00b0C in wet N2 (pH2O = 0.02 atm) for 9 h. Note that the BaCO3 phase did not exist before exposure to the CO2 atmosphere. The diffraction patterns were continuously recorded in \u03b8\u20132\u03b8 mode for 398 h.\nIn situ FT-IR in a humidified atmosphere\nDiffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was conducted on a Nicolet iS50 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 300 \u00b0C. Powders of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4 were first dehydrated at 1,000 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently introduced into the in situ chamber and heated to 300 \u00b0C under dry Ar. Spectra obtained in this dry atmosphere served as the reference. The gas flow was then switched to wet Ar (pH2O = 0.02 atm), and spectra were collected up to 9 h.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nThe Sn valence state in reduced BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS-ULTRA, KRATOS Analytical). Measurements employed a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source. Prior to measurement, the powder was reduced at 300 \u00b0C in flowing humidified H2 (partial pressure of H2 pH2 = 0.98 atm; pH2O = 0.02 atm), corresponding to pO2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221247 atm. Surface charging was done with an electron flood gun, and binding energy values were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV.\nElectrolyte-supported protonic ceramic cells\nA BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 disc pellet with a thickness of 0.3 mm was used as the electrolyte. Platinum paste (Tanaka Precious Metal, TR-7907) was applied on both sides of the disc as cathode and anode electrodes in a circular pattern with a diameter of 8 mm. The discs were then baked at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h in dry air, followed by a temperature reduction to 100 \u00b0C for 100 h in moist air. As the reference electrode, a Pt wire was attached to the side of the disc, while a Pt mesh attached to both electrodes using Ag paste (TR-3025) served as the current collector. After the Ag paste dried, 60 \u03bcl of 2 mol% cerium nitrate solution was dropped onto both electrodes. The samples were then fired at 300 \u00b0C for 2 h in humid air.\nAnode-supported protonic ceramic cells\nAnode-supported proton ceramic single cells were fabricated using BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte through cold-pressing and dip-coating. A mixture of 70 wt% Nano NiO (Kceracell), 30 wt% BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3\u2212\u03b4 and 20 wt% starch was pressed at 100 MPa and pre-sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h. The electrolyte film was dip-coated using 100 \u03bcl of a BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 slurry and then sintered at 1,300 \u00b0C for 5 h. PrBaCo2O5+\u03b4 mixed with BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3\u2212\u03b4 was brush-painted onto the electrolyte and sintered at 950 \u00b0C for 2 h. Ag and Pd were applied to the cathode and anode, respectively, as current collectors. The single cells were sealed in alumina tubes using glass sealant. The electrochemical measurements were made using a BioLogic VSP-300 with 2% H2O/H2 (20 sccm) at the anode and 2% H2O/air (100 sccm) at the cathode. The microstructure of single cells was observed using a micro-calorimeter field emission scanning electron microscope (TES + ULTRA55, Zeiss).\nMolecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field\nThe calculations were all performed in a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cubic perovskite supercell corresponding to 60 at.% Sc doping in BaSnO3. First, cation configurations corresponding to equilibrium at 1,900 K, which corresponds roughly to the sintering temperature, were obtained by replica exchange Monte Carlo calculations combined with a neural-network configuration energy model using our abICS framework50,51. The dry sintering conditions were simulated with a supercell containing 27 Ba, 16 Sc, 11 Sn and 73 O. Details of the calculation procedure and the neural-network model can be found in our previous work that studied 22 at.% Sc-doped BaZrO3 (ref. 17). The cation configuration is fixed to that determined by these Monte Carlo calculations, in subsequent molecular dynamics calculations using LAMMPS code52. We employed the Allegro model53 as the machine learning force field, and its training was performed in the fully hydrated system containing 27 Ba, 16 Sc, 11 Sn, 81 O and 16 H. The Supplementary Information contains details of the training procedure. In the final production run, deuterium was used instead of hydrogen to slow the local vibrations and enable accurate equation-of-motion integration with a time step of 1 fs. The diffusivities were calculated from 10 ns trajectories at 600\u2013800 K and 100 ns trajectories at 500 K and 550 K. The calculated values are multiplied by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to compare the simulations using deuterium with experiments using protons.\nProton migration barriers\nThe proton migration (hopping and rotation) barriers were calculated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package for a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cubic perovskite supercell with 64 Ba, 61 Zr, 3 B (B = Sc, Y), 192 O and 1 H, where the B site dopants Sc and Y were placed as shown in Fig. 5a. Only the gamma point was used for k-point sampling. The plane-wave cut-off was set at 500 eV. A homogeneous background charge was introduced to satisfy charge neutrality considering formal ionic charges. The climbing-image nudged elastic band method54 was used to calculate minimum energy paths for the proton migration processes shown in Fig. 5a and obtain energy barriers.\nDopant solution\nThe solution energy of the Sc and Y dopants was calculated for cubic BaSnO3, BaTiO3, BaZrO3 and BaHfO3. The trigonal (R3m), orthorhombic (Amm2) and tetragonal (P4mm) phases were also calculated for BaTiO3, considering its phase stability. The solution energy of dopant M for B-site cations was calculated using the following equation55:\nwhere \\({E}_{{\\rm{def}}}^{\\sup}({{\\rm{M}}}_{{\\rm{B}}}^{{\\prime}})\\) and \\({E}_{{\\rm{def}}}^{\\sup}({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\rm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet})\\) are the energies of a charged supercell of a perovskite compound containing a dopant M (Sc or Y) and an oxide-ion vacancy, respectively. The lattice constants for these supercells were fixed during structural optimization. \\({E}_{{\\rm{per}}}^{\\sup }\\) is the energy of a perfect perovskite supercell, and \u03bcB, \u03bcO and \u03bcM are the chemical potentials for B, O and M, respectively. The Supplementary Information contains details of the computational conditions.\nData availability\nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available in the article and its Supplementary Information except for the molecular dynamics trajectories and training data/hyperparameters for the machine learning potential, which are available via the ISSP Data Repository at https://datarepo.mdcl.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/repo/54.

      "text": "Abstract\nAdvances in electrochemical devices have been primarily driven by the discovery and development of electrolyte materials. Yet the development of high-performance and chemically stable proton-conducting oxide electrolytes remains a challenge due to proton trapping and the resulting trade-offs between ionic carrier concentration and conductivity in doped oxides. Here we demonstrate that cubic perovskite oxides with heavy Sc doping can overcome these limitations. BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 and BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2013\u03b4 are found to exceed the technological threshold of a total proton conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 for fuel cell electrolytes at 300 \u00b0C. The structural stability of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 is further validated under harsh chemical and fuel cell conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field illustrate rapid proton diffusion pathways along the ScO6 octahedral network, effectively mitigating proton trapping, while protons are preferentially associated with Sc. Lattice softness is proposed as a primary design descriptor for increasing Sc content in perovskite oxides and developing high-performance electrolytes for electrochemical devices.\nMain\nThe discovery and development of novel electrolyte materials has historically led to advancements in electrochemical devices1,2,3,4,5. Examples include lithium-ion conduction in the Li\u2013Ge\u2013P\u2013S system4 and proton conduction in SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite oxide1, which have paved the way for all-solid-state batteries5, intermediate-temperature proton ceramic fuel cells6 and electrolysers for fuel production7. An ideal electrolyte should exhibit both high ionic conductivity and enduring chemical and electrochemical stability during device operation. However, meeting these criteria remains a challenge. Liquid electrolytes8 offer high ionic conductivity but can compromise device integrity owing to potential leakage. By contrast, a solid electrolyte eliminates such risks but requires overcoming substantial activation barriers for ionic carrier migration. Hydride-conducting compounds9 offer a conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 between room temperature and 400 \u00b0C but are unstable under oxidizing conditions. Proton-conducting CsH2PO4 fulfils the requirements within only a narrow operating temperature and water solubility window of 233\u2013254 \u00b0C at a water partial pressure of 0.4 atm (ref. 10), limiting its broader application. Currently, no stable solid-state and/or protonic electrolytes exist that can operate under fuel cell and electrolyser conditions at 300 \u00b0C.\nProton-conducting perovskite oxides11,12 exhibit a high proton conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 at 450 \u00b0C with strong chemical stability, as reported for Y-doped barium zirconate2,13. Perovskite oxides with a cubic or pseudo-cubic structure represented by the general chemical formula ABO3, where A and B are cations, are characterized by a network of corner-sharing BO6 octahedra with A-cation sublattices. Upon doping with cations of lower valency (that is, acceptor doping), usually on the B site, oxygen vacancies are generated to maintain charge neutrality, as represented using the Kr\u00f6ger\u2013Vink notation:\nThese oxygen vacancies are filled with hydroxyl groups when exposed to moisture (hydration reaction):\nThe incorporated protons are often strongly associated with acceptor dopants14 that reside on the nearest or second nearest neighbour oxygen to the acceptor dopant14,15,16,17:\nFurther details of this general defect chemistry for acceptor-doped perovskite oxides can be found in Supplementary Section 1. This association effect acts to stabilize the hydrated state16, where the maximum proton content equals the amount of acceptor dopant in the case of a trivalent cation substituting at a tetravalent cation site. The protons can diffuse throughout the material via a combination of rotation and hopping to neighbouring proton sites (Grotthuss mechanism11) on the three-dimensional network of BO6 octahedra.\nThe development of proton-conducting perovskite oxides has followed a design principle aimed at enhancing proton conductivity by increasing lattice volume through the incorporation of larger host cations and acceptor dopants within the perovskite structure11 (Fig. 1a). However, the proton conductivity in barium zirconate peaks at a Y-doping level of 20 at.% (refs. 2,18), substantially below its solubility limit of approximately 50 at.% (ref. 19), and any further increase in Y doping reduces its conductivity20, which implies that carrier diffusivity also decreases (Fig. 1b,d). This has conventionally been explained as the detrimental effect of the proton\u2013dopant association leading to proton trapping14,16. More recent theoretical works have pointed out the formation of deeper proton traps surrounded by Y clusters as the underlying mechanism for the decrease in conductivity at high dopant concentrations21. This trade-off is inherent in proton-conducting oxides, where the proton\u2013dopant association stabilizes protons in oxides, enabling the hydration of oxides but impeding proton diffusion in the lattice (proton trapping), as found for proton-conducting barium zirconates2,14,18,20,22. A similar phenomenon is also observed for oxide-ion conduction in doped zirconia and ceria23.\nThe recent discovery of superior proton conduction in heavily (60 at.%) Sc-doped barium zirconate3 offers a promising avenue for overcoming the trade-off in doped ionic conductors. In BaZr0.4Sc0.6O3\u2013\u03b4, the proton concentration, diffusivity and conductivity all increase continuously up to approximately the solubility limit (Fig. 1b\u2013d). It is proposed that heavy acceptor doping facilitates proton diffusion in barium zirconates and analogous materials, based on computations24 and experiments3,25. These results suggest that heavy Sc doping promises to overcome the trade-off in doped ionic conductors.\nIn this study we performed systematic searches for Ba-based host perovskite oxides capable of dissolving substantial amounts of Sc. We found that heavy Sc doping, up to 70, 80 and 50 at.%, is possible in barium stannate, barium titanate and barium hafnate, respectively. The resultant total proton conductivities in the barium stannate and barium titanate exceed the technological threshold26 of 0.01 S cm\u22121 for fuel cell electrolytes at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 1a), overcoming the well-known and problematic H+ concentration\u2013conductivity trade-off in doped oxides. Doped barium stannates27,28 and barium titanates29 have long been overlooked due to their lower proton conductivities and less favourable hydration behaviour at dopant contents up to ~20 at.%, and proton conductivity investigations under heavy doping close to the solubility limit had not been attempted. Molecular dynamics simulations employing state-of-the-art machine learning force fields reveal that the heavy Sc doping creates proton diffusion pathways along the ScO6 octahedral network that mitigate the influence of proton trapping on diffusion. A correlation between reduced bulk modulus and increased ScO6 content in the perovskite framework provides a design guideline for developing such electrolytes.\nHeavy Sc doping of BaSnO3, BaTiO3 and BaHfO3 perovskites\nThe 20 at.% and 70 at.% Sc-doped barium stannates, 60 at.% and 80 at.% Sc-doped barium titanates and 20 at.% and 50 at.% Sc-doped barium hafnates were synthesized using solid-state reactions. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement for dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 (Supplementary Fig. 1) show that these compounds primarily exhibit cubic perovskite phases in the space group \\({Pm}\\bar{3}m\\) (structural parameters are provided in Supplementary Table 1). BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 contain 5.1 wt%, 2.3 wt% and 5.3 wt%, respectively, of secondary BaSc2O4. By using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and considering the secondary phase, the chemical composition of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite was determined to be Ba1.00Sn0.311Sc0.695O3\u2212\u03b4 (Supplementary Table 2). The substitutional acceptor Sc doping and vacancy formation for barium stannates, titanates and hafnates, described in equation (1), are validated by the monotonic increase or decrease of lattice volume upon Sc doping (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nProton conductivities from a.c. impedance\nThe a.c. impedance spectroscopy, conducted under a humidified Ar atmosphere, reveals that heavy Sc doping at levels of 70 at.% and 80 at.% in stannate and titanate, respectively, results in fast proton conduction at 300 \u00b0C. For 20 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate and 60 at.% Sc-doped barium titanate, the proton conductivity is only 0.001 S cm\u22121 at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 3\u20138). However, increasing the Sc content to 70 at.% and 80 at.% enhances the proton conductivity by a factor of ten, reaching 0.01 and 0.016 S cm\u22121, respectively (Fig. 1b). This tenfold increase represents a substantial improvement compared to the Y-doped barium zirconate system, which peaks at a dopant level of 20 at.% Y (refs. 2,18). Within the Sc-doped systems, barium stannate outperforms barium hafnate and barium zirconate3 in proton conductivity for all Sc contents by a factor of 2\u201330 and 2\u20134, respectively (Fig. 1b). The temperature dependence of the proton conductivity in the stannates, titanates and hafnates (Supplementary Fig. 9) also highlights the advantage of heavy Sc doping regardless of operating temperature.\nBaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 and BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2013\u03b4 exhibit high total proton conductivities, exceeding 0.01 S cm\u22121, at and above 300 \u00b0C under a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 15). The total conductivity comprises both bulk and grain boundary resistivities in the polycrystalline pellet. Large grains with a mean grain size of 16.7 \u03bcm for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 (Supplementary Fig. 16) minimize the resistive contribution across grain boundaries to the overall proton resistivity in the polycrystalline pellet.\nProton concentrations from thermogravimetry\nThe thermogravimetry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10) provides compelling evidence that the defect chemistry and hydration processes of these materials adhere to the principles governing acceptor-doped perovskite oxide proton conductors, as described by equations (1) and (2). Proton concentration at 300 \u00b0C nearly equals the Sc content (Fig. 1c) for all perovskite oxides examined excluding barium titanates, indicating almost complete hydration in those systems. The hydration enthalpies for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 are determined by van\u2019t Hoff plots as \u2212125 \u00b1 1, \u2212131 \u00b1 3, \u221299 \u00b1 5, \u221271 \u00b1 2, \u2212112 \u00b1 2 and \u221280 \u00b1 2 kJ mol\u22121, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3), which are in the range of reported values for acceptor-doped perovskite oxides30,12. When comparing among heavily Sc-doped samples, barium titanates exhibit a much lower proton concentration (Fig. 1c) and less negative hydration enthalpy (Supplementary Fig. 12) than barium stannate and barium zirconate. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for Sc-doped barium stannates and barium titanates (Supplementary Fig. 13) also provides direct evidence of the hydration reaction of equation (2).\nProton diffusivities\nSc-doped barium stannate displays high proton diffusivity across a wide range of Sc concentrations. By using the Nernst\u2013Einstein relationship and measuring proton conductivities and concentrations (Fig. 1b,c), the proton diffusivities in barium stannates with 20 at.% and 70 at.% Sc at 300 \u00b0C were determined to be 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121, respectively (Fig. 1d). These proton diffusivities are 2.3 to 3.4 times greater than those in Sc-doped zirconates3, depending on Sc content. By contrast, barium titanates display a steep Sc dependence in proton diffusivity, similar to that observed in barium zirconates. Sc-doped barium hafnate shows the steepest dependence of diffusivity on Sc content, but the Sc solubility of 50 at.% limits the proton diffusivity to 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121. The temperature-dependent proton diffusivity (Supplementary Fig. 14) in the range between 200 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C provides apparent activation energies, plotted against Sc content in Fig. 1e. In these perovskites, Sc doping lowers the activation energy. The reduced activation energy (Fig. 1e) and enhanced proton diffusivity (Fig. 1d) appear to be a general advantage of heavy Sc doping in the perovskites. As a result, heavy Sc doping overcomes the trade-off between proton diffusivity and proton concentration reported in conventional systems, leading to a high conductivity of 0.01 S cm\u22121 at 300 \u00b0C in barium stannate and barium titanate (Fig. 1f).\nConfirmation of proton conduction in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4\nAn isotope exchange experiment between D2O and H2O moisture at 301 \u00b0C, while maintaining a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm, yielded an isotope effect of 1.95 (Fig. 2b). This strongly suggests that protons are the primary ionic carriers. The higher value (~2) than the square root of the mass ratio between a deuterium and a proton, 1.41, is likely attributable to a more profound influence of the zero-point energy between them31 at 301 \u00b0C. Recent calculations that incorporate both nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicity report an isotope effect of 1.9 at 227 \u00b0C in barium zirconate32, which closely aligns with our experimental result in 70 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate at 300 \u00b0C. A continuous isotope exchange experiment over 261 h at 301 \u00b0C confirmed the chemical stability of proton insertion and extraction in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 (Fig. 2b).\nA constant total conductivity across a wide range of oxygen partial pressures ranging from highly reducing to oxidizing conditions between 10\u221222 and 1 atm at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 2c) indicates a proton transference number close to unity. As proof of ionic conduction, the open circuit voltage for a BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 electrolyte-supported protonic ceramic fuel cell at 300 \u00b0C matches the theoretical value (1.194 V) calculated from the Nernst equation for the given conditions (Supplementary Fig. 17). An anode-supported fuel cell, consisting of a thin BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3 electrolyte that includes 5 at.% Ni (Supplementary Fig. 18), shows an open circuit voltage of approximately 1 V at 300 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 4). The equivalence of the X-ray photoelectron spectra for reduced BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 and undoped BaSnO3 (ref. 33; Supplementary Fig. 20) offers further evidence that the Sn cation remains tetravalent. All the results, including the isotope effect of Fig. 2b, confirm that BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 is purely proton conductive at 300 \u00b0C, fulfilling another crucial requirement for fuel cell electrolytes.\nAcross a broad temperature spectrum, BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 exhibits a proton diffusivity that is twice as high as that found for state-of-the-art 60 at.% Sc-doped barium zirconate3 (Fig. 2d) and is equivalent to that for 20 at.% Y-doped barium zirconate14. The nonlinear Arrhenius plot of proton diffusivity for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2013\u03b4 suggests the existence of some sort of proton trapping.\nProton transport examined by machine learning force field\nMolecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field were performed with realistic dopant configurations determined by Monte Carlo simulations17. Diffusivities predicted by the simulations for 60 at.% Sc-doped barium stannate and barium zirconate between 227 \u00b0C and 527 \u00b0C are in good agreement with the experimental results, although the absolute values are slightly overestimated (Fig. 3a; the data for the zirconate are taken from the literature12). The observation of the trajectory of protons in the molecular dynamics simulations confirms the Grotthuss mechanism, a combination of proton rotation around the donor oxygen and hopping between the oxygens (an animation is provided as Supplementary Data 3). A clear tendency of protons to reside near dopant Sc compared with Sn, that is, a proton\u2013dopant association, is evident from the analysis of H\u2013Sc and H\u2013Sn pair distribution functions for the stannate (Fig. 3b; similar results for the zirconate can be found in the literature12). This is consistent with the conventional understanding of proton\u2013dopant association in acceptor-doped perovskites15,16,17. The H\u2013Sn distribution increases slightly with increasing temperature, indicating that protons are slightly more randomly distributed, but a strong preference for H\u2013Sc association remains at 527 \u00b0C. A high proton diffusivity is observed despite such a strong association, and this can be explained by the fast proton-conducting pathways formed along the three-dimensional network of ScO6 (Fig. 3c,d).\nAtomistic structure of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4\nAn analysis of the atomistic structure and chemical composition using transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte had a perovskite-type structure with a high Sc content. Electron diffraction patterns were acquired from one crystal grain of the dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte with two different electron incidence angles approximately 90\u00b0 apart (Supplementary Fig. 21). All the Bragg reflections were reasonably indexed assuming a perovskite-type structure with the space group \\({Pm}\\bar{3}m\\). The lattice parameter of 0.42 nm deduced from the electron diffraction pattern was consistent with the X-ray diffraction result of 0.4143 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Both high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 22) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Supplementary Fig. 23) imaged the sublattices making up the perovskite-type structure: that is, A sites occupied by Ba and B sites occupied by Sn and Sc, although the sublattice of O was unclear from these observations. The results showed neither cation ordering, expected in the double perovskite-type structure, nor oxygen-vacancy ordering in the brownmillerite-type structure. An analysis of the HAADF-STEM images revealed a negligible change in the intensity of the B sites, suggesting that the distribution of Sn and Sc at the B sites is random. An EDS analysis determined the atomic ratio of Ba/Sn/Sc to be 1:0.30:0.67 (Supplementary Fig 22c,f and Supplementary Table 2), indicating that Sc constitutes 69 at.% of the B-site cations (Supplementary Table 5). The results are in good agreement with the chemical analysis using ICP-OES, considering the 5 wt% BaSc2O4 (Supplementary Table 2).\nCO2 tolerance of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 at 300 \u00b0C\nAn accelerated chemical stability test, conducted under harsh, humidified CO2 conditions at 300 \u00b0C using in situ X-ray diffractometry, confirmed the chemical stability of hydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4. The diffraction patterns for hydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 powder did not vary at 300 \u00b0C under a flow of highly concentrated CO2 for 398 h (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 24). The amount of the secondary BaSc2O4 phase, shown by the peak intensity at 31.3\u00b0, did not increase during the test (Fig. 4c). These results show the chemical stability of the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 powder, in agreement with the stability expected for the perovskite phases34; it is yet to be determined whether these results indicate thermodynamic or kinetic factors or both.\nDiscussion\nA distinct characteristic of Sc, particularly at higher concentrations, is its ability to create rapid diffusion pathways even when protons are strongly associated with acceptor dopants in the oxide. The measured proton diffusivity versus Sc content for various host cations (Figs. 1d and 5d) shows that the diffusivity at low Sc content (~20 at.%) is lower than that at higher Sc content (>50 at.%). This, in turn, indicates that proton trapping, which is unfavourable for proton diffusivity, is prevalent at lower Sc content but is mitigated at higher Sc content. Also notable is that the diffusivities exhibit a clear dependence on the host B-site cation at lower Sc content but converge to similar values at higher Sc content; this is a natural consequence of Sc becoming the major B-site cation under heavy doping. The microscopic picture responsible for this effect is evident from our molecular dynamics data for 60 at.% Sc-doped BaSnO3 (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d) and BaZrO3 (ref. 12). Sc doping increases the population of ScO6 octahedra, forming oxygen sites corner-shared by ScO6\u2013BO6 and ScO6\u2013ScO6 pairs. A further increase in Sc concentration creates a connected network of ScO6 octahedra, to which protons preferentially associate, as seen in our simulated data (Fig. 3c,d) and discussed in the literature15,16,17. Despite such a clear association, the calculated diffusivity is rather high as a result of proton migration along the ScO6 network without the need to completely detrap itself from the acceptor dopant.\nTo highlight the difference between Sc and Y dopants, we compare local migration barriers for Sc-doped and Y-doped BaZrO3, obtained from ab initio calculations on the dopant configuration shown in Fig. 5a,b. We find that associated protons along ScO6\u2013ScO6 octahedra pairs from sites 5 to 8 (pink region in Fig. 5a) exhibit the lowest site energy (proton\u2013dopant association), and the values are almost equal. Transitions between these sites encompass both proton rotation and hopping (Grotthuss mechanism) in the oxide. By contrast, Y-doped barium zirconate, which exhibits the concentration\u2013conductivity trade-off2,18, shows a large difference of 0.18 eV in the site energies of protons at YO6\u2013YO6 octahedra pairs (between sites 5 and 8 in Fig. 5b). Similar tendencies are observed in the ScO6\u2013ZrO6 and YO6\u2013ZrO6 pairs across sites 2 to 4 (grey regions in Fig. 5a,b). The overall activation energies for protons to move from one of the lowest energy sites to site 4 or 9 at the YO6\u2013ZrO6 pair (0.42\u20130.51 eV) exceed those for Sc (approximately 0.3 eV). These results show the importance of forming an interconnected ScO6 octahedral network within the cubic perovskite structure for enhanced proton diffusion. Although heavy acceptor M-doping into perovskite oxides always leads to the formation of an MO6 octahedral network, creating a relatively flat energy landscape that mitigates proton trapping is a distinct benefit of using Sc as a dopant, while the cubic perovskite oxide retains structural stability under harsh chemical and fuel cell conditions.\nSaito and Yashima25 have recently proposed starting from a hypothetical BaScO2.5 and adding Mo6+ or W6+ as donors to control the oxygen content for stabilization of the cubic state. BaScO2.5 exists in a brownmillerite structure at ambient pressure with limited proton conductivities35, but the cubic perovskite structure can be stabilized by applying 4 GPa (ref. 36) or by adding Mo6+ or W6+ into the Sc3+ site to introduce oxide ions; the resultant BaSc0.8Mo0.2O3\u2013\u03b4 (ref. 25) and BaSc0.8W0.2O3\u2013\u03b4 (ref. 37) adhere to the principle of an interconnected ScO6 octahedral network facilitating rapid proton diffusion in cubic perovskite.\nA remaining issue is to characterize B-site cations that combine with Sc to stabilize Ba-based perovskite oxides with high Sc content. Although it becomes increasingly ambiguous whether BaScO2.5 or BaBO3 should be identified as the \u2018host\u2019 material at such high Sc content, considering the latter as the host turns out to be useful for our purpose; we find that the lattice softness (low bulk modulus) of \u2018host\u2019 BaBO3 correlates very strongly with high Sc \u2018solubility\u2019 (Fig. 5c). This experimental observation is also consistent with our ab initio calculations: the computed solution energy for Sc in the host oxides aligns with their maximum Sc content (Supplementary Fig. 25a) and decreases as the bulk modulus decreases (Supplementary Fig. 25b). The soft nature of the host lattice is also confirmed on a microscopic level by the lattice compression upon the formation of \\({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\rm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet }\\), which is linearly correlated with the bulk modulus (Supplementary Fig. 25c). This intrinsic lattice softness may reduce the energy increase associated with structural distortions induced by point defects, thereby facilitating Sc incorporation. A similar decreasing trend in solution energy for lower bulk modulus is also observed for Y (Supplementary Fig. 25d), indicating the general applicability of lattice softness as a descriptor for enhanced dopant content. Y doping of up to 50 at.% (ref. 19) with lower proton conductivities20 has been reported in BaZrO3, but this is not inconsistent with the above discussion; the solution energy is calculated for B-site substitution while experiments report partial substitution on the A site38 and/or phase separation19, which would lower the connectivity of the dopant network. We also considered the correlation between maximum Sc content and the ionic radius of the B-site cation in six-coordinate species, including Mo6+ and W6+, but the trend is not as clear (Supplementary Fig. 26).\nThe favourable impact of extremely heavy doping had been overlooked for almost half a century, since the first report of proton conduction in perovskite oxides1. Our work suggests that such heavy doping, enabled by the choice of host materials with \u2018soft\u2019 lattices, could open new avenues for high-performance materials for various solid-state devices.\nMethods\nSynthesis\nBaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method and sintered at 1,600 \u00b0C for 12\u201324 h in dry air. The resulting relative densities of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 pellets were 97%, 97%, 99%, 90%, 68% and 50%, respectively.\nStructural and chemical characterization\nCrystal structure data were obtained from sintered pellets using an X-ray diffractometer (D2 Phaser, Bruker AXS) equipped with a Ni filter. The DIFFRAC.TOPAS software (v.5, Bruker AXS) was used for Rietveld refinements. The chemical composition of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was determined using ICP-OES at the Center of Advanced Instrumental Analysis, Toshiba Nanoanalysis Corporation.\nThermogravimetry\nThe proton concentration of Sc-doped barium stannates, barium titanates and barium hafnates was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (STA449F3 Jupiter, NETZSCH). The proton concentration was determined in the temperature range 100\u20131,000 \u00b0C. The samples were first dehydrated at 1,000 \u00b0C for 2 h in dry Ar and subsequently exposed to a wet gas flow saturated with a water partial pressure of 0.02 atm. The proton concentration was calculated by assuming a weight gain from the dehydrated state to the hydrated state based on the hydration reaction \\({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet }+{{\\mathrm{O}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\times }+{{\\mathrm{H}}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}\\leftrightarrow 2{\\mathrm{O}}{{\\mathrm{H}}}_{{\\mathrm{O}}}^{\\bullet }\\). To reduce the buoyancy effect, each weight change measurement using thermogravimetric analysis was corrected by performing the measurement without the sample under the identical temperature and gas flow conditions.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThin-foil specimens of a dehydrated BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 pellet, which were transparent to incident electrons, were prepared using a focused ion beam system with an acceleration voltage of 16 kV for shaping and 2 kV for thinning (at the final stage of polishing). In addition to polishing, electron backscatter diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses were carried out using a Helios 5 UX DualBeam (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Focused ion beam sample preparation was performed after dehydrating the BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 pellet by ramping up the temperature to 1,000 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C min\u22121 under 1 \u00d7 10\u221210 atm and maintaining the temperature at 1,000 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. Transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, HAADF-STEM and EDS were carried out using a JEM-ARM300F2 (JEOL) microscope at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.\nElectrochemical characterization\nTemperature-dependent electrical conductivities of sintered BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4, BaHf0.5Sc0.5O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaHf0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 pellets were measured by a.c. impedance spectroscopy. The pellets were polished to ~500 \u03bcm thickness and coated with 650 nm Ag films on both surfaces by d.c. sputtering (Sanyu Electron, SC-701HMC II). Silver meshes (Niraco Corporation) affixed with silver paste (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo, TR-3025) acted as current collectors. Specimens were pre-annealed at 720 \u00b0C in dry Ar and then exposed to humidified Ar (pH2O = 0.02 atm). The impedance spectra were acquired with an electrochemical station (BioLogic VSP-300) in the temperature range of 35\u2013631 \u00b0C under the humidified atmosphere over a range from 10\u22121 Hz to 3 \u00d7 106 Hz and fitted to an equivalent circuit of serial RC components, where R and C were in parallel, for the grain interior, grain boundary and electrode regions using EC-Lab software (v.11.33, Biologic Science Instruments). Here, R is the resistance from an ideal resistor with impedance ZR = R, and C is a constant phase element with ZC = (Y(j\u03c9)l)\u22121, where j is \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\), \u03c9 is the frequency and Y and l are constants with 0 \u2264 l \u2264 1. H/D isotope effects were evaluated for BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 at 300 \u00b0C by switching between H2O-saturated and D2O-saturated Ar streams (pH2O = pD2O = 0.02 atm). The oxygen partial pressure dependence of proton conductivities in BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was determined at 300 \u00b0C under pH2O = 0.02 atm across the range from pO2 = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221222 atm to 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22121 atm.\nIn situ X-ray diffraction measurements under concentrated and humidified CO2 streams\nTo confirm the stability of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 against CO2, high-temperature X-ray diffraction (D8 DISCOVER, Bruker AXS) was performed in a high-temperature chamber (XRK900, Anton Paar). Cu K\u03b1 radiation was used in the measurement under humidified CO2 (pH2O = 0.02 atm, pCO2 = 0.98 atm) at 300 \u00b0C. Prior to exposure to humidified CO2, protons were introduced while maintaining the temperature at 300 \u00b0C in wet N2 (pH2O = 0.02 atm) for 9 h. Note that the BaCO3 phase did not exist before exposure to the CO2 atmosphere. The diffraction patterns were continuously recorded in \u03b8\u20132\u03b8 mode for 398 h.\nIn situ FT-IR in a humidified atmosphere\nDiffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was conducted on a Nicolet iS50 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 300 \u00b0C. Powders of BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4, BaTi0.2Sc0.8O3\u2212\u03b4, BaSn0.8Sc0.2O3\u2212\u03b4 and BaTi0.4Sc0.6O3\u2212\u03b4 were first dehydrated at 1,000 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently introduced into the in situ chamber and heated to 300 \u00b0C under dry Ar. Spectra obtained in this dry atmosphere served as the reference. The gas flow was then switched to wet Ar (pH2O = 0.02 atm), and spectra were collected up to 9 h.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nThe Sn valence state in reduced BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS-ULTRA, KRATOS Analytical). Measurements employed a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source. Prior to measurement, the powder was reduced at 300 \u00b0C in flowing humidified H2 (partial pressure of H2 pH2 = 0.98 atm; pH2O = 0.02 atm), corresponding to pO2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221247 atm. Surface charging was done with an electron flood gun, and binding energy values were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV.\nElectrolyte-supported protonic ceramic cells\nA BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 disc pellet with a thickness of 0.3 mm was used as the electrolyte. Platinum paste (Tanaka Precious Metal, TR-7907) was applied on both sides of the disc as cathode and anode electrodes in a circular pattern with a diameter of 8 mm. The discs were then baked at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h in dry air, followed by a temperature reduction to 100 \u00b0C for 100 h in moist air. As the reference electrode, a Pt wire was attached to the side of the disc, while a Pt mesh attached to both electrodes using Ag paste (TR-3025) served as the current collector. After the Ag paste dried, 60 \u03bcl of 2 mol% cerium nitrate solution was dropped onto both electrodes. The samples were then fired at 300 \u00b0C for 2 h in humid air.\nAnode-supported protonic ceramic cells\nAnode-supported proton ceramic single cells were fabricated using BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 electrolyte through cold-pressing and dip-coating. A mixture of 70 wt% Nano NiO (Kceracell), 30 wt% BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3\u2212\u03b4 and 20 wt% starch was pressed at 100 MPa and pre-sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h. The electrolyte film was dip-coated using 100 \u03bcl of a BaSn0.3Sc0.7O3\u2212\u03b4 slurry and then sintered at 1,300 \u00b0C for 5 h. PrBaCo2O5+\u03b4 mixed with BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3\u2212\u03b4 was brush-painted onto the electrolyte and sintered at 950 \u00b0C for 2 h. Ag and Pd were applied to the cathode and anode, respectively, as current collectors. The single cells were sealed in alumina tubes using glass sealant. The electrochemical measurements were made using a BioLogic VSP-300 with 2% H2O/H2 (20 sccm) at the anode and 2% H2O/air (100 sccm) at the cathode. The microstructure of single cells was observed using a micro-calorimeter field emission scanning electron microscope (TES + ULTRA55, Zeiss).\nMolecular dynamics simulations using a machine learning force field\nThe calculations were all performed in a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cubic perovskite supercell corresponding to 60 at.% Sc doping in BaSnO3. First, cation configurations corresponding to equilibrium at 1,900 K, which corresponds roughly to the sintering temperature, were obtained by replica exchange Monte Carlo calculations combined with a neural-network configuration energy model using our abICS framework50,51. The dry sintering conditions were simulated with a supercell containing 27 Ba, 16 Sc, 11 Sn and 73 O. Details of the calculation procedure and the neural-network model can be found in our previous work that studied 22 at.% Sc-doped BaZrO3 (ref. 17). The cation configuration is fixed to that determined by these Monte Carlo calculations, in subsequent molecular dynamics calculations using LAMMPS code52. We employed the Allegro model53 as the machine learning force field, and its training was performed in the fully hydrated system containing 27 Ba, 16 Sc, 11 Sn, 81 O and 16 H. The Supplementary Information contains details of the training procedure. In the final production run, deuterium was used instead of hydrogen to slow the local vibrations and enable accurate equation-of-motion integration with a time step of 1 fs. The diffusivities were calculated from 10 ns trajectories at 600\u2013800 K and 100 ns trajectories at 500 K and 550 K. The calculated values are multiplied by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to compare the simulations using deuterium with experiments using protons.\nProton migration barriers\nThe proton migration (hopping and rotation) barriers were calculated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package for a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cubic perovskite supercell with 64 Ba, 61 Zr, 3 B (B = Sc, Y), 192 O and 1 H, where the B site dopants Sc and Y were placed as shown in Fig. 5a. Only the gamma point was used for k-point sampling. The plane-wave cut-off was set at 500 eV. A homogeneous background charge was introduced to satisfy charge neutrality considering formal ionic charges. The climbing-image nudged elastic band method54 was used to calculate minimum energy paths for the proton migration processes shown in Fig. 5a and obtain energy barriers.\nDopant solution\nThe solution energy of the Sc and Y dopants was calculated for cubic BaSnO3, BaTiO3, BaZrO3 and BaHfO3. The trigonal (R3m), orthorhombic (Amm2) and tetragonal (P4mm) phases were also calculated for BaTiO3, considering its phase stability. The solution energy of dopant M for B-site cations was calculated using the following equation55:\nwhere \\({E}_{{\\rm{def}}}^{\\sup}({{\\rm{M}}}_{{\\rm{B}}}^{{\\prime}})\\) and \\({E}_{{\\rm{def}}}^{\\sup}({{\\mathrm{v}}}_{{\\rm{O}}}^{\\bullet \\bullet})\\) are the energies of a charged supercell of a perovskite compound containing a dopant M (Sc or Y) and an oxide-ion vacancy, respectively. The lattice constants for these supercells were fixed during structural optimization. \\({E}_{{\\rm{per}}}^{\\sup }\\) is the energy of a perfect perovskite supercell, and \u03bcB, \u03bcO and \u03bcM are the chemical potentials for B, O and M, respectively. The Supplementary Information contains details of the computational conditions.\nData availability\nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available in the article and its Supplementary Information except for the molecular dynamics trajectories and training data/hyperparameters for the machine learning potential, which are available via the ISSP Data Repository at https://datarepo.mdcl.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/repo/54.

  "argos_summary": "Researchers at Kyushu University have developed a new type of solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that operates efficiently at a significantly lower temperature of 300\u2103, compared to the typical 700\u2013800\u2103 required by conventional SOFCs. This advancement is achieved through heavy doping of barium stannate and barium titanate with scandium, which enhances proton conductivity and mitigates proton trapping, a common issue in doped oxides. The findings suggest that these low-temperature SOFCs could lead to more affordable and practical applications in energy generation, particularly in the context of the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels.",
