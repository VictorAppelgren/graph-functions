  "title": "If I Could Only Buy 1 S&P 500 Stock From Each Sector for the Rest of 2025, I'd Go With These 11 Dividend Stocks",
  "description": "Incorporating top stocks from a variety of sectors can be an effective way to balance out an investment portfolio.",
  "content": "\u2022 Some stock market sectors significantly impact the S&P 500, whereas others barely make a dent.\n\u2022 There are plenty of ways to generate passive income across market sectors.\n\u2022 Investing in companies with very little overlap can help reduce correlation.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Texas Instruments \u203a The Global Industry Classification Standard assigns each stock into a market sector to make it easier for investors to compare companies to their peers and track broader market movements. The system isn't perfect. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is in the consumer discretionary sector even though its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, is its most valuable segment -- meaning Amazon is arguably more of a technology company. But overall, the system is useful for achieving portfolio diversification and seeing which sectors are outperforming or underperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Here are the 11 stocks I would choose if I could only buy one dividend stock from each sector for the rest of the year. The technology sector makes up just over a third of the S&P 500 with a 34% weighting. The tech sector includes the three largest companies in the world -- Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. My top tech stock for the rest of 2025 is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN). The company is an industry veteran that makes analog and embedded semiconductors. It's not a pure artificial intelligence (AI) play. But Texas Instruments is unique in that it has a highly diversified business. The company stands to benefit from the growth of edge AI, which involves AI on a device level rather than in the cloud. With 21 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 2.7% yield, Texas Instruments stands out as a unique way to invest in tech while generating a sizable amount of passive income. Financials are the second-largest stock market sector with a 13.8% weight in the S&P 500. Payment processors have wide moats, rock-solid business models, and extremely high margins. American Express (NYSE: AXP) takes it a step further by acting as both a payment processor and a card issuer. Issuing cards adds risk to the business, but American Express has an excellent track record of managing that risk, as evidenced by its low net write-off rate. The consumer discretionary sector makes up 10.4% of the S&P 500. The sector can be highly cyclical and sensitive to macro data from the broader economy, housing market, interest rates, and more. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is my top pick from the sector because the company's turnaround is going well and the dividend is excellent.\n\nLast August, Starbucks poached Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol to get Starbucks back on track to consistent international growth. Niccol's Starbucks hasn't been perfect, but it's much more organized and focused on improving customer service. With 14 consecutive years of boosting the payout and a 2.7% yield, Starbucks stands out as a top consumer discretionary stock for generating passive income. The communications sector comes in at 9.9% of the S&P 500. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stands out as a high-conviction pick due to its diverse business model and dirt cheap valuation. Fears of Al disrupting Google Search are overblown. Google Search continues to grow at an impressive rate. And adoption for Google Gemini, Alphabet's Chatbot, has been accelerating. Alphabet announced its first dividend last year, but it only yields 0.4% . Healthcare now only makes up 8.8% of the S&P 500 because the sector has been under pressure due to sell-offs in companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). Eli Lilly is an exciting company in the space because of existing drugs, especially for weight loss and diabetes -- as well as its pipeline of drugs in development. The company passes along capital directly to shareholders through its growing dividend. Industrials are right behind healthcare with an 8.6% weighting in the S&P 500. Investors are getting a great value for industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON). Honeywell is splitting into three separate businesses to unlock value for shareholders. At 24.7 times earnings and with a 2.1% dividend yield, Honeywell is a good buy for folks who believe the company will be more innovative and flexible as three independent entities. Consumer staples make up 5.2% of the S&P 500. The sector has been struggling due to inflationary pressures on consumers. So it's best to approach consumer staples with an emphasis on quality. Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) is as quality as it gets, with a 2.7% dividend yield and 69 consecutive years of boosting its payout, strong pricing power, and a diverse lineup of industry-leading products spanning beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care. Like consumer staples, the energy sector has been under pressure from relatively low oil prices. There's also the ongoing risk of the energy transition as oil and gas demand could fall over the coming decades. Integrated major ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) provides a straightforward way to mitigate the sector's risks. ExxonMobil has a low cost of production, diversified portfolio across upstream, product solutions, and low carbon. ExxonMobil has 42 consecutive years of increasing its payout and a high yield of 3.7%. The utilities sector makes up just 2.5% of the S&P 500. But it's one of the best sectors for generating reliable passive income. Southern Company (NYSE: SO) is hovering around an all-time high due to steadily rising demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers and AI-related tailwinds in Southern Company's wheelhouse in the Southeastern U.S. With a yield of 3.1%, Southern Company is a reliable passive income powerhouse that's worth buying now. The real estate sector makes up 2% of the S&P 500. The sector includes companies that own, manage, and develop property, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) that generate income from rental properties. Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA) is a REIT that specializes in multifamily apartment complexes in the Sun Belt. The company has an excellent track record of maintaining its dividend, which has never decreased over the 30 years that it has been paid. The dividend has increased significantly in recent years, boosting the yield to 4.3%. The materials sector makes up just 1.8% of the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) is the lone materials stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it's a perfect representative for the sector. The company has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years and consistently repurchases its stock. The company does much more than residential paint, including a thriving industrial and commercial business that includes paint and coatings for industrial wood, marine, automotive, and more. It operates its own stores and works with retailers like Lowe's and Walmart. Sherwin-Williams only yields 0.9%, but that's due to the stock's strong long-term performance rather than a lack of commitment to growing the dividend.

      "text": "Dividend stocks are shares of companies that make regular distributions to their shareholders, usually in the form of cash payments. Dividend stocks can be a useful source of income, but the best dividend stocks can also be an excellent way to build wealth over the long term.\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are great investments, and many investors are unsure how to start their search. With that in mind, here's a list of dividend-paying stocks you might want to consider and some of the most important things to look for in top dividend stocks.\nNine best stocks\nNine best dividend stocks\nThe Dividend Kings list is a great place to find top dividend stocks. Dividend Kings are companies that have paid and raised their base dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\nThe Dividend Achievers\u2122 list, whose companies boast 10-plus straight years of dividend increases, is a trademarked property owned by the Nasdaq and another great list to research. Both lists include some great stocks to buy, and we have included a few from each in our list below. Here are nine top dividend stocks to consider buying now.\nCompanies 1 - 3\n1. Lowe's\nHome improvement giant Lowe's (LOW 3.1%) may not seem like a very exciting stock. And that's true -- unless you like dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend almost every year since going public in 1961 and has raised the payout by more than 300% over the trailing decade alone.\nInvestors worried about the housing downturn shouldn't fret. When the housing supply is tight, homes are harder to buy, and people tend to spend more to upgrade their existing homes. So, any cyclical weakness in its results will likely return to growth over the long term, even if short-term shifts in consumer spending cause an overall slowdown in renovations.\nWhile consumer expenditures on home improvement projects remain in flux, particularly as concerns about the economy persist, these are durable spending trends over the long run. As consumer spending appetite improves, home upgrades and other projects, from which Lowe's has historically experienced considerable growth, should see an uptick.\nAnother important factor that's good for Lowe's is that the typical U.S. home is between 31 and 60 years old, depending on the state. The next generation of DIYers will spend a lot of money at Lowe's, as will home improvement contractors. It's made professionals a priority, and sales to contractors are growing.\n2. Realty Income\nIf you're looking for a simple way to invest in high-quality real estate for income and growth, Realty Income (O -1.21%) might be the perfect stock. The company owns an array of largely e-commerce-resistant properties, earning strong cash flow from tenants on long-term leases.\nRealty Income is also a Dividend Achiever, with more than three decades of consecutive annual dividend increases every year since going public in 1994 -- and over 55 straight years of paying a dividend every month. Since its founding, Realty has declared 661 consecutive monthly dividends and has habitually increased its dividend for the last 30 consecutive years.\nThis best-of-breed real estate investment trust (REIT) has also taken steps to continue delivering on its dividend-growing ways. In early 2024, it closed the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which it said would immediately add 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO).\n3. Chevron\nFor years, Chevron (CVX 1.5%) has been a big winner for investors and a solid stock to own, especially for dividend investors. It has maintained a steady track record of generating strong cash flows and growing payouts modestly every year for 38 years and counting.\nThe stock price can fluctuate with oil prices, and Chevron has been part of the volatility trend afflicting many oil stocks recently. Still, Chevron has proven a profitable investment for dividend-seekers over the long term.\nIts $53 billion deal to acquire Hess (NYSE:HES) means significantly more low-cost onshore oil in the Permian Basin and some of the cheapest offshore oil currently being produced. However, a legal challenge by competitor ExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%) delayed the deal's closing until recently.\nIn January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent order to resolve antitrust issues concerning the deal, satisfying a key closing condition. Arbitration proceedings over the remaining interests off the coast of Guyana then concluded in May 2025. Chevron ultimately prevailed in the arbitration case and announced the completion of its acquisition of Hess in July 2025.\nThe Hess acquisition significantly strengthens Chevron's portfolio, including adding a 30% interest in the highly valuable Stabroek Block in Guyana. Chevron is now focused on integrating Hess's operations, and is aiming to achieve $1 billion in annual run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2025.\nCompanies 4 - 6\n4. Target\nFor years, Target (TGT 1.98%) was more profitable than its peers, posting some of the highest gross margins and operating margins in retail. At the same time, its focus on increasing its e-commerce business and expanding in-store offerings helped stabilize its top line while improving profitability.\nRecent years have been quite tumultuous as Target has worked through some growing pains, dealing with lower-than-expected growth compared to industry peers, slowdowns in consumer spending, and other notable headwinds. However, Target remains profitable with a robust balance of cash on hand.\nIn fiscal 2024, the company reported net earnings of $4.1 billion on net sales of $106.6 billion. At the end of the fiscal year, the company had about $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.\nThat's great news for dividend investors. With dividend growth at 55 years and counting and shares trading for attractive earnings and cash-flow multiples, dividend investors should put Target on their shopping list.\n5. Starbucks\nOver the past four decades, Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) has established itself as the dominant global brand in coffee beverages. With more than 40,000 global stores and Starbucks-branded ready-to-drink beverages and packaged coffee in hundreds of thousands more locations, nobody sells -- or buys -- more coffee than this company.\nIn 2023, China returned to more normal public commerce, which has been a big boost for the company. China is Starbucks' second-largest market outside the U.S. and its largest international market. Starbucks has counted on that country to become its biggest and most profitable market over the next decade.\nThe company has also cemented partnerships across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (both through franchise and licensing agreements) as it seeks to open new profitable stores and expand its international segment. However, the company has some challenges to deal with.\nCritics say Starbucks hasn't introduced many exciting new drinks recently, making the menu feel stale and unappealing to customers. Newer coffee chains are gaining popularity, and despite significant expansion in China, Starbucks faces increased competition from local coffee brands, affecting sales in that key market.\nOver the long run, though, its strong brand and power as a buyer have resulted in robust competitive advantages, including cost benefits throughout its operations and pricing power with consumers. Those economic moats and the company's strong digital presence have resulted in a cash cow business.\nWhile business results have softened more recently, this isn't the first challenge the company has faced. It could be an enticing opportunity to invest. Starbucks has increased its dividend yearly for 14 consecutive years.\nIt has also increased annual earnings per share by more than 300% over the last five years alone. Its yield of about 3% at recent prices is on the higher end of its historical range, representing an attractive price to buy company shares.\n6. Brookfield Infrastructure\nSometimes, the best stocks are the ones hidden in plain sight. That's the case with Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC 3.75%) (BIP 2.13%), which owns water, energy, utility, transportation, and communications infrastructure projects worldwide.\nIts assets generate steady recession- and inflation-resistant cash flow, and Brookfield returns a sizable portion to shareholders. At recent Class C share prices, it claimed a dividend yield of about 4.1%, more than 5% for the limited partner units, and aims to raise the payout by 5% to 9% every year.\nCompanies 7 - 9\n7. Microsoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is one of the most important software companies on the planet. Over the past decade, it has rebuilt its business to focus on recurring subscription-based revenue that keeps its customers connected and the cash flowing. The company has a solid balance sheet with more cash than debt and a very low payout ratio that leaves tons of room to increase the dividend.\nIts 20-year streak of dividend increases is easy to miss. Its yield of less than 1% at recent prices hasn't put it on many dividend investors' radars. But what it hasn't paid in yield, Microsoft has absolutely delivered, with total returns of more than 3,000% since 2009 and dividends accounting for a sizable portion of those total returns.\nLooking forward, Microsoft wants to take a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI). With significant investments in and a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the company is integrating AI features across its suite of productivity and communications platforms and its Windows operating system.\n8. American Express\nFinancial services, such as consumer and business lending, are another place to find a handful of top dividend stocks, and American Express (AXP 3.47%) is one of the best. Although it's not on the list of companies that raise their dividends every year, Amex has a decades-long track record of either raising or maintaining its dividends through every economic environment.\nThe big lesson here: When other banks and lenders have cut or even eliminated their dividends, Amex has proven strong enough to keep the payouts coming for its shareholders. That's a credit to its high-quality lending standards and focus on higher-income credit customers who are less likely to default on their debts during weak economic periods.\nThe bottom line is that Amex appeals to investors who like owning a top financial services company but are also concerned about economic conditions. This is a great stock to buy during broad market downturns and a solid hold for a bull market recovery.\n9. Clearway Energy\nRenewable energy is mostly considered a place for growth investors, but it's also a wonderful opportunity for dividends. Clearway Energy (CWEN.A 1.14%)(CWEN 1.18%) is a perfect example. The company invests in, acquires, and operates renewable energy facilities, selling the power on long-term contracts -- think decades, not years -- to utility companies and large power consumers.\nThe stock witnessed extensive volatility over the last few years due to concerns that rising interest rates and perceived weakening in demand for renewables could affect its business. The market could be pricing in those concerns now, but the flip side is that its dividend yield was around 5.7% as of August 2025.\nWorries about the business are probably significantly overstated. Yes, rising rates and inflation have sent wind and solar into a downturn. These are cyclical industries that ebb and flow. Plus, Clearway's earnings come from long-term power production, and utilities continue to demand more and more clean power.\nManagement is moving forward, too, saying their long-term expectations remain unchanged. With ample opportunity ahead and plenty of access to funding, Clearway expects it can continue to grow profits and increase its payout.\nHighest dividends\nHighest dividend stocks\nWhether it's to generate the income you'll use today or the capital you can reinvest to increase your wealth, there's a good chance you're looking for a big dividend payout. If you're hoping to maximize the number of dividends you earn, here are some suggestions.\nFirst, consider dividend yield above dividend size. The dividend yield is a percentage of the share price you paid for the stock, paid in dividends annually. That's far more relevant than the dollar amount of dividends per share.\nNext, don't make owning high-dividend-yielding stocks your No. 1 priority. Focus first on business quality and a company's ability to maintain and increase the payout. Only then can you know whether a high dividend yield is sustainable.\nDividend investors should focus not on dividend size but on dividend yield.\nHow to invest\nHow to invest in dividend stocks\nThis article hits on a few things to avoid (e.g., focusing too much on a high yield that might be a trap) and the power of dividend growth stocks as some of the best winners. Here are some key things to look for when investing in dividend stocks.\n- Identify dividend stocks that meet your criteria. You may be looking for yield, a history of dividend growth, and so forth.\n- Research the history of earnings growth. Dividend growth is sustainable only if a company's earnings have also steadily grown at a similar or higher rate over time.\n- Consider valuation. While paying a modest premium for a high-quality business can sometimes be justified, overpaying can significantly weigh on long-term returns.\n- Determine position sizing. Consider how much exposure you want to a particular stock, how much income you expect it to generate, and other factors to ensure you buy an appropriate amount.\n- Focus on the long term. Dividend stocks deliver best when bought and held for many years. Having patience and letting exceptional managers run great companies while you just sit back and own them is how you get the best returns from dividend stocks.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in dividend stocks\nIf you're new to dividend investing, it's smart to familiarize yourself with dividend stocks and why they can make excellent investments. Once you have a firm grasp of how dividends work, a few key concepts can help you find excellent dividend stocks for your portfolio.\n- Payout ratio: A stock's payout ratio is the amount of money the company pays per share in dividends divided by its earnings per share. In other words, this tells you the percentage of earnings a stock pays to shareholders. A reasonably low payout ratio (say, 70% or less) is a good sign that the dividend is sustainable.\n- History of increases: It's a very good sign when a company raises its dividend year after year, especially when it can continue to do so during recessions and other tough economic times.\n- Steady revenue and earnings growth: When looking for the best dividend stocks to own for the long term, prioritize stability. Erratic revenue (up one year, down the next) and fluctuating earnings can be signs of trouble.\n- Durable competitive advantages: This is perhaps the most important feature. A durable competitive advantage can take several forms, such as proprietary technology, high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, or a powerful brand name.\n- Supportable yield: This is last on the list for a reason. A high yield is obviously preferable to a lower one, but only if the other criteria are met first. A high dividend is only as strong as the business that supports it. So, compare dividend yields after ensuring the business is healthy and the payout is stable.\nRelated investing topics\nDividend stocks are long-term investments\nEven the most rock-solid dividend stocks can experience significant volatility over short periods. There are simply too many market forces that can move them up or down over days or weeks, and many have nothing to do with the underlying business itself.\nSo, while the companies above should make great long-term dividend investments, don't worry too much about day-to-day price movements. Instead, focus on finding companies with excellent businesses, stable income streams, and (preferably) strong dividend track records. The long term will take care of itself.\nDividend stocks vs. dividend funds\nDividend stocks and dividend funds are both popular ways to generate income and potentially grow your investments. Dividend funds, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), invest in a portfolio of multiple dividend stocks. Dividend funds offer diversification and professional oversight by investment managers who carefully select the underlying stocks. With a dividend fund, it's important to pay attention to the expense ratio to determine how much of your investment may go towards fees.\nDividend stocks provide the potential for higher returns but also higher risk. It also takes time and effort to carefully research each business so you can understand whether it is a good fit for your portfolio. Depending on your investing style, you might prefer investing in dividend funds for the instant diversification and exposure they provide to a wide range of income stocks vs. putting cash to work in individual businesses. However, both types of investments can offer advantageous returns for a long-term investor with a well-diversified portfolio.\nFAQ\nBest dividend stocks: FAQ\nWhat stocks pay the highest dividend?\nWhile chasing yield can often lead to bad outcomes, some stocks are just built to be yield machines. Two categories known for paying above-average yields are utilities and REITs, or real estate investment trusts. But just as with any other dividend stock, don't assume that the highest-yielding ones are the best. Be sure to evaluate business quality and whether a company's cash flows support a dividend.\nWhat are dividends in stocks?\nDividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. U.S. companies typically pay dividends quarterly, though some pay less often, and a few even pay monthly.\nDividends are generally paid in cash, but some companies pay in \"scrip,\" which is dividends paid in stock. Note that this is not the same as a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, where a company (or your brokerage) automatically takes your cash dividend and purchases shares for you.\nWhat is considered a good stock dividend?\nIt can vary by sector and even particular industries within a sector, but the most important answer is \"one that can be sustained.\" This is why chasing yield is so dangerous, as a high yield that can't be maintained is no good at all.\nA useful metric for determining a dividend's safety is the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out in dividends. The safest dividends generally have the lowest payout ratios.\nIs it a good idea to buy dividend stocks?\nWhether you're looking for income or just the best possible total returns, chances are good that many dividend stocks can be ideal ways to reach your financial goals. Just remember that yield is often less important than other factors, such as a company's ability to maintain and grow the payout for the long term.\nHow do dividends work?\nA dividend occurs when a company sends money (or stock, though very rarely) to its shareholders. When a company reaches the point that it consistently earns more than management can effectively reinvest, establishing a dividend policy and sending those excess profits back to investors is a smart move.\nDo ETFs pay dividends?\nYes, many ETFs pay dividends. Dividend ETFs hold stocks that pay dividends, and the ETF then distributes those dividends to its investors.\nDoes it matter when you buy a dividend stock?\nWhen you buy dividend stocks, it matters if you purchase them before the ex-dividend date. To receive the next dividend payment, you need to own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.89%) contains 30 industry-leading companies that act as representatives of the broader stock market. The Dow has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the addition of growth stocks such as Salesforce in 2020 and Amazon and Nvidia in 2024. However, the index remains a great starting point for finding top dividend stocks.\nHere's why these Fool.com contributors think Honeywell International (HON 2.43%) of the industrial sector, financial sector representative American Express (AXP 3.47%), and consumer staples stalwart Coca-Cola (KO -0.81%) are three great dividend stocks to buy now, even though they are hovering around all-time highs.\nHoneywell's breakup will create value for investors\nLee Samaha (Honeywell): Despite the recent sell-off of the industrial stock, it remains close to its all-time high price.\nThe investment case for this Dow Jones member currently revolves around its impending breakup and the amount of value that can be released in its constituent parts as they trade as stand-alone companies.\nIt's a breakup with an understandable rationale. For example, aerospace companies (Honeywell Aerospace will be the largest of the three new companies) are traditionally valued differently from industrial companies to reflect the long-cycle nature of their business.\nHoneywell Automation (set to be the remaining company) combines building automation and industrial automation, and its separation is part of a trend of industrial companies becoming more focused as automation becomes more software-driven by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization technologies. It's a trend followed by peers like Emerson Electric, Siemens, and Johnson Controls.\nFinally, the advanced materials business (Solstice Advanced Materials) will offer investors an opportunity to invest in a pure-play sustainable materials business.\nAs you can see from this short description, they are significantly different businesses. When separated into three more focused and agile companies with their own capital raising dynamics and sets of investors behind them, they will have an opportunity to release value for investors.\nAmerican Express remains a good value for long-term investors\nDaniel Foelber (American Express): The financial services company is knocking on the door of an all-time high for all the right reasons. American Express continues to deliver excellent results despite pressures on consumer spending by catering to affluent customers.\nAmerican Express charges relatively high fees for its top credit cards, but it makes those fees worth it by offering cardholders attractive perks -- such as high baseline cash back rates and a variety of reward redemption options.\nUnlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is both a payment processor and a card issuer. Its revenue stream is diverse, consisting of card fees, as well as transaction fees related to card usage frequency and volume.\nIt's a near-perfect business model -- as long as American Express customers pay off their loans. In its latest quarter (second quarter of 2025), American Express reported a 2% net write-off rate. It defines net write-off as a principal loss from a consumer or small business card member, net of what American Express was able to recover (interest not included). Net write-offs are also known as net charge-offs.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, net charge-off rates on credit card banks at all commercial banks for the first quarter of 2025 were 4.44%. This means that American Express does an exceptional job of managing risk and limiting steep losses from customers not paying their loans.\nAmerican Express is similar to an insurance company that has a track record of above-average underwriting -- like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (American Express also happens to be one of Berkshire's largest holdings). In other words, the risk American Express is taking is of high quality relative to the industry -- which makes investing in the company more appealing.\nOver the last three years, American Express stock has soared 130.3% compared to 43.2% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. So the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be -- with a 21.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 17.2 10-year median P/E. However, American Express is arguably worth the premium price due to the strength of its underlying business model and clear path toward future earnings growth.\nPut some pop in your passive income stream with Coca-Cola\nScott Levine (Coca-Cola): Although shares of Coca-Cola have trended lower over the past few weeks, it was only a few months ago that shares had been their most effervescent.\nOn April 22, Coca-Cola stock bubbled up to uncharted territory when it climbed to an intraday high of $74.38 and ultimately closed at $73.90. Since then, shares have retreated from that level, falling about 6% as of this writing. Nonetheless, shares are hardly sporting a frothy valuation, and investors looking to quench their thirst for passive income would be wise to consider Coca-Cola stock along with its forward-yielding 2.9% dividend.\nThose who only know Coca-Cola for the legendary namesake soft drink may be surprised to learn that the company has consistently acquired a variety of brands over the years. From its acquisition of Minute Maid, a popular juice brand, to gaining a well-known iced tea brand with the acquisition of Honest Tea, to picking up a recognizable milk name in its acquisition of Fairlife, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio considerably over the decades. As lifestyle trends shift toward consumers adopting healthier habits, Coca-Cola is well-positioned to prosper from its robust portfolio of consumer beverage brands.\nIn addition to owning the title of the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola wears the crown of Dividend King, having consistently hiked its distribution for 63 consecutive years. While it's not a guarantee that the company will rack up another six decades of dividend hikes, it's certainly an auspicious sign that management is committed to rewarding shareholders.\nA cursory glance at Coca-Cola's valuation suggests that today's not a great time to click the buy button. Shares are trading a 21.7 times operating cash flow. Dig a little deeper, however, and investors will find that the valuation is actually a discount to the stock's five-year average cash flow multiple of 22.6. As an industry leader with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, Coca-Cola stock is a great option now."

      "text": "The Global Industry Classification Standard assigns each stock into a market sector to make it easier for investors to compare companies to their peers and track broader market movements.\nThe system isn't perfect. For example, Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) is in the consumer discretionary sector even though its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, is its most valuable segment -- meaning Amazon is arguably more of a technology company. But overall, the system is useful for achieving portfolio diversification and seeing which sectors are outperforming or underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.52%).\nHere are the 11 stocks I would choose if I could only buy one dividend stock from each sector for the rest of the year.\n1. Technology\nThe technology sector makes up just over a third of the S&P 500 with a 34% weighting. The tech sector includes the three largest companies in the world -- Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. My top tech stock for the rest of 2025 is Texas Instruments (TXN 2.67%).\nThe company is an industry veteran that makes analog and embedded semiconductors. It's not a pure artificial intelligence (AI) play. But Texas Instruments is unique in that it has a highly diversified business. The company stands to benefit from the growth of edge AI, which involves AI on a device level rather than in the cloud.\nWith 21 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 2.7% yield, Texas Instruments stands out as a unique way to invest in tech while generating a sizable amount of passive income.\n2. Financials\nFinancials are the second-largest stock market sector with a 13.8% weight in the S&P 500. Payment processors have wide moats, rock-solid business models, and extremely high margins.\nAmerican Express (AXP 3.47%) takes it a step further by acting as both a payment processor and a card issuer. Issuing cards adds risk to the business, but American Express has an excellent track record of managing that risk, as evidenced by its low net write-off rate.\n3. Consumer discretionary\nThe consumer discretionary sector makes up 10.4% of the S&P 500. The sector can be highly cyclical and sensitive to macro data from the broader economy, housing market, interest rates, and more. Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) is my top pick from the sector because the company's turnaround is going well and the dividend is excellent.\nLast August, Starbucks poached Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol to get Starbucks back on track to consistent international growth. Niccol's Starbucks hasn't been perfect, but it's much more organized and focused on improving customer service.\nWith 14 consecutive years of boosting the payout and a 2.7% yield, Starbucks stands out as a top consumer discretionary stock for generating passive income.\n4. Communications\nThe communications sector comes in at 9.9% of the S&P 500. Alphabet (GOOGL 3.10%) (GOOG 2.98%) stands out as a high-conviction pick due to its diverse business model and dirt cheap valuation.\nFears of Al disrupting Google Search are overblown. Google Search continues to grow at an impressive rate. And adoption for Google Gemini, Alphabet's Chatbot, has been accelerating.\nAlphabet announced its first dividend last year, but it only yields 0.4% .\n5. Healthcare\nHealthcare now only makes up 8.8% of the S&P 500 because the sector has been under pressure due to sell-offs in companies like Eli Lilly (LLY 0.13%).\nEli Lilly is an exciting company in the space because of existing drugs, especially for weight loss and diabetes -- as well as its pipeline of drugs in development.\nThe company passes along capital directly to shareholders through its growing dividend.\n6. Industrials\nIndustrials are right behind healthcare with an 8.6% weighting in the S&P 500. Investors are getting a great value for industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON 2.43%).\nHoneywell is splitting into three separate businesses to unlock value for shareholders. At 24.7 times earnings and with a 2.1% dividend yield, Honeywell is a good buy for folks who believe the company will be more innovative and flexible as three independent entities.\n7. Consumer staples\nConsumer staples make up 5.2% of the S&P 500. The sector has been struggling due to inflationary pressures on consumers. So it's best to approach consumer staples with an emphasis on quality.\nProcter & Gamble (PG -0.04%) is as quality as it gets, with a 2.7% dividend yield and 69 consecutive years of boosting its payout, strong pricing power, and a diverse lineup of industry-leading products spanning beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care.\n8. Energy\nLike consumer staples, the energy sector has been under pressure from relatively low oil prices. There's also the ongoing risk of the energy transition as oil and gas demand could fall over the coming decades.\nIntegrated major ExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%) provides a straightforward way to mitigate the sector's risks. ExxonMobil has a low cost of production, diversified portfolio across upstream, product solutions, and low carbon.\nExxonMobil has 42 consecutive years of increasing its payout and a high yield of 3.7%.\n9. Utilities\nThe utilities sector makes up just 2.5% of the S&P 500. But it's one of the best sectors for generating reliable passive income.\nSouthern Company (SO -0.19%) is hovering around an all-time high due to steadily rising demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers and AI-related tailwinds in Southern Company's wheelhouse in the Southeastern U.S.\nWith a yield of 3.1%, Southern Company is a reliable passive income powerhouse that's worth buying now.\n10. Real estate\nThe real estate sector makes up 2% of the S&P 500. The sector includes companies that own, manage, and develop property, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) that generate income from rental properties.\nMid-America Apartment Communities (MAA 1.34%) is a REIT that specializes in multifamily apartment complexes in the Sun Belt. The company has an excellent track record of maintaining its dividend, which has never decreased over the 30 years that it has been paid. The dividend has increased significantly in recent years, boosting the yield to 4.3%.\n11. Materials\nThe materials sector makes up just 1.8% of the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams (SHW 2.52%) is the lone materials stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it's a perfect representative for the sector.\nThe company has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years and consistently repurchases its stock. The company does much more than residential paint, including a thriving industrial and commercial business that includes paint and coatings for industrial wood, marine, automotive, and more. It operates its own stores and works with retailers like Lowe's and Walmart.\nSherwin-Williams only yields 0.9%, but that's due to the stock's strong long-term performance rather than a lack of commitment to growing the dividend."
