      "text": "Minnesota school shooting gunman kills 2 children, injures 17 others during Catholic Mass\nA shooting was reported Wednesday at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. Police confirm 17 injured, two children dead. The suspect took his own life in the rear of the church.\nCoverage for this event has ended.\nAll 14 students who were injured during Wedesday's barrage of gunfire inside the Minneapolis church are expected to survive, authorities said.\n\u201cI believe all of them have their parents with them now. And they are all expected to survive all of the remaining victims are expected to survive,\u201d Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters.\nPolice said 14 children, ages ranging from 6 to 15, were injured, as well as three adults who were parishioners in their 80s, officials said.\nMelania Trump called for the U.S. to start focusing on early-warning systems following the tragic mass shooting Wednesday at a Catholic school in Minnesota.\nThe first lady says that too often clear signals of violent behavior are evident but overlooked.\n\u201cThe tragic mass killing in Minnesota illuminates the need for pre-emptive intervention in identifying potential school shooters. Early warning signs are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions,\u201d her post said.\nShe also urged a nationwide push for behavioral threat assessments.\n\u201cTo prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society \u2014 beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.\u201d\nThe shooting in Minnesota has sparked debates regarding school safety and what bystanders can do to spot the red flags in advance.\nIt was noted by Minneapolis Police that 23-year-old Robin Westman the shooter had made troubling messages on social media leading up to the attack.\nTrump\u2019s comments echo the theme she championed as the first lady, the \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative, which focused in part on online behavior and children\u2019s mental health.\nFormer Biden administration spokeswoman and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki blasted President Donald Trump\u2019s D.C. anti-crime crackdown and the power of prayer as she reacted to a church school shooting in Minnesota Wednesday.\nAuthorities said at least two children were killed and more than a dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis.\nWHO IS ROBIN WESTMAN, SUSPECT IN ANNUNCIATION CATHOLIC SCHOOL SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS?\nIn the aftermath of mass shootings, Americans often offer prayers for victims, their families and communities. In Catholic and Orthodox traditions, prayers for the dead ask that their souls be received into heaven.\nBut many gun control advocates deride prayer, arguing that it is not enough and government action must be taken to stop mass shootings. Psaki echoed that view in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nRead more about what Psaki said about the shooting in Minnesota.\nThis is an excerpt from a story by Fox News Digital\u2019s Alexander Hall and Alexa Moutevelis.\nPope Leo XIV offered his condolences in the hours following Wednesday's shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic church.\nA message from the Cardinal Secretary of State was read during a Wednesday night vigil expressing Leo's thoughts on the shooting.\n\"His Holiness Pope Leo the 14th was profoundly saddened to learn of the loss of life and injuries following the shooting that took place at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, and he sends his heartfelt condolences and the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child,\u201d said the message, which was read by Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda.\n\u201cWhile commending the souls of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God, his holiness prays for the wounded as well as the first responders medical personnel and wounded as well, and the clergy who are caring for them and their loved ones at this extremely difficult time,\" he added.\n\u201cHis Apostolic blessing as a pledge of peace, fortitude and consolation in the Lord Jesus. My prayer for you, my brothers and sisters, is that you might experience that peace, that fortitude, and that consolation that Pope Leo desires for each one of us,\" the message continued.\nVirginia Gov.

Protect the children. Save lives.\u201d\nOfficials in Minneapolis confirmed that the shooter was dead and took his own life.\nPack said now the investigation shifts to gathering shell casings, reviewing security footage, tracing the firearms and interviewing witnesses.\nHe added that investigators will also look at the suspect\u2019s past to understand warning signs and whether others were involved.\u201cThe main question they are answering, \u2018Why would someone do this?\u2019\u201d Pack said.\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin interrupted his party\u2019s summer meeting Wednesday in Minneapolis to announce the mass shooting in the same city.\n\u201cI just want to announce some news.

He also said he was \"shocked,\" and thought there was \"no way that that could be gunfire, there was so much of it.\"\nPolice have confirmed that two children were killed in the shooting and 17 other individuals were injured, including 14 children and three adults.\nThe shooter is dead, likely from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though police have not conclusively stated his cause of death.\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed on Wednesday that two children were killed and 17 others were injured, 14 of whom were children.\n\"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\" O'Hara said while addressing reporters.\nAdditionally, O'Hara said police believe the assailant took his own life.

Students and teachers should not be putting their lives on the line just by going back to school. We must do more to stop gun violence in America.\u201d\nJeffries similarly called the Catholic school shooting \u201chorrifying.\u201d\n\u201cPraying for the children, families and first responders during this moment of terror and unimaginable grief,\u201d he wrote on X, in part. \u201cWeapons of war have no place in our neighborhoods, streets or schools.\u201d\nChildren\u2019s Minnesota Hospital said six children are being treated after the shooting at a Minnesota Catholic school. The hospital would not share details on the patients out of respect for them and their loved ones.\nA federal source on the ground in Minneapolis confirmed to Fox News that an estimated 15 to 20 people were injured in a shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School.\nAnother federal source told Fox News Digital that there were 20 injured, and were \u201cmostly children.\u201d\nIt was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities.\nFox News Digital's Preston Mizell and Fox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.\nA shooting was reported Wednesday at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, according to the state's governor, Tim Walz.\nWalz wrote on X that \"I\u2019ve been briefed on a shooting at Annunciation Catholic School\" and \"I\u2019m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence.\"\nThe Minneapolis Police Department shared a message from the city of Minneapolis confirming \"there is no active threat to the community at this time\" and \"the shooter is contained.\" Sources told Fox 9 that the suspect \u2013 who has not been publicly identified \u2013 is deceased.\nLive Coverage begins here"
