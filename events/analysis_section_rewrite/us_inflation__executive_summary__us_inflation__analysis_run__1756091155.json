      "feedback": "Overall, the analysis credibly links crypto pricing to a macro regime map, but it is too long, unfocused, and thin on a single, decision-ready house view. Actionable edits: 1) distill to a 4–6 sentence executive brief (or 4–6 bullets) with a single house view at the top (policy regime → discount-rate path → crypto demand) and tight sections on catalysts, risks, and watch items; 2) fix the causal chain so every crypto implication (discount rates, ETF/corporate ether demand, staking/stablecoins) is explicitly driven by the regime signal (Tight/Transition/Easy) and cite OGK8WLL69 and 2QRLB974F for policy inputs; 3) anchor all quantitative claims to the source IDs in one place (ETH ≈ 4,955; BTC ≈ 110k–124k; ETH ETF inflows >$5B/mo; YTD ETH inflows ≈$9.6B; staking ~one-third of supply) and, if possible, attach a probabilistic Regime A/B/C weight (e.g., 50/30/20) to frame sensitivity; 4) replace broad tangential macro examples with explicit triggers and invalidation points: e.g., a faster-than-expected rate-cut path or hawkish surprise from Powell; failure of GENIUS/Project Crypto to deliver durable tailwinds; ETF approvals delays; and quantify thresholds (e.g., ETF inflows, staking share, corporate ether buys) to define watchpoints; 5) prune or relocate non‑crypto cross-asset illustrations (Pacaso, Walmart, Ford EV, etc.) to watch-items only, ensuring the core narrative remains crypto-centric and grounded in the regime framework; 6) tighten citation discipline—place IDs after each assertion, reconcile any conflicting sources (prioritize the most proximate source for each claim), and ensure all critical sources (OGK8WLL69, 2QRLB974F, NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, JPAIHPA4N, 17F49LURJ, S3, etc.) are present and consistently applied.",
