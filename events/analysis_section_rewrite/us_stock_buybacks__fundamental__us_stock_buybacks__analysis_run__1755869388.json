      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the macroeconomic landscape but could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in reasoning. To elevate it to world-class quality, ensure a more coherent causal chain by explicitly linking the factors influencing market dynamics, such as how cash reserves directly translate into equity investments. Ground your arguments in first principles by quantifying the impact of productivity gains and interest rate changes on corporate earnings and market valuations, avoiding vague assertions. Incorporate specific scenarios for potential outcomes based on varying levels of productivity and interest rates, and clearly outline catalysts and triggers for market movements. Increase citation density by referencing specific data points from the sources to support claims, particularly regarding earnings performance and investor sentiment. Lastly, reconcile conflicting views on market valuation and stagflation risks more thoroughly to present a balanced perspective.",
