      "feedback": "The current draft nails the broad multi‑year regime but falls short on a disciplined, first‑principles framework and a tight causal transmission to market pricing; to upgrade, reframe as a formal regime analysis with invariant anchors (rooted in first principles such as policy reaction functions, productivity/CapEx dynamics, terms‑of‑trade, real rate/frame, and BoP exposure), then map explicit regimes and transition conditions before delivering a base case, risks, and watchpoints; anchor these to the sources (SGB2PAZGK for the tariff/reshoring regime and energy/Data‑center buildout, including the 145% baseline and talk of an 80% tariff; O4ZEED2EB for CEO pay structure and stock‑based incentives; 65UUBU0OR and the Fool Ford pieces for Ford’s EV losses, ROIC/operating margins and dividend yield; W2622L6WW for ROIC framing) and reconcile any tensions; quantify the channels and timings with concrete numbers: tariff luminosity and ramp dates from SGB2PAZGK, Ford’s EV loss magnitude (~$1.3B in Q2) and 5.18% dividend yield with forward P/E ~10.3 from 65UUBU0OR, Ford’s ~17% YTD rise from the same; CEO pay data showing a 7.7% rise to a median $19M (O4ZEED2EB); and total return/ROIC framing from W2622L6WW; build a clean causal chain: policy regime → onshore CapEx (chip fabs, AI data centers, energy infra) → supply‑chain resilience and data‑center demand → equity pricing dispersed along capital‑intensive tech vs cyclical autos (Ford as income play; Ford’s cyclicality and EV risk in 65UUBU0OR/O4ZEED2EB) → valuation signals; add catalysts and invalidation rules: policy intensity shifts (tariff baseline held or raised toward 145% or higher; tariff escalations on India/China spillovers in SGB2PAZGK), tech/EV profitability inflection points (Ford EV profitability timelines and Model E ramp; EV margin implications in the Fool pieces), geopolitical pivots (India/China dynamics in SGB2PAZGK), and a clear invalidation trigger (tariffs rollback or rapid global supply‑chain normalization); present a two‑section scenario tree (base case vs upside/downside) with event‑driven timing windows (e.g., next 12–24 months for capex cycles, 3–5 years for onshore capacity fully ramped); tighten the narrative so every assertion cites a source ID, and explicitly separate base case reasoning from attached assumptions; enhance rigor by adding sensitivity bands (e.g., if tariff baseline remains at 10% vs 145%, how does capex intensity and Ford’s EV losses alter the pricing gap); ensure horizon language mirrors SECTION FOCUS by stating regimes, regime transitions, and the causal chain to market pricing, concluding with a concise base case, enumerated risks, watch list, and confidence level; finally, trim extraneous elements (e.g., extended Wealth‑of‑The‑Fool ROIC tutorials) and keep all numeric anchors tightly tied to the cited sources (O4ZEED2EB, SGB2PAZGK, 65UUBU0OR, W2622L6WW) to maintain density and correctness.",
