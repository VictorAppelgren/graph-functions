Tom Cotton wrote a letter to the chairman of Intel's board of directors with concerns about conflicts of interest and US national security. Cotton wrote specifically asking about Tan's reported investments and previous leadership at Cadence Design Systems. He also questioned Tan's reported investments in Chinese companies, including some with ties to the Chinese military.  A spokesperson for Intel said the company looks forward to working with Cotton on these matters and that Intel and Tan \"are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defense ecosystem.\"In response to Trump, Tan addressed Intel in a memo:The flagging US chipmaker has received $8 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act. Tan hopes to turn the company around and has highlighted its importance to US national security.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Intel's stock price was up more than 2% after market close.",
