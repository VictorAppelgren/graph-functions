      "feedback": "Your draft shows a solid ambition to fuse macro, policy, flows/positioning, and tech/valuation, but the causal chain is not yet crisp enough, and the medium-term scenario structure, signals, and numerical anchors need stronger tightness and traceability. Actionable edits: 1) rebuild the causality into a clean, testable chain: AI/digital infrastructure and cloud build-out (anchored by 2.4T cloud spend by 2030; Azure +39% YoY; Shopify +31% YoY) lift productivity and operating leverage, which should be linked to durable cash generation (net income $906M, FCF $422M) and higher equity multiples via a cost-of-capital/justness framework; explicitly show how these translate into a range for implied profitability and ROIC given the stated capital costs (DGICB; TN66GHPAT). 2) convert the base case into a multi-scenario framework (baseline, upside, downside) with explicit catalysts and invalidation rules tied to cited data: inflation prints and wage momentum paths that trigger the Fed’s reaction function (as described), accelerator/heating in AI-driven hiring/automation (IBM hiring pause as a signal), cloud-demand milestones, and Just Capital index shifts; specify what would invalidate the view (e.g., a material surprise in 10Y yields or a policy path that decisively tightens beyond current expectations). 3) sharpen the transmission channels into four explicit channels (macro/inflation-policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals, FX) with directional signs and mechanics, and tie each channel to a cited data point (0G3A676BP for cloud/AI, DGICB/TN66GHPAT for cost of capital/justness, 4LQD15CFU for AI productivity signal, 5S9GJV2O3/UVEQ2SJ0W/HWGNUP2XG for EURUSD regime, governance and margins). 4) replace generalized statements with quantified ranges from sources: e.g., “cost of capital tightens” vs “dividend yields 1.8–2.2%” and “justness premium 12–18%,” and explicitly state how these feed into fair-value multiples; avoid qualitative platitudes. 5) reorganize the EURUSD cross-regime section to map each regime to a concrete macro driver and to a testable FX/asset-pricing implication, ensuring all three FX/valuation claims rely on the four-regime spine. 6) produce a concise watch-list of decisive signals (e.g., inflation prints and wage data; Azure/cloud milestones; Shopify operating metrics; IBM hiring trends; updates to Just Capital indices; shifts in 10Y yields and risk premia) with explicit thresholds that would flip the stance. 7) tighten citations so every substantive claim has a source tag and explicitly reconcile any conflicts (policy path vs. real rates, AI gains vs. margin translation). 8) trim length and improve readability by dropping redundant clauses, normalizing parentheses, and delivering a single, coherent narrative that foregrounds the cross-topic drivers, their direction, and the fragile points; maintain all IDs from SOURCE MATERIAL.",
