  "description": "Maximizing your Mac",
  "content": "While the new \u2018Liquid Glass\u2019 look and a way more powerful Spotlight might be the leading features of macOS Tahoe 26, I\u2019ve found that bringing over a much-loved iPhone feature has proven to be the highlight after weeks of testing.\n\nLive Activities steal the show on the iPhone, thanks to their glanceability and effortless way of highlighting key info, whether it\u2019s from a first or third-party app. Some of my favorites are:\n\u2022 Flighty displays flight tracking details in real-time, for myself, family, or friends\n\u2022 Airlines like United show my seat, a countdown for boarding, or even baggage claim\n\u2022 Rideshare apps tell you what kind of car you're driving is arriving in\n\u2022 Apple Sports displays your favorite teams' live scores in real-time with the game\n\nNow, all of this is arriving on the Mac \u2013 right at the top navigation bar, near the right-hand side. They appear when your iPhone is nearby, signed into the same Apple Account, and mirror the same Live Activities you\u2019d see on your phone. It\u2019s a simple but powerful addition.\n\nConsidering Apple brought iPhone Mirroring to the Mac in 2024, this 2025 follow-up isn\u2019t surprising. But it\u2019s exactly the kind of small feature that makes a big difference. I\u2019ve loved being able to check a score, track a flight, or see my live position on a plane \u2013 without fishing for my phone.\n\nI\u2019ve used it plenty at my desk, but to me, it truly shines in Economy class. If you\u2019ve ever tried balancing an iPhone and a MacBook Pro \u2013 or even a MacBook Air \u2013 on a tray table, you know the awkward overlap. I usually end up propping the iPhone against my screen, hanging it off the palm rest, or just tossing it in my lap. With Live Activities on the Mac, I can stick to one device and keep the tray table clutter-free.\n\nConsidering notifications already sync, iPhone Mirroring arrived last year, Live Activities were ultimately the missing piece. On macOS Tahoe, they sit neatly collapsed in the menu bar, just like the Dynamic Island on iPhone, and you can click on one to expand and see the full Live Activity. Another click on any of these Live Activities quickly opens the app on your iPhone via the Mirroring app \u2013 it all works together pretty seamlessly.\n\nYou can also easily dismiss them, as I have found they automatically expand for major updates, saving screen real estate on your Mac. If you already have a Live Activity that you really enjoy on your iPhone, there\u2019s really no extra work needed from the developer, as these will automatically repeat.\n\nAll-in-all, it\u2019s a small but super helpful tool that really excels in cramped spaces. So, if you\u2019ve ever struggled with the same balancing act as I have with a tray table, your iPhone, and a MacBook, know that relief is on the way.\n\nIt's arriving in the Fall (September or October) with the release of macOS Tahoe 26. If you want it sooner, the public beta of macOS Tahoe 26 is out now, but you'll need to be okay with some bugs and slowdowns.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 AOL ends dial-up: Why the goodbye to that scratchy sounds matters\n\u2022 I've tested 14 coffee makers in the last year, and these are the top 3 automatic machines I recommend for easy brewing\n\u2022 I swapped my alarm clock for this Philips Hue light, and I've never felt more refreshed in the morning",

      "text": "AOL ends dial-up: Why the goodbye to that scratchy sounds matters\nYou had mail\nThe classic dial-up handshake sounds melodic, scratchy, and harsh, and is inexorably associated with connection. It\u2019s also now silent. AOL\u2019s decision this week to finally end dial-up service is not surprising, but it still feels like a door closing, one I walked through more times than I can count to step onto the world wide web.\nIt\u2019s a sound immortalized in the 1998 Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan rom-com You\u2019ve Got Mail, a film in which the then insanely popular AOL service propels the plot forward to its unsurprising and deeply romantic conclusion.\nWhen I first started covering and working online, AOL was one of the chief portals to the new digital world, and the only way to traverse that portal was via a dial-up modem, one connected to your PC on one side and your phone line on the other. (Having a phone line close to your computer was a big deal \u2013 kids today are spoiled by ubiquitous, high-speed Wi-Fi... but I digress.)\nIn today's always-connected world, it\u2019s hard to conceive of the intentionality of this act. In the 1990s, our phones were dumb, and your computer dealt with local networks and files. We called dial-up \u201cgoing online\u201d because it was like taking a trip in which the mode of transportation was a little box with the magic code to connect you to the Internet and, ultimately, the information superhighway.\nBefore home broadband, everyone knew the handshake sound and, yes, millions were dialing into AOL (America Online) \u2013 a network of its own \u2013 to access the internet.\nIf you were breaking down the dial-up process, you might look at it as two distinct parts: the dialing of the AOL number, and then a series of negotiation sounds all designed to ensure that the modem was legit and speaking the correct language. Once the system on the other side of the connection was satisfied, you\u2019d be connected and soon hear, \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail.\u201d\nThat mail system was also an integral part of AOL. There was no Gmail, and far fewer people were using online mail systems from Yahoo or even Microsoft (I should add that these days, having a @hotmail.com mail account is akin, for some, to having an @AOL.com mail account).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDial-up started its rapid decline in the late 1990s as cable companies introduced broadband over coaxial cable. Instead of knocking on the internet\u2019s door with a phone call, broadband paved an open path to the digital realm. One day, we had the classic dial-up sound in my home, and the next day, we did not.\nDial-up continued to serve a purpose well into the first decade of the new millennium, and broadband took years to reach rural communities. In 2009, Netzero tried to bring dial-up back as an affordable alternative to pricey broadband. Imagine someone trying to sell consumers on the horse and buggy decades after the automobile had become ubiquitous. It was a terrible plan and, in my opinion, set back broadband reach a few years.\nEven so, by 2022 the number of people still using dial-up had dropped to 175,000. I'm sure the number today might equate to the population of a very small, one-street town in middle America. I hope AOL is at least supporting those who still can't connect to cable or fiber.\nIt's not like we didn't see this coming. In recent years, other big companies with names that start with A have been turning their backs on dial-up technology.\nMy sadness is not ennui for a better time. It\u2019s really just nostalgia for a digital snapshot, a moment when we had to make an effort to get connected and then wait, in anticipation, as the modem completed its digital handshake before opening the door to reveal the growing world of digital connections and information. I wonder if, perhaps, we appreciated the miracle of connection more for the effort that was involved.\nWe take it for granted now; and Gen Z, in particular, surely has no idea what it means to prime the pump of online before adding an Instagram post. But what if they did? What if, just once a year, we declared it 'Dial-Up Day' and you had to run a fake modem handshake before you could use your laptop or smartphone?\nRidiculous, I know, but the thought does make me smile.\nYou might also like\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

Its decision to build its own silicon, meanwhile, has given it an advantage over rivals such as Samsung and Microsoft - one that's only slowly being closed.\nIt's been every bit as dominant in the software space through iOS, macOS, watchOS, iTunes, Apple Pay, and more, while its Apple TV Plus streaming service is now regularly home to top-quality, award-winning original content.\nApple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, and has been led by CEO Tim Cook since 2011.

      "text": "How to download the macOS Tahoe 26 developer beta\nCan\u2019t wait to try macOS Tahoe? Here\u2019s how you can do that now\nApple has just shown off the next version of its desktop operating system for the best MacBooks and Macs at WWDC 25, and presumably if you\u2019ve arrived here wondering about installing macOS Tahoe 26, you were impressed by the new features that were revealed with Tahoe.\nHow do you go about trying macOS 26, then? Well, before you forge on towards that goal, do bear in mind that this is the developer beta, the very first airing of macOS Tahoe 26. A more refined public beta will come later, but if you\u2019re jumping into Lake Tahoe now, you\u2019ll need a robust tolerance for bugs, a steely level of perseverance, and maybe some armbands. In short: it won\u2019t be an easy ride.\nNeither can anyone just jump into the developer beta, which, as the name makes clear, is for developers. And, in the same name-on-the-tin vein, the public beta is for the general computing public.\nSo, at this stage, if you\u2019re a developer you can get onboard. Or, if you\u2019re an Apple enthusiast and really keen macOS user, you can sign up to be a \u2018developer\u2019 as it were. It will, however, cost you \u2013 a fairly substantial chunk of cash \u2013 and all told, you\u2019re better off waiting for the public beta, which will arrive in July 2025. But if money is no object, here\u2019s how you can install and then play around with macOS Tahoe 26 now.\nHow to install the macOS 26 Tahoe beta on your Mac (developers only)\nFirst of all, you must have a compatible Mac to install macOS Tahoe \u2013 check here to find out if your device is good to go in that respect. Also, remember that this is early beta software, so it\u2019s not advisable to put it on your daily driver Mac. Ideally, you want to instal this on a secondary device.\nIf you\u2019re intent on having a macOS Tahoe developer beta on your main PC, then understand that it\u2019s risky to run a pre-release operating system on it \u2013 and definitely be sure to back up before proceeding (you should do this in any case).\nSecondly, you need to be a software developer. If you are, you must be signed into your Apple Developer account: head here, and click on Account, top-right, then login.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIf you don\u2019t have a developer account, then you\u2019ll need to create one here, signing up as an individual which requires an Apple Account (with two-factor authentication enabled). You\u2019ll need to provide a payment method, and a developer membership costs $99 per year, so it\u2019s hardly cheap.\nOnce Apple verifies you and sets up your Apple Developer membership \u2013 or if you already have one and are logged in \u2013 you can proceed to download macOS Tahoe.\nHead to System Settings > General > Software Update on your Mac, and where it says \u2018Beta Updates\u2019 click the Info (i) icon on the right. In the panel that opens, along from Beta Updates, click the button on the right, where it says \u2018Off\u2019 and you\u2019ll get a list of options. Choose the macOS Tahoe Developer Beta from that list, click Done, and then click Upgrade Now.\nThat\u2019s it \u2013 the upgrade will go ahead, and you\u2019ll be immersing yourself in the hopefully not too turbulent waters of Lake Tahoe. (And yes, it does sound like an Intel processor rather than a piece of Apple software \u2013 ironically, given that macOS 26 does away with support for a fair few more Macs that have Team Blue\u2019s CPUs inside).\nYou might also like...\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "The iPhone\u2019s Dynamic Island will get a \u201csignificant evolution,\u201d one leaker says, but I\u2019m skeptical about their claims\nNew info or a whole lot of nothing?\n- Several leakers have made claims about the iPhone 17\u2019s Dynamic Island\n- A new report says it will undergo a \u201csignificant evolution\u201d\n- But the claims are so vague that they actually tell us very little\nIf you\u2019ve been keeping up with all the latest iPhone 17 rumors, you\u2019ll probably have heard that Apple\u2019s next iPhone could come with a redesigned Dynamic Island. That idea has just been bolstered by a prominent leaker, although their post is frustratingly short on solid details.\nIn a new interview with Spanish-language site AppleX4, leaker Majin Bu has chimed in with their thoughts on the upcoming Dynamic Island changes. There, they said the feature is set for a \u201csignificant evolution.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cApple appears committed to making [the Dynamic Island] more functional and integrated, turning it into a key element of the user experience. This development could mark a step forward in device interaction, but for now, I\u2019ll keep further details under wraps. Stay tuned to see how this innovation unfolds.\u201d\nThis information comes after Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station commented on the Dynamic Island last week, saying that it would get a new-look design. Digital Chat Station has previously claimed that the Dynamic Island will be shrunk down to its smallest-ever size in the iPhone 17, but that contradicts the belief of Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who argued in January that the Dynamic Island would remain \u201clargely unchanged\u201d in this year\u2019s iPhones.\nIs this anything new?\nWhile it is a somewhat divisive feature of modern iPhones, I\u2019m a big fan of the Dynamic Island. That means I pay close attention whenever someone talks about how it might change in future Apple devices.\nI\u2019d love to see a slimmer Dynamic Island, or even one that disappears entirely until it is needed. The latter would require the use of under-screen cameras and Face ID sensors, but could combine the beauty of an uninterrupted display with the functionality of the Dynamic Island.\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t get anything like that from Majin Bu, whose latest claims are extremely vague to the point of being basically unverifiable. They\u2019ve not shared anything of note, other than saying that the Dynamic Island is due to change in some nebulous, important way, which feels like a safe way to say very little.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple, surely, would also argue that the Dynamic Island is already both \u201cfunctional and integrated\u201d and \u201ca key element of the user experience.\u201d While Majin Bu might have some exclusive information here, their elusiveness and refusal to share solid details could be an indication that the opposite is actually true.\nMajin Bu has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple leaks. Some of their predictions have been on the money, while others have been wide of the mark. That, combined with the vagueness of their latest Dynamic Island claims, means we should treat this latest rumor with a healthy degree of skepticism until more reliable information emerges.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

Just take your pick from the menu, and the machine will handle the dosing, grinding, and brewing for you, then steam and dispense milk too if your chosen drink calls for it.\nAutomatic coffee makers tend to be more expensive than manual machines, and sometimes require more cleaning (particularly if the milk enters any part of the machine), but you'll still save a lot of time compared to brewing yourself, and you can be assured of perfectly consistent results every time with no experience at all.\nCurious? Here are my three top recommendations for effortless brewing. If you can't see quite what you want, take a look at my complete guides to the best coffee makers and the best espresso machines for more option.\nPhilips LatteGo 5500 Series\nThis compact automatic machine is my top recommendation if you're the sole coffee-drinker in your household. Not only is it one of the smallest I've tested in recent months (it measures 9.7 x 14.6 x 17 inches, or 24.6 x 37.1 x 43.3cm), it's also cleverly designed so you don't have excessive quantities of beans, water, and milk hanging around to spoil.\nFirst, let's take a look at the water tank. It has a modest capacity of 1.9qt / 1.8 liters, and even less when you've fitted the supplied water filter (something that's not included with many coffee machines in this price bracket), but that's perfectly fine if you're only brewing one or two drinks at a time. Fresh water is always best, so there's no point in having liters of water hanging around in your machine unused.\nI also like the fact that the tank slides out of the front, so you can place the machine up against a wall and don't have to move it out when it's time for a top-up.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe bean hopper is also small, capable of holding only enough coffee for a few brews at once. It has a rubber seal to prevent air getting in, and a tinted lid to protect your beans from light (both of which will make them degrade faster) but again, it's best to only keep the beans you'll need today in the hopper. For one person, this is just right.\nFinally, we have the LatteGo milk system. You fill the carafe while it's attached to the machine, which is a bit strange, but it works very well. There are measuring lines so you can add just enough milk for your favorite latte or cappuccino, and once you're done the carafe separates into two simple parts you can wash up in seconds. No containers full of milk hanging around in the fridge, and no gross tubes to clean.\nThe only downsides are that you can't adjust the direction of the spout, so you have to be careful where you place your cup on the drip tray, and the 'iced coffee' options are a bit of a cheat \u2013 instead of brewing coffee cold, the machine instructs you to add ice to your cup and then pours hot espresso over it. Personally I don't think those are dealbreakers, though.\nRead our full Philips LatteGo 5500 Series review\nSmeg BCC13\nIf you want an automatic coffee machine that looks great and doesn't take up your entire kitchen counter, the Smeg BCC13 is the one for you. This super smart machine is available in a range of matt-finish colors (white, black, green, and blue), and has the -combination of curves and sleek lines you'd associate with Smeg's 1960s-inspired appliances.\nIt boasts a generously sized water tank, which slots into the top of the machine (an unusual design choice that leaves the sides clear), a bean hopper with an opaque lid to protect your coffee from exposure to light, and a handy hatch for removing the brew group for easy cleaning. The whole thing feels extremely well put together, and it's beautifully finished inside and out.\nThere's no color touchscreen here. Instead, Smeg has decided to keep things classy and minimalist with a row of physical buttons along the BCC13's top edge for your different drink and maintenance options. Pressing and holding will open up a secondary menu, and once you've picked a drink you'll be able to tweak brewing options like adjusting the volume to suit your favorite cups.\nIt's not as self-explanatory as a touchscreen, but it does look great. Just remember to keep the quick reference guide nearby until you've memorised what each button does.\nThe resulting espresso is delicious whether enjoyed alone, or as the foundation of an americano, latte, or cappuccino. The BCC13 has a milk-foaming system that includes a fridge-friendly milk container, with a hose that pushes onto the side of the coffee dispenser, where it releases perfectly textured foam. The system worked better with dairy milk than plant-based alternatives during my tests, so bear that in mind when making your decision.\nRead our full Smeg BCC13 review\nJura J10\nIf you want an automatic coffee maker that really does it all, the Jura J10 is well worth your attention. It's a successor to the hugely popular J8, with one interesting addition that will appeal to anyone whose regular coffee order brings baristas out in a cold sweat: SweetFoam.\nThis is a cleverly designed system that infuses your milk with flavored syrup while it's foamed, and works with dairy or non-dairy milk, hot or cold. Just pour your syrup into the small container provided, push it onto the milk dispenser nozzle, and it'll be incorporated next time you make a drink. Because it's distributed evenly throughout the milk, you only need a tiny bit to get the same flavor you would if you pumped the syrup into the bottom of your coffee cup.\nOf course, none of that would matter if the J10 wasn't also an excellent coffee maker, but there are no worries on that front \u2013 in fact, it's one of the best around. Just choose your drink (there's a vast menu of hot and cold options), adjust the grind size as instructed, and the machine will handle the rest.\nThe J10 makes some of the best espresso I've ever had from a fully automatic coffee machine, making the perfect foundation for your beverage of choice. The J10 also boasts an impressive cold brew option, which pulses cold water through your freshly-ground coffee at high pressure, producing a mellow-tasting drink that's remarkably similar to traditionally-made cold brew that's infused slowly overnight.\nThere's even a smart system called Coffee Eye, which will detect where you've placed your cup and change the menu accordingly. If you've put the cup directly under the central coffee dispenser, it will only offer drinks without milk. Place it under the milk dispenser and you can also choose lattes and cappuccinos.\nRead our full Jura J10 review\nYou might also like\n- 6 ways to brew better coffee at home, according to a certified coffee grader \u2013 and the most common coffee myths busted\n- Breville's new espresso machine can brew coffee and steam milk at the same time \u2013 and it's eye-wateringly expensive\n- I went hands-on with the new Sage Luxe Brewer Thermal, and it might be the best drip coffee maker I've ever used\nCat is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in kitchen appliances and smart home technology.

      "text": "Liquid Glass on iMac G4 is the mashup I didn't know I needed \u2013 now I can't stop thinking about it\nReviving an iconic design\nImagine a sunflower. Now imagine a computer that looks like one. Now imagine a sunflower-style computer running an interface that mimics the look and feel of glass. That's what I'm staring at \u2013 online at least \u2013 and I can't look away from this iMac G4 running Liquid Glass.\nIt's quite the mashup. The iconic iMac G4 launched 23 years ago with OS X and Liquid Glass is part of the macOS Tahoe 26 Public Beta, which launched just days ago. The project, spotted by 9to5Mac, is the brainchild of Colby Sheets, who first took the 2002 all-in-one, gutted it, and installed an M1 Mac Mini in 2021.\nHe posted about that on X and in this most recent follow-up, displayed a few images of what macOS 26 would look like on the iMac G4's floating, 15-inch active matrix LCD screen.\nLiquid Glass in macOS 26 Tahoe looks amazing on the iMac G4 btw \ud83d\ude42\u2195\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/VksD7oEfd4August 2, 2025\nIn a word, it looks lovely, but it's not just that the macOS 26 interface tries to ride the fine line between frosted glass mimicry and readable interface elements. I'm not sure I'd be as entranced if it weren't on the all-but-forgotten first floating-screen, all-in-one iMac.\nI have a certain affinity for this system because it takes me back to a pivotal moment in tech history.\nIt was a recession, not a great time for computing or even the Internet, which was experiencing the aftermath of the rapid deflation of the dot-com bubble. Our industry needed something.\nThe last design and development spark had come, unsurprisingly, from Apple, which under returning CEO Steve Jobs' guidance introduced the first candy-colored all-in-one iMac that was both a design and commercial hit.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThings had been relatively quiet since then, with only the original iPod, more of a consumer electronics device, to inspire the Apple minions and gadget enthusiasts at large. On the computing side, it was the doldrums. Many of the Windows whitebox PC companies had either been acquired or were disappearing (Gateway, eMachines, Zeos), and what the rest of the industry was producing were mostly uninspiring tower PCs.\nBlooming technology\nThe iMac arrived as a cover story in Time Magazine on January 14, 2002. It was weeks before the unofficial unveiling of the product at Macworld, so we all pored over the story and marveled at the images of this utterly unique system.\nWith just a 10.4-inch in diameter, circular, domed white base, chrome arm, and floating thin panel display, the iMac G4 looked nothing like the last iMac or any of the All-in-One PCs then filling Best Buy, Circuit City, and Micro Center shelves.\nThe design was quite intentional. Jobs recounted to Time the conversation he had in his backyard flower garden with then Apple Designer Jony Ive about how the new iMac should differ from the previous and arguably still quite popular model.\n\"Why have a flat display if you\u2019re going to glom all this stuff on its back? Why stand a computer on its side when it really wants to be horizontal and on the ground? Let each element be what it is, be true to itself.\u201d Instead of looking like the old iMac, the thing should look more like the flowers in the garden. Jobs said, \u201cIt should look like a sunflower.\u201d\nAnd so it does. The iMac G4 (for the CPU inside) is arguably the most plant-like of all iMacs before or since. New iMacs still have a floating display, but the base is flat and devoid of components, which now all fit neatly inside the screen panel body. Any other design, and Colby Sheets probably could not have squeezed Mac Mini components inside the classic iMac.\nUp close and still out of reach\nA few months after the Time Magazine article and the Macworld launch, an iMac G4 finally arrived at PC Magazine, where I worked in 2002. In person, it was even more impressive. Our first look lauded the new system's design, though we weren't thrilled with the \"insubstantial\" keyboard and one-button mouse. Still, the bundled software that included iMovie, iTunes, iDVD (the system could burn CDs and DVDs), and iPhoto stood out among PC offerings.\nMy romanticism of that design is a direct result of its brevity. Apple shifted away from the sunflower look within two years, replacing it with the iMac G5, which set the design language for all future iMacs.\nI, though, have reason to think of the iMac G4 every so often. On many of my weekly walks with my wife, we make our way through our small town, walking by all the business storefronts. Inside one, quite close to a window, is an iMac G4. I've never seen it turned on, but each time, I fantasize about marching into the business and asking the proprietor to sell it to me.\nMaybe someday. And then I guess I'll gut it and run macOS 26.\nYou might also like\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "macOS Tahoe 26 is official: here\u2019s everything we know about the release date, compatibility and all the new features\nA whole new look for macOS and a big change for Spotlight\nApple officially revealed macOS Tahoe 26 at WWDC 25 and as expected, we were treated to an all-new look for this latest version of the desktop operating system \u2013 and a lot more besides.\nBut what are the new features coming with macOS Tahoe? And when will the OS be out? Indeed, you may be wondering whether your model of Mac will be compatible with the next incarnation of Apple\u2019s OS. Read on to find out everything you need to know about macOS Tahoe 26.\nmacOS 26: release date\nApple typically deploys its new version of macOS in September or October, so we can likely expect macOS Tahoe 26 to roll out to Macs around that time.\nBefore that, we will see the release of a developer beta (which should be imminent), and later, a public beta, for testing macOS Tahoe as the year rolls onwards.\nRemember, though, that pre-release software is often a rollercoaster ride of glitches and potentially show-stopping bugs, so it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted. Most folks will want to wait for the full release of macOS Tahoe.\nmacOS 26: Compatibility\nWant to know if your Mac will be compatible with macOS Tahoe 26? Here\u2019s the full list of Macs that\u2019ll be able to run the operating system:\n- MacBook Air M1 or later\n- MacBook Pro M1 or later\n- MacBook Pro 16-inch 2019\n- MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 with four Thunderbolt 3 ports\n- iMac 2020 or later\n- Mac mini 2020 or later\n- Mac Pro 2019 or later\n- Mac Studio 2022 and later\nmacOS 26: New features\n1. An all-new look\nOne of the most insistent rumors was that Apple\u2019s desktop OS is getting a visual overhaul, and that is indeed the case: macOS Tahoe uses the \u2018Liquid Glass\u2019 design language. Get ready for translucency aplenty across the interface, a refined dock and toolbars, and a transparent menu bar which allows for the desktop to feel a bit larger.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple is offering more ways to customize the interface in macOS 26, too. You can tailor what controls are present in the menu bar and Control Center, tinker with the layout, and add controls for your favorite apps. A greater level of personalization is also being ushered in with moves such as allowing the user to change the color of folders, and add a symbol (or emoji) to those folders to make them more readily identifiable.\nIt looks to be a substantial makeover, and the emphasis on clean lines, greater levels of customization, and adding more personality with the likes of jazzing up folders all seems very promising.\n2. Under the Spotlight\nSpotlight is the system-wide search feature which hasn\u2019t got much love in recent times, but Apple is changing that with macOS 26. It\u2019s being powered up with AI so that it surfaces results that are ranked more intelligently, we\u2019re told, based on relevance to the user. Spotlight also pops up filtering options to allow you to swiftly whittle down search results, too.\nWith macOS Tahoe, it can be used to search within apps for features, and the more you use it, the more Spotlight acclimatizes to your workflow and typical usage patterns to make more relevant suggestions. Overall, this looks like a big step forwards for Spotlight.\n3. Continuity continued\nApple is bringing new Continuity features to macOS Tahoe, with the big move here being the introduction of the Phone app to the Mac. You\u2019ll be able to make or take calls, access voicemail, and benefit from the new features on iPhone as well, such as Call Screening or Hold Assist.\nTighter integration is also present with Live Activities from the Mac owner\u2019s iPhone popping up in the menu bar on macOS. Clicking a Live Activity will open the relevant app via iPhone Mirroring, and it all looks very neat and convenient.\n4. More AI (of course)\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Apple is adding more AI to macOS 26, as well as juicing up Spotlight which we\u2019ve already discussed.\nThe Shortcuts app is getting fresh AI abilities, and that incudes summarizing text using Writing Tools, and image generation via Image Playground. Furthermore, Mac users will be able to access Apple Intelligence models (on-device, or in the cloud) to use as part of their shortcuts. Shortcuts can also be cued up to run at a certain time of day, or when completing a specific action like connecting an external monitor.\nAI is also set to drive Live Translation in the Messages app, translating text into another language as you type it (and vice versa for replies). FaceTime will benefit from translated live captions, and calls in the Phone app can be translated, too.\nThere are some further minor trimmings here, including macOS 26 providing new ways to create Genmoji.\n5. Apple Games\nThere\u2019s a new dedicated app for gamers with macOS Tahoe, imaginatively named Apple Games. It acts as a hub for your Mac gaming activities, allowing you to jump back into titles you\u2019ve been recently playing.\nThere\u2019s a Game Overlay that allows you to quickly adjust settings (volume, brightness), chat with friends, send invites to them and so forth. A new Low Power Mode is present for MacBooks to give them better battery life when gaming, too.\nOn the developer side, Metal 4 arrives with macOS 26, ushering in new tech including MetalFX Frame Interpolation (for faster frame rates) and Denoising.\n6. Additional accessibility features\nApple has brought in new accessibility functionality with macOS Tahoe, including Magnifier for Mac. This leverages your iPhone (or a USB camera) to be able to zoom in to, say, a distant whiteboard, and present the writing on the board to the user on their Mac\u2019s screen \u2013 seriously nifty stuff for those who are vision-impaired.\nIn a similar vein, Accessibility Reader can take images of book pages and show them on the Mac display, allowing for zooming, or changing fonts or colors to make things clearer. There\u2019s also a new Braille Access experience providing an interface for those using a connected braille display, and Vehicle Motion Cues, a feature to help combat motion sickness when on, say, a long car journey.\nYou might also like...\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "We asked Apple about how to get the most of its Sports app for the iPhone, and how it updates so fast\nTechRadar chatted with Craig Mahonchak, Head of Product for Sports at Apple\nNo, it\u2019s not often that Apple releases entirely new apps for the iPhone, but in the nine months \u2013 nearly 10 \u2013 that the Sports app has been around, it\u2019s been a pretty much universal hit. It not only offers free access to real-time sports data for many of the major leagues, but generally, it\u2019s more up-to-date than a broadcast of the game.\nNot to mention, Apple has been updating and keeping the sports app fresh, taking advantage of live activities, making it easy to track various playoff runs and finales, and expanding the leagues.\nSo whether you\u2019re unboxing a shiny new iPhone this holiday season, have decided to download the Sports app, or just want to get more out of the app, TechRadar is here to help. We chatted with Craig Mahonchak, Head of Product for Sports at Apple, to discuss the latest enhancements and some tricks to get the most out of it.\nSports stats right on the iPhone's lock or home screen\nMahonchak quickly summed up the biggest evolution post-launch as Live Activities \u2013 \u201cTo have your favorites automatically show up on your lock screen without having to do anything, is just a game changer.\u201d This rollout was tied to the iOS 18 launch, which ensured a seamless and fluid rollout, allowing you to, somewhat like magic, just have your favorite teams appear on your lock screen when playing or on a newer iPhone with a Dynamic Island, right up at the top.\nIt\u2019s an easy, glanceable way to get the core information you might want from a specific game or team, without needing to unlock your iPhone and jump into the Sports app. Simply put, it\u2019s just on your lock screen and automatically updates. Now, if you\u2019re anything like some more vocal Sports app users, the data sometimes comes in a little to hot \u2026 or at least faster than the TV broadcast of the game, considering there\u2019s a delay.\nSo, if you don\u2019t want to be spoiled, a tip I discovered during the World Series \u2013 with the New York Yankees against the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 is that you can simply swipe the Live Activity away to dismiss it. And that goes for the home screen or at the top of your iPhone within the Dynamic Island.\nLive Activities was a feature that Mahonchak and the rest of the Sports team \u201cconceived early on,\u201d but he was quick to note there have been some more subtle features routinely added in simply over the air. Considering that much of the sports app is all about the data piece \u2013 think play-by-play, yards, and overall points \u2013 it makes sense that the focus has been on \u201cadding more team stats.\u201d\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been enhancing play-by-play and putting a drive tracker, and we want to bring that type of functionality to more leagues,\u201d continued Mahonchak. Red cards are more prominent with soccer play-by-play, and with baseball, l can quickly see who\u2019s on base and the pitch count \u2013 all additions that make it easier to follow a given game.\nBeing able to serve up all of this data within the interface stems from Apple\u2019s engineers and the data providers that are partners. \u201cIt is no small feat in terms of the partnerships from the data providers. You know, it would be great if there was one provider for everything,\u201d Mahonchak joked. \u201cThe lift around adding another league is really about going out and figuring out the partnerships and how we're going to source that data.\u201d\nHe explained that Apple is often looking at multiple sources to find the best, most reliable data, but that speed and how quickly it can be delivered is also key. \u201cWe\u2019ve nearly eliminated the latency from what we received from a provider to getting it down to your screen,\" said Mahonchak, which is how Apple Sports levels up the experience compared to competing apps.\nIt's also how, as mentioned above, the Sports app can sometimes be a little too quick, especially if you're watching the live broadcast. The good news is you can easily dismiss it, but if you're actually at the game, it will be more in line and can provide some guidance if you're trying to figure out an exact call.\nThat speed also extends to the app onboarding, which is all about selecting the teams in the leagues you care the most about and diving into the experience. The first step is to select your teams, and the Sports app does some of the heavy lifting by suggesting some if you\u2019ve favorited them in the TV or News apps. You can always go back and adjust these, but if you\u2019re just curious about any given team \u2013 maybe not a favorite \u2013 you can always utilize the search bar.\nIt\u2019s a sleek way to easily find any team and live play-by-play \u2013 if there\u2019s a game \u2013 or a standing within a given league. Plus, for tournaments within a league, you can tap on a given game to see the overall standings and past performance. These are all enhancements that arrived post-launch as well.\nEven neater, though, you can automatically have live activities appear for a given game and schedule them. And if multiple teams are playing at once, you can stack them on your lock screen, with them rotating in and out of a Dynamic Island.\nNow, since Live Activities are also supported on the Apple Watch \u2013 courtesy of watchOS 11 \u2013 these will be easily accessible from your wrist. So if the New York Jets \u2013 or whatever your favorite team \u2013 is playing while you're out to dinner, you don't need to be glued to your phone and can glance down when a key moment happens. Or if it's the Apple Watch Series 10, you can view it even more easily.\nApple has already made some leaps in the sports app\u2019s development, and with new additions \u2013 either in leagues or sports types \u2013 it\u2019s clear they\u2019re taking the time. The team is focused on delivering the best experience possible for the end user.\nSo if you\u2019re new to iPhone, the Sports app, or want to get more out of it, keep an eye out for little updates that just appear in terms of how a game\u2019s linear notes are presented and for future bigger ones, like additional leagues, as anything\u2019s possible here.\nYou might also like\n- \"If you\u2019re a sports fan, I think you're going to be very happy with it,\" Apple's Eddy Cue explains how the tech giant made its new Sports app\n- The Apple Vision Pro\u2019s Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display is something you have to see to believe\n- 'There\u2019s nothing like this in any land-based themed park that\u2019s out there' \u2013 a Disney Imagineer on how the Treasure cruise ship's Haunted Mansion Parlor came to be\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "macOS Tahoe 26 announced at WWDC 2025 with a new look and new numbering scheme: these are the best features for your new Mac or MacBook\nThe latest version macOS has just been announced at WWDC 2025\nApple has announced the latest version of macOS at WWDC 2025, its yearly developer conference.\nAccording to Apple, the new version of macOS Tahoe 26, the operating system used by MacBooks and Macs, is coming later this year, but before then an early beta version has been made available for developers to help ensure their apps work well with the new operating system. We show you how to download the macOS Tahoe 26 developer beta if you want to give it an early try.\nAfter that, Apple will launch a public beta that allows anyone with a compatible Mac to test out the operating system - though you should only do this with the understanding that this is an early version of the software and could lack features and could include bugs (after all, the reason for releasing a beta version is for people to help test out the software and highlight problems).\nAs usual, macOS Tahoe 26 will be a free update for everyone with a compatible Mac or MacBook, so for most people I recommend holding on tight for the official launch around October or November, as by that point most, if not all, of the bugs and issues found in the beta version will have been fixed.\nUntil then, read on for all the info we know about macOS Tahoe 26 so far, plus the new features we're most excited about.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? The latest operating system for Macs and MacBooks\n- How much is it? As usual, it's free for compatible Macs\n- When is it out? Developer Beta out now, public Beta out in July 2025, final release autumn 2025\nWhat Macs and MacBooks are compatible with macOS Tahoe 26?\nThese are the all the Mac and MacBook devices that will be able to run macOS Tahoe 26 according to Apple:\nMacBook Air M1 or later\nMacBook Pro 16-inch 2019 or later\nMacBook Pro 2020 or later\nMacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 with four Thunderbolt 3 ports\niMac 2020 or later\nMac mini 2020 or later\nMac Pro 2019 or later\nMac Studio 2022 and later\nA new look\nThe rumors were right - Apple has overhauled the look of macOS (as with its other operating systems), with a unified design language which means that macOS, iPadOS and iOS will look similar.\nKnown as 'Liquid Glass', this part of the user interface doesn't just look good, it reacts depending on the task you're performing.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Dock, sidebar and toolbars of macOS 26 Tahoe have been redesigned, with the menu bar now completely transparent. The idea behind this appears to be to make the user interface blend into the background, giving prominence to whatever you're working on on the screen.\nApp icons have also been given a new look to fit in the the Liquid Glass design, and these will also change depending on if you're using the light or dark macOS theme.\nApple is also expanding on the customization options of macOS 26 Tahoe, so it should be even easier to make the operating system suit your style.\nA new numbering convention\nAt WWDC, Apple announced the official name for the latest macOS: Tahoe. Once again, based on a landmark in Apple's native California.\nMore surprisingly (if you weren't keeping up with the rumors), Apple also confirmed that there will be a new numbering scheme for macOS and its other operating systems. Instead numbering according to version (the current version is macOS 15), it will now be based on year, so there will be no macOS 16, but macOS 26, as well as iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and more.\nThis is quite a change, but it shows how serious Apple is about making all of its operating systems feel like they are parts of the same ecosystem.\nSpotlight in the... spotlight...\nSpotlight has been a key part of macOS for ages, allowing you to find and open up applications that you've installed. At WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that macOS Tahoe 26 will feature the 'biggest update ever' to Spotlight, with all search results across apps, files, folders, messages and more are all listed together and 'ranked intelligently based on relevance to the user.'\nAdvanced filter controls should help you narrow down your results, and Spotlight will also be able to search for files stored on third-party cloud drives, such as Google Drive or OneDrive.\nYou'll also be able to perform actions straight from Spotlight - so you can send an email, play a media file and more without having to open the app first. These can also be used via keyboard shortcuts, and according to Apple, Spotlight will learn from how you use your Mac, and will offer you personalized actions for tasks you perform often. The example Apple gives is quickly sending a message to someone you regularly talk to.\nLive translation\nAs you might expect, Apple has put plenty of AI features into macOS Tahoe 26, and perhaps the most interesting (and useful) is Live Translation, which will automatically translate messages depending on the language of the person you're talking to (and their reply will be translated for you).\nDuring FaceTime calls, live captions will also be shown, and if you're old school and still use the Phone app, you can see a translation of what they are talking about - and all of this is done on-device so conversations remain private.\nMake calls from the Phone app direct from macOS Tahoe 26\nA running theme of WWDC 2025 seems to be making Apple's ecosystem of devices work better together, and with Continuity, the app that allows you to access your iPhone through your Mac, you can now use the Phone app to answer phone calls on your Mac, rather than having to pull out your iPhone out of your pocket.\nThe Phone app in macOS 26 is designed to be instantly familiar to iPhone users, and you'll be able to access recent calls, favorite contacts and your voicemails - plus handy features like Call Screening and Hold Assist.\nIf someone from an unknown phone number rings, Call Screening will answer the call and ask for information, letting you decide whether or not to answer the call.\nIf you are put on hold, Hold Assist will save your spot in line, so you can work on your Mac until your turn comes up. Handy!\nMac gaming gets better with Apple Games app\nGaming on a Mac is no longer the joke it used to be thanks to a steady stream of AAA games coming to macOS, and with macOS Tahoe 26, it looks like gaming could get even better.\nA new app, called Apple Games, will act as a launcher for all of your games, as well as highlight new games that suit your tastes. It's not clear if this app will only show games you've bought and installed from Apple's App Store, or if you'll be able to add games from other services, such as Steam. Hopefully it'll be the latter.\nA Game Overlay, familiar to PC gamers using Windows 11 and Steam, is also included with the Apple Games app, and will allow you to quickly change your settings and chat with friends without leaving the game.\nA new Low Power Mode should also make playing games on a MacBook less demanding of the battery, so you should be able to play unplugged for longer - though I hope it doesn't have too much of an impact on game performance.\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

      "text": "macOS Tahoe 26 finally brings Journal to Mac, and I might use it now\nFinally time for me and the Mac to catch up\nRevealed at WWDC 25, macOS Tahoe 26 (which still feels strange to say) is promising big things. For one, there\u2019s another visual refresh to match the Liquid Glass UI design of its OS siblings, transparent widgets and all.\nThen there\u2019s third-party Control Center actions support, a phone app, and, uh, Image Playground.\nOne feature above so many others stood out, though, and that\u2019s the arrival of the Journal app on Apple\u2019s oldest platform.\nDay One of Forever\nIf you\u2019d already assumed Journal was on macOS, then you\u2019re not alone, as I saw a few bemused reactions to the announcement.\nYou see, Journal began life in iOS 17, and somehow never made it off of the iPhone. While it certainly had its strengths, creating a digital diary required using a fiddly phone keyboard and accessing the photos and videos stored locally on the device.\nEver tried to attach a file from an event to a Journal entry while using an iPhone? It\u2019s not fun, and so my interest waned.\nSure, I could fork out for Day One (and it\u2019s a fantastic app), but I\u2019m not at the point in my journaling journey (try saying that five times fast) where I can reliably use it for any more than a few days of the month, which would render any monthly subscription less than ideal.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThankfully, macOS getting Journal means that it just got a lot easier to drag and drop to my heart\u2019s content. Pictures and videos of a gig I\u2019ve been to? Easy peasy. A PDF version of an event itinerary I want to look back on? Done, no more fiddly file management.\nThen there\u2019s that all-important physical keyboard, which means I\u2019m much more likely to actually jot down some notes about how I\u2019m feeling at the end of the day before I log off.\nA different option\nAt the time of writing, I\u2019ve been unsuccessfully trying to get my brain to jot things down in a Notion template I found online. And yet, when I look, it\u2019s full of half-hearted workout records and random text snippets that are hardly worth keeping.\nSadly, having my journal tied into Notion - an app I use to run my freelance business - means every time I hop in to take some time for myself, I end up finding something I need to work on. After all, time is money, right?\nJokes aside, it\u2019s clear I need some sort of delineation between my journaling app of choice and Notion, which is essentially a work tool for me (and somewhere to catalog Magic: The Gathering cards, because a guy needs a hobby).\nSo could Journal on Mac be that?\nBut that\u2019s not all!\nCompleting the home run for the Journal app on Apple platforms, it\u2019s coming to iPadOS, too.\nThat means I can scribble my recollections in with the Apple Pencil, making it an even easier way to record my day-to-day adventures (that might be overselling sitting at a desk and writing).\nIt also gave me a great idea to ask my six-year-old son to write a few words every week so I could see his handwriting evolve and improve over time\u2014something simply not possible on Apple\u2019s other platforms.\nWill you be giving Journal a go on macOS or iPadOS? Let us know in the comments below. I'm excited to restart my journaling process, and I'm hoping that Apple's signature Journal app will kick-start me into taking it more seriously this time around.\nYou may also like...\n- Forget the Switch 2 \u2013 this dual-screen handheld gaming PC brings back the glory days of the Nintendo DS, but with all your Steam games\n- Apple says it\u2019s not merging iPadOS and macOS \u2013 but I reckon it might soon have to change its tune\n- This restoration of the world\u2019s oldest photograph shows the difference between AI slop and ChatGPT expertise\nLloyd Coombes is a freelance tech and fitness writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "Apple just gave its brilliant iPhone Mirroring feature a handy upgrade in macOS Sequoia\nBut you\u2019ll need both iOS 18 and macOS 15\nWhen Apple revealed macOS Sequoia during its WWDC 2024 event in June, one of the most intriguing features was iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your iPhone right from your Mac as long as you\u2019re running macOS Sequoia and iOS 18. Now, Apple has updated the feature with a helpful addition that makes the whole process much more powerful.\nAs spotted by 9to5Mac, the latest public betas of Apple\u2019s macOS and iOS operating systems allow you to enter \u2018jiggle mode\u2019 when controlling your iPhone from your Mac. To do so, you just need to click and hold on your iPhone\u2019s Home Screen when using iPhone Mirroring \u2013 if done correctly, your app icons will start to jiggle slightly (hence the name).\nWhat\u2019s the point of all this? Well, jiggle mode is what lets you rearrange your app icons and widgets, something that wasn\u2019t previously available in iPhone Mirroring. As well as that, you can add a tint to your app icons, place new widgets, change widget sizes, switch between light and dark app icons, and more.\nBeing able to do all that on your Mac is a positive change for iPhone Mirroring. After all, iPhone Mirroring is designed to let you control your iPhone, not just view it. Without one of the key features for making your iOS Home Screen your own \u2013 whether that\u2019s coloring all your icons or dropping some important widgets into place \u2013 iPhone Mirroring would feel nerfed and restricted.\nInstead of having to get up and find your iPhone (which may not be close to hand) just to add a new button to your Control Center, you'll now be able to do it all from the comfort of your Mac\u2019s desk.\nA helpful step forward\nAdding this kind of functionality to iPhone Mirroring is a big step forward, as it reduces the times you need to switch back and forth between your devices. No one wants to keep picking up their iPhone because iPhone Mirroring on their Mac is lacking a feature, so this change should cut down the number of times you need to do that \u2013 and hints at more powerful functionality ahead.\nStill, there are a few ways of controlling and editing your iPhone that you still can\u2019t do on your Mac. You can\u2019t alter your iPhone\u2019s Lock Screen, nor can you access the Notification Center or Control Center. Hopefully those features will become available in a future beta update, although there are no signs of that so far.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIf you want to take the new iPhone Mirroring for a spin, it\u2019s available in the iOS 18.1 beta and macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta. Right now, it\u2019s unfortunately now available in the European Union.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "I've tested a lot of wake-up lights over the years, and most of them have the same problem: even their lowest illumination level is fairly bright, and they jar me awake the instant they start their sunrise cycle. Some have terrible canned bird noises as well, but mostly it's the sudden change in brightness that has me burying my groggy face in my pillow.\nThe Philips Hue Play Wall Washer is different, though, and after a week, I can say that it's changed my morning routine for good.\nThe Wall Washer is a new smart lamp, released earlier this year, and as the name suggests, it's designed to shine colored light onto a wall rather than into your room, creating a diffused, atmospheric effect. It's not advertised as a wake-up light, and as part of the Play series, it's made more with entertainment in mind. Similar to a Philips Hue Play Gradient Strip, it can be paired with an HDMI Box or the Philips Hue Play app to extend the colors from your TV screen, creating a more immersive experience.\nIt uses a technology called ColorCast, which is essentially a stack of three colored LEDs that overlap in such a way that they create a smooth gradient of color. The image at the top of this article is unedited \u2013 it really is that seamless.\nIt's the same system you'll find in the back of the Philips Hue Twilight, which is designed to sit beside your bed and has a front-facing light for reading, but if choosing between the two, I'd opt for the Wall Washer thanks to its versatility.\nCreating a wake-up automation in the mobile app is easy. Once I'd plugged in my Wall Washer and connected it to my Philips Hue Bridge (the hub that connects your Hue Lights devices to one another), I added it to my bedroom, gave it a descriptive name, tapped the 'Automations' button in the app, and selected 'Wake Up'.\nThere are two options here: you can choose white light that simply increases in brightness, or opt for a simulated sunrise that starts with dim red light, shifts to orange, and eventually finishes white. I wanted an effect similar to the sun shining through the canvas on a camping trip, so I chose the latter, set it to finish its cycle at 7am, and named it 'Rise and Shine'.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nCreating this automation is no harder than setting an alarm on your phone, and after a week, I can say that it's a much gentler way to wake. Now I come round gradually, with no shock of noise-induced adrenaline.\nI still keep a backup alarm set with some nature noises in case I manage to sleep through the light, but so far that's not happened (touch wood).\nThe Wall Washer doesn't just wake you gently either; it can also help you drift off at night by playing its sunrise effect in reverse, with warm light that gently fades to darkness over a duration of your choice.\nAgain, this is done via an automation in the Philips Hue app. This time, though, I didn't want to set a timer. Although experts recommend keeping a set bedtime every night (even on the weekends), sometimes life gets in the way. There could be a deadline, I might be having drinks with friends, or I might need to spend half an hour on Duolingo to avoid being demoted. You know, important things.\nLuckily, I happened to have a Philips Hue Dimmer Switch on hand, which is perfect for the job. It has programmable buttons, so I could set one to trigger the simulated sunset, and its self-adhesive mount was perfect for sticking to the side of my nightstand. If my husband wants to use it, he can simply remove the magnetic switch from its mount and use it as a remote.\nYou could do exactly the same thing with a Philips Hue Smart Button, but the advantage of the Dimmer Switch is that it can also turn the light on and off, or (as the name suggests) adjust its brightness.\nI added the switch to my bedroom in the app, then gave it a name, and assigned the Sleep automation to its bottom button. Now, when I'm ready to wind down, I can trigger the light sequence with a single tap.\nThe video below shows the final few seconds of the sleep automation, and as you can see, the change in brightness is incredibly smooth. I'd set the light to dim over the course of five minutes, which is the shortest possible period. If you choose a longer timeframe, the light will dim even more gradually.\nI sometimes have trouble dropping off at night (likely a consequence of testing the best coffee makers too close to bedtime), but the sleep automation on the Wall Washer is like magic. Its dim, reddish light lulls me to sleep like nothing else, somehow helping me relax and silencing the caffeine-induced chatter.\nIt's incredibly soothing, and after a week, I can't imagine dozing off without it. If I ever did change my mind, though, it's good to know that the Wall Washer could find a new home beside my TV, serving as an Ambilight alternative. It's the most versatile Philips Hue lamp yet, and well worth investigating if you're looking to expand your smart lighting setup.\nYou might also like\n- Smart lights 101: everything you need to know to level up your lighting\n- If Philips Hue is too expensive, the HDMI Sync Box and TV Backlight set from WiZ is a cheap and effective alternative\n- \u2018What you can do now is quite amazing\u2019: the company behind Philips Hue reveals how to get the most from your smart lights\nCat is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in kitchen appliances and smart home technology.

      "text": "I've already been using macOS Tahoe 26 for a month \u2013 here are 4 features that make it worth the upgrade\nThe public beta is out, but proceed with caution\nYou may have spotted that the public beta version of macOS Tahoe 26 is now available to install on compatible Macs, with the finished version out later this year. If you're wondering what all the fuss is about, I can tell you: I've been using the developer betas since they were first launched in June.\nThere are a lot of new features to dive into and explore, both in terms of the operating system overall and the individual Apple apps running on top of it. There's also a complete visual overhaul of the interface, making use of the same Liquid Glass theme being introduced on all of Apple's software platforms, including iOS 26.\nYou can either try the public beta now to get the new features ahead of everyone else, or wait for the full release. If you do jump in early, note that you do so at your own risk: beta software can be buggy and cause issues with third-party apps, so we wouldn't recommend it for a Mac you rely on using every day.\nSpotlight gets a huge upgrade\nSpotlight has always been a useful way of launching apps and searching through the files on a Mac, but with macOS Tahoe 26, it gets what is probably the biggest upgrade in its history. There are now four sections to jump between via icons or keyboard shortcuts, covering apps, files, shortcuts, and the macOS clipboard.\nThose first two options work in a similar way to how they have done previously, though there are more comprehensive browsing options (you're able to see apps sorted by category or name, for example). It's also really helpful to have access to the clipboard history, so you can quickly bring back something you copied recently \u2013 it means I've been using Spotlight much more regularly.\nThe really significant upgrade comes with shortcuts, though. Not only can you launch any existing shortcut, you're able to create new ones from right inside Spotlight, and even assign keyboard combinations to them: send messages, start timers, open playlists, and more. On top of that, there's added Apple Intelligence, so you can make calls to various AI features from within Spotlight too.\nLiquid Glass looks superb\nBy now, you've probably seen plenty of Liquid Glass screenshots, so you have an idea of the visual changes Apple is rolling out across its various software platforms, including macOS Tahoe 26. However, it's not until you actually start using these operating systems that you realize what a step forward it is in terms of aesthetics.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI'll admit it took some getting used to, but I'm now very much a fan of Liquid Glass on macOS. With the various demands of tech journalism to keep up with, I've been switching between different versions of Apple's desktop software, and going back to macOS Sequoia 15 feels like entering an old-fashioned, outdated world.\nEverything looks clean and fresh, and the translucent effects are really well done, without being overbearing or affecting legibility \u2013 the Control Center is one of the key panels that looks more modern, for example. You get more in the way of curves and smoothness too, and I think most people are going to be on board with the changes.\nLive Activities keep you updated\nLive Activities has become a pretty essential feature on the iPhone, keeping you right up to date with real-time information, and it's proved so useful that it's making its way to the Mac as well. Live Activities will now be mirrored at the top of your macOS screen, once they pop up on iOS.\nYou may already be familiar with the convenience of Live Activities for apps that track flights, deliveries, and sports scores. Having these updates available on macOS is a real bonus. It's one of those features where you don't really realize how useful it is until you actually get it.\nThe upgrade builds on the impressive syncing between iOS and macOS that's already in place, including iPhone Mirroring. You're even able to click on a Live Activities widget on your Mac and open up the relevant iPhone app on your macOS desktop, through the mirroring link between your computer and your phone.\nMacs get even more gaming upgrades\nApple has been trying to convince us that it's serious about gaming on the Mac for many years of course, but there's evidence that this time we can believe it. The new macOS update features a new Metal 4 graphics rendering engine, adding in denoising tech and frame interpolation (similar to the equivalent Nvidia offering on Windows).\nNow admittedly I haven't tested this out extensively \u2013 but at the beta stage of proceedings, these improvements aren't likely to be fully operational, especially considering that some tweaks will be needed on the developer side too. This is going to be well worth checking back in on as macos Tahoe 26 rolls out and gets refined.\nThere's also the new Games app, a central hub for launching games, checking your scores and gaming chats, and discovering new titles. It's all neatly done, and looks to be another significant improvement for gamers \u2013 with the potential to get a few more users gaming on the Mac. The same hub is going to appear for iPhones and iPads at the same time too.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.
