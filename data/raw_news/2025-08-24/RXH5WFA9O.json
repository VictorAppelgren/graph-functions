  "title": "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures slide after record surge with Nvidia earnings in focus",
  "description": "Wall Street is in a holding pattern ahead of a mammoth earnings week following the Dow's 800-point surge.",
  "content": "US stock futures ticked down after Wall Street\u2019s powerful rally to close out last week with eyes all on Nvidia (NVDA) earnings for the week ahead.\n\nFutures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&P 500 (ES=F), and the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slipped 0.2%.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) surged over 800 points, or 1.8%, to 45,631.74, to its first record of 2025. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 1.5%, finishing just shy of a fresh all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped 1.9% as investors cheered signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that rate cuts could start as early as September.\n\nWith earnings season continuing to roll on, Nvidia, the most valuable stock in the S&P 500, reports results after the closing bell Wednesday. Analysts see the chipmaker posting earnings of $1.01 per share on $46.13 billion in revenue. Price targets have been climbing in the lead-up, reflecting optimism that demand for AI hardware remains high.\n\nNvidia stock has already had a monster run: Shares are sitting near a record high, up 32% year to date while nearly doubling since April\u2019s market low. Wednesday\u2019s report acts as a litmus test for Nvidia as well as the broader market, as investors eyed a potential rotation out of tech before the end-of-week rally. Meanwhile, Dell (DELL) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) report Thursday.\n\nLooking ahead, the spotlight turns to Friday\u2019s July PCE inflation report, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Economists expect core PCE to rise 2.9% year over year, slightly higher than June\u2019s 2.8%.",

      "text": "Palantir (PLTR) stock fell more than 9.3% on Tuesday to mark a fifth straight losing session for shares as investors continue to rotate away from some of the hottest tech names that have powered stocks to all-time highs in 2025.\nPalantir stock rose more than 150% from its April low through its second quarter earnings report, which saw the company's revenue top $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time. Data from market data provider Barchart showed Tuesday's slide marked Palantir's longest losing streak since March.\nPalantir was also under pressure after a bearish report by short seller Citron Research published Monday predicted a price target of $40. The firm's founder, Andrew Left, called the target \"generous.\"\nCitron said it derived its price target by comparing Palantir to OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) recent $500 billion valuation as the ChatGPT giant looks to sell several billion dollars of stock.\nPalantir is not alone in seeing some investors move away from the stock in recent days.\nThe Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which tracks technology stocks, fell more than 1.7% in Tuesday's trading session. AI superstar Nvidia (NVDA) ended the day down 3.5%, and its chip rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) stock fell more than 5%. Meta (META) \u2014 which has thrown huge sums of capital expenditures into AI talent retention \u2014 saw shares down more than 2%.\nThe tech sector as a whole has lost more than 2.4% over the past five sessions.\nThe pressure on AI names comes at a moment when the broader market rally is starting to show signs of rotation beyond Big Tech.\nAfter months of concentration in a handful of growth giants, sectors like Health Care (XLV) and Homebuilders (XHB), along with small- and midcap stocks, have taken on a larger role in driving this summer's move to record highs. The sectors are up more than 4% and more than 3%, respectively, over the last five days.\nOn Tuesday, leadership was concentrated in more defensive corners of the market, with Real Estate (XLRE), Utilities (XLU), Materials (XLB), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care among the biggest gainers.\nBut given Big Tech's outsized weighting in the index, if the group isn't leading, gains in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) are unlikely to be as sharp or one-sided as they've been over the past two years \u2014 a dynamic on display in Tuesday's trading as the S&P 500 ended the session down more than 0.5%.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also took on heavy losses, falling nearly 1.5% by the closing bell."

      "text": "The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases accelerated in June as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target.\nThe \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month, in line with the 0.3% economists had expected and above the 0.2% increase seen in May.\nOn an annual basis, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% economists had expected and in line with May's reading. May's 2.8% reading was revised higher from an initially reported 2.7% increase.\n\"The above-target rise in core PCE prices in June, upward revisions to previous months\u2019 data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed\u2019s concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Capital Economics assistant economist Harry Chambers wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\nThe release comes just one day after the Fed opted to hold interest rates steady at its July meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that it's still the \"early days\" of any tariff impact on inflation and that there is still \"a long way to go\" before the full effects will be clear.\n\"Tariffs are beginning to make their mark on the inflation data,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients. \"While services inflation remains subdued, helped by slowing housing inflation, core goods prices are up sharply in recent months. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell argued on Wednesday, the Fed will not cut rates until it is confident that a temporary rise in goods prices isn't bleeding through into broader inflation and inflation expectations.\"\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nFollowing the release, markets were pricing in a 61% chance the Fed holds rates steady again at its September meeting, up from just a 40% chance seen a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nElsewhere in the release, data showed mixed signs of slowing economic activity. Real personal spending, which adjusts for inflation, rose 0.1%, in line with estimates. Real personal spending had decreased 0.2% in May. Meanwhile, personal income rose 0.3% after falling 0.4% the month prior.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Indeed, it has endured the Iran-Israeli war; the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear sites; the Fed's FOMC meeting; White House progress on individual-nation tariffs; and Congressional action on The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. So yes, there are plenty of reasons to think stocks shouldn't keep heading north - and yet they do. But take all of the above and boil it down to one thought: the higher stocks go, the greater the likelihood that they will eventually correct (to some degree). That simple logic, we think, is driving current sentiment from corporate insiders -- sentiment that has been cautious for several weeks, but now has taken a big bearish jump. On a scale where any reading above 6.00 is bearish, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers Stock Research is currently 10.10. The same ratio for the Nasdaq is 6.98, and the Total (all exchanges) One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 8.01. Time will tell if this worrisome sentiment has legs -- but it is well worth acknowledging, especially as it comes just ahead of earnings season. Insider buying activity outpaced insider selling in two sectors over the past week, namely Healthcare and Real Estate. Within Healthcare, insiders purchased shares valued at $44 million versus $19 million sold. In Real Estate, insiders bought shares valued at $3 million, while selling just $139,346. Buying activity was also notable in Financials, as the level of buying activity trailed the level of selling by a factor of only 1.3-times. Conversely, selling far outpaced buying in Information Technology, with shares valued at $31 million sold versus just $15,395 bought. Selling was also notable in Industrials. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at GRAIL Inc. (NGS: GRAL) and Micron Technology Inc. (NGS: MU).\nMarvell: New Design Wins and Higher Targets Align With Our Long-Term Custom Chip Optimism\nMarvell Technology is a fabless chip designer focused on wired networking, where it has the second-highest market share.

This week, the focus flips back to the labor market as the May jobs report is due out on Friday. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, the Nasdaq popped 1.9%, and the S&P 500 rose 2.0%. So far this year, the Dow and the Nasdaq are down 1%, while the S&P has gained 0.5%. Earnings season is near an end, but a few big names do report this week. The list of includes on Campbell's on Monday; CrowdStrike and Dollar General on Tuesday; MongoDB and Dollar Tree on Wednesday; Broadcom, Cracker Barrel, and Lululemon on Thursday. Some 98% of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and earnings for 1Q are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the pre-reporting consensus that called for EPS growth of 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare was the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy was at the bottom, down 17%. On the economic calendar, Job Openings and Factory Orders are reported on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the ADP Private Payrolls report is due. On Thursday, the U.S. Trade Deficit will be updated, and on Friday, the May employment report will be released. In addition, many Federal Reserve officials speak this week, including Chairman Powell, who speaks Monday afternoon at the Fed's International Finance Division's conference in Washington, DC. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for another healthy employment report on Friday. We expect to see that Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 140,000 and the Unemployment Rate remained at 4.2%. The consensus is 130,000 for payrolls and 4.2% for unemployment. Despite a solid forecast for May and a baseline forecast for U.S. economic growth to slow from 2024 (but avoid recession), Chris is dusting off his spreadsheet for the Sahm Rule recession indicator. Layoff announcements have been increasing, according to the Challenger Report, and the pace of hiring has slowed, according to the JOLTS report. The Sahm indicator rang a false alarm last year. We have never used it as a standalone recession indicator, but it is still one of the employment-driven business cycle indicators we follow. The rule states that when the three-month moving average of the Unemployment Rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more above its low over the prior 12 months, the U.S. economy is in the early months of recession. If the Unemployment Rate for May comes in at 4.2%, as we expect, the Sahm indicator would be 0.27 by our calculation, which is well below the warning level of 0.5. What would it take to spark a recession warning? If the Unemployment Rate rose by 0.10 a month starting in June, our model shows that we would get a warning sign of 0.53 in October. This is an analytical scenario, not a forecast. If the Unemployment rate rose by 0.10 a month through August and then rose 0.20 to 4.7% in September, our calculations show that the indicator would be at 0.47, just below the threshold. In that scenario, our numbers show that the indicator would give a recession warning in October. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 3.8% for 2Q and follows a decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% CPI rate for May. Mortgage rates inched higher again last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.89%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down a penny to an average of $3.16 per gallon for regular gas. The next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 5% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the Fed next meets on July 30, with odds for a rate cut at 27%.\nDell Earnings: $12.1 Billion Surge in AI Server Orders; Raising Fair Value to $125 From $121\nDell Technologies is a broad information technology vendor, primarily supplying hardware to enterprises.

      "text": "By Sam Li and Florence Tan\n(Reuters) -Oil prices edged higher on Monday after Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russia, fanning concerns Russian oil supply could be disrupted, while expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates buoyed the outlook for global growth and fuel demand.\nBrent crude futures rose 3 cents, or 0.04%, to $67.76 at 0342 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 7 cents, or 0.11%, to $63.73.\nUkraine launched a drone attack on Russia on Sunday, which forced a sharp fall in the capacity of a reactor at one of Russia's biggest nuclear power plants and sparked a huge blaze at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal, Russian officials said.\nIn addition, a fire at Russia's Novoshakhtinsk refinery, caused by a Ukrainian drone attack, was burning for the fourth day on Sunday, the acting governor of the region said.\nThe refinery sells fuel mainly for export and has an annual capacity of 5 million metric tons of oil, or around 100,000 barrels per day.\n\"Given the success that Ukraine is having with its targeting of Russian oil infrastructure ... the risks for crude oil are shifting to the topside,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.\nMeanwhile, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Russia has made \"significant concessions\" toward a negotiated settlement in its war with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\"They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And, importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" Vance said on NBC's \"Meet the Press with Kristen Welker\" program.\nHowever, U.S. President Donald Trump also renewed threats on Friday that he would impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks.\nInvestors' risk appetite has improved after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday signaled a possible interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's meeting next month.\n\"A risk-on tone across markets boosted investor appetite across the commodities complex, aided by renewed supply side issues across energy and metals,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.\n(Reporting by Sam Li in Beijing and Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Sonali Paul and Christopher Cushing)"

      "text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings day may boil down to one key question: Will China be part of its outlook?\n\"If NVDA were to include China in its guidance, we believe it would contribute an incremental $2-3 billion in revenue,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh wrote in a new note.\nVinh expects strong Q2 results, driven by demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, when the chipmaker reports on Wednesday. But he warned that guidance for Q3 could be conservative, given uncertainty around US export licenses to China.\nStill, KeyBanc reiterated its Overweight rating and lifted its price target to $215 from $190, pointing to Nvidia's central role in the AI boom and supply-demand dynamics that remain firmly in its favor.\nNvidia's near-term growth story looks solid without China. Supply of Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU jumped 40% in Q2 and could rise another 20% in Q3, according to Vinh. Simultaneously, shipments of the more advanced Blackwell Ultra (B300) are ramping up, reinforcing Nvidia's dominance in AI chips.\nKeyBanc raised its full-year shipment forecast for Nvidia's rack-sale AI systems, known as GB200. The firm now expects 30,000 units to ship this year, up from 25,000 previously, citing stronger yields and improved supply-chain execution.\nFor now, KeyBanc assumes Nvidia will exclude China revenue from its guidance. That mirrors the approach of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which earlier this month left China out of its outlook amid the same regulatory uncertainty.\nThe Chinese impact on Nvidia is significant. KeyBanc raised its Q2 revenue estimate to $47.1 billion from $45.1 billion, above Wall Street\u2019s consensus of $45.7 billion. It raised earnings per share to $1.05 from $0.99, slightly above consensus of $1.00.\nBut with Nvidia agreeing to pay 15% of Chinese chip sales to the US government, plus China's push for domestic AI chips, the company is likely to adopt a more conservative stance on its financial forecast.\nFor Q3, KeyBanc cut its revenue estimates to $50.4 billion from $53.5 billion, versus a consensus of $52.6 billion. EPS was clipped to $1.14 from $1.22, below the Street's consensus of $1.19. Longer term, KeyBanc trimmed fiscal 2026 forecasts on China risks, but boosted 2027 expectations on stronger rack shipments due to accelerating spending by hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG).\nWall Street remains bullish. Morgan Stanley recently called Nvidia the most undervalued megacap stock in the market. Its shares are up more than 30% year to date and over 35% in the past 12 months."

      "text": "US stocks soared on Friday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a September rate cut during his highly anticipated speech at Jackson Hole.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 800 points or 1.9% to close at a fresh record, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up about 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 1.9%. Friday's surge came on the heels of a downbeat week for markets, as tech stocks took a hit amid AI trade doubts.\nFed Chair Powell raised the prospect of the central bank lowering interest rates in September on Friday, saying in his speech that \"the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"\nWith the speech touching on both the country's economic outlook and the Fed's new policy framework, Powell noted that risks from inflation remain \"tilted to the upside,\" saying that tariff-related inflation pressures \"are now clearly visible.\"\nHis remarks shook up rate-cut bets, which had been waning after a weak monthly jobs report. Traders on Friday were pricing in about 91.5% odds of a September cut compared to 70% earlier in the morning and 85% a week ago.\nMeanwhile, the 10-year (^TNX) and 30-year (^TYX) Treasury yields fell after Powell's remarks. The commentary also spurred a gain in bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies, with ethereum (ETH-USD) leading the crypto gains.\nThe White House watched Powell's speech closely, as President Trump has continued to push the Fed and Powell to lower rates. Trump opened a new front in his public pressure campaign on central bank independence by calling for the resignation of Fed governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. On Friday, Trump said he'll \"fire\" Cook if she doesn't resign, though legally, presidents cannot easily dismiss Fed governors.\nOn the earnings front, Zoom (ZM) stock popped Friday after reporting an AI boost, and Ross Stores (ROST) jumped as shoppers sought discounts amid tariffs. Intuit (INTU) and Workday (WDAY), meanwhile, slid.\nShares of Intel (INTC) jumped 5% after President Trump said the government will take a 10% stake in the ailing chip giant, calling it a \"great deal.\"\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER26 updates\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nDow notches new record, S&P 500, Nasdaq jump as Fed's Powell signals September rate cut on the table\nStocks jumped with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rising more than 800 points, or 1.9%, to close at a new all-time high record.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rallied 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also jumped 1.9%. The Dow and S&P 500 closed out the week with gains after a volatile week following a rotation away from tech stocks and into defensive sectors in anticipation of Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday.\nPowell signaled that policy members were open to a September rate cut after disappointing recent labor data, despite signs of inflation due to ongoing tariff policy.\nInes Ferr\u00e9\nTrump says US enforcement of TikTok divestment law may 'extend a little bit longer'\nApple, Google stocks climb on report the iPhone maker may use Gemini AI for Siri\nApple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG) stocks climbed to session highs midday Friday after Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple is considering using Google's Gemini to power a revamped version of the Siri voice assistant.\nIntel jumps as Trump says US will take 10% stake in Intel\nPresident Trump said his administration will take a 10% stake in ailing chip giant Intel (INTC) on Friday, calling it a \"great deal.\"\nIntel's stock price rose more than 5% in midday trading.\nOn Tuesday Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the administration was exploring converting Intel's funding from the Biden-era CHIPS Act into equity aimed at stabilizing the company's US manufacturing business.\nIntel is dealing with multiple issues across its businesses.

For fiscal 2025, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $4.20 to $4.35 instead of the $4.10 to $4.30 previously forecast.\nTrump says he'll fire Fed governor Lisa Cook if she doesn't resign\nJust as Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole fueled market optimism \u2014 following months of social media skewering from President Trump \u2014 Trump dialed up pressure on another member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors.\nEthereum leads crypto gains following Powell speech\nEthereum led an upswing in cryptocurrencies as rate cut bets soared after Jerome Powell's policy speech in Jackson Hole opening the door to rate cuts in September.\nEthereum (ETH-USD) jumped 8.6%, while Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose a modest 2.7%.

Crypto exchange platform Coinbase (COIN) soared 6.6%, and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) shot up 9.6%.\nThe gains helped pare or reverse losses in those stocks as tech stocks have been beaten down this week by doubts over the sustainability of the AI trade.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 1.4% to near last week's record high for the index of 6,449.80.

Traders are pricing in about 91.5% odds of a cut late Friday morning compared to 70% earlier in the day and 85% a week ago.\nLaura Bratton\nPowell opens door to September rate cut, says economic outlook 'may warrant' change in Fed's stance\nYahoo Finance's Myles Udland and Jennifer Schonberger report:\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell began speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday, where he is delivering what is expected to be his final speech at the annual gathering of central bankers, policymakers, and economists.\nInvestors will examine Powell's remarks for clues about the state of the economy and the potential for interest rate cuts next month. The central bank is grappling with whether to hold interest rates steady in September to counter inflation or lower rates in light of weaker labor market data.\nAdditionally, Powell is expected to describe changes to the central bank\u2019s policy framework. The Fed is expected to drop its average inflation targeting policy, which sets an inflation rate goal for the Fed to achieve over the long run.

The stock was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance on Friday morning.\nThe SUV is one of Nio's most affordable yet, with prices starting at 308,800 yuan (approximately $43,000) with a battery subscription plan. The plan allows customers to pay lower upfront costs for the vehicle and then upgrade batteries for a monthly fee.\nDeliveries are scheduled to begin in late September.\nGrace O'Donnell\nUS sectors in spotlight ahead of Fed's Jackson Hole gathering\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., today is expected to provide investors with a signal on whether an interest rate cut is coming next month, which could have wide-ranging implications for many parts of the economy.\nReuters broke down how some of the most rate-sensitive stocks have fared since the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting cycle in September 2024:\nIntuit Inc. (INTU) stock fell 6% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates on Thursday.\nWorkday's (WDAY) stock dropped on Friday before the bell after the software company raised its full-year subscription revenue forecast on Thursday, but a forecast in line with expectations for the current quarter pushed the human resources software provider\u2019s shares down.\nAMD (AMD) shares fell 1% in premarket trading following the news that Nvidia (NVDA) has told partners to halt work on H20 chip for China.\nGrace O'Donnell\nZoom stock jumps as Enterprise revenue accelerates\nShares of Zoom (ZM) jumped 5% in premarket trading on Friday after the communications software provider posted earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year outlook.\nZoom CEO Eric Yuan highlighted artificial intelligence as a driver of its strong quarter, with its AI agents underpinning profit growth.\nThe company posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\nDespite Friday's gain, the stock is still down 10% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 8% gain."

      "text": "'Powell clearly opens the door': Markets surge as speculative bets get another boost from dovish Jay Powell\nUS stocks ripped higher Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a September rate cut during his speech at Jackson Hole \u2014 a dovish turn that lit a fire under speculative trades from meme stocks to crypto.\n\"The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.\n\"Powell clearly opens the door for a September cut,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note. \"When Fed chairs open the door for a rate cut, it\u2019s quite difficult to close.\"\nThat expectation helped ignite a broad risk-on rally, with some of the market\u2019s most volatile corners leading the charge.\nOpendoor (OPEN), a debated Wall Street meme stock, surged nearly 40% as investors piled into housing-related names on expectations that lower borrowing costs could revive demand.\nCrypto and crypto-linked equities also roared back. Ethereum (ETH-USD) spiked 14% as of Friday afternoon, outpacing a 4% gain in bitcoin (BTC-USD). Solana (SOL-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) each rose around 10% and 7%, respectively.\nThat enthusiasm spilled into crypto-adjacent names as well: Coinbase (COIN) climbed over 6%, Robinhood (HOOD) added about 3%, and Strategy (MSTR) gained 6%.\nThe moves marked a sharp rebound after a bruising stretch for speculative assets, particularly as doubts mounted over the sustainability of the AI-fueled tech rally.\n\"Equity markets reacted very positively,\" Scott Chronert, managing director of US equity strategy at Citi, wrote in a Friday note, highlighting the Russell 2000 (^RUT), a benchmark for small-cap stocks, had the most \"striking surge\" as investors shifted money into more economically sensitive names.\nThat broadening story, which captured Wall Street\u2019s attention this week, was also evident with the equal-weighted S&P 500, which gives smaller companies the same influence as megacap tech, slightly leading the headline index.\nThat signals the rally is beginning to expand beyond the largest technology stocks that have dominated gains over the past two years.\nStill, Chronert noted Friday, \"there is some 'junkiness' to this initial reaction. Speculative/non-earners in growth sectors outperformed.\" Speculative growth names, particularly unprofitable tech companies, have surged since the April market bottom.\nGoldman Sachs' Non-Profitable Tech Index, which tracks US-listed tech firms that have yet to generate positive GAAP earnings, jumped about 4% on Friday, extending its recent rebound. The index has climbed more than 65% off its spring lows and now sits just shy of recent highs."
