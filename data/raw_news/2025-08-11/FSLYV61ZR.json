  "description": "Several rivers remain flooded in the Milwaukee area after heavy rain battered Wisconsin over the weekend.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNearly 200,000 people on Monday remained under flood warnings in the aftermath of torrential rainfall that dropped more than a foot on Milwaukee and its environs, prompting officials to issue a state of emergency over the weekend and caution motorists against traveling.\n\nThe heavy rains in Wisconsin come as meteorologists have warned that climate change has contributed to the prevalence of 100-year and 1,000-year floods across the U.S. in recent years. As the atmosphere warms, it gains the ability to hold more moisture, which in turn can fuel heavy rains when storms roll into the area.\n\nThe floods in Wisconsin caused officials to cancel the last day of the Wisconsin State Fair. On Sunday, Milwaukee County declared a state of emergency and cautioned residents against driving or walking through flooded areas.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, numerous rivers were still flooding, according to warnings issued across the Badger State by National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologists.\n\nThese include the following rivers:\n\nNone of the rivers had reached major flood levels, though the Fox River Lower at Waukesha was experiencing moderate flooding. The others saw minor issues.\n\nFlooding is the second deadliest weather hazard in the U.S. behind extreme heat. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles, prompting NWS officials to urge people against driving through flooded roadways.\n\n\"Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\n\n deaths occur in vehicles,\" NWS Milwaukee said in one flood warning. \"Caution is urged when walking near riverbanks. Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive cars through flooded areas.\"\n\nMost of the rain has stopped, but NWS meteorologist JJ Wood told Newsweek there is a 40 percent to 50 percent chance for showers and storms overnight Monday, and a 30 percent to 40 percent chance of additional rain Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Any storms that do move through the area, we are expecting them to move through at a fairly decent rate,\" he said. \"We are not expecting big, flash flooding impacts like we've seen over the weekend.\"\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley, in a news release: \"Flooding is still an active emergency situation across Milwaukee County, and we are expecting more rain today and into this evening. Our top priority is the life and safety of Milwaukee County residents. I strongly urge our residents to stay cautious, stay informed, and refrain from traveling. Check in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful to our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.\"\n\nNWS Milwaukee, in a flood warning: \"Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding.\"\n\nSome of the flood warnings are set to expire by early Wednesday afternoon, whereas others will remain in place until further notice, as it can take time for flooded river levels to recede. Wood said it will be dry for the next several days after Tuesday, which carries the chance of rain.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe term \"100-year flood\" implies that the event is a rare occurrence; however, dozens of such storms have inundated the United States over the past year alone, prompting concern that they are occurring more frequently as the Earth's climate continues to warm.\nWhy It Matters\nFlooding is the second-deadliest weather hazard in the U.S., next to extreme heat. Devastating flood events have made headlines numerous times this year, including a 1,000-year atmospheric river event that hit the Midwest and South in April and the deadly floods that inundated Central Texas over the July 4th weekend.\nThe frequency of such flooding rainstorms, which often go hand-in-hand with death and destruction, is alarming. What's even more concerning is that AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva told Newsweek that these events are happening more frequently.\nWhat To Know\nIn 2024, dozens of 100-year rainstorms struck the U.S. Each point is marked on the map below, created by Colorado State University. The points marking each event are widespread, with only a few states escaping unscathed.\nLast year wasn't a one-time occurrence, either. This year is also \"shaping up to be one of the most flood-impacted summers on record in the United States,\" AccuWeather reported.\nWhat Is a 100-Year Flood?\nThe United States Geological Service (USGS) describes the term \"100-year flood\" as an attempt \"to simplify the definition of a flood that statistically has a 1-percent chance of occurring in any given year.\"\nWhere Did 100-Year Rainstorms Hit in 2024?\nOn the CSU map, countless points pepper the Eastern Seaboard around North Carolina and South Carolina after Hurricane Helene struck in September. Others show the devastating impact of the summer monsoon season in New Mexico, which caused deserts to flood and cars to become stranded as water washed over a highway. Vermont faced catastrophic floods in late July.\nCentral Texas, known as Flash Flood Alley, experienced several 100-year rainstorms last year, as did Florida, with a scattershot of points dated as occurring during the Atlantic hurricane season.\nThere was also an onslaught of precipitation that hit South Dakota in June 2024, as well as a similar storm that measured as a 100-year event at several locations in Missouri in November, among others.\nOnly a few states emerged unscathed, including Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, and Massachusetts, but most of the U.S. experienced some form of severe flooding precipitation last year.\nWhy Are 100-Year Floods Occurring More Frequently?\nThe map's creator, Russ Schumacher, a professor of atmospheric sciences at CSU and a CSU climatologist, told Newsweek that improved technology, such as radar, provides better access to data, which can make it seem as if the flood events are happening more frequently. However, he also stressed the impact of climate change.\n\"The physics of climate change tells us that we should see these extreme events more frequently,\" he said.\nAs the atmosphere grows warmer through global warming, its ability to hold moisture increases, DaSilva told Newsweek.\n\"This is why in the wintertime, we typically don't see too much flash flooding in the wintertime,\" DaSilva said. \"It's too cold, and there's snow, of course, but it's hard to get the moisture content you need for heavy rain events in the wintertime because it's cooler out. In the summertime obviously the temperature is above freezing, but the atmosphere can hold more water content. There's more moisture to squeeze out.\"\nWhich States Have Increased Flood Risk?\nAs the atmosphere's ability to hold moisture increases, DaSilva told Newsweek that states in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys are becoming wetter, while areas like California are becoming drier.\nWhat People Are Saying\nAccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva told Newsweek: \"When the atmosphere is getting warmer as a whole...essentially what it's doing is making summer warmer and the shoulder seasons warmer as well. What's happening is those seasons, especially in the summertime, the [atmosphere's] ability to hold more moisture is going up as well.\"\nDaSilva added: \"It doesn't guarantee we will see more rain over a certain area, but...when it rains, it's going to rain heavier.\"\nThe USGS in a webpage about 100-year flood events: \"In other words, over the course of 1 million years, these events would be expected to occur 10,000 times. But, just because it rained 10 inches in one day last year doesn't mean it can't rain 10 inches in one day again this year.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nAs the probability of heavy rain events increases, people are advised to have a flood plan in place before such an event occurs in their area. People should also never drive on a flooded roadway, as most flood-related deaths occur in vehicles.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\"Catastrophic\" flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in Texas from Hunt downstream to Comfort has caused at least 13 deaths, authorities said.\n\"Move to high ground immediately!\" warned Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist and director of Harris County Flood Control District flood operations and forecasting, in a post on X. \"This is a life threatening flash flood situation.\"\nEarlier in the day, Kerr County Sheriff's Office confirmed there had been fatalities but said it would not release more information until the next of kin are notified.\n\"Our Office is working with a wide variety of local and state agencies to respond to calls and rescues,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement on its Facebook page.\n\"The entire county is an extremely active scene. Residents are encouraged to shelter in place and not attempt travel. Those near creeks, streams, and the Guadalupe River should immediately move to higher ground.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Kerr County Sheriff's Office by phone for comment.\nCamp Mystic Water Rescues\nCamp Mystic, a summer camp for girls, was included in the flood region and water rescues were necessary in the area. Twenty-three girls from the camp are still unaccounted for.\n\"BREAKING: 23 girls from Camp Mystic are unaccounted for after the Kerrville flooding, Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said in a press conference,\" Keenan posted. \"We are praying they're found safe.\"\nRain To Continue on Friday\nA Friday morning forecast from the National Weather Service (NWS) attributed the excessive moisture to remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which formed in the Gulf over the weekend.\n\"The heavy rain threat is forecast to largely diminish by later today,\" the forecast said.\nHowever, as much as 15 inches of rain was reported in some areas of Central Texas, NWS meteorologist James Wingenroth told Newsweek.\nIn San Angelo, official reports were more than 3.5 inches, which is three times the average amount for the entire month of July. Average rainfall throughout July in San Angelo is 1.1 inches.\nThis weather map from Windy.com shows the situation across the affected area.\n\"Heavy rainfall is pivoting south into Kerr and Gillespie Counties,\" said the NWS office for Austin/San Antonio.\n\"Another 2-4 inches of rain possible in these areas. Flash Flood EMERGENCIES are in effect for Kerr County. Avoid travel through this area. Elsewhere, light to moderate rainfall ongoing for portions I-35 corridor.\"\nGuadalupe River Flooding\nRiver water level data from the National Water Center shows that the Guadalupe River surged 25 feet in only 45 minutes this morning. Forecasts anticipate the levels will drop quickly and return to below action stage by the early morning hours on Saturday.\nThe San Saba River near San Saba, Texas, is nearing 18 feet, which is still below action stage, and still rising. Forecasts anticipate the river will keep rising until it peaks at more than 32 feet, which is considered major flood stage. The highest water levels are expected to occur on Saturday morning. The river will remain flooded throughout the weekend.\nEvacuations were ordered in some of the hardest-hit areas.\n\"MANDATORY EVACUATIONS underway for areas near the Guadalupe River in COMFORT, TEXAS in Kendall county,\" CBS Austin meteorologist Avery Tomasco posted on X. \"The destructive flooding in Kerrville is moving quickly downstream. Quickly rising waters likely over the next 4 hours in Comfort. Get to higher ground!\"\nOn Friday afternoon, Tomasco warned that the Llano River was also expected to reach moderate flood stage after the river rose 12 feet in 30 minutes.\nFamilies 'Swept Away'\nAn unidentified man who spoke to News 4 San Antonio said his brother's home was no longer there after the flooding, apparently swept away. He said his brother, sister-in-law, and their two children were all missing.\nFloodwaters \"swept away\" an RV park in Ingram, Texas, with families reportedly still in their RVs, according to a post on X from Tomasco.\n\"New info out of Ingram, TX is hard to stomach,\" Tomasco posted with the video. \"This is video from the back of Howdy's Bar and Chill restaurant. There is usually a large RV park here, closer to the Guadalupe River. It was all swept away with families reportedly still in their campers.\"\nUpdates 7/4/25, 11:20 a.m. and 1:58 p.m. and 4:41 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\nAbout the writer\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.
