      "summary": "The nematicides market is projected to grow from USD 2.25 billion in 2025 to USD 3.06 billion by 2030, driven by rising crop losses from plant‑parasitic nematodes, increasing demand for high‑value crops, and advances in seed‑applied treatments and precision agriculture. Soil dressing remains the dominant application mode, while fruits and vegetables represent the largest crop segment. North America holds the largest market share, supported by extensive high‑value crop cultivation, mechanized farming, and a favorable regulatory environment encouraging bio‑based alternatives.",
