  "content": "Apple has just released a new wave of beta 6 software updates, including watchOS 26 for Apple Watch users on the developer beta.\n\nBeta 6 now available for watchOS 26, with public launch nearing\n\nApple Watch users running the developer beta have a new update to install.\n\nwatchOS 26 beta 6 is now available, bringing the latest changes ahead of Apple\u2019s big public launch.\n\nBeta 5 introduced some refinements to Liquid Glass throughout watchOS 26.\n\nFor example, Notification Center now looks a lot more \u2018glassy\u2019 than before, more closely resembling iOS 26\u2019s look.\n\nToday\u2019s beta 6 isn\u2019t expected to pack much in the way of new features or changes. That\u2019s because we\u2019re getting to the point in the summer where stability and performance are most important.\n\nSince watchOS 26 is expected to ship to all users in just over a month, Apple\u2019s development teams are focused primarily on ensuring it comes with as few bugs as possible.\n\nSo while smaller UI tweaks and enhancements may still arrive in each new beta, we\u2019re unlikely to see much in terms of noticeable changes.\n\nExcept, of course, when it comes to software stability. If you\u2019ve been encountering issues running watchOS 26 this summer, those will hopefully start getting eliminated with each new beta.\n\nHave you noticed anything new in watchOS 26 beta 6? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 Apple Watch Series 10, 46mm (now only $329, down from $429)\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "Apple\u2019s next big iPhone update, iOS 26, will bring a Liquid Glass redesign and tons of new features. Beta testers can try out iOS 26 now, but its release date for the public is still a ways off\u2014here\u2019s when to expect its launch.\niOS 26 will launch this fall, likely in mid-September\nSo far, Apple has only confirmed that iOS 26 will arrive for all users this fall.\nBut looking at the history of software releases, we can get much more precise with our expectations.\nHere are release dates for the last three major iOS versions:\n- iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024\n- iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023\n- iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022\nEach of these launches happened within a week of Apple\u2019s big iPhone event.\nIn 2024, the event happened September 9, in 2023 it was September 12, and in 2022 September 7.\nThis pattern has been followed closely by Apple for years, and we shouldn\u2019t expect anything different for 2025.\nAs a result, iOS 26 is expected to launch to all users in mid-September, shortly after Apple unveils its iPhone 17 lineup earlier in the month.\nMid-September, then, will be when all users with a supported iPhone can install iOS 26 and get the new Liquid Glass redesign, big updates to Messages, Apple Music, Wallet, CarPlay, and much more.\nBut there will also be an opportunity to gain access sooner via a public beta.\nPublic beta for iOS 26 releases this month\nIf you don\u2019t want to wait until September to try out iOS 26, you won\u2019t have to.\nAs it does each year, Apple will offer a public beta version of iOS 26.\niOS 26\u2019s public beta will launch before the end of July.\nThis beta release will be available to anyone who wants it via enrollment at beta.apple.com.\nMost years, Apple ships the public beta in mid-July\u2014but that didn\u2019t happen this year. However, following this week\u2019s debut of beta 4 for developers, the iOS 26 public beta is expected to arrive any day now.\nLike all pre-release software, iOS 26\u2019s public beta will include bugs and performance issues that may or may not impact your device experience.\nApple uses the public beta process to get more data and feedback so it can eliminate as many issues in iOS 26 as possible before the full launch in the fall.\nIf you\u2019re willing to accept the risk of your iPhone not performing as reliably, the public beta is a great way to gain early access to iOS 26\u2019s new features.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $199, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C power adapter for fast charging\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
