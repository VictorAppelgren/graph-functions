  "title": "Northern Lights Tuesday: These States May See Aurora And \u2018Shooting Stars\u2019",
  "description": "The Northern Lights may be visible in U.S. states after space weather experts at NOAA forecast geomagnetic activity.",
  "content": "The Northern Lights may be visible in the U.S. on Tuesday and Wednesday just as the Perseid meteor shower peaks, according to a forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s .\n\nDespite the weekend\u2019s bright full moon rising later at night to entirely true dark skies, sky-watchers in around 10 U.S. states may have a chance to see the aurora borealis on the northern horizon as \u201cshooting stars\u201d fall. The cause is a spate of solar flares on the sun after weeks of inactivity.\n\nThe agency\u2019s three-day forecast indicates an uptick in geomagnetic activity overnight on Tuesday, Aug. 12 through Wednesday, Aug. 13. According to a NOAA forecast, the Kp index \u2014 which provides a rough guide to the intensity of aurora displays \u2014 may reach 4 during a G1 geomagnetic storm.\n\n\u201cThe geomagnetic field is expected to reached active levels, with a chance for G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms, over 12-13 Aug due to persistent influence from a positive polarity CH HSS,\u201d reads a NOAA forecast. A positive polarity CH HSS is a stream of fast-moving solar wind from a coronal hole on the sun, which can cause geomagnetic storms and auroral displays.\n\nWhere The Northern Lights May Be Visible\n\nNOAA\u2019s latest aurora viewlines indicate that aurora displays are a possibility in northern U.S. states and Canada, with 10 U.S. states having a chance after dark on Wednesday, June 25.\n\nParts of U.S. states that could potentially see aurora \u2014 possibly only on camera \u2014 according to NOAA, include Alaska, Washington, northern Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine.. Check NOAA\u2019s 30-minute forecast or use the Glendale App for up-to-the-minute forecasts.\n\nWhy The Northern Lights Are Being Seen In The U.S.\n\nThe possibility of displays of the aurora borealis at more southerly latitudes than is typical is down to an increase in solar activity, which is currently at a 23-year high due to the current solar maximum period.\n\nThe sun is now thought to be on the wane, having peaked in late 2024, but the best aurora displays often occur in the few years after solar maximum. If the current solar cycle does have a long tail, good aurora sightings in the U.S. could result for a few years.\n\nWhen The Northern Lights Are Most Common\n\nMarch-April and September-October are the most geomagnetically active month of the year, with geomagnetic disturbances twice as likely in spring (and also in fall) as in winter and summer. They tend to be strongest in the week or two after the equinoxes (September 22, 2025 and March 20, 2026).\n\nEarth\u2019s axis tilts by 23.5 degrees, which is why we have seasons. It also puts Earth perpendicular to the sun at equinox. Since the solar wind\u2019s magnetic field is facing southward relative to the Earth, during equinox the geometry more easily allows charged particles from the sun to be accelerated down the field lines of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",

      "text": "When is the Perseid meteor shower? Happening right now \u2014 and peaking this week \u2014 the fastest and brightest meteor shower of the year will likely underwhelm.\n\u201cThe Perseid meteor shower is active between Jul. 17 and Aug. 24,\u201d said Dr Shyam Balaji, theoretical physicist at King\u2019s College London, in an email. \u201cIt peaks on Aug. 12, but the light from the full moon might make meteors harder to spot that night.\u201d Harder, but not impossible.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about \u2014 and how and when to get the best view of \u2014 the Perseid meteor shower this week.\nPeak Night Is August 12\u201313 \u2014 But Moonlight Will Be a Factor\nOn the peak night, Aug. 12\u201313, a bright gibbous moon \u2014 about 84% lit and rising just as it starts to get dark \u2014 will vastly reduce the visibility of \u201cshooting stars.\u201d \u201cThe light from the full moon might make meteors harder to spot that night,\u201d said Balaji.\nThe best chance may be just after sunset and before moonrise, when the sky is still dark, on Aug. 12 \u2014 but it\u2019s a narrow window.\nExpect About 5-10 \u2018Shooting Stars\u2019 Per Hour On The Peak Night\nAlthough the Perseids can see about 75 \u201cshooting stars\u201d per hour during their peak night, this year observers might spot only five to 10 meteors per hour. That\u2019s the huge impact of a bright gibbous moon.\n\u201cThe Perseid meteor shower is caused by the Earth travelling through the debris left by a comet called Swift-Tuttle,\u201d said Balaji. \u201cThe debris falls through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and as it burns up, you get the meteor shower display.\u201d\nFind An Open Space With A Clear View\nAlthough strong moonlight means there\u2019s no point in escaping to dark skies for the Perseids this year, you still need to think about your observing location. \"The key would be to find an open space with a clear view of as much of the sky as possible, since meteors can appear anywhere,\u201d said Dr. Qicheng Zhang, astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in an email. He adds that smoke and smog can also make a noticeable difference.\nThe Peak Night Is Still Worth Watching Despite the Moon\nAlthough the Perseid meteor shower will be marred by moonlight, it can still be an astronomical highlight for stargazers. That\u2019s because some of the brighter \u201cshooting stars\u201d \u2014 called fireballs \u2014 will still be visible to those with lots of patience.\nThe best chance may be just after sunset and before moonrise, when the sky is still dark, on Aug. 12 \u2014 but it\u2019s a narrow window.\nThere may be reasons to look for Perseids in a darker sky, but there\u2019s still likely to be a visible uptick in rates around the peak night. \u201cThe Perseids in the middle of the month are still likely to produce the most visible meteors despite the moon,\u201d said Zhang.\nYou Can Take Evasive Action To Beat The Strong Moonlight\nThere\u2019s not much you can do about moonlight interrupting the peak of the Perseid meteor shower, but you can lessen its impact by keeping the moon behind you and, better still, watching from somewhere in shadow.\nHowever, be careful that the obstruction you use to block the moon doesn\u2019t also block too much of the night sky. That\u2019s likely to be a bigger problem the higher the moon rises into the sky after midnight.\nThe Nights Following The Peak Are Also Worth Being Outside For\nThe nights immediately afterwards are also worth being outside for looking for \u201cshooting stars.\u201d\n\u201cThe moon rises slightly later each night around the time of the Perseids peak, giving a slightly longer moonless window for later nights,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cHowever, typically, the meteor rate drops off substantially from the peak \u2014 one would probably still see more meteors on the peak night than afterward, all else equal.\u201d\nThere Could Be A Sudden Outburst\nSudden, unpredictable outbursts could increase that number, but they\u2019re rare and difficult to forecast. \u201cOutbursts are notoriously hard to predict since they require us to know precisely how the parent comet responsible for the meteors was behaving centuries ago, long before astronomers were observing it in any detail,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cStrong outbursts in meteor activity may last only a few hours, and because they\u2019re unpredictable in time, require either a lot of luck or watching for many hours to have a reasonable chance of catching.\u201d\nThe Perseid meteor shower is caused by the Earth travelling through the debris left by comet Swift-Tuttle.\nLook To The North-East For The Best Chance\n\u201cShooting stars\u201d can appear anywhere in the night sky at any time. However, there is a radiant point, a specific location in the night sky from which the meteors appear to originate. \u201cThe best place to view the Perseid meteor shower is in the Northeast near the constellation Perseus,\u201d said Balaji. \u201cWhile you can look at the whole sky and are likely to see a meteor, that\u2019s the target location.\u201d\nThe brightly lit moon might upset your view of the Perseid meteor shower in 2025, but it will simultaneously create a rather beautiful sight. Look alongside the moon as it rises in the east \u2014 albeit uncomfortably near the Perseids\u2019 radiant point \u2014 and you\u2019ll see the planet Saturn, close to looking its biggest, brightest and best in 2025.\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes."

      "text": "|\nNorthern Hemisphere |\nSouthern Hemisphere |\nThis is a short-term forecast of the location and intensity of the aurora. This product is based on the OVATION model and provides a 30 to 90 minute forecast of the location and intensity of the aurora. The forecast lead time is the time it takes for the solar wind to travel from the L1 observation point to Earth.\nThe two maps show the North and South poles of Earth respectively. The brightness and location of the aurora is typically shown as a green oval centered on Earth\u2019s magnetic pole. The green ovals turn red when the aurora is forecasted to be more intense. The sunlit side of Earth is indicated by the lighter blue of the ocean and the lighter color of the continents. Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise. The aurora is not visible during daylight hours. The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as a 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right.\nThe aurora is an indicator of the current geomagnetic storm conditions and provides situational awareness for a number of technologies. The aurora directly impacts HF radio communication and GPS/GNSS satellite navigation. It is closely related to the ground-induced currents that impact electric power transmission.\nFor many people, the aurora is a beautiful nighttime phenomenon that is worth traveling to arctic regions just to observe. It is the only way for most people to actually experience space weather.\nThese links provide a discussion of the aurora phenomena and tips for the best opportunities to view aurora at various locations around the world.\nThe OVATION (Oval Variation, Assessment, Tracking, Intensity, and Online Nowcasting) model is an empirical model of the intensity of the aurora developed at the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory by Patrick Newell and co-workers1. The model uses the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field measured at the L1 orbit position at 1.6 million km (1 million miles) upstream from earth as input and calculates three types of electron precipitation and the proton precipitation which strongly correlate with the aurora. An estimate of aurora viewing probability can be derived by assuming a linear relationship to the intensity of the aurora. This relationship was validated by comparison with data from the Ultraviolet imager (UVI) instrument on the NASA Polar satellite(2).\nOn occasion, the input solar wind data are either contaminated or unavailable. In those instances, an alternative estimate of the solar wind forcing, based on the current Kp geomagnetic index is used to drive the OVATION model. When this occurs, there is no forecast lead time.\nFor more information on the OVATION model and aurora products, see:\n- Newell, P. T., T. Sotirelis, and S. Wing (2009), Diffuse, monoenergetic, and broadband aurora: The global precipitation budget, J. Geophys. Res., 114, A09207, doi:10.1029/2009JA014326(link is external).\n- Machol, J. L., Green., J. C., Redmon, R. J., Viereck, R. A., Newell, P. T., (2012), Evaluation of OVATION Prime as a forecast model for visible aurorae, Space Weather, 10, 3, doi.org/10.1029/2011SW000746\nIn 2009, Newell et. al., developed the OVATION model.\nIn 2011, NOAA (NCEI and SWPC) developed a real-time version of the OVATION model to forecast the location and intensity of the aurora. Machol and Redmon (NCEI) developed the real-time ovation model. Viereck (SWPC) implemented the model and developed the graphical products to run in realtime to create aurora forecasts.\nIn 2013, Newell upgraded the OVATION Prime model so that it would more accurately capture large geomagnetic storms. The original model, based solely on DMSP data, was only reliable to Kp of 7. By adding data from the NASA TIMED GUVI instrument, Newell et al., were able to expand the model to include the larger storm values of Kp of 8 and 9.\nIn 2016, NOAA SWPC shared the operational OVATION code (written in IDL) with the UK Met Office in the UK. The UK Met Office converted the OVATION model from IDL to Python.\nIn 2020, NOAA SWPC implemented the new version of the OVATION Prime model into operations. This version has been dubbed OVATION 2020.\nThe Auroral Forecast product is based on the OVATION Prime model developed by P. Newell at the Johns Hopkins, Applied Physics Laboratory.\nThe latest 24 hours of image frames comprising the Northern and Southern hemisphere loops (with time-tagged file names) are available: Northern, Southern\nThe most recent Northern and Southern Hemisphere images (with static file names) are available: Northern, Southern\nAuroral data in a grided format for the entire Earth is available in compressed JSON format: The latest JSON file is available as well.\nThe Hemispheric Power Index, an estimate of the total auroral energy input at each pole, is available in ASCII format: latest HPI"

You want it negative. The more negative it is, the stronger the aurora is at that minute. Falling is good, rising is bad. It tracks the strength of the actual aurora in the sky in real-time. It is the single most important number on the app and overrides all others.\nWhen it says 'growth', the substorm is charging up like a battery. When it says 'expansion' that energy is being released as aurora. When it says 'recovery', the aurora will slowly begin to fade.\nThe trendline shows the changes in strength over the last hour. The line dropping sharply downwards is good. Rising is bad. The blue shaded area indicates the ambient level.\n*Auroral Substorm Index (AS Index).\n| Loading... |\nIMF tells us about the future, not the present. We use it to predict activity 1 to 3 hours from now.\nThe table shows an analysis of the interplanetary magnetic field in the 30 minute window that is currently arriving at Earth, together with windows either side of it. The 'percentage' figure indicates how negative the Bz was, the ideal is 100% negative.\nIf the 'now' and 'next' rows are both lit up, the substorm will continue if one is active or will start in about an hour if one isn't active.\nIf the 'next' row is not lit up, the activity will start to wane if a substorm is active but there can be an extra burst of activity, so wait an hour.\nWhen a substorm is in its expansion phase all of these values are irrelevant to that substorm. Substorm strength overrides all other metrics.\nThe trendlines show the Bz and Bt that is arriving at Earth now (left) and as far into the future as it is possible to see, at L1 satellites (right). Bt is at the top, Bz in the middle and the optimum Bz at the bottom (black).\nThe middle line is the important one. You want it to be below the blue shaded (ambient) area and as close to the black line as possible.\n| Speed (V) | Loading... | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Density (N) | Loading... | |\n| Pressure | Loading... | |\n| PCP | Loading... |\nThis is the mean velocity, density and pressure of the solar wind that is currently arriving at the Earth. They don't directly matter for aurora. IMF is what matters. A good IMF will lead to aurora even when speed and density are at ambient levels.\nWe use solar wind data to look for space weather events that might bring us good IMF. Primarily we look for shocks, which are simultaneous large steps on the graphs.\nWhen a substorm is active, all of these values are irrelevant. Substorm strength overrides all other metrics.\nAurora is all about magnetic fields (IMF-driven). Speed and density do NOT affect physical characteristics of the aurora such as brightness, colour or viewing latitude. Nor do they have any affect on the substorm process itself.\nThe trendlines show the solar wind speed (V), density (N), temperature (T) and IMF strength (B) that is arriving at Earth now (left) and as far into the future as it is possible to see, at L1 satellites (right). The blue shaded area indicates the ambient level.\nThe EPAM chart shows low-energy particles arriving at Earth. The protons are the thick line and electrons the thin line. The lines climbing sharply indicates that a space weather event is approaching. Proton values rise sharply in the hours before an interplanetary shock.\nCoronal holes cause most of our auroras and they are regular, repeating on a 27 day cycle. Plasma from an Earth-facing coronal hole typically takes 3 to 4 days to reach us and spark auroras.\nFlipping between the 'now' and '-27 days' tabs allows you to see how coronal holes have changed since their last rotation 27 days ago.\nThe '-4 days' tab allows you to see how the coronal hole looked when it was in the earth-facing position 4 days ago.\nSolar imagery courtesy of NASA/SDO and the AIA, EVE, and HMI science teams.

They can trigger the strongest auroras if they hit Earth.\nYou are looking for plasma surrounding more than 50% of the solar disk in this graphic (a partial halo). The ideal is a 'full halo', where plasma appears to surround the entire solar disk. It then takes 2 to 3 days for the CME to reach Earth.\nEven when there appears to be an Earth-directed component or it looks like a direct hit, the CME can still miss completely or bounce off the Earth's magnetosphere. Don't get too excited until the app alerts that a shock has been detected!\nDon't take any ETAs too seriously, either here or on other sites, as they are only a very rough guide.\nUnverified CMEs are those automatically detected by the app that haven't been manually reviewed yet to confirm that they are valid and Earth-sided.\nCME data and graphics derived by Glendale App from solar imagery kindly provided by SOHO.\n| Loading... |\n| Loading... |\nSolar flares from sunspots sometimes produce a CME which, if directed earthward, can cause strong substorms between two and four days after the eruption.\nMost flares don't produce a CME and most CMEs miss the Earth, so don't get too excited about flares.\nFlares are classed A, B, C, M or X with A being weakest and X being strongest. The number indicates how strong the flare was within its class.\nAfter a flare, it can take several hours before imagery becomes available that enables us to determine whether there was a CME and whether that CME was Earth-directed. After a flare, keep checking the Coronal Mass Ejections panel for the latest updates as imagery arrives.\nThe image shows the active region that was the source of the most recent solar flare, highlighted with a circle. When there have been no recent flares it shows the latest image of the solar disk. The images are annotated with the sunspot (active region) numbers. These are colour-coded based on magnetic complexity.\nSolar imagery courtesy of NASA/SDO and the AIA, EVE, and HMI science teams.

Dates that are missing have no predicted activity.\nThis forecast should only be used for dates 10 to 27 days in the future. Up to 9 days ahead we can see the actual hole on the solar disk.\nThe sun spins on its axis effectively every 27 days, which means that coronal holes and active regions giving us auroras today can rotate back around again in 27 days time, giving another show.\nThese are the dates when solar wind streams that gave us good auroras will rotate around again. There is no guarantee that the coronal holes that caused the substorms on the previous rotation won't have closed but they also may have got larger. You can only use these as a guide but this is the most accurate long-range forecast for the UK, Ireland, Iceland, Scandinavia, North America and Australasia that you will find anywhere in the world.\nIt is essential to check the coronal holes panel, as we get closer to the dates that interest you, to confirm the current status of the hole that caused the activity, as it might have closed.\nThis forecast is based on my own data collected in the UK and is valid worldwide. The more negative the figure, the stronger the aurora could be.\n* You need to register to view the full 28-day forecast.\n| Loading... |\nIf you have forgotten your password, an email will be sent to your registered email address with a link to reset it.

An 'onset' alert is sent first as a warning that an aurora is starting, followed by yellow, amber, red, major, severe and extreme alerts as activity develops. Your device will receive these even when the app is not running.\nThe 'Expansion Alarm' is designed for desktop users. If you leave the app running in 'alarm mode' on your PC, the app will start bleeping as soon as it detects a substorm heading into expansion phase to give you time to head out and catch it at its peak.\n'Activity Alerts' are notifications that can be set to 'ping' your device only when the app is running. These occur much more frequently than the basic alerts. They alert you to all thresholds being crossed, auroras being reported by users and photos being uploaded. These are great for users of desktop PCs who want to keep constantly updated on the current aurora situation.\nAlerts are available for both Apple and Android devices via Telegram at https://t.me/GlendaleApp\nThe plot shows the substorm strength* over the last 24 hours, which allows you to see the periods when the aurora was at its best.\nThe more negative the figure, the stronger the aurora was.\nThese graphs are deliberately produced 5+ minutes behind real-time. Use the Substorm Panel above for aurora-hunting.\nThese graphs allow you to verify the accuracy of this app by comparing the times of your best photos against the substorm strength the following day. You will see that your best photos were taken precisely on the best drops. Remember that the graphs are in UTC time, not your local time.\n*Auroral Substorm Index (AS Index).\nThe plot shows the IMF Bt (black) & Bz (red) over the last 24 hours, which allows you to see the periods when the IMF was strongest.\nThe pale green line shows the By.\nThe plot shows the clock angle (\u03b8) over the last 24 hours, which allows you to see the periods when the IMF was best aligned.\nThe plot shows the solar wind speed & density over the last 24 hours.\nThe chart shows magnetometer deflections at every station on the entire Norwegian array from north to south, in descending order of latitude, plotted over the last 24 hours.\nSharp drops correspond to substorms in their expansion phase. Ideally what you are looking for on the stackplot are drops of >200nT on the right-hand side of the graph. The scale is shown top-right.\nThis should not be used for real-time aurora-hunting. Use the substorm panel at the top of the app instead, as it reacts faster and translates all the squiggles into a single, easy-to-use number.\nStackplot courtesy of the Troms\u00f8 Geophysical Observatory.\nThe 'at-Earth' graphs allow you to see when activity was happening over the last 24 hours. These should not be used for real-time aurora-hunting, as they are deliberately delayed. They are intended to be used to correlate the timestamps on your images taken last night against the data that was being shown on Glendale App at the time. This helps you to verify how accurate the app is at tracking the actual aurora that was happening in the sky. Times are in UTC, so you will need to consider your UTC offset.\nThe 'substorm strength' graph is the main graph for retrospective use. It shows you when all of the substorm activity was happening. You will see that the times of peak activity on your images correspond to the peak drops on the graph.\nThe other graphs are all adjusted to the Earth-time frame of reference and aligned vertically so that you can easily see how the other parameters influence the substorms.\nThese are an educational tool to help you understand how the aurora you captured last night corresponds to the relevant data.\nIdeally what we want is either a negative Bz, or a very wide separation between the Bz and Bt lines, over the course of the last hour.\nSolar wind graphs courtesy of the NOAA SWPC.\nStereo graphs courtesy of the STEREO Science Center\nThis allows you to verify that you have enabled location services correctly in your device and confirm what lat/long your device is giving to the app. If these are wrong then all forecasts and times given on the app will be incorrect. It is vital that you resolve any issues.\nYour location in geomagnetic co-ordinates is also given, which allows you to see how much closer your effective latitude for auroras is to your true latitude.\nGlendale App was created by Andy Stables of the Glendale Skye Auroras Facebook Page to make it easy for people to see and photograph auroras worldwide. It is the result of research carried out on a daily basis since September 2012 in the Isle of Skye.\nThe world-leading accuracy of the app is only possible due to the generosity of the Troms\u00f8 Geophysical Observatory, the Swedish Institude of Space Physics, the US Geological Survey, the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the CARISMA team in allowing me to access the live data feeds from their entire magnetometer arrays around the northern hemisphere.\nThe wonderful icons for the tiles, badges and logo were the work of Andrew Liley from Portree.\nThe Iceland Version of the App was only made possible thanks to many hours of detailed observation and recording by Caroline Weir from Reykjavik, who runs the Aurora Iceland Facebook Group.\nRead the full behind-the-scenes story of Glendale App here.\nEurope, Canada & Oceania Maps by vemaps.com."

      "text": "Update, June 24, 2025: NOAA has upgraded its forecast, which is now reflected in the article.\nThe Northern Lights may be visible in the U.S. this week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center, which is predicting a geomagnetic storm that could result in aurora being glimpsed in as many as 14 U.S. states overnight on Tuesday, June 24, and Wednesday, June 25.\nThe agency\u2019s three-day forecast has a minor geomagnetic storm occurring, measured at a value of up to G2 on a scale of G1 to G5. According to NOAA\u2019s forecast, the Kp index \u2014 which provides a rough guide to the intensity of aurora displays \u2014 may reach 5.\nAccording to Spaceweather.com, a large hole in the sun\u2019s atmosphere is turning toward Earth, unleashing a stream of solar wind in its direction.\nWhere The Northern Lights May Be Visible\nNOAA\u2019s aurora viewlines have potential aurora displays that are possible in northern U.S. states and Canada. A total of 14 U.S. states have a chance of seeing the aurora on the northern horizon on Tuesday, June 24, and Wednesday, June 25, with those on the U.S.-Canada border having a higher chance.\nParts of U.S. states that could potentially see aurora include Washington, northern Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Areas far from light pollution are likely to get the best views.\nWhen To See The Northern Lights\nExactly when and where aurora becomes visible this week will be down not to predictions but data coming in from NASA\u2019s DSCOVR and ACE satellites. Orbiting the sun from around a million miles from Earth, they give a roughly 30-minute warning of aurora displays after measuring the solar wind\u2019s speed and magnetic intensity. Check NOAA's 30-minute forecast or use the Glendale App for up-to-the-minute forecasts.\nWhat Causes The Northern Lights\nThe Northern Lights are caused by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun interacting with Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Although the magnetic field deflects much of it, some charged particles accelerate along the magnetic field lines toward the polar regions, where they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, exciting them and causing them to release energy as light.\nThe possibility of displays of the aurora borealis at more southerly latitudes comes from a spike in solar activity, which is currently at a 23-year high due to the current solar maximum period. Geomagnetic storms and aurora are expected to continue through 2025 and 2026.\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes."

  "argos_summary": "The Northern Lights may be visible in the U.S. on August 12-13, coinciding with the peak of the Perseid meteor shower, due to increased geomagnetic activity from solar flares. A NOAA forecast indicates a potential Kp index of 4 during a G1 geomagnetic storm, allowing sightings in northern states such as Alaska, Washington, and North Dakota. Despite a bright full moon potentially obscuring the Perseids, sky-watchers may still catch glimpses of both phenomena.",
