      "feedback": "The analysis draft effectively outlines the potential implications of a Trump-Putin meeting, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth. Strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking the potential meeting to specific market reactions and geopolitical outcomes, rather than relying on general statements. Incorporate quantifiable data, such as potential price ranges for oil or specific sanctions that could be lifted, to provide a more concrete basis for your assertions. Ensure adherence to the 0–3 week horizon by emphasizing immediate catalysts and monitoring key developments closely. Increase citation density by referencing specific analysts or reports that support your claims, rather than relying solely on the article ID. Lastly, clarify invalidation scenarios by detailing what specific commitments from Trump would counteract concessions to Russia. This will elevate the analysis to a world-class standard.",
