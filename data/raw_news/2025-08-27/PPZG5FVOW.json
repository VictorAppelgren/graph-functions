  "title": "Pro-DEI organizers fired up to maintain Target boycott as promises go unfulfilled",
  "description": "When Target announced its current chief executive officer was stepping down, organizers of a months-long consumer boycott took it as a hopeful sign and stressed that their actions will continue as long as promises go unfulfilled.",
  "content": "Organizers of a Target boycott that began in January are pointing to their tactics as a hopeful sign that actions against corporate retailers can still make a deep impact.\n\nWhen Target announced its current chief executive officer will be stepping down in February 2026 and an insider was taking the helm, those organizers saw it as a move in the right direction and stress more than ever that boycotts will continue as long as previous promises made to the public go unfulfilled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been now nearly 200 days and what all the statistics and economics are showing that since that boycott was announced on that Monday \u2014 every single week since then \u2014 Target foot traffic in nearly 2,000 stores has declined sharply and continues to decline,\u201d said organizer Jaylani Hussein, at a news conference of the National Target Boycott movement outside Target\u2019s Minneapolis headquarters late last week.\n\nBoycott organizers in Minnesota were among some of the first to galvanize when Target opted in January to follow other companies like Amazon and Walmart and forego diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. High-profile civil rights activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jamal Bryant also made similar calls for what they deemed a betrayal of previous DEI promises.\n\nSocial justice advocates say this shows boycotting is a key tactic not to be taken for granted.\n\nRetail analysts say it\u2019s difficult to gauge the exact impact of the boycott, since Target has faced a slump the last few years and a leadership change was in the cards. Still, groups like Washington-based DC Boycott Target Coalition insist falling foot traffic is \u201cdue in no small part\u201d to a boycott that spans coast to coast.\n\n\u201cThe leadership change doesn\u2019t mean anything without a culture change,\u201d the group said in a statement, vowing to continue pressuring Target until the corporation sees its diversity goals as \u201cmore important than bowing to an administration that is filled with racism, failure and hatred.\u201d\n\nOpponents began the national boycott in February, during Black History Month. Their strategy left some Black-owned brands with merchandise on Target shelves conflicted or scrambling.\n\nBy April, Sharpton actually met with Target\u2019s CEO Brian Cornell, who had been at the helm for 11 years. But, nothing concrete came of it.\n\nCornell\u2019s departure from the role had been in the works for several years.\n\nIn September 2022, the board extended Cornell\u2019s contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65. When Target\u2019s chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke takes over, Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board.\n\nIn a call with reporters, Fiddelke attributed the sales malaise to many issues like focusing too much on basics and not enough trendy items, particularly in home goods.\n\nStacey Widlitz, president of investment research firm SW Retail Advisors, said she believes that Target\u2019s sales malaise has more to do with its operational issues \u2014 messy stores and poorly stocked shelves \u2014 not from its pullback from DEI initiatives.\n\nUnraveling them did not affect Target \u201cexponentially compared to somebody else,\u201d she said. \u201cThe consumer has a very short memory. If you have great, compelling product at value prices, they\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who say they regularly shop at Target has gone down 19% since 2021, according to Consumer Edge. The number of Americans who say they do not shop at Target has risen 17%.\n\nThe same analysis also looked at trends along party lines. Since last year, the number of regular Target shoppers who identify as Democrat has declined 13%. Inversely, the number of Republican customers has risen 13%. It\u2019s not clear if that is due to Target\u2019s $1 million donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration or some other factors.\n\nThe strategy of racial justice boycotts stretches back over 160 years, from Reconstruction era \u201cBuy Black\u201d campaigns stressing the Black American economic influence to the Montgomery Bus Boycott of the Civil Rights Movement. There have been more modern campaigns like the NAACP\u2019s 15-year economic boycott of the state of South Carolina over its display of the confederate battle flag widely regarded as a symbol of hatred and slavery. The civil rights group ended its boycott in 2015 after the state removed the flag from its statehouse grounds, following the massacre of nine Black parishioners at a historic African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston.\n\nSome Black creators on the social media platform TikTok rejoiced on the platform at the CEO leaving and credited the boycotts. Others cautioned that Cornell was essentially promoted but that the boycott is still needed.\n\nBlack Americans\u2019 buying power has climbed over the last 25 years and is now an estimated $2.1 trillion annually, according to Nielsen research.\n\nPart of the reason organizers say they have zeroed in on Target is because the company had heavily touted a commitment to DEI back in 2020 after protests erupted across the nation over the murder of George Floyd. That year, Target announced it would increase representation of Black staff by 20% over three years and invest $10 million in social justice organizations. In 2021, the company pledged to dedicate more than $2 billion toward Black-owned businesses before the end of 2025.\n\nIn January, however, Target said it would conclude the hiring and advancement goals it had set.\n\nFor boycott organizers, a reversal of those decisions is the only way to rectify the situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting that Target is making good on the promises that it made. Otherwise there\u2019s no point of discussion regarding calling off this boycott,\u201d said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and past president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP. \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to join us, get involved and hold Target accountable for its actions.\u201d\n\nAP Retail Writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Target is ending its diversity goals as a strong DEI opponent occupies the White House\nTarget is ending its diversity goals as a strong DEI opponent occupies the White House\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump\u2019s return to Washington\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\nTarget has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the DEI decisions as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s decades-long process to create \u201cinclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\u201d\n\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis.\nA 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\nWalmart, McDonald\u2019s, Ford, Harley-Davison and John Deere are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.\nPresident Donald Trump this week signaled his administration\u2019s agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs across the federal government. The order calls for revoking all DEI mandates, policies, preferences and activities, along with the review and revision of existing employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs.\nStill, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\nAccording to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco\u2019s board of directors had recommended a no vote.\nApple\u2019s board and the CEO of JPMorgan bank also have expressed a commitment to preserving their companies\u2019 DEI activities.\nUnlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target\u2019s work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.\nBut the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\nGetting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.\nSteering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \u201cinclusivity is a core belief at Target\u201d and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \u201ccorresponds with their gender identity.\u201d\nBut after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.\nIn 2023, Target removed some of its Pride Month merchandise after online complaints and in-store confrontations that the retailer said threatened employees\u2019 well-being. The company decided last year not to stock Pride Month products at every U.S. store."

Jamal Bryant said this week that the Minneapolis-based retailer has not met all of the boycott effort\u2019s demands. Among them: Restoring its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion principles and pledging money to Black-owned banks and businesses.\nTarget announced in January that it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees build meaningful careers and promote Black-owned businesses. Conservative activists and President Donald Trump have sought to dismantle DEI policies in the federal government and schools.\nBryant is the pastor of one of the South\u2019s largest churches, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. The 40-day \u201cfast\u201d of Target stores coincided with the beginning of Lent on March 5, and other faith leaders endorsed the protest.\n\u201cUntil Target comes to the table with serious, concrete proposals to meet our four demands, we will remain in this posture,\u201d Bryant said on a website dedicated to the boycott effort.\n\u201cSilence and delay are no longer acceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cOur communities deserve action, not platitudes. Our demands are not radical \u2014 they are righteous, reasonable, and long overdue.\u201d\nIn a statement Wednesday, Target said, \u201cwe have an ongoing commitment to creating a welcoming environment for all team members, guests, and suppliers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s core to how we support and grow our business,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe remain focused on supporting organizations and creating opportunities for people in the 2,000 communities where we live and operate.\u201d\nTarget operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people."

      "text": "Target CEO to step down amid company struggles\nTarget CEO to step down amid company struggles\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Target named an insider as its next chief executive officer Wednesday, a decision that comes as the discount retailer tries to reverse a persistent sales malaise and to revive its reputation as the place to go for affordable but stylish products.\nMinneapolis-based Target said CEO Brian Cornell, who has led the company for 11 years, would step down on Feb. 1. The board of directors chose Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, to succeed him.\nTarget, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, has struggled to find its footing since inflation caused pinched shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d\nConsumer boycotts since late January, when Target joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have compounded its predicament.\nSome retail analysts were surprised the board did not pick a candidate from outside the company to turn things around. Target\u2019s stock price was down more than 8% in early morning trading after the company announced both Fiddelke\u2019s appointment and another quarter of disappointing sales.\n\u201cThe Street was looking for a fresh pair of eyes that might bring a solution to two years of stumbles,\u201d Stacey Widlitz, president of investment research firm SW Retail Advisors, said while noting that she thinks investors should give Fiddelke a chance.\nDuring a call with reporters on Tuesday, Fiddelke acknowledged many of Target\u2019s problems. For example, he said he thought the company became too focused on basic home goods during the coronavirus pandemic, when demand for cozy furnishings and kitchen tools exploded.\nFiddelke said he would step in as CEO with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company\u2019s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re leading with swagger in our merchandising authority, when we have swagger in our marketing and we\u2019re setting the trend for retail, those are some of the moments I think that Target has been at its highest in my 20 years,\u201d Fiddelke said.\nTarget has reported flat or declining comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 in nine out of the past 11 quarters. On Wednesday, the company said comparable sales dipped 1.9% dip in its latest three-month period, when its net income also dropped 21%.\nIn March, members of Target\u2019s executive team told investors they planned to regain the chain\u2019s reputation for selling stylish goods at budget prices by expanding Target\u2019s lineup of store label brands and shortening the time it took to get new items from the idea stage into stores.\n\u201cIn a world where we operate today, our guests are looking for Tarzhay,\u201d Cornell told investors. \u201cConsumers coined that term decades ago to define how we elevate the everything everyday to something special, how we had unexpected fun in the shopping that would be otherwise routine.\u201d\nBefore joining Target in August 2014, Cornell spent more than 30 years in leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies, including as CEO at Michaels, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club and PepsiCo America Foods.\nHe replaced former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down months after Target disclosed a huge data breach in which hackers stole millions of customers\u2019 credit- and debit-card records. The theft badly damaged the chain\u2019s reputation and profits.\nIn September 2022, the board of director\u2019s extended Cornell\u2019s contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65. Fiddelke will become the board\u2019s chair when he takes over, and Cornell will transition into the role of executive chair.\nCornell reenergized sales by having his team rev up Target\u2019s store brands. He focused on better tailoring stores to their local communities. Cornell also spearheaded the company\u2019s mission to transform its stores into hubs for shipping or picking up online orders.\nThe move helped to reduce costs and speed up deliveries, but the in-person experience for shoppers suffered as Target diverted store workers to fulfilling orders placed online, according to some analysts.\nThe coronavirus pandemic delivered outsized sales for Target as well as its peers as many people bought items to help them work and entertain themselves at home. Sales continued to surge when shoppers first returned to stores. But the spending sprees eventually subsided.\nAs inflation started to spike, Target reported a 52% drop in profits during its 2022 first quarter compared with a year earlier. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic faded, leaving the retailer with excess inventory that had to be sold off.\nIn July 2023, as shoppers feeling pinched by inflation curtailed their spending, Target said its comparable sales declined for the first time in six years. Its sales continued to languish as customers defected to Walmart and off-price department store chains like TJ Maxx in search of lower prices.\nAlthough Walmart retreated from its diversity initiatives first, Target has been the focus of more concerted consumer boycotts. Organizers have said they viewed Target\u2019s action as a greater betrayal because the company previously had held itself out as a champion of inclusion. In 2023, a customer backlash over the annual line of LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise Target carried also cut into sales.\nMany analysts think Target stumbled by losing sight of the winning mix of merchandising savvy and competitive price points that had distinguished it from Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer. Walmart gained market share among households with incomes over $100,000 as U.S. inflation caused consumer prices to rise rapidly.\n\u201cWhile we think Fiddelke is talented and has a somewhat different take on things compared to current CEO Brian Cornell, this is an internal appointment that does not necessarily remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and the inward-looking mindset that have plagued Target for years,\u201d Neil Saunders, a managing director at GlobalData Retail, said Wednesday."

      "text": "Target CEO says he still sees many opportunities in retail\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Target CEO Brian Cornell says he\u2019s optimistic about the holiday season and consumer confidence, and still sees lots of opportunities in retail.\nAs all stores head into the crucial season, the Minneapolis-based discounter he has led since 2014 has been revamping its stores, opening smaller locations in urban markets and trying to offer more expert customer help in areas like food, clothing, and electronics.\nRetailers overall are under pressure to make the stores more inviting and offer experiences shoppers couldn\u2019t get online, as customers increasingly opt for the convenience of shopping online.\nTarget is offering new store brands, eight of which will be available for the first time for the holiday season. That includes the much-anticipated Heart & Hand by Magnolia, a lifestyle brand from Chip and Joanna Gaines of HGTV\u2019s \u201cFixer Upper.\u201d\nTarget\u2019s also been expanding online services including now shipping online orders from 1,400 of its 1,800 stores for faster delivery. It\u2019s hiring 100,000 temporary workers, a 40 percent increase from last year, to working in its stores, stocking shelves or fulfilling online orders.\nCornell spoke recently with The Associated Press about the holiday season and how consumers are feeling. The interview was edited for length and clarity.\n___\nQ: Why do you feel optimistic about the season?\nA: I feel really good. We\u2019ve been working all year to bring our new brand offerings to life, to bring more value to the guest. We have done a lot of work to reimagine stores and move into new neighborhoods, so the holiday season is where it all comes together.\nQ: What\u2019s been the reaction to Target\u2019s move to add dedicated experts?\nA: If you shop beauty today, we have someone there that can help you, who understands the category, that\u2019s there to assist you and make a decision. In apparel, there\u2019s someone who can put together an outfit for Friday night. So the guest reaction has been really positive. I\u2019m absolutely confident that is leading to market-share improvements. We\u2019re seeing stability and improvements in food and beverage and a big uptick in produce. We now have produce experts.\nQ: What\u2019s the state of the consumer?\nA: The consumer has been incredibly resilient. I look at the latest consumer confidence numbers. They look really positive, and we\u2019re seeing traffic up at the stores. We\u2019re seeing visits (to our) store site grow.\nI think we are going into the holiday season with a stable consumer environment.\nQ: Given a rash of layoffs at stores, do you think the retail industry is still the entry point into the workforce?\nA: We\u2019re a big part of the American economy. Things are changing. There may be different types of retail opportunities, whether it is in a store or as a visual merchant or working in fulfilment so the jobs may change over time, but there\u2019s lots of opportunities.\nI still believe that for well-run retailers that have great financial fundamentals who are investing in the business, there\u2019s great opportunity to take market share. I am absolutely determined to make sure Target is one of those winners.\n_____-"

Sales have been climbing steadily through the pandemic but now Target \u2014 like many retailers \u2014 is grappling with inflationary pressures and big shifts in consumer spending that have taken a toll on profits, which plunged nearly 90% in the fiscal second quarter.\nDespite the new challenges, the company is sticking with Cornell.\n\u201cIn discussions about the company\u2019s longer-term plans, it was important to us as a board to assure our stakeholders that Brian intends to stay in his role beyond the traditional retirement age of 65,\u201d said Monica Lozano, the lead independent director of Target\u2019s board in a release on Wednesday.\nThe move is part of a growing trend among corporations to drop the age requirement of CEOs amid stronger corporate governance standards and a shift in perception about the age appropriateness of a top executive, according to experts.\n\u201cPeople are working later in their life,\u201d said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger Gray & Christmas, a global outplacement firm. \u201cThe common perception of when someone should retire has changed,\u201d although he noted that many law firms and accounting firms still have mandatory requirements for their partners.\nAmber Clayton, senior director of Knowledge Center Operations at the Society for Human Resource Management noted that surveys have shown most companies do not impose a mandatory requirement for their CEOs. In fact, some companies that still have them may be reconsidering their policy since CEOs are staying in their jobs longer and boards are less likely to want to replace a CEO if the business is doing well. Experts also believe that boards also are looking for stability at a time of volatility.\nUnder Cornell\u2019s leadership, the Minneapolis-based chain had been accelerating its online services such as curbside pickup and same-day services while sprucing up its stores well before the pandemic. During the height of the health crisis, Target became a lifeline to millions of people trying to limit their exposure during the pandemic.\nThe company has also been out front with its investment with workers. It raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour in 2020, a commitment it pledged in 2017 and well ahead of many grocery rivals. Earlier this year, Target adopted minimum wages that range from $15 to $24 an hour, with the highest pay going to hires in the most competitive markets.\nBefore joining Target, Cornell spent more than 30 years in leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies, including as chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. and CEO at Michaels, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club and PepsiCo Americas Foods.\nThe company also announced Wednesday that Arthur Valdez, executive vice president and chief supply chain and logistics officer, will retire. Valdez will be succeeded by Gretchen McCarthy, senior vice president, global inventory management.\nShares of Target rose nearly 5%, or $7.83 to $171.41 in afternoon trading on Wednesday."

      "text": "Tariffs aren\u2019t keeping Walmart from attracting shoppers and outpacing Target\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Walmart Inc. powered through an uncertain economic environment and tariff concerns to deliver solid second-quarter financial results Thursday, showing it keeps pulling in shoppers and outpacing peers like Target.\nThe nation\u2019s largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales \u2014 those coming from established stores and online channels. Company executives said Walmart was attracting customers, particularly higher-income shoppers who may have avoided its stores in the past, with fast deliveries, grocery discounts and trendier clothes.\nThe company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also raised its annual profit and sales outlook.\nWalmart\u2019s results differed notably from those of rival Target, which on Wednesday reported another quarter of comparable sales declines. The Minneapolis-based company has struggled to find its footing as customers defect to Walmart and other stores where they think they will find greater bargains and increasingly, the same or better merchandise.\nTarget\u2019s board of directors named a 20-year company veteran on Wednesday to succeed CEO Brian Cornell when he steps down after 11 years in early 2026.\nWalmart said its profitable e-commerce operations, advertising revenue and selection of products with high profit margins have given it flexibility to absorb extra costs from the range of tariffs President Donald Trump has put on foreign products.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that the impact of tariffs also has been gradual enough to mute changes in consumer spending behavior. When the discounter raised prices on certain items, it\u2019s observed lower- and middle-income customers trading down to lower-priced options or foregoing purchases, he said.\nThe company will continue to see its costs increase as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels, McMillion said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we said we would do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.\u201d\nA growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.\nNone of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation\u2019s auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.\nSome of that spending may have been shoppers buying furniture and other imported items to get ahead of expected price increases, analysts said.\nOn Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot\u2019s performance missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nThe Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Home Depot reported comparable sales increase of 1.4% in line with what home improvement rival Lowe\u2019s reported on Wednesday.\nBut it\u2019s Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.\nWalmart said in May that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.\nThe company said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.\nSales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion. Walmart\u2019s 4.6% growth in U.S. comparable sales during the second quarter was slightly higher than its first-quarter gain of 4.5%. Groceries and health and wellness items fueled the growth, the company said.\nGlobal e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the first quarter.\nThe retailer said roughly one-third of deliveries from its U.S. stores in recent weeks were orders requesting delivery in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.\nDespite Walmart\u2019s solid quarter, its stock price was down 5% in early afternoon trading as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.\nPer share results, excluding effects of charges related to certain legal matters and from business restructuring, was 68 cents, Walmart said.\nOne $450 million expense was tied to settlements over worker and shopper injury claims, Walmart said. A company spokesperson said the cost per claim was increasing but not the total number.\nFor the year, Walmart raised its per-share estimates to a range of $2.52 to $2.62, up from a previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60. It said 2025 sales are anticipated to increase 3.75% to 4.75%, more than it projected in May."

The Forward Founders program builds off Target\u2019s accelerator program that helps entrepreneurs.\nTarget and other corporations have been expanding ties with Black-owned suppliers, rethinking marketing and embracing other initiatives in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd last summer that led to protests nationwide against policy brutality and racial inequity.\nThe trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, charged in Floyd\u2019s death, continued Wednesday in Minneapolis.\nMore than 20 companies, including Sephora, Gap and Macy\u2019s, have signed on to a nationwide campaign called 15 Percent Pledge, which aims to have companies commit to at least 15% of their products on their shelves to Black-owned businesses \u2014 in line with the U.S. Black population. Target\u2019s commitment is unaffiliated with that campaign.\nAurora James, founder and creative director of Brother Vellies, started 15 Percent Pledge as a nonprofit advocacy group last year. She said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the biggest problem for Black-opened businesses is lack of access. James says her group is building a data base of Black-owned businesses that helps retailers and brands connect with Black entrepreneurs.\nKendra Bracken-Ferguson is a Black digital marketing and brand development specialist in beauty and wellness. She has experience first-hand pitching Black-owned brands to Target and other stores. She believes the spending commitment at Target will make a difference.\n\u201cUltimately, Target is creating the pipeline that will fundamentally change how retailers must handle new brands coming into their stores,\u201d Bracken-Ferguson said.\nBut Jeffrey Robinson, associate professor and academic director of The Center for Urban Entrepreneurship & Economic Development at Rutgers Business School said Target has the right approach, but the number feels \u201clow\u201d given the size of the retailer. For the fiscal year that ended Jan. 30, Target generated annual sales of $93.5 billion.\n\u201cI applaud them for making the commitment, but let\u2019s see if they can exceed it,\u201d he said.\nTarget said it has actively pursued more connections with minority-owned businesses, but is always seeking to improve operations.\n\u201cWe have a rich history of working with diverse businesses, but there\u2019s more we can do to spark change across the retail industry, support the Black community and ensure Black guests feel welcomed and represented when they shop at Target,\u201d said Christina Hennington, executive vice president and chief growth officer, in a prepared statement.\n_______\nFollow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"

      "text": "Founders of Black-owned brands adapt their hopes and business plans for a post-DEI era\nFounders of Black-owned brands adapt their hopes and business plans for a post-DEI era\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The co-founders of a company that makes lip products for darker skin tones no longer hope to get their line into Target. A brother and sister who make jigsaw puzzles celebrating Black subjects wonder if they need to offer \u201cneutral\u201d images like landscapes to keep growing.\nPound Cake and Puzzles of Color are among the small businesses whose owners are rethinking their plans as major U.S. companies weaken their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The initiatives mostly date from the end President Donald Trump\u2019s first term and entered a new era with the dawn of his second one.\nSome Black-owned brands suspect big retail chains will drop partnerships they pursued after the police killing of a Black man in 2020 reignited mass protests against racial injustice. In today\u2019s anti-DEI climate, other entrepreneurs worry about personal repercussions or feel pressure to cancel contracts with retreating retailers.\n\u201cIt becomes a question of, are the big box stores going to be there? Do we even make any attempt to talk to these people?\u201d Ericka Chambers, one of the siblings behind Puzzles of Color, said. \u201cWe are really having to evaluate our strategy in how we expand and how we want to get in front of new customers.\u201d\nA fighting chance for Black-owned brands\nChambers and her brother, William Jones, started turning the work of artists of color into frameable puzzles the same year a video captured a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck. Amid the Black Lives Matter protests over Floyd\u2019s death, a fashion designer challenged large retailers to devote 15% of their shelf space and purchasing power to Black businesses.\nThe Fifteen Percent Pledge helped bring Puzzles of Color\u2019s creations to Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom\u2019s websites in 2022. Last year, they made it into select Barnes & Noble stores. Chambers said she\u2019s confident in the companies\u2019 commitments but recalled a backlash after news outlets covered the brand, which is based in Texas.\n\u201cIt does make us think about how we envision ourselves as far as the safety of not wanting to be attacked, because some people are very vocal about being anti-DEI,\u201d Chambers said.\nVibrant depictions of Black women account for many of her and Jones\u2019 puzzles. The pair figured they needed to provide more abstract designs for certain Barnes & Noble locations to give Puzzles of Color \u201ca little bit of a fighting chance.\u201d\nDiscontent over corporate diversity\nThe first prominent names in U.S. retail to end or retool their diversity programs surfaced last summer amid threats of legal challenges and negative publicity from DEI critics, who argue that setting hiring, promotion and supplier diversity goals for underrepresented groups constitutes reverse discrimination.\nAfter Trump won a second term in November, Walmart joined the corporate pullback. Target\u2019s suspension of its comparable DEI targets in January stung Black and LGBTQ+ customers harder, largely because they regarded the Minneapolis-based company as more of a natural ally.\nThe company said it would continue working with a diverse range of businesses. Philadelphia-based Pound Cake\u2019s co-founders, Camille Bell and Johnny Velazquez, said they don\u2019t think they would agree at this point if the retailer offered to stock their lipsticks and lip oils.\n\u201cTarget would have been a great boost to our business\u2019s growth,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find it elsewhere.\u201d\nTo boycott or not?\nTarget\u2019s stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores.\nThe retailer\u2019s DEI program \u201callowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,\u201d Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target.\nShe and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases to items from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target.\n\u201cThe conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they\u2019re in, is unrealistic,\u201d Powell said this month as a 40-day, church-organized Target boycott was underway. \u201cWe signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.\u201d\nNavigating the post-DEI landscape\nThe owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn\u2019t intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them.\nPanda says he isn\u2019t worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What\u2019s more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said.\n\u201cMy money has never really come from mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.\u201d\nBrianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said.\n\u201cA lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,\u201d she said.\nMoodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. In the current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand\u2019s presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers.\n\u201cThe resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,\u201d she said.\nAccentuating the positive\nAurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale\u2019s, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap.\nUlta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,\u201d Velazquez said.\nWhile making a strategic decision \u201cto appeal to a broader audience\u201d when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain\u2019s bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces.\nIn the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its \u201cPride\u201d collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories.\n\u201cDo we lean in all the way?\u201d Chambers asks herself. \u201cPart of why we started this was because we didn\u2019t see enough Black people in puzzles.\u201d"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 16 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.\nThe day\u2019s action centered again around stocks caught up in the mania around artificial-intelligence technology.\nNvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world\u2019s move into AI, sank as much as 3.9% during the morning and was on track to be the heaviest weight on Wall Street following its 3.5% fall on Tuesday.\nBut it clawed back nearly all of Wednesday\u2019s drop and finished with a dip of just 0.1%. As it pared its loss, so did broad market indexes because Nvidia is Wall Street\u2019s most influential stock by being its most valuable.\nPalantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 1.1% to add to its 9.4% loss from the day before, but it had been down as much as 9.8% Wednesday morning.\nWall Street is lower, dragged down by leading artificial intelligence stocks, including Nvidia and Palantir. We hear more from AP\u2019s Seth Sutel.\nOne possible contributor to the swoon was a study from MIT\u2019s Nanda Initiative that warned that most corporations are not yet seeing any measurable return from their generative AI investments, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nBut the larger factor may be the simple criticism that prices for such stock simply shot too high, too fast amid the furor around AI and became too expensive. Nvidia, whose profit report scheduled for next week is one of Wall Street\u2019s next major events, had soared 35.5% for the year so far heading into Tuesday. Palantir had surged even more, more than doubling.\nThe tech stocks still have supporters, though, who say AI will bring the next generational revolution in business.\nMixed profit reports from big U.S. retailers helped keep the rest of the market in check.\nTJX, the company behind the TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores, climbed 2.7% after beating analysts\u2019 forecasts for profit and revenue. It also raised its forecast for profit over its full fiscal year, while CEO Ernie Herrman said TJX is seeing \u201cstrong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses\u201d and that its current quarter is off to a strong start.\nLowe\u2019s added 0.3% after the home-improvement retailer delivered a profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts\u2019 expectations.\nTarget, meanwhile, tumbled 6.3%. The struggling retailer said that CEO Brian Cornell plans to step down Feb. 1 and that an insider, 20-year veteran Michael Fiddelke, will replace him. He helped reenergize the company, but it has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive post-COVID retail landscape.\nEstee Lauder dropped 3.7% after offering a forecast for profit this upcoming fiscal year that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. The beauty company said it expects tariffs to shave roughly $100 million off its upcoming earnings.\nLa-Z-Boy sank 12.1% after the furniture maker\u2019s profit and revenue for the spring came up shy of analysts\u2019 expectations.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 15.59 points to 6,395.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 16.04 to 44,938.31, and the Nasdaq composite fell 142.10 to 21,172.86.\nThe week\u2019s biggest news for Wall Street is likely arriving on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give a highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The hope on Wall Street is that Powell will hint that cuts to interest rates are coming soon.\nThe Fed has kept its main interest rate steady this year, primarily because of the fear of the possibility that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could push inflation higher. But a surprisingly weak report on job growth across the country may be superseding that.\nTreasury yields have come down sharply on expectations for an easing of interest rates, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.30% late Tuesday.\nTrump has been angrily calling for lower interest rates, often insulting Powell personally while doing so. Trump on Wednesday called on a top official at the Federal Reserve, Lisa Cook, to resign after a member of his administration accused her of committing mortgage fraud.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia.\nLondon\u2019s FTSE 100 rose 1.1% despite a report that said inflation in the U.K. rose more than expected through July, in part due to soaring airfares and food prices.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.2%. Shares that trade there of Chinese toy company Pop Mart International Group soared 12.5% after its CEO said its annual revenue could top $4 billion this year and announced the release of a mini version of its popular Labubu dolls.\n___\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization has encouraged consumers to avoid U.S. retailers that scaled backed their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nSharpton called the meeting with Target CEO Brian Cornell \u201cvery constructive and candid,\u201d according to an update from his National Action Network. Two other NAN representatives, National Board Chair Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson and Senior Advisor Carra Wallace, also attended the meeting at the organization\u2019s New York headquarters.\n\u201cI am going to inform our allies, including Rev.

Other faith leaders endorsed the protest, which started with the beginning of Lent on March 5.\nA National Action Network spokesperson confirmed earlier Thursday that Sharpton, the group\u2019s founder and president, planned to meet Cornell in New York this week. The news was first reported by CNBC.\nA Target spokesperson couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\nTarget is among a slew of companies, including Walmart, Amazon and PepsiCo, that have eliminated policies and programs aimed at bolstering diversity among their employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people.\nAfter returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump moved to end DEI programswithin the federal government. He has warned schools to do the same or risk losing federal money.\nThe National Action Network said Sharpton met on Tuesday with PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta and Steven Williams, the CEO of PepsiCo North America, to \u201cget clarity on its stance on DEI, whether they were shutting down their commitments due to pressure from Trump and right-wing activists, and the path moving forward.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Sharpton gave PepsiCo three weeks to meet with him \u2014 or suffer a boycott \u2014 to discuss reversing the company\u2019s recent move to do away with its DEI initiatives.\nThe National Action Network said Thursday that Sharpton planned to consult the organization\u2019s board members over the Easter holiday \u201cto determine any next steps with Target, PepsiCo, and other companies that have scaled back their DEI programs or pledges.\u201d\nTarget announced on Jan. 24 that it would conclude the DEI goals it had set to increase Black employees\u2019 representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers\u2019 experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. The company also said it planned to stop submitting reports for external diversity surveys.\nIt is also \u201cfurther evaluating our corporate partnerships to ensure they are directly connected to our roadmap for growth,\u201d according to a memo posted on its website.\nA number of other boycotts were launched of retailers that have pulled back on DEI."

  "argos_summary": "Target\u2019s decision to end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals sparked a nationwide boycott that has reportedly cut foot traffic in nearly 2,000 stores and fueled calls for a leadership change, with CEO Brian Cornell set to step down in February 2026 and COO Michael Fiddelke named successor. Civil\u2011rights activists, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jamal Bryant, have organized 40\u2011day fasts and 40\u2011day boycotts, demanding Target restore its DEI commitments and support Black\u2011owned businesses, while some Black\u2011owned brands fear losing shelf space. Despite the backlash, Target has pledged to spend more than $2\u202fbillion at Black\u2011owned businesses by 2025 and has introduced new supplier programs, though analysts note its sales slump may be driven more by operational issues than the DEI pullback. The boycott\u2019s impact remains hard to quantify, but organizers claim it has highlighted the power of consumer pressure on corporate policy, even as Target\u2019s leadership transition and broader retail competition add complexity to the company\u2019s recovery efforts.",
