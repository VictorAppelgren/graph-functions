      "summary": "U.S. tariffs have taken effect, with a 100% levy on semiconductor imports (exempting companies that shift production to the U.S.) and a 39% tariff on Swiss goods, while India’s tariffs doubled to 50%. The news has boosted tech stocks such as TSMC and Samsung, and lifted Asian markets. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is expected to cut rates to its lowest level in two years as it grapples with a slowing economy and sticky inflation.",
