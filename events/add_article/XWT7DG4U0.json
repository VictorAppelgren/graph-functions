      "summary": "Boeing’s commercial airplane business is regaining momentum, with 737 MAX production hitting its target of 38 planes per month and plans to increase to 42. The defense arm, now led by Steve Parker, has returned to profitability after a leadership change, bolstering the company’s $619 billion backlog. Despite these operational gains, the Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor does not list Boeing among its top 10 picks, suggesting investors should weigh the company’s recovery against broader market opportunities.",
