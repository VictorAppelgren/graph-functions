      "feedback": "Overall, the analysis covers the macro regime-to-stock transmission well but is too sprawling and repetitive for a crisp executive brief; to reach world-class quality, condense to 4–6 sentences/bullets that deliver a single, decision-ready house view with one base-case path, 1–2 clearly defined catalysts, and explicit invalidation checks. Edit plan: (1) collapse the narrative into a single base-case Regime A with a concise causal chain: policy-easing signals drive real-rate differentials lower, dollar under pressure, AI/tech earnings exposure (Tencent; 0G3A676BP; GX057ADL7) buoy risk assets, and spill into ACMR and cloud/AI equities; (2) add 1–2 alternate regimes (e.g., Regime B: stickier inflation/BoJ divergence; Regime C: Congo-mineral/AI-chip shock) with one sentence each on how asset prices and margins would reprice; (3) present a tight 3–4 item stock-read for ACMR plus a 1–2 sentence near-term catalyst and a single explicit invalidation rule (e.g., September rate cut delay beyond Q3 or ACMR missing 2025 revenue midpoints) drawn from the citations; (4) reframe the 0–3 week lens as 2–3 decisive catalysts (Jackson Hole bias, Opendoor/Cash Plus, Lucid governance) with explicit price/volatility implications and a single watch-list; (5) ensure the cloud/AI regime discussion remains tethered to numeric anchors (Azure +39%/368B, Shopify GMV 27%+, etc.) and state how oil/tariff signals would alter those trajectories, all with citations limited to the source IDs (GX057ADL7; 37UZC9X8I; YB758UDBU; H9WSBYP3D; 5JQEA5Z1T; S7M6BJSRT; J99EM2TPZ; 0G3A676BP; 0G3A; 48JXC9VDP; QF; SK994CBWR; C22MKA9VY; Q7VVGNSQE; OPEN; LCID). (6) Tighten numbers to a single base-case range per line and avoid duplicating figures across sections; ensure every numeral has an in-source citation and reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., oil-supply forecasts vs. tariff risk) in a single sentence. (7) Audit for coherence of the causal chain from regimes to asset pricing to stock-specific catalysts, and purge repetition and off-topic digressions, so the final piece reads as a compact, decision-ready 4–6 sentence/bullet house view with a 1–2 sentence optional downside view.",
