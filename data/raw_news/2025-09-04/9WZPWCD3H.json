  "content": "\u2022 The iPhone Fold will reportedly have a 24MP under-display camera\n\u2022 Given that existing leaks suggest the phone will use Touch ID, that means it might have an all-screen design\n\u2022 It's unclear whether one or both screens would have an under-display camera\n\nThe iPhone Fold \u2013 sometimes known as the foldable iPhone \u2013 could be a phone of multiple firsts for Apple, because not only would it be the company\u2019s first foldable phone, but it might also be the first iPhone with an all-screen design.\n\nBy 'all-screen design', we mean a phone with no camera cut-out or notch on the screen. This is something a recent JPMorgan analyst report (seen by 9to5Mac) suggests is a possibility for the iPhone Fold, as it states that the in-development phone will have an under-display 24MP camera.\n\nThat would mean the selfie camera on at least one of the screens would be hidden under the display, as we\u2019ve seen on a handful of Android phones.\n\nOf course, current iPhones also have Face ID components in the display, so hiding just the camera wouldn\u2019t be enough for an all-screen design. But the foldable iPhone is rumored to use Touch ID rather than Face ID, in which case Apple would just need to hide the camera.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether just one or both screens would have an under-display selfie camera, but 9to5Mac predicts that it\u2019s likely Apple would use the same camera for both displays. Even if this is only used for one, though, that could mean at least one screen would be free of cut-outs and notches.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal, as iPhones have long had more interruptions in their displays than the best Android phones, so an all-screen design could be almost as big a selling point as the foldable nature of the phone.\n\nAs ever, though, we\u2019d take this report with a pinch of salt, especially as the iPhone Fold probably won\u2019t launch for another year \u2013 so even if this is Apple\u2019s plan now, it could still change.\n\nIn any case, you won\u2019t have to wait that long for a new iPhone, as the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are all expected to land in less than a week, on September 9.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 When can we expect the iPhone 17 to be released?

  "summary": "The iPhone Fold, or the foldable iPhone, may be the first foldable phone for Apple and possibly the first all-screen design, according to a recent JPMorgan analyst report. The report suggests that the phone will reportedly have a 24MP under-display camera, which could hide the selfie camera from at least one of the screens under the display, similar to other Android phones. However, current iPhones also have Face ID components in the display. It's unclear whether one or both screens would have an under-screen camera, but it is likely Apple would use the same camera for both displays. The all-scalless design could be a significant selling point for Apple, as iPhones have historically had more interruptions in their displays than the best Android phones, making it almost as significant a selling point as a foldable device.",

      "text": "5 ways the iPhone 17 Air could beat the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\n2025 is the year of the slim smartphone, as not long ago we got the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which is a slimmer alternative to the other Samsung Galaxy S25 models, and soon Apple is rumored to be launching the iPhone 17 Air, which is said to be the same for the iPhone 17 series.\nSo far, nothing is known for sure about the iPhone 17 Air, but between leaks and rumors we have a fairly good idea of what to expect, and having fully reviewed the Galaxy S25 Edge we know exactly how that could be improved.\nSo below, you\u2019ll find a list of the five ways the iPhone 17 Air could beat the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Some of these things are more likely to happen than others, but we\u2019ll explain how likely we think they are too.\n1. A slimmer build\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s main selling point is just how slim it is, and from what we\u2019ve heard the same will be true of the iPhone 17 Air. So if Apple\u2019s phone is thinner then that would give it a real advantage over Samsung\u2019s.\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is just 5.8mm thick, but the iPhone 17 Air could have it beat, as while leaks don\u2019t agree on how thick it is, most put it at less than that. We\u2019ve heard 5.65mm, 5.5mm and even 5.44mm, so Apple\u2019s phone could be a sliver slimmer than Samsung\u2019s svelte smartphone.\n2. A lighter weight\nAs well as being slimmer the iPhone 17 Air could also beat the Galaxy S25 Edge by being lighter. After all, there\u2019s an expectation that a slim phone will be light, and if Apple\u2019s rumored handset really launches with the \u2018Air\u2019 moniker then that also has connotations of lightness.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge then weighs 163g, which is pretty light. That\u2019s just 1g heavier than the much smaller Galaxy S25, and far lighter than the 190g Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus \u2013 which has the same size screen as the Edge.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThat also makes the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge a bit lighter than the 170g iPhone 16, and much lighter than the 199g iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro \u2013 let alone the 227g iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nSo Apple might have its work cut out to make the iPhone 17 Air lighter than Samsung\u2019s rival, and so far we haven\u2019t heard much about its weight, but one leak from yeux1122 puts it at approximately 145g, in which case it would indeed be the lighter phone.\n3. Better cameras\nOne area where we\u2019re skeptical that the iPhone 17 Air will beat the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge \u2013 but would still like it to \u2013 is the cameras.\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge has a 200MP wide camera, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 12MP front-facing one. In our Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review we noted that the main sensor can take \u201cfantastic\u201d shots, but that they\u2019re more subdued than usual from a Samsung phone, and that they don\u2019t have as much detail as photos taken by the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nOf course, the Galaxy S25 Edge also lacks a telephoto camera, which is a major omission.\nSo the cameras there are a mixed bag, but reports suggest the iPhone 17 Air will actually only have one rear camera \u2013 most likely a 48MP one, along with a 12MP front-facing camera.\nAs such it\u2019s unlikely that Apple\u2019s phone will win for photography but not impossible \u2013 these rumors could be wrong, or the one rear camera it reportedly has could really excel. We certainly hope it will.\n4. More power\nApple\u2019s phones tend to be more powerful than Samsung\u2019s and that will quite possibly be the case with the iPhone 17 Air, though we can\u2019t be certain yet.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is the best chipset currently available to Android phones. That\u2019s joined by a respectable 12GB of RAM, so this is no slouch when it comes to performance.\nThere\u2019s a bit more of a question mark over how the iPhone 17 Air will perform, especially as tipsters disagree over whether the iPhone 17 Air will have the same chipset as the base iPhone 17 (likely an A19) or the same one as the iPhone 17 Pro series (likely an A19 Pro). The latter will almost certainly have the Snapdragon 8 Elite beat, but the former may not.\nWe\u2019ve also heard conflicting reports on how much RAM the iPhone 17 Air might have, with some pointing to 12GB and others to just 8GB.\n5. A longer lasting battery\nOne thing that slim phones will inevitably struggle with is battery life, as there\u2019s simply not enough space in them for a big battery.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has just a 3,900mAh one, and for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus (which has the same size screen) has a 4,900mAh one.\nThe iPhone 17 Air\u2019s battery might be even smaller than the S25 Edge's, with one rumor putting it at under 3,000mAh. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it won\u2019t last as long, with another source claiming its life will be comparable to current iPhones.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Foldable iPhone: latest rumors, news and everything we know so far\nThe last Apple event came and went without even the smallest of hints at a foldable iPhone. And with the rumors thin on the ground, I'd be skeptical if such a phone is even in the works; it could just be a shelved Apple project.\nAs it stands, our list of best foldable phones is dominated by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and OnePlus Open. So there's room for some iOS-orientated disruption, though when that will happen isn't clear.\nOur best guess is 2025 at the earliest, when Apple can be fairly confident that the foldable phone tech is mature enough for its foray into the arena. Until then, read on for everything we've heard so far and what you need to know about the so-called foldable iPhone.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? Potentially the first folding phone from Apple\n- When is it out? Possibly 2026, or maybe much later\n- How much will it cost? Expect it to be expensive\nFoldable iPhone release date and price\nIt's possible (based on multiple rumors) that the iPhone Fold could land in 2025.\nBut if anything, it might land much later, with a report from October 2018 suggesting Apple might first launch a foldable iPad in late 2024 or early 2025, with a foldable iPhone landing at a later date.\nAnother report back in February 2024 said a September 2026 launch was planned for the foldable iPhone, which would likely see it land alongside the iPhone 18. This report added that Apple was apparently moving much of the Vision Pro team over to development of this phone, and that the company is aiming for sales of 50 million. The 2026 claims have since been backed up by a leaked Apple roadmap too.\nMore recently still, we've heard that the foldable iPhone might be delayed from late 2026 until early 2027, and some analysts now believe the foldable iPhone project might end up getting canceled, so there's a chance we won't see it at all.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnd even more recently, a TrendForce report states that Apple is \"unlikely to release a foldable phone before 2027\", due to the company's \"strict requirements for crease and reliability\".\nSince then, we've heard that while a 2026 launch was previously planned, Apple has accelerated development so that it can launch the foldable iPhone in 2025.\nHowever, the most recent foldable iPhone leaks again point to a 2026 launch. We've heard a 2026 release date multiple times in late 2024 and early 2025, with a leak as recently as June 2025 pointing in that direction, while in July of 2025 we heard that Apple had started making prototypes of the device, with an aim to launch it in the second half of 2026, so that's our best guess for now. That said, Apple is at least apparently close to choosing a display supplier for the phone.\nWhenever it lands, the foldable iPhone probably won't be a one-off, with one report suggesting it will get an annual refresh.\nNaturally, we don't know how much the foldable iPhone might cost if and when it does land, but given that a lot of foldable phones demand well over the $1000 / \u00a31000 / AU$2000 mark, it's safe to expect a high price to pay. One of the few foldable iPhone price leaks we have seen so far points to a figure of $2,500 (which is around \u00a32,220 / AU$3,970), so we'd recommend saving now.\nThat said, a more recent foldable iPhone price leak points to a lower but still high price of $2,000 (around \u00a31,540 / AU$3,175), while a third leak splits the difference, claiming a price of roughly $2,300, and more recently still we've heard the foldable iPhone will cost between $2,100 and $2,500.\nThe latest foldable iPhone price leaks at the time of writing put the foldable iPhone at either $1,800-$2,000 or much more than current foldables, depending on who you believe.\nBut despite the likely high price, this could prove a very successful phone, with reputable analyst Mark Gurman predicting that a foldable iPhone will sell much better than any of the Plus or mini models, or the rumored iPhone 17 Air.\nThat said, analyst Ming-Chi Ku says to expect \"premium pricing\" for the foldable iPhone, and that this could limit its sales.\nAs for the name, we've heard mutterings that it could be called the iPhone Flip, likely referring to the Galaxy Z Flip-like patents we've seen that hint at a clamshell folding format. In truth, though, it could be called anything.\nFoldable iPhone leaks and rumors\nAt this point, foldable iPhone rumors fall broadly into two camps: those which suggest the device will have a true folding display, and others that point towards it having two distinct screens separated by a hinge.\nSeveral designs were revealed in a patent dump back in February 2019, some with a large display on the inside of folding sections with a single hinge, while another had two hinges for a hypothetical three displays that fold in on themselves in a Z-shaped formation.\nThis design shows how an iPhone could look when folded.\nThese two designs show possible ways the screen could store in the body of the device when folded.\nThis design shows what a device would look like when folded into three sections.\nOther patents, like the one discovered in March 2020, reveal that Apple could be working on a foldable with two distinct displays separated by a hinge. While the patented design suggests the tech giant would attempt to minimize the bezel between the screens as much as possible, it would still be more noticeable than a truly folding long display.\nThat\u2019s what leaker Jon Prosser suggested on Twitter in the same year: Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone design (at the time) had two separate display panels on a hinge.\nWhile it\u2019s purportedly just a \u2018current prototype\u2019 and not a final design, it\u2019s described as having rounded edges like the iPhone 11, unlike the squared-off edges on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 ranges.\nThere\u2019s also no notch for front-facing cameras: the sensors checking Face ID will be housed in a \u2018tiny forehead\u2019 on the outer display, according to Prosser.\nThis matches a later Prosser leak that suggested the iPhone Flip may come in a clamshell shape \u2013 similar to the Motorola Razr 2020 or the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip \u2013 and the same source said it'd be sold in \"fun colors.\"\nWe think that means you can expect some bold shades for the iPhone Flip when it lands.\nWe've seen another image of what the foldable iPhone could look like thanks to another patent, this one showing a device that folds out into a bigger device like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5. This device, which we're dubbing the iPhone Fold, has one display that's longer than the other, so when it's folded shut you can see your notifications to one edge.\nA separate leak suggests this folding iPhone could come with Apple Pencil support, and have a display measuring 7.3-inch or 7.6-inches across.\nIndeed, we've more recently heard that Apple's first foldable may have a screen of roughly 7-8 inches, which likely means it would be a book-style foldable.\nMore recently, another source claimed the foldable iPhone could have a 7.9-inch screen and that the foldable display could be on the outside of the phone, like the Huawei Mate Xs 2 pictured below. This would mean there's only one display, but it can be used either like a phone or a tablet depending on whether it's folded or unfolded.\nIn January of 2025 we similarly heard that the foldable iPhone could have a main display of between 7.6 and 7.9 inches, along with a surprisingly small 5.3-5.5-inch cover screen. This leak adds that it will have a wider aspect ratio than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, and that it will use LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide), likely meaning a 120Hz refresh rate.\nElsewhere, we heard that the foldable iPhone might have a foldable display of over 12 inches, which sounds unusually large. They also stated that the phone would be 9.2mm thick when folded, and just 4.6mm thick when unfolded (though a more recent foldable iPhone leak puts it at 4.8mm). The same source as the 4.6mm claim also points to a 5,000mAh battery, and a dual-lens rear camera, with an ultra-wide snapper but no telephoto.\nMore recently still (in February of 2025) we heard that the foldable iPhone could have 7.74-inch and 5.49-inch screens. We heard a similar claim in March, with TrendForce claiming the foldable iPhone will have a 7.8-inch foldable screen and a 5.5-inch cover display, which are sizes we've also previously heard from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, so they may well be accurate.\nDigital Chat Station has since added that the foldable screen will have a resolution of 1,920 x 2,713 and the cover screen will have a resolution of 1,422 x 2,088. They also claim that the foldable screen will have an under-display camera but that the foldable iPhone won't have Face ID.\nAnd they've said to expect the two rear cameras to both be 48MP, the foldable screen to be 7.58 inches, and the construction to include \"a hinge made of a more durable amorphous metal glass composite, and a titanium alloy body.\"\nThat claim of an under-display camera and no Face ID for the iPhone Fold has since been made by another source too, so this at least may well be the case. We've now heard that a third time in fact, with the latest of these leaks adding that it will apparently have a 24MP under-display camera.\nWe've also heard from another source that this screen might be thinner and lighter than existing foldable phone displays, as well as delivering higher brightness and better color accuracy.\nBeyond the size and resolution of the screen, we've also heard that the foldable iPhone's display might have a near invisible crease.\nWe've also heard from an analyst that Apple is testing an Electronic Paper Display (EPD) from E Ink for the cover screen of a foldable phone. This would be like an e-reader screen, but in color, and could be left on for long periods without draining much battery.\nApple's foldable phone might also have a protective layer on top of the screen that can defend against cracks and fill in pre-existing micro-cracks, to help avoid fractures. Apple has a patent for this tech, so it's certainly something the company is toying with, at least.\nElsewhere, an Apple patent details a slim yet strong hinge that could be used with a smartphone with a flexible display. This doesn't tell us much but it's more evidence that an iPhone Fold or iPhone Flip might be in the works. On a related note, we've heard the foldable iPhone could have a liquid metal hinge for better durability, with another source adding that the hinge will be higher quality than on other phones.\nPlus, one report also suggests that Apple has two foldable iPhone designs that have already passed durability tests. That doesn't mean this will be happening any sooner, but it's a good sign that Apple is on the right track.\nAnother Apple patent we've seen details touch-sensitive, solid-state buttons that would allow users to navigate a foldable iPhone using its edges, rather than its display alone. Alongside basic illustrations of the device (below), Apple explains how touch sensors would sit within \u201csidewalls\u201d (as opposed to conventional walls) made up of \u201cthin metal lines that are sufficiently small to be invisible to the eye.\"\nBeyond the design and display, we've heard that the foldable iPhone might have a dual-lens camera, Touch ID, and an ultra-thin battery. Despite that, the foldable iPhone could offer all-day battery life, with Apple apparently making its battery longevity a priority. We've now specifically heard that the foldable iPhone's battery might be 5,000-5,500mAh.\nAnother foldable iPhone leak has also pointed to Touch ID, adding that the foldable iPhone will apparently have two cameras on the back and one on each screen, that it will be available in black and white shades, and that it will use Apple's C2 modem.\nAnd beyond all the leaks, we've also now seen essentially a prototype iPhone Flip made unofficially by a team in China. You can see some images of this below.\nThere were a lot of compromises involved in making it, but if Apple's foldable is similar in design to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip line, then it could look like a much more polished version of this.\niPhone Flip: 5 things we\u2019d like to see\n1. Top-tier cameras\nFoldables bridge the gap between phones and tablets, but the ones we\u2019ve seen released, like the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate Xs, have packed the best cameras featured on those brands\u2019 other flagship phones.\nWhile there\u2019s no reason to guess Apple wouldn\u2019t do the same, the tech giant hasn\u2019t bothered to upgrade the cameras on its iPads in generations. What's more, given that the iPhone SE 2020 didn\u2019t improve upon the lens of its predecessor, the iPhone 8, Apple set a precedent that could see it give its foldable iPhone a single camera instead of the full suite seen in today's best iPhones.\n2. Apple Pencil support\nOne way Apple could easily match other foldables: introduce Apple Pencil support. Samsung introduced stylus integration with its Z Fold series, and given how the Apple Pencil 2 attaches magnetically to the newest iPad Pro tablets, we\u2019d love to see how Apple\u2019s styluses could be integrated with its foldable iPhone.\n3. The old Apple polish\nYes, we'll say it: even though the first few rounds of foldables have been impressive for simply pulling off folding screens, they\u2019ve come with design weaknesses, from hinge issues to cracking screens. We\u2019d love to see a design that makes everything move smoothly and stand up to punishment.\nNot that Apple\u2019s lineup is unimpeachable, as crackable iPhone displays, malfunctioning butterfly keyboards, and battery-throttling on older iPhones have shown. But in looks and function, at least, Apple has maintained a reputation for sleek and functional design.\n4. iPadOS integration\nWhen iPadOS split off from iOS, we got excited for the possibilities of a new operating system forking off to truly take advantage of iPad screen real estate. Thus far, we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with the multitasking features that let us pull up multiple apps at the same time, which we\u2019ve found personally handy in writing in Google docs while looking up stuff in Safari, for instance..\nWe\u2019d love to see a version of the OS in the foldable iPhone for the same reasons, though of course, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns. Will the device\u2019s display be large enough to properly handle the iPadOS controls? If it expands to 7.9 inches, the size of the iPad Mini\u2019s screen, it conceivably could be able to, but until we know what the foldable will look like, it\u2019s unclear how good a fit iPadOS will be.\n5. Strong battery life\nFoldable phones like the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X have had respectable battery life for first-generation devices, but we\u2019d like more in Apple\u2019s take on foldable phones. iPhones in general aren\u2019t known for lasting longer than a day, and flagships from Samsung and Huawei pack larger-capacity (in sheer milliamp Hours) batteries that seem to take them past the one-day mark handily.\nWe\u2019d like Apple to use the extra device space to keep its own foldable last longer than the competition.\nAxel is TechRadar's Phones Editor, reporting on everything from the latest Apple developments to newest AI breakthroughs as part of the site's Mobile Computing vertical.

      "text": "5 ways the iPhone 17 Pro can (and should) beat the iPhone 16 Pro\nThe iPhone 17 Pro looks to be a substantial upgrade\nThe iPhone 17 Pro is almost here, as Apple has sent out invites for an event on September 9 where we\u2019re sure to see it.\nBut as usual we already have a good idea of what to expect, as dozens of claimed leaks and rumors have emerged over the last few months.\nThese rumors point to a phone that should be a major upgrade over the iPhone 16 Pro, so below, we\u2019ve detailed five ways that the iPhone 17 Pro is likely to have its predecessor bettered.\n1. Upgraded cameras\nIt seems the cameras might be a big focus for Apple this year, as multiple rumors have suggested the iPhone 17 Pro could have a 48-megapixel telephoto camera.\nThat would be a big jump from the 12MP telephoto snapper on the current model, and would mean all three rear cameras would be 48MP (as the iPhone 16 Pro's 48MP main and ultra-wide snappers reportedly won\u2019t be changed).\nMultiple sources have also pointed to a 24MP front-facing camera, which would again be up from 12MP currently. So no lenses might feel lacking for megapixels on the iPhone 17 Pro.\nOn top of that, there\u2019s also a chance the iPhone 17 Pro could have a mechanical aperture, allowing you to adjust the aperture and depth of field, as well as support for 8K video recording (up from 4K on the current model).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe\u2019re less sure these two things will feature as they haven\u2019t been tipped by as many sources, but even if we just get the extra megapixels, that could make for a notable improvement.\n2. Even more power\nEvery new Pro iPhone model comes with a new, more powerful chipset than the one before, and the iPhone 17 Pro is unlikely to be an exception, with numerous leaks pointing to an A19 Pro chipset.\nThat would be up from an A18 Pro chipset in the iPhone 16 Pro, and while we don\u2019t know how much better the new chipset will be, it\u2019s sure to lead to even smoother, faster performance \u2013 which is impressive given that the iPhone 16 Pro is still one of the most powerful phones you can buy.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro might also have 12GB of RAM, which would give it 4GB more than the iPhone 16 Pro, and should further improve its performance.\n3. A new design\nThe most immediately obvious upgrade \u2013 or at least change \u2013 with the iPhone 17 Pro could be its design, as the consensus among leakers is that this phone will be getting a whole new look.\nMost of the changes will likely be to the back of the phone, which will reportedly have a large camera block running horizontally across it, for a design that could be somewhat reminiscent of the Google Pixel 10, albeit with the camera block here probably being even bigger.\nWe imagine not everyone will love this look, but it should certainly freshen up a handset that could otherwise risk looking a bit stale.\n4. Reverse wireless charging\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the iPhone 17 Pro will have a bigger battery than the iPhone 16 Pro, but either way it might have a new charging trick, as multiple sources have claimed that Apple is testing the phone with reverse wireless charging.\nThat would let you use the handset as a wireless charging pad, so you could place \u2013 for example \u2013 your AirPods or Apple Watch on the back, and have them charge up, while draining some amount of the phone\u2019s (much larger) battery.\nThat said, just because Apple has apparently tested a feature, that doesn\u2019t mean it will launch, so we\u2019re unsure whether reverse wireless charging will actually be included or not.\n5. A vapor chamber\nFinally, the iPhone 17 Pro could also have a vapor chamber, which could help keep the phone cool when it\u2019s carrying out demanding tasks, like running high-end mobile games.\nBy keeping it cooler, the phone would also be able to sustain its peak performance for longer, and this could additionally give the battery life a boost, even if the iPhone 17 Pro doesn\u2019t have a bigger battery than the iPhone 16 Pro.\nCombined with a new chipset and more RAM, a vapor chamber could make this phone feel substantially speedier than the already-fast iPhone 16 Pro.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

We've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best Android phone\n1. OnePlus 13\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe OnePlus 13 is a phone that can do almost nothing wrong. It tops our charts in performance with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It's also the best phone for battery life, thanks to the gigantic 6,000 mAh battery inside. It helps that you can charge it faster than almost any other phone, even if you're charging wirelessly. It's simply an astonishing phone all around, and it's easily our favorite Android phone.\nIn my review, I noted that every complaint I've had about OnePlus has magically become one of the great strengths of the OnePlus 13. I used to complain that OnePlus phones weren't water resistant, and now the OnePlus 13 is IP69 rated. I watched OnePlus reps wash the phone in a dishwashing machine, including the heat cycle. It's a very durable phone.\nI complain about a lack of wireless charging, and now OnePlus offers 50W wireless AirVOOC charging. A OnePlus 13 can charge wirelessly faster than a wired iPhone. But that doesn't matter, because the battery can easily last for two days.\nI like everything about this phone. I even like the cases that OnePlus sells, because they have magnets that line up my OnePlus 13 perfectly with all my MagSafe accessories. If you're considering a switch from the iPhone, or have friends who might need a push, this is the phone to push them.\nRead our full OnePlus 13 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Don\u2019t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help. You just can\u2019t get one at the Verizon store (try Best Buy). | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A more professional look and an incredible feel with the new vegan microfiber. Every color is unique and outstanding, but the blue is the one to get, and definitely get a OnePlus case. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best display on any smartphone in terms of color, and it also looks great with the curving edges sloping down to the frame. It could be brighter, but it\u2019s a winner. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | The best Android interface software, but I wish there was more to take advantage of all that power. Eventually AI may come along, but for now OnePlus isn\u2019t pushing AI tools too hard. This phone is refreshing to use all around. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | The best cameras for action photos, even at night, and great pics all around. It does more with 3x zoom than some phones managed with 10x zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone, according to our benchmarks. In the real world, it was harder to find the fast lane, but the interface was incredibly snappy and responsive. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | The longest battery life, thanks to a larger battery and the efficient Snapdragon processor, though OnePlus has managed to fit more battery inside without making the phone thicker. Oh, and it charges stupidly fast. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best Android AI\n2. Google Pixel 9 Pro & Pixel 9 Pro XL\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Xl introduced a fresh design to the Pixel, with a sleek camera pill that replaces the bar. Despite this makeover, I still enjoyed using these phones with their signature Pixel strengths: innovative AI, impressive cameras, and a vibrant display that outshines the competition in brightness and color.\nGoogle continues its display reign with the Pixel 9 Pro's Super Actua screen, which I found to be exceptionally bright, and I appreciated the adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate. This display is truly great, even in bright sunlight, making it ideal for outdoor photography.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro delivers fantastic photos and AI-enhanced video with Video Boost, though I found the camera controls to be a bit fidgety. It produced some of the best photos among all of the best camera phones I've tested, and it's probably my second-favorite camera after the iPhone 16 Pro family. Google Photos AI editing beats the current state of iPhone Photos editing by a wide margin.\nIf you want the most advanced smartphone AI, you need to get the Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL, because Google keeps some of its best features exclusive to these phones. You can Circle to Search on any new Android, but if you want an AI to screen your spam calls, you need a Pixel.\nEven features that are on most Android phones, like the recording app that transcribes for you, worked much better on the Pixel 9 Pro in my tests than on competing phones. For everything AI now and into the future, the Pixel 9 Pro is my top choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro review and our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best Android camera\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nYou won't find a phone that does more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but where this phone really pulls away from the pack is in its camera capabilities. If it only had the big 200MP sensor and maybe a single zoom lens, that would be a great camera phone, but the Ultra does more. So. Much. More.\nIn addition to the big sensor, the S25 Ultra offers a 5X optical zoom, as well as a new and improved 50MP sensor for the ultra-wide camera, which should make for great detail on macro shots. Whether you're shooting for the moon or just taking shots of your kids on the field, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is up to the task.\nIn fact, it's up to every task, because it has such an extensive array of lenses. The 5X zoom uses a 50MP sensor, but there is also a 3X zoom lens that uses its own 10MP sensor. Then there's that 50MP sensor for ultra wide shots and super steady videos.\nSamsung isn't letting Google have all the fun with AI editing features, but Samsung also builds AI directly into the camera app. The camera will try to recognize the scene and optimize accordingly. It isn't just the moon that looks better, you'll notice that food shots, monuments, portraits, and tons of other scenes look great when you shoot them with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best premium Android\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus is the upstart middle child of the Galaxy S family. It's a big step up from the Galaxy S25 in all the right ways. Plus, it has all the top performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, without all the features you don't need. It's the top Samsung phone for battery life, and one of the longest-lasting phones I've every tested.\nDo you really need a pen with your phone? The Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly feature-packed, but most people don't need that much. The Ultra is a bigger, heavier, and more expensive phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, without much added benefit.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus has the same sharp display resolution as the S25 Ultra, and the screen is only a hair smaller. It has the same processor and RAM, and it starts with 256GB, twice the storage of the Galaxy S25.\nThe camera specs come close to matching the iPhone 16 Pro, but fall a bit short of the Ultra. That's fine, because it's Samsung's shooting modes and Galaxy AI software that make its camera great, not the specs. The Galaxy S25 Plus is a winner any way you look at it, and if you really need more, the Ultra is next on the list.\nLooking to save money on a Samsung product? Check out our Samsung coupon codes for the latest deals on top-rated tech and gadgets.\nValue | Worth the premium over the Galaxy S25, with a display and battery life that beat the more expensive Ultra. Still expensive, but worth the high price. | 4/5 |\nDesign | A solid, refined look that hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, and strongly resembles its biggest rival. I\u2019m ready for something new, but this design is a classic, with good color options this year. | 3/5 |\nDisplay | A fantastic display that\u2019s bright and colorful, making it easy to use in any situation, even taking photos in bright sunshine. I only wish the fingerprint scanner were more responsive, but it\u2019s still a great screen with minimal bezels. | 5/5 |\nSoftware | Samsung has improved One UI with a refreshed look and brighter colors. The bloatware problem is growing, though, and many of the Galaxy AI features mentioned at launch don\u2019t show up on the phone. | 3/5 |\nCameras | Takes good photos, but you can find much better cameras on competing phones, with bigger sensors and more pixels. It\u2019s time for an Ultra-fied camera upgrade for the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but what will you do with all that power? This Snapdragon wins benchmark tests, but in real-world performance it\u2019s less apparent. Still, it\u2019s the fastest phone around, even if you can\u2019t see it. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life, topping even the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the OnePlus 13 is far more impressive, with longer battery life and much faster charging. It\u2019s time for Samsung to catch up if it wants to remain at the top. | 4/5 |\nThe best Android for everybody\n5. Google Pixel 9\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 is a delightful phone and the easiest Android phone for me to recommend to everybody, especially folks who say 'I just want a phone that works.' The Pixel 9 arrives in Google's striking new Pixel look, with even better color options than the Pro model (hey, Peony!). It takes photos that could be mistaken for Pro, and it has the same Google Tensor G4 processor inside.\nThe biggest difference between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro isn't the zoom camera on the Pro. The Pixel 9 takes great photos that are even better for sharing, since the phone keeps things to a scant 12MP. Videos also look great. The color quality on the photos I took with the Pixel 9 was excellent, and nearly identical to my Pixel 9 Pro shots.\nThe big difference is the year of premium AI that you'll get with the Pixel 9 Pro. That originally meant no Gemini Live for the Pixel 9 (unless you pay up), but Google has made its conversational AI available on every Pixel 9 device for free, so that's not a problem any more.\nGoogle also updated this phone with Android 15, making it one of the first Android phones to get the new system, as it should be. This phone has seven years of updates ahead, presumably taking us to Android 21, so it could get even better with time.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Not a bad price considering all the Pixel 9 Pro features you get, but with its free year of advanced AI, maybe you should just get the Pro instead. Hopefully discounts will come soon. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | The biggest Pixel redesign in years gives us cool new colors, a sleek and modern camera bar, and the most durable Pixel yet. It\u2019s twice as durable as the Pixel 8, but still looks fancy. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | An excellent display is a standout feature on every Pixel, this one is super bright and colorful. The Pro is more versatile, but you can\u2019t tell \u2026 can you? | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | New AI features take some getting used to, and some need to prove their worth, like the fascinating Screenshots app. But if you want the most advanced AI, get a Pixel 9 Pro with its year of free Gemini Advanced and Gemini Live. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Great camera performance looks almost exactly like the Pixel 9 Pro, without the high-resolution files and stuffy Pro controls. You won\u2019t get telephoto zoom, but you will get some of the best pics any smartphone can take, plus the new AI Add Me feature. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The Tensor G4 chipset has fallen far behind rivals and performance is lagging. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019ll notice the drag if you try to run a lot of apps at once and then ask the AI a question. Or do anything with the AI. The AI is slow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Great battery life, especially on a smaller phone. I wish it charged faster (or as fast as Google made it seem), but the Pixel 9 battery beats the iPhone 15 by hours and had no trouble lasting all day in the real world. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best budget Android\n6. Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nThe Pixel 9a is the clear value leader among Android phones. It's an easy recommendation if you want a dependable, uncomplicated Android phone that handles the basics very well. If you need an affordable device that will last for years and, the Pixel 9a is a strong contender.\nI wasn't the biggest fan of the new Pixel 9a design, but there's no denying this is a new Pixel phone, through and through. Helpful features such as AI call screening and superior voice recording transcription proved extremely convenient during my in-depth review time with the Pixel 9a.\nGoogle commits to providing seven full years of significant Android OS and security updates. This offers exceptional software support and ensures longevity rarely seen at this price level. Apple and Samsung won't match that commitment with phones this cheap.\nThe Pixel 9a camera performs particularly well. Colors are accurate. Its most impressive aspect is the highly capable new macro photography feature. The resulting close-up detail truly rivals more expensive phone cameras, and maybe even DSLR cameras.\nUltimately, if you want excellent value, a great camera (with standout macro), useful AI, and lengthy software support, and you can accept owning what might be the least visually appealing Pixel design to date, the Pixel 9a stands out as the best budget choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9a review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates. The cameras are among the best in this price range, even if the look isn\u2019t so premium. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s durable, and the colors are real nice. Otherwise, it\u2019s ugly as sin. Seriously, Google had a winning A-series formula that it ruined when it created this phone. But the design doesn\u2019t get in the way, at least. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | Excellent display that's bright and colorful, better than most phones at this price. Some trouble with Adaptive mode was easily fixed. If only the phone\u2019s performance could keep up with the fast screen. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A polished version of Android that's easier to use, with plenty of features. Some useful AI tools, but also some AI imagery slop that resorts to bigotry and should be removed from this phone. | 2 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid cameras take photos that look like they could have come from the Pro model, if you don\u2019t look too close. Astonishing macro capabilities rival my DSLR camera and make this phone a winner. Too bad about the low resolution and lack of detail, and some zoom would have been nice. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance is adequate for Pixel fans, though it won\u2019t win any races. No problems with my favorite apps and games, but things slowed down when I engaged the AI as it sent requests to and from the cloud. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | A larger battery somehow doesn\u2019t equal more battery life, but the Pixel 9a still lasts a full day with no trouble, and has wireless charging, a rarity at this price. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best Android folding phone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best folding phones, which means it's also the best Android folding phone. In fact, every folding phone you can buy is also an Android phone, and all of them make use of Google's mobile operating system in unique ways. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 comes loaded with One UI 8, based on Android 16, which means its a great choice for those who want access to the latest and greatest software features.\nOf course, the headline feature isn't the operating system, it's that 8-inch folding display. Samsung has made the folding display on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 larger than ever, and with nearly as much screen real estate as an iPad mini there's plenty of room for browsing, productivity, gaming, and whatever else you need to get done. Samsung has jammed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 full of AI tools and software settings, making this a phone that can adapt to the way you do things.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 has the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and either 12GB and 16GB of RAM depending on configuration, giving the phone plenty of power. Our testing found the phone to be an adaptable daily companion with enough battery life to get through a full day's use, which with a battery capacity of just 4,400mAh is pretty impressive.\nAnd when it comes to camera quality, no other folding phone comes close. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 sports a 200MP main camera, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultra-wide. It's the best camera system on any folding phone, and in some situations can hold its own against the dedicated camera phones on this list.\nThe only real downside to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its price. At a starting price of $1,999 / \u00a31,899 / AU$2,899, it's the most expensive phone on the market, period. Whether it's worth such a high price is up to you.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens. The crease is almost gone, but so is support for an S Pen. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Better than the best Qualcomm chip on other Androids, and the performance knocked our socks off. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Android 16! One UI 8! So much AI. It may sound like a lot, but it's a winning combination. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCameras | The 200MP sensor is a major upgrade, and overall photography is excellent. We would have liked a 5x optical zoom. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Really good battery life | 4.5 / 5 |\nFAQs\nWhat is the best Android phone?\nOur pick for the best Android phone for most people is the Pixel 9, because it's an affordable way to get all of Google's best new AI features and Google's refined Pixel interface and software. However, this could soon change as the Pixel 10 is now available, and we're currently testing it for review.\nThe best premium Android phone is the OnePlus 13, because it offers the best battery life, the most refined interface, and the most durable design with IP69 certification.\nWhich Android phone is the best value for money?\nThe best Android phone for people on a budget is the Pixel 9a, which costs $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849. The Pixel A-series phones are a popular discount item when Amazon puts smartphones on sale, so keep an eye on TechRadar for the latest deals.\nIf you want to spend less than that, Samsung's Galaxy A devices are great value. They gives you a great display and Samsung's feature-packed Android software, plus fast networking and good performance for the price.\nIs Android or iOS better?\nAndroid and Apple's iOS each have their fans, and there is very little that iOS can do that Android cannot. There are many more options, features, and oddities available on Android devices than iOS has ever seen, so Android has a reputation for being more complicated and experimental, while also allowing for more customization and more powerful overall features.\nHow we test\nI've only included phones on this list that have been thoroughly tested in Future Labs and in the real world by our expert review editors. I test every feature on a phone, then we dive deeper to discover all of the hidden goodies.\nI test phones rigorously for battery life and charging times, processor speed and performance, and especially for camera and video recording capabilities. I make sure that phones deliver on the promises and claims they make. If Samsung says a phone charges in 30 minutes, I time it to make sure.\nI've seen every phone you can buy, so I know how each model stacks up against one another. I use both iPhone and Android phones all the time, so I know what I'm saying about the phones you buy, no matter what you pay. I make sure the phones deliver what I'd expect for the price.\nOnce I'm done, I never stop. I update our reviews as the phones are updated. Our reviews are always fresh, so check again before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest review on the best phones you'll find.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "The foldable iPhone could have much smaller screens than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- A report suggests the foldable iPhone will have a 7.8-inch foldable screen and a 5.5-inch cover screen\n- We've heard those sizes before, so they may well be accurate\n- That though would make the foldable iPhone's screens significantly smaller than those of its main rival\nThere are still a lot more questions about the foldable iPhone than answers, and one of those questions is what size screens it will have. But we aren\u2019t left wondering this due to a lack of answers \u2013 rather there have been many conflicting answers.\nNow though, we\u2019re starting to see some consensus, as a report from TrendForce (via MacRumors) claims that the foldable iPhone will have a 7.8-inch foldable display and a 5.5-inch cover screen \u2013 which are both dimensions we\u2019ve heard before.\nMing-Chi Kuo (an analyst with a good track record for Apple information) said the same back in March, and we also heard almost identical sizes from tipster Digital Chat Station in February.\nSo while not all sources agree, there are now enough leaks pointing towards these sizes that they seem the most likely.\nSmaller than the competition\nIf these sizes are correct, then the foldable iPhone\u2019s screen wouldn\u2019t be especially large. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for example has an 8.0-inch foldable screen and a 6.5-inch cover display. That means you essentially have a small tablet and a medium-sized smartphone all in one, whereas the foldable iPhone could end up with a foldable screen that\u2019s still a fair bit smaller than a tablet\u2019s, and a cover screen that\u2019s quite compact.\nWe\u2019d argue that might hold it back, since it probably wouldn\u2019t fulfill either smartphone or tablet roles as well for most people, but then screen size is just one piece of the puzzle. If the remaining specs impress, the phone is suitably slim and light, and it\u2019s not prohibitively expensive, then this could still be the device to make foldable phones mainstream.\nWe probably won\u2019t find out for a while, as the foldable iPhone is unlikely to launch before late 2026 \u2013 and may arrive even later than that.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The foldable iPhone\u2019s cameras might leave it trailing behind the Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- Leaked foldable iPhone specs suggest it could have two 48MP cameras\n- That's fewer cameras than rival foldables, and far fewer megapixels than at least one upcoming rival's camera might have\n- The leak also details screen and construction specs\nWhile there have been numerous leaks about the foldable iPhone, until now, we hadn't heard all that much about its cameras, apart from the fact that there will likely be two of them. Now, though, we have a better idea of the iPhone Fold's megapixel credentials.\nAccording to leaker Digital Chat Station (via @Jukanlosreve), the foldable iPhone is \"expected\" to have a pair of 48MP cameras. They don\u2019t specify what type of cameras these will be, but previous leaks point to wide and ultra-wide snappers, with no telephoto to speak of.\nBut if that\u2019s the case, then the foldable iPhone might not impress camera fans, nor tempt them away from rival handsets. After all, both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold have triple-lens cameras, with wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses, respectively.\nApple foldable info:Specs haven\u2019t been finalized yet.The most recent test version features a display around 7.58 inches with a 2713x1920 resolution and a 14.1:10 aspect ratio.It\u2019s expected to have dual 48MP cameras, a hinge made of a more durable amorphous metal glass\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kBQMor0SxgJune 26, 2025\nAnd while the foldable iPhone's rumored 48MP megapixel count is competitive compared to current models, it'll have newer, better competition by the time it launches. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, for example, is rumored to have a 200MP main camera.\nOf course, megapixels are only one part of what makes a camera good, and their importance can be overstated. But big megapixel counts certainly look good on spec sheets.\nSo, with the foldable iPhone also quite possibly set to cost more than rival devices, it could be a tough sell for anyone who cares about smartphone photography.\nA big screen, a tough hinge, and a titanium frame\nAs well as the cameras, this latest leak also details the foldable iPhone's potential screen, saying that it might have a 7.58-inch 1920 x 2713 foldable display with a 14.1:10 aspect ratio.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAdditionally, the phone is said to have \u201ca hinge made of a more durable amorphous metal glass composite, and a titanium alloy body.\u201d Those details sound more promising, with that screen being somewhat similar to rivals, and the use of titanium likely helping keep the weight of the foldable iPhone down and its durability up.\nOf course, we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt, as we would any leak \u2013 and especially leaks surrounding the foldable iPhone, since this device probably won\u2019t launch until next year at the earliest.\nIndeed, while the source has a good track record, they claim that the specs in question aren\u2019t yet finalized; they're simply the ones Apple is currently testing.\nSo, even if their current information is accurate, it\u2019s entirely possible that Apple will change some or all of these specs before release. At least on our part, we hope the cameras in particular differ from what's detailed here.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "When can we expect the iPhone 17 to be released? Here are my expert predictions\nWe now know \u2013 or at least are almost certain \u2013 that the iPhone 17 series will be announced on September 9. That includes the iPhone 17 itself along with the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and probably a totally new model that could be called the iPhone 17 Air.\nWhy the near-certainty of this date? Well Apple has sent out invites for an event on September 9, starting at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST, which is 3am September 10 AEST for those in Australia.\nAnd while the company hasn\u2019t mentioned any iPhone 17 models by name \u2013 or even mentioned any phones \u2013 based on past form this timing is exactly when I would expect new iPhones to land, so it\u2019s incredibly unlikely that they won\u2019t be present.\nBut September 9 is just the date when Apple will probably announce these phones \u2013 not when they\u2019ll actually be released. So for information on the likely release date, read on.\nExpect pre-orders to open on September 12\nWhile I can be confident of the September 9 announcement date, Apple hasn\u2019t provided any clues as to when the iPhone 17 will go up for pre-order. But I still have a very good idea, as all it takes is looking at Apple\u2019s previous patterns.\nYou see, the company usually opens pre-orders on the Friday of the week the phones were announced, so with the iPhone 17 series expected on Tuesday, September 9, we fully expect pre-orders to open on Friday, September 12.\nThere\u2019s an outside chance this won\u2019t be the case, but the company rarely breaks from this pattern, so I\u2019d be surprised if September 12 wasn\u2019t the pre-order date.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLikely available from September 19\nThe iPhone 17 release date is probably what you\u2019re really here for and that\u2019s the date I'm least sure of, but as with the pre-order date we can take a very good guess based on past form.\nSpecifically, the iPhone 17 series will probably start shipping one week after pre-orders open, which in all likelihood means Friday, September 19. That fits Apple\u2019s typical patterns and is also a date that has been leaked.\nThat means September 19 is probably the day your iPhone 17 will arrive on your doorstep if you pre-ordered it, and that it\u2019s also likely the day you\u2019ll be able to walk out of a shop with an iPhone 17 or one of its siblings.\nThat said, even assuming that is the release date, it\u2019s worth noting that these phones may well sell out, so if you don\u2019t put in a pre-order on September 12 then you could be waiting longer.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The iPhone Fold won't come with an in-display Touch ID sensor \u2013 and that makes a lot of sense\n- Touch ID is predicted on the upcoming folding iPhone\n- It's most likely to be built into the power button\n- The same feature is available on several Apple iPads\nAfter years and years of rumors, we could be a mere 12 months away from the launch of the first foldable iPhone \u2013 and according to one well-placed tipster, it's likely to come with Touch ID built into the power button, rather than under the display.\nThis comes from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the more reliable sources when it comes to Apple predictions, and is a response to \"market rumors\" that the fingerprint sensor will be placed under the screen \u2013 as with many of the best Android phones.\nApple has of course never put a Touch ID sensor under the screen of one of its products, though the technology has been built into the power button on several iPads, starting with the iPad Air 4 that was announced in September 2020.\nThat's the approach the folding iPhone is going to use, Kuo says. The analyst has been making this prediction for several months now, but clearly felt there were enough rumors to the contrary to set the record straight.\nNo Face ID\nSix months ago, I predicted the foldable iPhone would use side-button Touch ID. There are now market rumors that it will adopt an under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, but I think that\u2019s unlikely. It\u2019s expected that Luxshare ICT will supply the side-button Touch ID module\u2026 https://t.co/KsGu49JXkPSeptember 1, 2025\nIt's worth noting that Kuo doesn't say that an under-display Touch ID sensor is completely off the table, just that it's \"unlikely\" at this stage \u2013 even going as far as naming the manufacturer that's in line to supply the Touch ID module for the power button.\nFor a long time now, it's been clear that the foldable iPhone would use Touch ID. The most probable reason that Face ID isn't being implemented is that the necessary cameras and sensors would add too much thickness to the handset.\nIt makes sense that Apple would go with a technology that's already present in several of its tablets: it means it can try and keep costs down as much as possible, and the folding iPhone is in effect an iPad (a 7.8-inch main screen has been rumored).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe should know for sure in September 2026, which is when most tipsters agree we're going to see this iPhone Fold make its first official appearance.

      "text": "iPhone 17 news live \u2013 all the latest specs, colors and price rumors ahead of the big event\nWe're getting closer to Apple's big event on September 9\nSeptember 9 is right around the corner and that's when we'll see the next big Apple event, and almost without doubt the reveal of the iPhone 17 family.\nThe smart money this year suggests we'll get a standard iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 though we could also see an iPhone 17 Air instead of one of those models.\nAnd if the rumors are to be believed, the Pro models at least should offer notable upgrades compared to the past few generations of iPhone launches, where Apple's smartphones have become somewhat iterative. That said, additions such as the Dynamic Island, Action Button, and Camera Control have still combined to make for some of the most consistent entries in our best phones list.\nI've been covering Apple events and iPhones for years, so I'll be your guide over the next few days as we count down to the big day. Below, you'll find a rundown of the tipped specs and features for the upcoming iPhones and live reporting of all the last-minute leaks and rumors, in addition to analysis from TechRadar's many phones experts.\nSo, let's get into it\u2026\niPhone 17: cut to the chase\n- On September 9 at the Apple event, expect to see the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n- These could be joined by an iPhone 17 Air, which is tipped to be a super-slim phone with a 6.7-inch display; it could replace the iPhone 17 Plus.\n- The standard iPhone will likely get a new chip, probably the A19, and may finally get a 120Hz display. Expect new colors, but not a radically different design.\n- The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have more significant upgrades, from the A19 Bionic and a vapor chamber cooling system, to a new telephoto camera, and a new rear camera design, as well as a new display.\n- Expect new Apple Intelligence features to launch with the phones.\n- Prices will likely start at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for the standard iPhones, and $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849 for the Pro models.\n- Expect pre-orders to open on Friday, September 12, and a full release on September 19.\n- Here's how to watch Apple's 'Awe dropping' event on September 9.\niPhone 17: what you need to know\nHere's a rundown of the key iPhone 17 features we expect to see from the family of phones on September 9, based on the latest rumors and claimed leaks.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: design and display\nGoing by the rumors and tips so far, you can expect the iPhone 17 and 17 Plus to look a lot like their iPhone 16 predecessors.\nThere are rumors of an aluminum frame for all four next-gen iPhones, but I'm not buying that; it would mean a departure from the titanium chassis found on the Pro iPhones.\nOne big change could come in the form of a vertical rear-camera module for the iPhone 17, much like that on the Samsung Galaxy S25. This could reduce the rear footprint of the module, but would be a departure from a style Apple has used for years.\nDummy units that also touted this design have a slim horizontal pill-shaped camera module for the so-called iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to have the same screen size as the iPhone 16 Plus but to be a lot slimmer.\nIn direct contrast, the rear-camera module for the iPhone 17 Pro models is tipped to be rectangular and to span the width of the phones' bodies, with the idea that such a module could hold an upgraded camera system. A suite of other dummy units, renders, and rumors have lent weight to this, so I'm inclined to believe it's got some legitimacy.\nOn the display side, the tipsters have claimed all four phones will have 120Hz displays, which I'd welcome \u2013 a 60Hz display feels ludicrous in 2025, even on the standard iPhones.\nFor the Pro phones, one rumor claims the screens will use a new technology that \"improves battery efficiency, maximizes display durability, and enhances overall performance compared to existing display technologies.\u201d\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: Cameras\nA credible and repeated rumor that there'll be a new 24MP front-facing camera for every iPhone 17 model has been doing the rounds, but wider camera upgrades for the standard iPhone 17 don't look likely.\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air might just have one rear camera, although there's some debate here, with another tipster claiming the iPhone 17 Air will have a 48MP main camera and a 12MP front-facing one.\nIt's likely to be business as usual for iPhone 17 on the camera side, though Apple may have improved the sensor a little and will likely improve image signal processing to get more out of a main and ultra-wide camera combo.\nOn the iPhone 17 Pro side, things look a little more interesting, with both models tipped to get a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. One tipster also claims that the iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a mechanical aperture, allowing you to adjust the depth of field of your photos on the fly; that might explain the expected camera module design change.\nOne left-field rumor has Apple testing a 200MP sensor, though there's no indication that this would be included on the iPhone 17 Pro range.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: price and release date\nI'll keep this simple based on rumors and my own experience of covering iPhones.\nThe standard iPhone 17 is expected to start at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399.\nThe iPhone 17 Plus / iPhone 17 Air could start at $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,599.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro will likely start at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max will likely start at $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149.\nThere's a rumor that due to tariffs, all the new iPhones could be some $50 more expensive than their respective predecessors. I'm of two minds as to whether Apple will mess with an established price cadence this year.\nExpect pre-orders for all the iPhones to open on Friday, September 12, and a full release on September 19.\nAnd be prepared for a range of storage options from 128GB to 1TB, and a mix of colors, including a punchy orange for the Pro phones.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro rumored specs\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | iPhone 17 | iPhone 17 Air | iPhone 17 Pro | iPhone 17 Pro Max |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nDisplay: | 6.1-inch OLED | 6.7-inch OLED | 6.3-inch OLED | 6.9-inch OLED |\nResolution: | 1179 x 2556 | 1290 x 2796 | 1206 x 2622 | 1320 x 2868 |\nRefresh rate: | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz |\nChipset: | A19 | A19 Pro | A19 Pro | A19 Pro |\nRear cameras: | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | 48MP wide | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) |\nFront camera: | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP |\nRAM: | 8GB | 8GB | 12GB | 12GB |\nStorage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\nBattery: | 3,561mAh+ | Under 3,000mAh | 3,582mAh+ | ~5,000mAh |\nYou can expect the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max to have similar key specifications to the iPhone 16 specs.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could mix things up and have a thickness measuring between 5.0mm and 6.0mm, but so far there haven't been a lot of leaks to tease out the dimensions of the rumored slim phone.\nOther key specs of the new iPhones will likely include an A19 chip for the standard and Plus/Air models, bringing in improved performance and efficiency, and likely snappier responses from AI tools, along with improved image signal processing.\nOn the Pro phone side, that chip is tipped to be the A19 Pro, which will surely bring in the same upgrades but with more clout on the gaming side. The latter point is given more weight by the fact that vapor chamber cooling is expected for the iPhone 17 Pro models, which could enable the chipset to deliver peak performance for extended times; this would be ideal for some of the more demanding iOS games.\nThere's also a rumor that the iPhone 17 Pro will get 12GB of RAM, which would be an upgrade on the 8GB that the current Pro phones have, and which could enable faster responses from Apple Intelligence tools.\nLive updates\nRumors of improved battery life is potentially a given for the iPhone 17 series, with new chips often bringing with them improved energy efficiency.\nThis could be mitigated by a boost in performance, so the energy efficiency evens that out; more power but the same expected battery life.\nHowever, my prediction is Apple will favor a longer battery life this year over pure performance boosts, as the iPhone 16 models already have buckets of power.\nAll of the lights\nDing! Ding! We have a new rumor: the latest iPhone 17 Pro leak points to a brighter screen and better battery life.\nOver to freelancer David Nield:\n\"According to regular tipster Instant Digital (via AppleInsider), we can expect the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 the most expensive of the four anticipated models \u2013 to maintain higher levels of screen brightness for longer periods of time.\n\"What's more, the phones are said to be better at handling the higher internal temperatures that are typical when playing demanding games. The phones will be more stable in these scenarios, the tipster says, with fewer frame drops.\"\nThat's not to say I think the telephoto camera on the iPhone 16 Pro Max isn't good; in fact I think it's great.\nBut more megapixels combined with smart image processing and some AI tools, could make for a more flexible telephoto camera with more options to crop into shots and so on.\nFor more, read Jamie Richard's article: The iPhone 17 Pro could get a 48MP telephoto camera, which is way more exciting than it sounds \u2013 let me explain.\nAnd as I've said before, the tipped 48-megapixel 5x optical zoom telephoto camera on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, also has my attention.\nAs mentioned previously and by Axel Metz, the tipped 120Hz display on the standard iPhone 17 is worthy of our attention.\nApple's iPhones have never really been about the specs per se. Rather it's about what certain specifications enable the iPhone to do, such as gaming or more advanced AI features.\nSo while these tipped iPhone 17 specs don't exactly get one phone-nerd synapse tingling, it's very likely that all four next-generation iPhone will have plenty of power to be super-slick and offer snappy smart tools.\nSpying specs\nStraight off the bat, I'm looking at our new deep-dive into the iPhone 17 specs.\nAs you'll see in the static section above, I've added a new specs table for all four predicted iPhone 17 models so check that out.\nGood morning form the UK. Roland Moore-Colyer back again to bring you the latest iPhone 17 rumors and analysis from today, and some wider thoughts on the looming Apple event.\nThis event desperately needs one more thing\nIn the runups to these big tech launches, I like to imagine the whole sequence of events, a sort of mental pregame that starts with all the activities before, say, Apple CEO Tim Cook takes the stage, through the cascade of product unveilings to the end, where, sometimes, Cook reemerges on stage before releasing us to the pell-mell demo room.\nWhen I do that, I often ponder the big question: Will there be \"one more thing\"? That signature Apple move that started with Steve Jobs and continues to this day with Cook has a pretty storied history.\nFor those who've never seen it, this is the 'extra\" announcement that happens after you think all the Apple product reveals are done. It's been everything from Windows compatibility for iPod to, most recently, Vision Pro in 2023.\nIt makes sense not to do them every year, since that would make the \"one more thing\" just another thing that we all expect. However, I think we can agree that Apple needs one more thing this year more than ever. It's not been a super year, what with tariff worries, a President pressing Cook on building the iPhone in the US, and Apple Intelligence disappointments.\nI don't know exactly what \"one more thing\" could be, but I am convinced that Apple needs the electricity such an announcement invariably brings.\nBeware the fakery\nWhat you see below is not the new iPhone 17 lineup. Sure, there appears to be an iPhone 17 Air and a Pro model with the wider camera array, but watch closely and you'll see the cameras move around the backs of these phones.\nThese are most like AI-generated fakes (even X's Grok confirmed as much) designed to fool you into believing they're the real thing. Sure, they could be based on real prototypes, but we doubt it.\nIn this age of AI it is worth remembering that anyone with a AI image generator and a decent prompt can create a fake \"iPhone 17\" image and even a video.\nTrust nothing until the big reveal on September 9 at 1PM ET.\niPhone 17 \ud83d\udd10\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/XoA9ZGTmyGSeptember 3, 2025\nHow to talk AI without talking about Apple Intelligence\nBy now, we all know that Apple plans to deliver the best bits of Apple Intelligence \u2013 like a Siri worth caring about \u2013 \"in the coming year\", which sounds like next year. If that's the case, there won't be any truly exciting Apple Intelligence bits to discuss during the Apple iPhone 17 launch event. On the other hand, how does Apple not talk about artificial intelligence in the Age of AI.\nThe reality is that Apple did add some Apple Intelligence tweaks in iOS 26 that it could again highlight, like Live Translations and the tweaks to Visual Intelligence, but these are not exciting updates, and none puts Apple on a level playing field with generative AI leaders like OpenAI (a partner) and Google (a partner).\nPerhaps this is the moment when Apple unveils a new AI partnership with, for instance, Anthropic. There are rumors that it could integrate Claude AI intelligence into Siri. There's no way that's ready by next week, but a smaller partnership in which you can choose to use Claude AI instead of ChatGPT would be interesting, and this is how you talk about AI without really talking about Apple intelligence.\nTrade in? Trade up? What's the right timing?\nThe most common question I get this time of year is, \"Do I upgrade or wait until next year?\" It's a funny question, but it implies that people think something even bigger is just around the corner (12 months from now), and they could soon be kicking themselves for upgrading too quickly.\nPerhaps there's a more rational approach.\nThere is no good school of thought on when you should trade in your aging iPhone, but a good rule of thumb might be when OS updates are running dry. Apple products do become vintage (roughly 7 years or older) and then obsolete, with no more platform updates. This year, that list includes all the iPhone X phones.\nMy point is, if you own one of those, or maybe even one a year away from vintage status, like the iPhone 11, you might consider an upgrade.\nRight, it's getting late in the evening for me in the UK, so I'll leave you for a bit with some thoughts from Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff, who isn't short on what he'd like to see from the next-generation iPhones and the Apple event.\nOver to Ulanoff:\nApple's iPhone 17 Air could be the star, but may not be the highlight\nRumors have been swirling around an ultra-thin iPhone (the iPhone 17 Air) for almost a year, but in that time, Samsung released the 5.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and then the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which, unfolded, is just 4.2mm thick!\nOf these two phones, the Z Fold is unquestionably thinner but also a much more interesting phone. The S25 Edge is just a thin Galaxy that is otherwise, well, a bit boring (read our review for evidence).\nWhich brings me to the iPhone 17 Air, which should be the star of Apple's big iPhone 17 launch event, but I worry it could be underwhelming. That is, unless Apple makes it thinner than 4.2mm and adds some extra, unexpected feature. But what could Apple do? You can't fit a decent-sized battery, so battery life won't match the iPhone 17 Pro. It won't have a big telephoto camera because you can't fit that periscope in the itsybitsy space.\nWhat the iPhone 17 Air will have going for it is a super thin and light body and a very big (Plus-sized) screen. Oh, and did I mention that it'll probably be as expensive (if not more so) than the iPhone 17 Pro?\nOn the subject of price drops, I have an analysis based on my time writing about iPhones on whether the iPhone 16's price drop when the iPhone 17 launches.\nI should add that I 100% don't think you should buy an iPhone until Apple has announced its new phones.\nHolding fire until then means you could either pick up the new iPhone if they appeal to you, or get an older iPhone at a discount price. So even if you're due an upgrade, patience will likely do you wonders.\nTime for an upgrade?\nWhile I spoke earlier about upgrading from an iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 17 family will more likely appeal to people looking to upgrade from older Apple phones.\nSo here's freelancer Paul Hatton with why 3 rumored features could see him upgrade to the iPhone 17 from an iPhone 12.\nBuilding off the back of that thought, I'd be keen for the powerd-up iPhones to further acts as device that can better interact with other devices one uses in daily life.\nOf course, that'll likely need Apple to let more things into its walled garden, but I do think that's a distinct possibility.\nSpeeding up\nBit of a left-field tidbit, but it looks like Apple CarPlay Ultra will come to more affordable cars in the near-future.\nCarPlay Ultra better stitches together car infotainment unit with Apple's car-meets-phone interface. So I'd be curious to see if CarPlay Ultra could benefit from a boost in power the iPhone 17 family could bring to the table.\nJust want to flag this rumor for a little color to the blog: New iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max leaks show off internals, a camera upgrade \u2013 and a SIM slot.\nI'd be curious to see how the standard iphone will evolve over Apple's tipped three-year plan.\n\"Fresh rumors suggest Apple has committed to a new three-year plan for the iPhone, with three radical new designs set to join or replace parts of the current flagship lineup,\" Jamie Richards reportes.\n\"This comes from Mark Gurman, Bloomberg\u2019s resident Apple correspondent and the tech industry\u2019s most trusted Apple tipster, who shared some details of the rumored changes to the iPhone line-up.\"\nStill, Staff Writer Jamie Richards has 4 ways the iPhone 17 can improve on the iPhone 16, which based on some rumors means the iPhone 17 could be a bigger upgrade than first meets the eye.\nIterative upgrades\nPutting aside the 120Hz display, it's not looking like the iPhone 17 will bring a huge clutch of upgrades to the table.\nA new rear-camera desing could streamline the phone a little. And a new A19 chip could offer a decent boost in power, but I'm not convinced it'll be a big upgrade over the iPhone 16 series.\nMr Metz's opinion is one I can get behind. I think the standard iPhones is great but the 60Hz display feels almost heinous in 2025.\nIf Apple ditches it for a 60Hz to 120Hz display then I could see myself not needing to go Pro.\nHz so good\nMoving on from the iPhone 17 Pro, and there's a rumor or two that the iPhone 17 will have a 120Hz display.\nThat's got Phones Editor Axel Metz a little intrigued. Over to him:\n\"Back in February 2024, I wrote that 120Hz refresh rates make Apple\u2019s best iPhones worth the money. But if the base iPhone 17 is due to get this formerly Pro-exclusive feature, I may well recommend this cheaper model over the pricier Pro models this year.\n\"To be clear: the iPhone 17 isn\u2019t tipped to get ProMotion specifically, which allows iPhone screens to dial all the way down to 1Hz (enabling features like the Always-On display). But it is tipped to get a static 120Hz display, which is by far the more important feature of the two.\"\nThough I should say there's plenty of great, and less-demanding games on Apple Arcade, which I do rather enjoy taking for a spin.\nGassed up\nLet me ponder that vapor chamber tidbit a little more... I think it might low-key be a heck of an upgrade for the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max.\nNot only can my iPhone 16 Pro Max get a little hot under the collar when gaming or using 5G, so a vapor chamber cooling system could help alleviate that, I think it could also extract more performance out of an A-series chipset.\nBetter cooling means less had that can hamper the performance of a chip's CPU and GPU over time, say extended gaming sessions. And so being able to push a chip harder and for longer could see Apple extract more power for more advanced games.\nCupertino's crew has already seen the porting of Sniper Elite 4, Death Stranding and Hitman World of Assassination on to iOS, so I think unlocking more power could further open up the path for more console-grade games on iPhone.\nAs is the tipped vapor chamber upgrade for the iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPhone 17 Pro. This should keep a high-performing iPhone cooler than ever before, which is handy for mobile gamers and people who rely on sustained 5G connectivity.\nMore power and a more efficient battery management, likely facilitated by the rumored A19 Pro chip would also be appreciated.\nThat being said, the idea of a 48-megapixel improved telephoto camera and a form of adjustable aperture for the cameras system, definitely has my attention I'm a big fan of telephoto cameras as I do like a nicely zoomed shot.\nMax attack\nSpeaking of my iPhone 16 Pro Max, it's become a phone i've really enjoyed using, so it's hard for me to see myself upgrading from it other than for work purposes. While I do prefer a slightly smaller phone, this iPhone has been a wonderful device to use for the past year-ish.\nI've loved the cameras, performance, desing, toughness and more. So it's hard to see what Apple can bring to the table to tempt me over.\nGet set for iOS 26\nWith the iPhone 17 family, we should see the full debut of iOS 26, with its new Liquid Glass material design.\nIn preparation for this, Apple has released what's sure to be the final iOS 26 beta to developer testers ahead of its event on September 9. So from that I can glean we could get the full rollout of iOS 26 rather soon after the next-generation iPhones get shown off. I'm looking forward to trying it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nAmong the rumors, there's also a hit that the iPhone 17 Air could be the only model to lack a SIM card slot in the EU.\nWhile eschewing physical SIM cards maybe common in the US, it's not the done thing in Europe yet. But perhaps Apple could forge the path for an eSIM future on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFrom that rumor report there's more stuff to chew over.\nSeen by 9to5Mac, a research note from JPMorgan has the firm expecting the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max to have the same prices as their predecessors.\nSo that would mean a starting price of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for the iPhone 17, and of $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149 for the iPhone 17 Pro Max. These are only US prices however but we hope other nations will follow such a cadence and not come with a price hike over the previous generation of iPhones.\niPhone 17 Pro Max papped already?\nSo let's kick things off with a nice and fresh rumor: the iPhone 17 Pro Max has seemingly been caught on camera \u2013 and it could cost less than expected.\nA short video reportedly showed an iPhone 17 Pro Max retail unit and it's look like the new rectangular rear-camera module will be a new design feature of the next-generation Pro iPhones. Hopefully, this'll means the phones will also hold upgraded cameras.\nBut this was from a post on Weibo and it's hard to verify the veracity of such stuff, Yet, this does back-up the desing touted in other rumors and dummy units. So I reckon there's some weight to this.\nGood morning or afternoon, or evening, wherever you are. I'm Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor of Mobile Computing at TechRadar, and I'll be your host for the next few days as we count down the days to the big Apple event.\nHello and welcome to our iPhone 17 rumors live blog."

      "text": "More details of the foldable iPhone have leaked \u2013 including a 'less obvious' crease\n- Some key details of the folding iPhone have leaked\n- Expect four cameras, two colors, and Touch ID\n- We'll probably see the handset launch in 2026\nAt this point it seems almost certain that Apple is going to bring out a foldable iPhone in September 2026, and we just got a few more details about what to expect from an Apple tipster who is usually more reliable than most.\nThat tipster is Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who says that the folding Apple phone is going to use Touch ID rather than Face ID. While all the current iPhones now use Face ID, the thinking is that the required sensors would add too much thickness to the foldable.\nApple is therefore going to go with Touch ID to keep the device as thin as possible, Gurman says, and there'll be no SIM card slot for the same reason \u2013 this is going to be eSIM only. Previous leaks have predicted the phone will be 4.8 mm thick when unfolded, compared to the 4.2 mm of the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nThis latest report also states we're going to get four cameras on the folding iPhone: one on the outer screen, one on the inner screen, and two on the back (which will both be 48MP cameras, according to an earlier rumor).\nCreasing up\nIf past reports are to be believed, one of the reasons a foldable iPhone has taken so long is because Apple is very keen to make the screen crease as invisible as possible, and it seems the company now has a display setup it's happy with.\nAs per Gurman, the folding iPhone is going to use what's known as an in-cell touchscreen, with an integrated display and digitizer layer. That would make the screen tech similar to what we have on the current iPhone models, ensuring a \"less obvious\" crease and improving touch accuracy.\nOther tidbits from the report: the folding iPhone will be available in black or white, and will include Apple's own C2 modem chip that's expected to debut in the iPhone 17 (which should lead to improved efficiency and battery life).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nGurman says the foldable iPhone will be a \"game changer\" for Apple, and his belief is that anyone who makes the switch to a folding iPhone won't want to go back. Before that, though, we've got this year's iPhone 17 launch coming up next month.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "The dream of an edge-to-edge iPhone display with no cutout could come true sooner than we thought. Per a new analyst report, next year\u2019s iPhone Fold might be the first iPhone to move camera components under the display, thus offering a truly all-screen design.\niPhone Fold expected to feature under-display front camera\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone X in 2017, it touted a \u201cgorgeous all-glass design.\u201d But as we all know, that design included a notch, which in 2022 shrank into the Dynamic Island.\nFinally though, it seems Apple could be nearly ready to launch its first all-screen, cutout-free iPhone.\nIn a recent JPMorgan analyst report seen by 9to5Mac, the firm detailed expectations for the next several years of iPhone upgrades.\nOne particularly noteworthy detail involves the new iPhone Fold coming in 2026.\nThe report says Apple\u2019s iPhone Fold will have an under-display 24MP front camera.\niPhone Fold is expected to include front cameras on both the outer display and its inner display. As a result, it seems likely that Apple will put the same selfie camera in both locations.\nIf JPMorgan is right, this would be the first time an iPhone utilized under-display camera technology.\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy for another big reason: since iPhone Fold won\u2019t have any Face ID components, it sounds like the screen will be entirely cutout-free.\nWith no cutout for a camera, and no cutout for Face ID due to Apple opting for Touch ID instead, we could be looking at truly all-screen displays.\nPrior reporting indicated the iPhone Fold would utilize a hole-punch cutout for its front camera. Though one leaker previously suggested that the outer display might have a hole-punch while the inner one uses an under-display camera. His claims were fairly vague and hedgy, however.\nBut with an under-display camera, there\u2019s no need even for a reduced camera cutout.\nAs a result, it\u2019s very possible that both the outer and inner iPhone Fold screens will have no notch or even Dynamic Island\u2014at least in hardware, as the software feature will likely live on.\nThis would represent a major step forward for iPhone design, and lead in well to the rumored \u2018iPhone 20\u2019 model the following year.\nWould the iPhone Fold having an all-screen, no-cutout design make a difference to you?
