  "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to give what could be his most consequential speech yet \u2014 just a few days after one of his colleagues was threatened with prosecution for alleged mortgage fraud.\n\nEvery year, the Fed chair gives a highly anticipated speech at an annual economic symposium hosted for the world\u2019s central bankers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It serves to give investors a heads up on what monetary policy may look like in the months ahead.\n\nBut this year\u2019s speech is on a radically different backdrop. For months, the Fed has been under an unprecedented full-scale assault by President Donald Trump, who has not only lobbed a series of personal insults at Powell and spoken of firing him, but who is now attempting to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden. The president\u2019s frustration is due to the Fed not lowering borrowing costs this year.\n\nThe speech will arguably be Powell\u2019s last stand, with his term as chair ending in May 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is already leading the search for Powell\u2019s replacement and the president could announce his pick soon, several months before the end of Powell\u2019s term. Two current Fed governors \u2014 the same ones who have broken ranks with Powell \u2014 are under consideration for chair, underscoring the rare divisiveness at the central bank.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with interest rates?\n\nSince December, Fed officials have kept rates unchanged, waiting to see how Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs affect prices before resuming rate cuts, which could spur inflation.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s tariffs have had a limited impact on inflation (though it remains well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target), and Fed officials calling for rate cuts argue any increase in prices will prove temporary. At the same time, the labor market has shown growing signs of weakness.\n\nPut together, financial markets now see a compelling argument for an interest rate cut as soon as September. But it won\u2019t be an easy call.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is really between a rock and a hard place right now,\u201d said Paul Eitelman, global chief investment strategist at Russell Investments. \u201cI don\u2019t think Powell has enough clarity yet to strongly signal a September cut, but he will have to flag risks to full employment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, our view is that the Fed will be able to cut interest rates in September,\u201d he added.\n\nMost mainstream economists expect Trump\u2019s tariffs to push up prices, although to what extent remains to be seen. But the idea that those price pressures may be short-lived has gained traction among Fed voters.\n\nThat\u2019s what the two Trump appointees who dissented from consensus and backed a rate cut at the central bank\u2019s July monetary policy meeting \u2014 Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman \u2014 have argued. The ways that businesses have managed tariffs so far has played a crucial role in keeping consumer inflation at bay for now.\n\n\u201cEven if we\u2019re starting to see some pressures build from the tariffs and that they could eventually be passed through, the argument is that these will still be largely temporary adjustments,\u201d said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.\n\nThe latest data is indeed starting to show that price pressures are increasing on the wholesale level.\n\nThe July Producer Price Index, which measures the prices businesses pay their suppliers, jumped 0.9% from the prior month, boosting the annual rate to 3.3%. The monthly and annual figures both rose much more than economists had expected.\n\nBowman said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that she still thinks the Fed should cut rates now, despite the much-hotter-than-expected PPI figure for July.\n\nPowell himself has frequently pointed out that it\u2019s still not clear how persistent tariff-induced inflation will be \u2014 and it could be a while until that becomes apparent.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is not going to have a clear answer whether it\u2019s going to be a one-time shift or not until probably into next year,\u201d said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. \u201cBut they still have to be making these decisions.\u201d\n\nThe labor market is the official theme of the Jackson Hole conference \u2014 demographics, productivity and macroeconomic policy.\n\nThe average pace of monthly job growth from May through July was weaker than any other three-month period since 2009, outside of the pandemic recession in 2020. Job gains this year have been driven by just a few industries, too; health care, social assistance and local government.\n\nIt\u2019s also become exceptionally difficult for unemployed Americans to find a job, at least compared to prior years. In July, the number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks reached its highest level since December 2021, at 1.85 million, though it remains well below Great Recession levels.\n\nNot only is the Fed responsible for taming inflation, it\u2019s also supposed to preserve the labor market\u2019s strength. In addition to their views that tariff inflation might be only temporary, Bowman and Waller have also raised concerns about the labor market. But they\u2019re not the only ones among Fed officials.\n\n\u201cThe labor market has softened, and I would see additional slowing as unwelcome,\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly wrote in a post on LinkedIn last week. \u201cOnce the labor market stumbles, it tends to fall quickly and hard.\u201d\n\nFed officials have also floated the possibility that a weakening labor market is precisely what would keep tariff-induced inflation from becoming entrenched, since companies won\u2019t have as much flexibility to raise prices with more consumers finding themselves out of work.\n\n\u201cIf you do see pressure on both sides of the mandate, then you\u2019re always trying to ask the question, is the labor market going to get bad enough that it\u2019s going to do the work on inflation for you?\u201d Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said during an August 14 virtual discussion hosted by the National Association for Business Economics.\n\n\u201cHigh unemployment is in fact disinflationary,\u201d he said.",

      "text": "Americans are still opening their wallets, with unemployment remaining low and businesses blunting the effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs.\nBut consumers remain skittish over Trump\u2019s erratic trade war, according to recent surveys. Still, they haven\u2019t cut back and consumer prices have remained somewhat tame.\nBusinesses have played a key role in keeping the economy afloat, despite persistent economic jitters. For instance, companies mostly have not ramped up layoffs to deal with the cost pressures arising from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Unemployment remains low at 4.2%, and if Americans have a job, then they\u2019re able to spend and save.\nCompanies have also managed Trump\u2019s confusing onslaught of tariffs through a serious of maneuvers that have, so far, kept inflation from surging; a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond detailed all those strategies.\nAfter briefly improving from the near-record lows in the spring, consumer sentiment went into reverse again this month, the University of Michigan said Friday. But that might not mean anything for spending, since sentiment has been a lousy predictor of purchasing behavior in recent years.\nPut together, this has allowed consumers to continue to power the US economy with their spending, which contributes about 70% of economic output (though there are signs of caution on how long this resilience can last.)\n\u201cAs long as consumer spending holds up and companies are able to retain workers because of that robust spending, the flywheel can continue to spin, pushing corporate profits and stock prices higher,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in commentary issued Friday.\nWhat businesses are doing to manage tariffs\nSince the beginning of the year, Trump has rewritten US trade policy, with a new wave of tariffs that went into earlier this month. Businesses have scrambled to deal with the fallout.\nEconomists have long said that tariffs will likely stoke consumer inflation, but so far, that hasn\u2019t happened. That might be because of how businesses have handled the situation, according to a recent analysis from the Richmond Fed that looked at survey responses from businesses.\nThe report said that businesses have delayed ordering inventories, delayed the timing of when a tariff is charged and negotiated partnerships with suppliers and customers to share costs. Many businesses also stocked up on inventories in the beginning of the year to avoid tariff-induced sticker shock.\nAnd fortunately for the American worker, one of those strategies hasn\u2019t been to trim headcount. New applications for unemployment benefits remain low, according to Labor Department data.\nThat\u2019s done the trick in keeping a lid on consumer inflation, but it might not last for much longer. The latest Producer Price Index, which measures the prices businesses pay their suppliers, surged 0.9% in July from the prior month, lifting the annual rate to 3.3%. The monthly and annual figures both rose much more than economists had expected.\n\u201cSensing from businesses suggests that the impact of tariffs on their price-setting has been lagged, but it is starting to play out,\u201d Richmond Fed economists said in their paper. \u201cNonetheless, it remains highly uncertain how tariffs will impact consumer inflation.\u201d\nSpooked but still spending\nConsumer sentiment remains well below where it was late last year, after the presidential election. But it hasn\u2019t \u2014 and probably still won\u2019t \u2014 predict how Americans spend in the months ahead.\nConsumer sentiment fell 5% this month to a preliminary reading of 58.6, the University of Michigan said Friday, falling for the first time in four months. Sentiment had improved, with consumers feeling a sense of relief that the worst of Trump\u2019s trade war might finally be in the rearview mirror.\nBut the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are still very much up in the air.\n\u201cConsumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April when reciprocal tariffs were announced and then paused,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release. \u201cHowever, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.\u201d\nTheir expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead rose to 4.9% this month, up from 4.5% in July.\nStill, Americans will likely continue to spend, just as they did in 2022 when sentiment fell to a record low because inflation was running at 40-year highs. Or in 2023, when a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling prompted sentiment to fall, yet spending remain robust all throughout that year.\nResilient spending\nSpending at US retailers rose 0.5% in July, the Commerce Department said Friday. That\u2019s down from June\u2019s upwardly revised 0.9% gain, and in line with economists\u2019 expectations.\nRetail sales picked up across categories last month, especially at car dealerships and furniture stores, which saw sales climb 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Online sales jumped 0.8% in July, coinciding with Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale. Spending also picked up at gas stations and department stores.\nRetail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings, but not inflation.\nMeanwhile, spending was down among only a handful of categories, including home improvement stores (-1%) and electronics retailers (-0.6%). Restaurants and bars also saw sales decline in July, falling 0.4% and extending an unusually weak period of sales growth.\nA subset of retail sales that excludes volatile categories \u2014 known as the \u201ccontrol group\u201d \u2014 rose 0.5% in July, slightly better than the 0.4% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. That measure is seen as a better gauge of underlying consumer demand.\nEven after factoring in July\u2019s 0.2% monthly increase in consumer prices, according to the Consumer Price Index, retail sales were still up a healthy 0.3% last month.\n\u201cWhat consumers do is more important to the economy than what they say,\u201d Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said in an analyst note Friday."

      "text": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting as it remains under intense pressure from President Donald Trump and his allies to lower borrowing costs.\nThe central bank left its benchmark lending rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since December, but the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous. Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman cast dissenting votes, marking the first time more than one Fed governor has dissented since 1993. They preferred a quarter-point rate cut instead, the Fed said.\nThe division among policymakers underscores the extraordinary and uncomfortable moment the Fed is in: Central bankers want to wait a little while longer for additional data to see how the US economy is faring during Trump\u2019s trade war, but they\u2019re facing repeated attack from the White House because of their wait-and-see strategy.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference that these are still the \u201cearly days\u201d of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 and their effects on the US economy \u2014 meaning that \u201cthere are many, many uncertainties left to resolve,\u201d he said.\nHere are takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision to hold rates steady as the central bank faces intense pressure to reduce borrowing costs, even from within.\nPowell on the dissents and possible rate cuts\nA Fed governor dissenting on a policy decision is rare, and even more so when two of them do it at the same time. But Powell didn\u2019t characterize that as an issue.\n\u201cOn the dissents, what you want from everybody and also from a dissenter is a clear explanation of what your thinking is and what the arguments are you are making. We had that today,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBasically, this was a good meeting around the table where people thought carefully about this and put their positions out there.\u201d\nBowman and Waller could share their views on why they dissented as soon as Friday morning, after the customary post-meeting blackout.\nEven though the Fed is standing pat for now, the central bank is widely expected to lower rates at least once this year, and as many as two times by year\u2019s end, according to futures. This year\u2019s first rate cut could some as soon as September, some investors say.\nPowell said there are still too many things up in the air when it comes to the economy to know whether it makes sense to resume rate cuts in the fall. \u201cWe have made no decisions about September,\u201d he said.\nFor now, Fed policymakers are waiting to see if the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs on inflation prove to be mild and if the economy continues to weaken. Those two developments would give the Fed the green light to resume rate cuts and ease some pressure off the economy.\n\u201cMost in the (Fed\u2019s rate-setting) committee think it will be appropriate to cut rates fairly soon, but they might be disagreeing over exactly how much evidence they need or how comfortable they have to be before they start cutting rates again,\u201d William English, a former senior Fed adviser, told CNN.\nPowell on the labor market\nThe job market has been a pillar of strength for the US economy for years, but it\u2019s not clear how much longer that resilience will persist as tariffs start to take a bigger bite.\nIn addition to taming inflation, the Fed is also responsible for protecting the labor market.\nPowell reiterated repeatedly Wednesday that the labor market remains in good shape, but said \u201cyou do see a slowing of job creation\u201d and some \u201cdownside risk,\u201d meaning a turn for the worse.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Waller and Bowman who have doubts over how much longer the labor market can keep its ahead above water without any rate cuts.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to see more weakness in the labor market,\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said earlier this month at an event in Idaho. \u201cWhich is why you can\u2019t wait forever.\u201d\nPowell said officials are looking at various factors of the labor market such as demand for workers and the supply of workers, which is being affected by Trump\u2019s ongoing crackdown on immigration.\nPowell on the renovation and housing\nTrump hasn\u2019t let up with his monthslong, insult-laden pressure campaign against Powell.\nThe president raised the temperature earlier this month when he and his allies seized on the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC. They said the Fed, with Powell at the helm, has mismanaged the project, seeing it as a potential legal opening to oust Powell. Last week, Trump toured the renovation site and at one point even feuded with Powell, on camera, over the total cost of the project.\nPowell said it was \u201ca nice visit with the president,\u201d adding that \u201che really wanted to see was us getting this construction completed as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cThat is our focus. And that\u2019s what we are going to do,\u201d he said.\nSince then, Trump has backed off from his criticism of the renovation project. On Monday, he even said he will \u201cgreatly miss\u201d Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026.\nTrump is still calling on the Fed to lower rates, but instead of saying it drove up the federal government\u2019s debt servicing costs, he\u2019s now pointing to the effects of elevated interest rates on the housing market.\n\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!\u201d Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media platform.\nHowever, the Fed cutting rates will not be the silver bullet that fixes the housing market, which is still grappling with the longstanding issue of not enough homes on the market. And last year, after the Fed began to lower interest rates, mortgage rates climbed instead.\nOn the housing market, Powell said \u201cthere are other things going on housing sector, and one of those is \u2026 a long-term housing shortage.\u201d\nPowell on the latest GDP report\nThe Fed\u2019s decision comes the same day new data showed underlying momentum in the economy is sputtering.\nThe Commerce Department earlier on Wednesday reported that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, registered an annualized rate of 3% in the second quarter. That figure beat economists\u2019 expectations and was a sharp rebound from the first quarter, when surging imports as businesses tried to get ahead of tariffs prompted GDP to decline at a 0.5% rate.\nBut that strong headline figure masks underlying weakness buried in the details of the GDP report, and even the Fed noted that in its latest policy statement.\n\u201cAlthough swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\u201d Fed officials wrote.\nA key gauge of demand in the economy \u2014 real final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 expanded at a 1.2% rate in the April-through-June period, down from 1.9% in the beginning of the year.\n\u201cWe expected the GDP data that we got this week and I think it\u2019s still a little bit difficult to interpret because you have these massive swings in net exports,\u201d Powell said."

      "text": "Congress has given the Fed two goals: full employment and price stability. We need to balance both. The Fed has maintained restrictive monetary policy since 2022 in an effort to slow economic growth to a sustainable pace and bring inflation down toward our 2% goal. We've made progress on inflation while keeping unemployment low. But the labor market has softened, and I would see additional slowing as unwelcome. Once the labor market stumbles, it tends to fall quickly and hard. As I said in my remarks at the Anchorage Economic Summit this week, all this means that we will likely need to recalibrate policy in the coming months to balance the risks to both of our mandated goals.\nPerhaps it's time to recalibrate the 19th century tools and policies to match 21st century economic needs before the homeless population reaches 50%. QE in industrial development bonds, commodity bond's, housing bond's. And admit increasing interest rates creates inflation by reducing scales of efficiency and reducing supply among many other factors. Create negative interest loans for education and American made cars subsidized by tariffs.\nThanks for sharing, Mary C.\nThanks for sharing.\nMary C. Daly Is it correct to interpret your use of the word \"recalibrate\" to mean 50bps? Federal Reserve Board\nThanks for sharing, Mary C.\nMary C. Daly Yes. The last mile is always harder and more so when the mile may end up being longer ex post. Would have been an easier call without tariff uncerainty.\nThanks for sharing, Mary!\nSo, what happened to your inflation mandate, Mary? As you know, inflation has been above the Fed's target for over 4 years and is now rising. As you also know, it will rise further in the coming months as the increasing level of tariffs comes to bear on prices. Do you feel additional inflation increases as \" unwelcome ' also? I'm assuming not, given that you haven't mentioned it. It would be very nice if you could clarify this, as your statement either implies that you are going soft on inflation or that you are \" throwing your hat into the ring \" to be the next Fed chair\nFed failed in both the areas. Tech layoffs, bank layoffs, two major bank closures, record high inflation since 2022, incredible books cooking, printing money and pumping into wall street that created record highs and volatility, record government debt no body wants to own slipping dollar into 25% loss against Major currencies...

Next gen workforce disabled. And 25M US adults, growing with each reinfection, regardless of of vaccine. 3% unprecedented excess mortality rate per Swiss Re. People are still dying of Covid under the guise of heart attack, embolism, dementia, diabetes, and more bc Covid is vascular. When will the numbers get so bad it can\u2019t be ignored?"

      "text": "Costs were sharply on the rise for producers and manufacturers in July, a sign that higher prices could soon filter down to American consumers.\nUS inflation on the wholesale level picked up steam last month, with prices rising by the fastest monthly pace since June 2022, new data showed Thursday.\nThe latest Producer Price Index, which measures the average change in prices paid to producers, jumped 0.9% from June, lifting the annual rate to 3.3%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThe PPI serves as a potential bellwether for the prices consumers may see in the months ahead.\n\u201cProducers are starting to feel the inflation fire heat,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote Thursday. \u201cIt will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs on to the backs of inflation-weary consumers.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s readings far exceeded economists\u2019 expectations for prices would rise by just 0.2% in July and 2.4% annually.\nAnd considering the PPI covers the domestic output of goods and services and excludes imports, the potential consumer price inflationary impact could be underestimated, noted Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College.\nThe Dow fell 175 points, or 0.4%, at the opening bell on Thursday. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.35% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%. All three indexes mostly pared those losses later in the morning.\nEarlier this week, the Consumer Price Index for July showed that falling gas prices kept a lid on overall consumer price hikes but that tariff-sensitive goods continued to get more costly.\n\u201cThe large spike in PPI this morning shows inflation is coursing through the economy, even if it hasn\u2019t been felt by consumers yet,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. \u201cGiven how benign the CPI numbers were on Tuesday, this is a most unwelcome surprise to the upside and is likely to unwind some of the optimism of a \u2018guaranteed\u2019 rate cut next month.\u201d\nTraders pared their bets that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark lending rate at its September meeting.\nExcluding food and energy, core PPI also shot higher by 0.9%, sending the annual rate to 3.7%, the highest level since March.\nProduce prices spike\nPPI data typically has more variability and wild swings than CPI, and monthly economic data is volatile on its own.\nStill, shifts in certain PPI categories are being closely scrutinized to gauge how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are making their way through the production chain.\n\u201cThe concern with PPI is always that it could be a harbinger of inflation to come; and in that sense, this was not a good report,\u201d said Tyler Schipper, an associate professor in economics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nMore than three-quarters of the larger-than-expected monthly increase came from services, notably a sharp 4.5% upswing in purchased capital equipment prices.\n\u201cThe targeted area of tariffs, which has been industrial goods, the pricing pressures are now spilling over to the service sector,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, said in a phone interview. \u201c[Services increases] all imply pipeline pressures for inflation.\u201d\nOn the goods side, higher food prices were the biggest culprit behind a 0.7% monthly increase. Raw agricultural products leapt 12.8% highest from June; and within that, fresh and dry vegetables saw a 38.9% monthly price surge, which is the largest since March 2022.\n\u201cThat clearly tells me that the tariffs that were slapped on Mexican agricultural imports are coming home to roost,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nTariffs causing businesses to raise the prices they charge each other and how that could eventually show up in higher consumer prices over time does put \u201canother pebble on the scale\u201d against a Fed rate cut, Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.\nHowever, hotter-than-expected inflation data will take a back seat to what\u2019s happening in the labor market, Adams noted.\nThe jobs report for last month delivered a massive surprise: An estimated 73,000 jobs were added in July and there were substantial downward revisions for job growth in the two prior months. However, the unemployment rate has remained flat for much of the past year, in part due to fewer workers in the labor force.\n\u201cImmigration policy changes have caused a decline in the foreign-born workforce, and the pace of older workers exiting the labor force due to retirement or disability has picked up this year,\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cThat has slowed growth of the labor force and kept it more or less in line with growth of labor demand. We\u2019ll have to see which of these crosscutting forces dominates in the August jobs report, to be published on September 5.\u201d\nData cuts hitting PPI\nPPI is among a suite of monthly indicators viewed as crucial for gauging the health and trajectory of the US economy. However, this report lands at a time when the agency that produces the data is in flux.\nFollowing the lackluster July jobs report and its larger-than-average revisions, Trump fired the BLS commissioner and baselessly claimed that the data was \u201crigged.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the president nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist for the conservative Heritage Foundation, to helm the BLS.\nAntoni, who has received criticism from economists and organizations that rely heavily on economic data, caused a brief stir earlier this week when comments published that he considered suspending the monthly jobs report so the methodology could be adjusted. However, fellow Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore told CNN that Antoni will continue to publish monthly jobs numbers if he is confirmed for the role.\nIn addition to uncertain leadership, the BLS is one of many federal agencies that have been subjected to funding and workforce cuts under the Trump administration. Citing ongoing limitations in resources, the BLS has reduced collections in its CPI report and, starting in July\u2019s PPI, stopped calculating 350 indices.\n\u201cThe announced discontinued indexes represent less than 1 percent of the PPI. Their removal will have minimal impact on the accuracy of the PPI final demand index,\u201d Scott Sager, a PPI and BLS spokesperson, told CNN via email. \u201cBLS discontinues series when they can no longer be supported with existing resources.\u201d\nThe reduction in collections comes at a time when economists, former BLS commissioners, statisticians and other academics are pleading to Congress that the US statistical agencies receive more \u2014 not less \u2014 funding."

      "text": "The US job market slowed sharply in July and was substantially weaker than first estimated for prior months, suggesting President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy may be stifling hiring.\nThe US economy added just 73,000 jobs last month, and the monthly totals for May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs.\nThe prior two months\u2019 revisions were \u201cstunning,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, in an interview with CNN.\nMay\u2019s estimated 144,000 net gain was revised down by 125,000 to 19,000; and June\u2019s preliminary tally of 147,000 was slashed by 133,000 to 14,000, according to data released Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s stalling out right now,\u201d Swonk said of the labor market.\nWith those monumental, quarter-million-job downward revisions, the meager job gains in June were the weakest since December 2020, the last time the labor market had monthly job losses. The pace of job creation seen so far this year is the weakest in decades, outside of recessions.\n\u201cThis is absolutely the worst major economic report since the end of the pandemic era,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN.\nThe Dow opened lower, falling by more than 600 points, or 1.3%, by mid-morning. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.8%. Traders now expect an 85% chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in September, up from a 38% chance on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1%.\nTariffs are \u2018paralyzing\u2019 employers\nHigh uncertainty over Trump\u2019s economic policies \u2014 specifically a volatile trade policy and shifting tariff rates \u2014 have been blamed for putting a stranglehold on employers\u2019 growth plans.\n\u201cTariffs and uncertainty are paralyzing employers,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview.\nEconomists were expecting the report to show a slowdown in job growth, reflecting the weak pace of hiring across the vast majority of industries.\nForecasts called for a gain of 115,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%.\nHowever, economists weren\u2019t expecting the past three months to be this frail.\n\u201cThis (jobs report) is really bad because you can see the impact of trade and immigration policy hurting demand for hiring,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nHe noted that goods-producing industries lost 13,000 jobs, with 11,000 of those losses coming in manufacturing and construction posting weak gains of 2,000 jobs.\n\u201cThese trends reflect the ripple effects of trade and immigration policies impacting labor supply, especially where migrant workers are key,\u201d he added.\nIn recent months, despite the labor market registering solid (but slower) gains, economists were sounding some alarm bells: The all-important labor market churn was grinding to a halt, and a smaller and smaller subset of industries was responsible for the job gains.\nThat lack of breadth was wildly apparent in July: Health care and social assistance, which added 73,300 jobs, accounted for the entirety of the month\u2019s overall gains.\n\u201cThere was a three-legged stool holding up the labor market; we had state and local, leisure and hospitality, and health care and social assistance,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re down to one.\u201d\n\u201cA one-legged stool is dangerous,\u201d she added.\nLeisure and hospitality, which typically sees a summertime boom, added a meager 5,000 jobs in July. June\u2019s gains were revised down to 4,000, BLS data shows.\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost within the margin of error,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cThat reflects a slowdown in domestic travel and tourism.\u201d\nState and local government posted a meek 2,000-job net gain in July. And June\u2019s initially reported 80,000-job gain \u2014 which economists warned was likely an \u201cartificial\u201d increase that resulted from seasonal adjustments \u2014 was revised down to 20,000 jobs.\nAnd as for that labor market churn (or lack there of), Friday\u2019s jobs report showed that the average duration of unemployment rose to 24.1 weeks (north of six months), the lengthiest average span in more than three years.\nWhy is the jobs data revised?\nThe US labor force is shrinking. It\u2019s done so for three months in a row now, and in July, the unemployment rate rose as a result.\nThe civilian labor force is the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation (with the number of out-of-work job seekers being the numerator), so that\u2019s helped to push up the overall unemployment rate.\nBut before delving into labor market dynamics, it\u2019s worth stepping back and highlighting some of the nitty-gritty about how the jobs report is structured.\nThe BLS\u2019 monthly snapshot of the labor market is composed of two surveys: One of households (which provides demographic data and feeds into the all-important unemployment rate) and the other of businesses (designed to measure employment, hours and earnings).\nThe household survey, which provides demographic data and feeds into the unemployment rate, is considered more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. The establishment survey is responsible for the monthly estimates of how many jobs were added or lost.\nIt\u2019s important to note the \u201cestimates\u201d part of this: It is a survey after all, albeit a fairly robust one (the BLS surveys well north of 100,000 businesses and government agencies, representing roughly 629,000 individual worksites).\nWhen the market-moving jobs report is released, that initial estimate is often based on incomplete data and thus will be revised twice further in the two jobs reports that follow as the BLS receives more complete information from businesses.\nBut then it\u2019s eventually revised even further: The bigger, annual revision (which takes place each February jobs report) will come into focus starting next month when the preliminary annual benchmarking estimates are released.\nAnd, also keep in mind that the estimates seen in the jobs reports are adjusted to smooth out seasonal changes (think: construction jobs pick up in spring, schools are out for the summer). The adjustments anticipate a certain number of job losses or gains, so if the employment gains or losses fall outside those expectations, it can result in bigger or smaller employment gains.\nThe statistical refinements help smooth out the data to better understand underlying trends. These adjustments anticipate a certain number of job losses to start the year, so if fewer workers get let go than anticipated, that can result in bigger overall employment gains (and vice versa).\nWarning signs flashing\nKeeping the above context in mind, there were several potential warning signs in the July jobs report:\nBlack unemployment in America hit 7.2%, its highest level since October 2021.\nA rise in the Black unemployment rate almost always precedes the rise in the general population unemployment rate. That\u2019s because a higher percentage of Black Americans than Americans of other races are in temporary jobs or lower-income jobs that tend to be the first that employers cut when they grow concerned about the economy.\nThe labor force shrank for the third month in a row, which is the first time since 2011, according to Appcast economist Sam Kuhn. And the labor force participation rate fell to 62.2%, the lowest since November 2022.\nThe fall could be caused in part by stepped-up immigration enforcement; however, other factors such as an aging workforce, highly discouraged workers, and \u201csimply mismeasurement\u201d from lower response rates to the household survey could be factoring in to that equation, said Preston Caldwell, Morningstar\u2019s chief economist.\nThe foreign-born labor force has declined in recent months. In addition to the household survey response rate and volatility caveats, this one comes with another: Given the rhetoric and actions around immigration enforcement, workers (undocumented or not) are likely disinclined to share details about their immigration backgrounds with the federal government, Oliver Allen, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 senior US economist, told CNN in a recent interview.\nEconomists warn that a shrinking labor force and fewer foreign-born workers could put upward pressure on wages (and inflation), and result in hiring challenges for key industries and negative supply chain impacts as a result.\nThe 253,000 downward revisions to May and June was the largest since at least 1979 (with the exception of 2020), according to Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale.\nThe outsized correction is reflective of an extremely volatile economic environment, KPMG\u2019s Swonk said. \u201cThe data was meant for historic norms for an economy that typically moves more slowly.\u201d\nAll told, the July report showed a \u201cweaker underbelly for the US economy,\u201d said Daco.\n\u201cThis type of very weak job growth momentum is essentially eroding the economy\u2019s buffer against headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd and in an environment where the US economy is subject to historic supply shocks, that will essentially expose it to the risk of a recession.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed to this report."

      "text": "It took only a few days for the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest decision on interest rates to age like milk.\nThe central bank on Wednesday said it was holding borrowing costs steady yet again, extending a wait-and-see pattern that began in January. That same day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that a \u201csolid\u201d labor market means central bankers still have the luxury of waiting to see how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs affect prices before resuming rate cuts that could help boost jobs but could also reignite inflation.\nJust two days later, it turned out that the job market is on shakier ground than Powell had suggested. It may take a bit more time to know if that\u2019s really the case.\nBut the Fed may walk away with egg on its face.\nOn Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, well below the threshold of monthly job growth necessary to keep up with population growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%.\nAnd the monthly report was even worse than it seems: The Labor Department also massively revised downward the job gains for the prior two months.\nIt\u2019s now clear that job growth has been anemic, based on the newly revised data: The average pace of monthly job growth from May through July was the weakest than any other three-month period since 2009, outside of the pandemic recession in 2020.\nThe Fed declined CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\u201cPowell is going to regret holding rates steady this week,\u201d Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said in commentary issued Friday.\nBut not everyone at the Fed shared Powell\u2019s view on the labor market. The Fed\u2019s latest decision generated pushback from within like it hasn\u2019t seen in decades.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman cast dissenting votes, marking the first time that more than one Fed governor has done so since 1993.\nIn statements issued Friday, both officials pointed to signs of weakness in labor market as a major reason why they dissented, while downplaying the potential effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs on prices. The Fed is tasked by Congress to address both high inflation and a weakening labor market.\n\u201cThe labor market has become less dynamic and shows increasing signs of fragility,\u201d Bowman wrote, adding that just few industries have propelled job growth this year, which remained the case in July, according to the latest data.\nStill, it may be too soon to conclude that the Fed has royally screwed up.\n\u201cIt was a disappointing report to be sure, but when I look at the data, we try not to make too much out of any one individual report,\u201d Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack told Bloomberg on Friday after the July jobs report was released. \u201cI feel confident with the decision we made earlier this week.\u201d\nLast year, after the unemployment rate climbed quickly in a short period of time and there were similar calls that the central bank was too late to lower rates, the Fed stepped in with a bold, half-point rate cut to stave off any further weakening.\nBy the end of last year, it turned out that the labor market wasn\u2019t falling off a cliff: In December, employers added a massive 323,000 jobs as the unemployment rate edged down from the prior month to 4.1%.\nThis story has been updated with additional content."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on a top policymaker at the Federal Reserve to resign, after one of his allies alleged that she committed mortgage fraud.\nIn a letter dated August 15, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate a pair of mortgages taken out in recent years by Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\nOn Wednesday, Trump referenced those allegations on his social media platform, writing that \u201cCook must resign, now!!!\u201d\nBut Cook pushed back on calls to resign, saying she would not be pushed out of the Fed.\n\u201cI learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve,\u201d Cook wrote in a statement.\n\u201cI have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet. I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\u201d she added.\nPulte, a vocal Trump ally, has frequently criticized the Fed and its leader, Chair Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates. He also called for closer scrutiny of the central bank\u2019s costly refurbishment of its Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\u201cShe needs to explain herself, but it\u2019s all there in black and white,\u201d Pulte said in a phone interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think she needs to resign quickly.\u201d\nThe new focus on Cook is an expansion of the Trump administration\u2019s intense pressure campaign against the Fed, specifically central bankers who aren\u2019t perceived as allies of the president.\nTrump is still loudly demanding the Fed lower interest rates, continuing to bash Powell with the moniker \u201cToo Late.\u201d After raising rates in recent years to fight pandemic inflation that reached 40-year highs in 2022, the central bank started to cut its benchmark lending rate last fall. While inflation earlier this year hovered close to the bank\u2019s target rate of 2%, central bankers have paused further rate cuts while they ascertain the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nIn the letter, which Pulte posted on social media, he alleged that Cook, a Biden appointee, \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.\u201d\nPulte refers to a mortgage Cook took out in June 2021 to purchase a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which stipulated it would be her primary home address for at least a year, according to the letter. Cook then took out another mortgage in Georgia two weeks later, Pulte said, also declaring that property as her primary home address. Cook\u2019s Georgia home was later listed as a rental, according to Pulte.\nThe housing official has functioned as a reliable attack dog for the Trump administration, routinely taking to social media to berate Powell, essentially around the clock. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has criticized Pulte\u2019s incessant use of social media for political attacks.\nBut Pulte told CNBC that his call for Cook to resign was apolitical.\n\u201cThere can be no mortgage fraud. This came across our desk, and it\u2019s my duty to report it,\u201d Pulte said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if she were a Republican or a Democrat. It is what it is.\u201d\nThe Fed declined CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nAs Cook faces pressure, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to soon consider Trump\u2019s nomination of Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill the vacancy on the central bank\u2019s board left by Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee.\n\u201cWe see a window for the Senate to confirm Stephen Miran as a Fed governor, but question if Lisa Cook has an incentive to resign before the meeting. Either way, we see limited impact as the (Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee\u2019s) membership is broader than just Federal Reserve Board members,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in commentary issued Wednesday.\n\u201cFor Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next (Fed) meeting,\u201d he said.\nIf Cook were to resign from the Fed\u2019s board, that would leave only two governors appointed solely by a Democratic president out of a total of seven seats: Fed Governor Michael Barr and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. Kugler stepped down from her governor position earlier this month. Powell has been appointed to Fed roles by Democratic and Republican presidents, and his term as chair ends in May 2026, though his position as a governor stretches to 2028.\nCook is the first Black woman appointed to the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attacks come as Fed policymakers convene in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for an annual economics symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, seen as a major event for the world\u2019s central bankers and US monetary policy.\nDuring his keynote speech at the conference, Powell is widely expected to signal long-awaited rate cuts in the second half of the year, citing fragility in the labor market, which is the theme of the symposium. Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 83% chance of a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s September meeting, according to futures.\nSince Trump began his second term, Powell has resisted the president\u2019s demands to lower rates and has mostly refrained from responding to his personal attacks. Trump recently backed off from his threats to fire Powell, though it would have led to an uphill battle in the courts if he were to try.\n\u201cIt looks to me like the administration is admitting they can\u2019t push Powell out or push him around,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. \u201cMoreover, they realize that even when they appoint his successor, there is no guarantee they achieve their preferred policy outcome.\u201d\n\u201cThey are going to need to create the conditions where they can replace enough members to get the votes they want,\u201d he added.\nCNN\u2019s David Goldman and Matt Egan contributed to this report."
