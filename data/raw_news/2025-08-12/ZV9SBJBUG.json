  "title": "Here's Why Adient (ADNT) is a Strong Value Stock",
  "description": "Whether you're a value, growth, or momentum investor, finding strong stocks becomes easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a top feature of the Zacks Premium research service.",
  "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +23.75% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nDublin, Ireland-based Adient PLC is one of the world\u2019s largest automotive seating suppliers. Adient maintains longstanding relationships with the largest global auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company\u2019s technologies extend to virtually every area of automotive seating solutions.\n\nADNT is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 11.64; value investors should take notice.\n\nThree analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.14 to $1.87 per share. ADNT also boasts an average earnings surprise of +18.3%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, ADNT should be on investors' short list.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss Out on These Stocks\n\nBefore you make your next investing move, we have a free report that highlights the %%CTA_TEXT%% to buy.\n\nOur experts at Zacks Investment Research hand-selected these stocks for their eye-opening growth projections.\n\nSince 1988, our stock picks have more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.89% per year using the Zacks Rank stock-rating system.\n\nRegister now to see the %%CTA_TEXT%%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
