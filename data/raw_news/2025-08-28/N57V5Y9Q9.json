  "content": "Denzel Washington might have lost count of the number of movies he has starred in, but when it comes to how many films he watches, it\u2019s a quick calculation. The answer is none.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch movies, man. I really don\u2019t,\u201d the two-time Oscar winner said in a conversation with A$AP Rocky and Spike Lee for a recent GQ video.\n\nAfter a bent-over chuckle from the rapper and laughs from the film director, Washington continued, \u201cI\u2019m just being honest with you. I don\u2019t watch movies, man. I don\u2019t go to the movies. I don\u2019t watch movies.\u201d\n\nA$AP Rocky then asked the 70-year-old if that is because he makes movies.\n\nLee then chimed in to ask how many films Washington had made, and the actor had a quick response: \u201cToo many.\u201d\n\nHe then pondered, \u201cI think 50.\u201d\n\nWashington and Rocky both star in Lee\u2019s neo-noir crime thriller \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which is out in cinemas in the US and will air on AppleTV+ next month.\n\nIn the chat, Rocky recounted starring in Anthony Mandler\u2019s 2018 crime drama \u201cMonster\u201d with Washington\u2019s son John David, and appeared to surprise Washington with his friendship with his son.\n\n\u201cI made really good friends with your son, John David. Really good friends and he\u2019s a really good brother,\u201d Rocky said.\n\n\u201cSo, you and John David are tight?\u201d Washington asked, before receiving yet another chuckle from Rocky.\n\nWashington reassured Rocky that he knows they were in the film together, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know y\u2019all were tight tight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Washington\u2019s fifth collaboration with Lee, with the first one being 1990 drama \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues.\u201d\n\nAsked by Rocky what his favorite piece is with Lee, the actor said, \u201cI don\u2019t have favorites. I always tell people \u2013 they say, \u2018What\u2019s your favorite movie?\u2019 I say, \u2018My next one.\u2019 I\u2019m not interested in the past. Actually, I\u2019ve never seen \u2018Mo\u2019 Better\u2019 since.\u201d\n\nTo which Lee then questioned, \u201cSince the premiere?\u201d\n\nAsked by Lee if that is the case with all his films, Washington revealed, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of \u2018em from top to bottom.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s upcoming projects include Netflix heist movie \u201cHere Comes the Flood,\u201d which he will star in alongside English actors Robert Pattinson and Daisy Edgar-Jones.",

      "text": "Landing somewhere between sequel and reboot, \u201cTwisters\u201d introduces new characters and an extra letter to the 1996 disaster movie but not much else, leaving its stars stranded in a vehicle with roughly the weight of a stiff breeze. Impressive visual effects only go so far, though they at least provide a necessary distraction to the heightened awareness of climate change baked into the premise.\nAfter \u201cAnyone But You\u201d and \u201cHit Man,\u201d Glen Powell serves as the biggest marketing come-on beyond the chance to see wanton destruction, but despite opportunities to flash that million-dollar smile, it\u2019s not really his movie. The core story, rather, belongs to Daisy Edgar-Jones (\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d), playing the brilliant scientist lured back into the storm-chasing game after a tragic setback.\nEdgar-Jones\u2019 Kate Carter has taken refuge in New York after pursuing potentially groundbreaking research for the Tornado Tamer Project, an attempt to do the original movie\u2019s premise one better by actually employing state-of-the-art technology to reduce massive tornadoes.\nThose perilous efforts have lain dormant, however, when she\u2019s approached by former colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos), who has found well-heeled sponsorship for his own storm-measuring device, flanked by an associate (\u201cSuperman\u201d-to-be David Corenswet) who gives off a decided \u201cDon\u2019t trust that dude\u201d vibe.\nBack in the field, Kate encounters Tyler Owens (Powell), a rambunctious tornado \u201cwrangler\u201d who cashes in chasing storms and posting the content he films to his popular YouTube channel. Yet while there\u2019s tension between her altruistic focus on science and his commodification of disasters, underscored by the neophytes with whom they cross paths, in this kind of movie handsome clouds tend to have silver linings.\nAfter earning well-deserved praise for the character-driven independent film \u201cMinari,\u201d director Lee Isaac Chung tackles this major-studio assignment without bringing anything particularly distinctive to it, relying a little too much on how good his leads look wet and sweaty. That extends to the posse of supporting players in Kate/Javi and Tyler\u2019s respective camps, which try to match the zany daredevil antics associated with the earlier film but generally fall short.\nIndeed, the notably clever moments prove few and far between, from a reference to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to a sequence involving a movie theater, which a cynic might see as a metaphor for the stormy state of the industry.\nAs noted, the most salient wrinkle isn\u2019t particularly helpful in viewing the movie as light escapism \u2013 namely, illustrating the devastating impact of tornadoes on communities, and an increase in extreme weather that has become more alarming and dire as filtered through our news-saturated culture. (\u201cTwister,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting, premiered the same year that Fox News and MSNBC signed on.)\nFrankly, this \u201cTwister\u201d revisitation might have been better served by following the old title with an exclamation point instead of an \u201cS.\u201d Either way, the assignment of replicating the first movie\u2019s appeal would have presented a challenge, but \u201cTwisters\u201d makes that task harder due to headwinds entirely of its own making.\n\u201cTwisters\u201d premieres July 19 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated PG-13."

      "text": "Denzel Washington knows \u201call money ain\u2019t good money\u201d \u2013 but sometimes you\u2019ve got to put food on the table.\nThe tag line for Spike Lee\u2019s latest film \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d in which Washington stars as a music mogul caught in a ransom plot on the eve of a big business deal, had the two-time Oscar winner reflecting on past money jobs in an interview with CNN.\n\u201cMy mother used to say, \u2018Do what you gotta do, so that you can do what you want to do\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not the other way around,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cWhen we had four children, I was doing stuff I had to do. You go back and look in the mid-\u201990s \u2013 I won\u2019t mention any movies, I\u2019ll just say the mid-\u201990s, around there.\u201d\n\u201cA couple (of movies) for the kids?\u201d chimed in Jeffrey Wright, Washington\u2019s co-star.\n\u201cMore than a couple for the kids \u2013 and the wife, and the house, and the bank, and everybody else,\u201d Washington replied.\nA quick sweep of his credits around then and you\u2019ll find a few duds, sure, but there\u2019s also \u201cCrimson Tide,\u201d \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d (surely he doesn\u2019t mean these). And at either end of the \u201990s, two Spike Lee collaborations, \u201cHe Got Game\u201d (1998) and their masterpiece, \u201cMalcolm X\u201d (1992). Washington\u2019s career has been nothing if not consistently packed with gems. As for his kids, the money jobs paid dividends: John David and Olivia are successful actors, Malcolm a film director, and Katia is a producer.\n\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together. The actor brought the script, a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa classic \u201cHigh To Low\u201d (1963) \u2013 itself based on 1959 novel \u201cKing\u2019s Ransom\u201d by Evan Hunter \u2013 to the director, for what would be their first collaboration since 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d\nTransposing the story of a Japanese shoe executive to the New York music business, many of the key elements remain. Washington\u2019s record exec David King believes his son has been kidnapped, only to learn the kidnapper (A$AP Rocky) has mistakenly taken the son of his chauffer Paul (Jeffrey Wright). Should King still pay the ransom, even if it drains his bank accounts, scuppering plans for him to buy back control of his company? What was a clear-cut decision when he thought it was his own flesh and blood is muddied when it\u2019s someone else\u2019s child.\nInterestingly, there\u2019s more than a little of Spike Lee in David. Both are cultural titans at a stage in their careers when they\u2019re weighing their legacy with an unquenchable thirst to create. Both are balancing art and commerce, and the event horizon of tech pulling their industries in new directions. Both happen to have exquisite personal art collections \u2013 in fact, the production made copies of paintings by Jean-Paul Basquiat, Tim Okamura and Kehinde Wiley, among others, which really do belong to Lee.\nBut whereas Lee has embraced his industry\u2019s newest players \u2013 \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d was distributed by Netflix in 2020, and \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d will debut on Apple TV+ after A24 distributes theatrically \u2013 King is a leerier of tech disruption. He rails at soulless AI-generated music, new artists trying to gain a following on social media, and his son\u2019s Instagram addiction.\n\u201cI think we\u2019d all be better off without those addictives in our lives,\u201d offered Wright. \u201cWe were promised harmony; that technology was going to make us wiser, more democratic, more peaceful. That has not been the case. In fact, it\u2019s been the opposite. I think it\u2019s something we should give some thought to: Where are we going with all this?\u201d\nDoes Washington share any of the same concerns as his character? In a word: no.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t affect me to the degree that they affect the character, because I don\u2019t rely on those things for my happiness or my peace,\u201d he reflected. \u201cI don\u2019t make money off those kinds of things.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be known, you know? I like being quiet,\u201d he added.\nThe acting legend, who was baptized and became a minister at the end of 2024, has entered his zen era, content to reel off aphorisms about fame and filmmaking; taking shots while walking backwards into his own mystique.\n\u201cIf they see you for free all week, they won\u2019t pay for you at the weekend,\u201d he said. It\u2019s the same warning he reportedly gave to Michael B. Jordan about the danger of movie star over-exposure.\nSo no, don\u2019t go looking for him on Instagram, or anywhere else but the big (or small) screen.\n\u201cAll those so-called Instagram accounts, if my name is connected it, you\u2019ve been had. You\u2019ve been took. Hoodwinked. Bamboozled,\u201d he said, gleefully.\n\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is released in US cinemas on August 15 before debuting on AppleTV+ on September 5."
