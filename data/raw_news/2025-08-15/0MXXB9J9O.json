  "content": "Smart ring maker Ultrahuman is acquiring women\u2019s health technology company viO HealthTech to launch advanced cycle and ovulation tracking, the company announced on Friday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThanks to the acquisition, the company is launching a new plug-in for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called \u201cCycle and Ovulation Pro.\u201d The plug-in will allow users to accurately track their cycles, get fertility planning support with ovulation confirmation, and detect patterns like early or late ovulation. The plug-in also allows users to log moods, symptoms, and more to uncover long-term wellness trends.\n\nCycle and Ovulation Pro uses a temperature-sensing algorithm originally developed for viO\u2019s OvuSense fertility monitors. The technology was developed over 15 years and trained on a dataset of over 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, Ultrahuman notes.\n\nWith the Ultrahuman Ring AIR, the technology enables cycle tracking via the finger to allow for personalized insights that adapt over time and a better understanding of users\u2019 cycles.\n\n\u201cMost menstrual tracking platforms are built for women with regular 28-day cycles,\u201d Ultrahuman wrote in a press release. \u201cIn reality, the majority have diverse cycle patterns \u2013 and those with conditions like non-bleeding, PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders often don\u2019t get an accurate or supportive experience. Ultrahuman\u2019s acquisition of viO is designed for them.\u201d\n\nUltrahuman notes that the existing free Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug, which offers foundational tracking tools and calendar-based predictions, will remain available.\n\n\u201cWearables will shape the future of health\u201d, said Rob Milnes, CEO of viO HealthTech, in a press release. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be able to bring OvuSense women\u2019s health insights to a significantly wider audience via the Ultrahuman Ring AIR.\u201d\n\nCycle and Ovulation Pro is available starting Friday as a premium PowerPlug in the Ultrahuman app for $3.99 per month or $39.99 per year for users in the U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, and Canada. The company plans to release it in more regions in the future.",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
