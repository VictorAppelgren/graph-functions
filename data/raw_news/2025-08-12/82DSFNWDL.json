  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Even with many of its top stars sidelined, the WNBA has still had strong ratings and attendance numbers this season. Injuries have kept Caitlin Clark, Breanna Stewart, Napheesa Collier and Angel Reese out, but that hasn\u2019t dampened fan interest in the league. ESPN games are up slightly over last season and games on ABC are up 17%. Attendance has also still been strong, thanks to the addition of the Golden State Valkyries this season, who have sold out all of their home games, averaging more than 18,000 fans.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not all been rosy for the league with negative attention coming towards the WNBA with a number of sex toys being thrown on the court at various arenas over a two-week span. That has subsided over the last few days.\n\nMinnesota has won all three games without Collier \u2014 the MVP frontrunner \u2014 who is sidelined with a right ankle sprain, to remain in first place in the standings, increasing their lead to 6 1/2 games over New York and Atlanta.\n\nIndiana has gone 6-2 over its last eight games without Clark, who has been out for nearly a month with a right groin injury. She is progressing from the injury but still is not practicing.\n\nThe second-year guard told Sue Bird on her podcast that she feels a level of \u201cresponsibility\u201d to play, knowing that so many people have been drawn to the league because of her.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s definitely been hard. I\u2019m going to go to every road game no matter what, whether I\u2019m playing or not. It\u2019s hard because obviously I do feel this responsibility of being out there and playing,\u201d Clark said.\n\nNew York has been up and down without Stewart, who said she plans to be back by the end of the month from a bone bruise in her right knee.\n\nThe Seattle Storm will unveil a statue of Sue Bird on Saturday before the team faces Phoenix on Sunday. Seattle is the first franchise in WNBA history to dedicate a statue to a former player. Early next month, Bird will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nMinnesota remained the No. 1 team in the poll with Atlanta and New York still behind the Lynx. Phoenix and Las Vegas followed the Liberty. The Aces are riding a four-game winning streak. Indiana, Los Angeles and Golden State are next. Seattle fell to ninth as the Storm have lost five straight games. Washington and Dallas came after the Storm with Chicago and Connecticut rounding out the poll.\n\nA\u2019ja Wilson of Las Vegas was the AP player of the week after averaging 25.3 points, 13 rebounds and 3.7 assists to help the Aces win all three of their games last week. She had the first 30-point, 20-rebound game in league history in a win over Connecticut on Sunday. Other players receiving votes included Kelsey Plum of Los Angeles and Alyssa Thomas of Phoenix.\n\nNew York at Minnesota, Saturday. The Lynx beat the Liberty in New York last Sunday and now don't play again until the two teams tip off in Minnesota. New York has back-to-back games in Los Angeles and Las Vegas before heading to Minnesota.",

The Fever forward jumped back in surprise and then Kelsey Plum kicked it into the stands.\n\u201cI think its ridiculous, it\u2019s dumb, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s also dangerous and players\u2019 safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things. I think it\u2019s really stupid.\u201d\nPlum added that she thought both teams did a great job \u201cplaying on, don\u2019t give it any attention. The refs too, I really appreciate them too, was just like hey let\u2019s go.\u201d\nCunningham walked over to the Sparks bench and was laughing about it.\nCunningham had expressed concern on social media about the incidents, saying \u201cyou\u2019re going to hurt one of us.\u201d\nAccording to social media posts, green toys were also thrown in Phoenix and New York, but didn\u2019t reach the court. The one at Barclays Center landed near a child.\nA week ago the first incident occurred in Atlanta late in the fourth quarter of the Dream\u2019s game against Golden State in College Park, Georgia. A fan was arrested, according to the WNBA, and was ejected from the arena and faced a minimum one-year ban.\nOn Friday, another sex toy was thrown in Chicago under a basket after a whistle was blown to stop play during the third quarter of Golden State\u2019s 73-66 victory over the Sky. An official kicked the object aside before it was picked up and removed.\nIt\u2019s unknown if the fan who threw the object at the Sky game was arrested.\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of everyone in our arenas is a top priority for our league. Objects of any kind thrown onto the court or in the seating area can pose a safety risk for players, game officials, and fans,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cIn line with WNBA Arena Security Standards, any fan who intentionally throws an object onto the court will be immediately ejected and face a minimum one-year ban in addition to being subject to arrest and prosecution by local authorities.\u201d\n___"

      "text": "Minnesota Lynx to face New York Liberty in 3 straight games in scheduling quirk\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Minnesota Lynx have three straight games against the New York Liberty due to a scheduling quirk.\nA rematch of last season\u2019s WNBA Finals feels in some ways like a playoff series for the Lynx, who beat the Liberty on Sunday 83-71 before traveling home. The team doesn\u2019t play again until hosting New York on Saturday. The Lynx then return to Barclays Center to face the Liberty on Aug. 19, playing three times in nine days.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird schedule, three games in nine days,\u201d Minnesota guard Kayla McBride said. \u201cYou get to know a team and what they like to do.\u201d\nNew York doesn\u2019t have the same luxury, heading west for back-to-back games against Los Angeles and Las Vegas on Tuesday and Wednesday before traveling to play Minnesota for the home and home set.\n\u201cIt would have been nice to have it be spread out a little bit,\u201d New York coach Sandy Brondello said. \u201cIt\u2019s a series with a few games extra for us, not for them.\u201d\nThis is the fifth time since 2013 that one team has played another in three straight games in the regular season, according to Stats Perform. New York and Las Vegas played three straight games against each other in 2022. The year before the Lynx had three consecutive matchups against Indiana.\nA number of factors go into scheduling such as arena availability.\nThe two teams will have played four times over a three-week stretch with Minnesota winning the first matchup at home on July 30.\nNew York star Breanna Stewart will most likely miss all of the games while recovering from a bone bruise in her right knee. Minnesota\u2019s Napheesa Collier, who is a front-runner for the MVP this season, was out for Sunday\u2019s matchup while dealing with a sprained right ankle. She might miss the next two meetings as well as she recovers.\n\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen with teams and like the league didn\u2019t know that Phee and I were both going to be out,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cYou want to see everybody full throttle. That\u2019s the first game of the season or the second or the third, not August.\u201d\nMinnesota (27-5) currently has the best record in the WNBA with New York 6 1/2 games behind.\n___"

I just finished working out on the court in the back,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really just kind of giving my leg, the bone a little bit of time while we have it. But hoping to be back sooner than later and really just wanting to be back with my team.\u201d\nStewart has been rehabbing the injury and Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said she thought her star forward could be back by the end of August.\n\u201cI feel like this is the hardest part for me because I\u2019ve been out. Like I\u2019ve been out, but I\u2019m not usually out when I can go back in. So I want to be back,\u201d Stewart said.\nOne non-negotiable Stewart said was that she wanted to be back before her birthday on Aug. 27.\n\u201cI\u2019m on the training staff to let me be back to free me a little bit. But definitely, like, before my birthday,\u201d she said.\nStewart celebrated her daughter Ruby\u2019s fourth birthday on Saturday, taking her to a trampoline park.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on being injured, so it\u2019s a little bit less than ideal,\u201d she said.\nStewart felt the injury in her knee in the loss to Los Angeles. She had three points and a rebound.\n\u201c\u201dIt was like when I stepped, I just like felt something in my knee a little bit, but I don\u2019t know, I think I just irritated it,\u201d she said.\nA seven-time All-Star, Stewart is averaging 18.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists. Stewart was disappointed that she will miss all the games with Minnesota in a WNBA Finals rematch as the two teams play four times in a three-week span that Stewart is out for.\n\u201cI hate this, but I\u2019ll be on the bench,\u201d she said.\n___"

It was her 14th double-double of the season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said Wilson, who registered her 30th career 30-point game and sixth this season. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know, as many greats as we have in this league, it\u2019s kind of a shocker that it\u2019s just now happening. It\u2019s a blessing. I love what I do. I love what I do. I love it so much, so anytime that I can come out and just play basketball the way that I love it, and the team, and we\u2019re all getting involved \u2014 I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d\nTeammate Jackie Young said Wilson never ceases to amaze.\n\u201cEvery night she shows up, and I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s so great at what she does,\u201d Young said. \u201cShe\u2019s a super hard worker, so it\u2019s cool to see her hard work pay off. At the same time, they\u2019re bringing double teams to her, triple teams to her, and she\u2019s having to navigate that and play out of it. She\u2019s still able to put up insane numbers every night.\u201d\nWilson, who this season became the fastest and second-youngest player to score 5,000 career points, ranks first for 30-point games since entering the league in 2018.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool to have my name in the record books when it comes to that,\u201d said Wilson, who turned 29 on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s going to be a lot following up. So yeah, it\u2019s pretty cool to kind of be the first one.\u201d\n____"
