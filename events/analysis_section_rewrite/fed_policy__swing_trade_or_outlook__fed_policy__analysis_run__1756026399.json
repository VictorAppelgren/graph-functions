      "feedback": "Solid framework and evidence base, but to reach world-class quality you should tighten structure, sharpen causality, and harden triggers. What to fix in one compact pass: (1) Make Movers & Scenarios strictly four lines with exact fields: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and ensure each line reads crisply (avoid overlong prose). The Up 0–3 weeks line and Down 0–3 weeks line should be concise, with a single, atomic Driver/Mechanism (e.g., “Policy easing path with Jackson Hole as signal” vs “hawkish surprises”) and a tight watchlist item (CPI/wages, BoJ signaling). (2) Embed a first-principles causal chain in each line: how policy, financial conditions, real yields, dollar, and risk assets feed the mover; e.g., “easing → easier financial conditions → lower real yields → weaker dollar → AI/tech cycle gains.” Link each line to one or two observable triggers (data prints, central-bank commentary, cross‑border signals) and assign a probability grounded in the material (cite IDs after facts). (3) Explicitly pair each scenario with an invalidation or guardrail and, if possible, a numeric trigger (e.g., CPI print deviating from a stated range, a regional yield move beyond a threshold). Right now, the four lines lack formal invalidations in the Movers set and could be strengthened by concise thresholds. (4) For quantification, push precise numbers and ranges from the material into the lines (e.g., “~25bp cut in September,” “Fed easing path 150–175bp,” “Tencent AI spend +150% YoY,” “ACMR revenue guide $850–$950m,” etc.) and attach the corresponding source IDs to those numbers. (5) Audit citation density: ensure every material-number claim has a source ID; avoid implied facts without a citation. Reconcile conflicts by noting, where relevant, the observable tension (e.g., a base-case pricing-in of modest cuts vs. a policy-path contest) within the movers rather than in an appendix. (6) Trade/Outlook Plan: if ACMR remains tradable, keep 1–2 Swing Trade lines with strict fields (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100); the current Long/Short ACMR lines largely meet this but could be tightened to a single, high-signal line (or two if you keep both sides) with clearly defined entry/exit events and explicit invalidation tied to the macro scenario you adjudicate as most probable. (7) Clean up formatting and consistency: unify date formats, ensure numeric punctuation is uniform, and ensure every line uses only IDs present in the SOURCE MATERIAL; avoid introducing new IDs or extraneous narrative. (8) If you keep the longer contextual sections (baseline, alt scenarios, catalysts), move them to an appendix or a preface, but ensure the main four lines stay as the actionable core. After these edits, you’ll have a tightly reasoned, first-principles, scenario-driven Swing Trade/Outlook that is immediately usable and audit-able against the cited material.",
