      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid start but falls short of world‑class rigor. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each macro driver to a concrete semiconductor‑specific impact (e.g., CPI → higher input costs → margin squeeze; oil oversupply → lower energy cost but weaker industrial demand). Add a two‑tier structure: **Current** (Fed’s 25 bp hike cycle, CPI 2.7 % YoY, IEA’s +2.5 m bpd supply in 2025) and **Medium** (Fed’s projected 4‑5 % rate hike path, oil inventory build‑down, potential policy shifts). Quantify every claim: cite the Fed’s 25 bp hikes (source ID), the 2.5 m bpd supply forecast (J99EM2TPZ), and the 2.7 % CPI rise (LZG5YWQMC). Integrate the remaining sources: note Intel’s 20 % workforce cut and potential government stake (Intel CEO Management source) as a supply‑chain risk; mention cannabis rescheduling (Marijuana Rescheduling source) as a potential upside for ancillary tech (e.g., packaging). Provide a concise watch‑list with dates: CPI July 2025, Fed minutes Aug 2025, weekly oil inventories, S&P 200‑day MA crossing. Add valuation anchors: Intel’s P/E vs. sector median, EV/EBITDA trend, and technical support at $110. Reconcile any conflicting signals (e.g., lower oil prices vs. weaker demand) by weighting them in a scenario matrix. Finally, ensure every claim is backed by a source ID and that all critical sources are cited. This will elevate depth, clarity, and actionable insight.",
