  "content": "Eric Trump plans to visit Japan next month as the Trump family continues to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency space, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe son of the U.S. President is scheduled to attend the September 1 shareholder meeting of Metaplanet Inc., a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company modeled on Michael Saylor's Strategy Inc.\n\nMetaplanet, formerly a hotel operator, pivoted to Bitcoin accumulation in early 2024, using business profits to build its holdings.\n\nThe company says it holds more than $2.1 billion in Bitcoin. Eric Trump was appointed as a strategic adviser to Metaplanet in March.\n\nNews of his planned trip to Tokyo helped Metaplanet shares recover, with the stock reversing earlier losses to gain nearly 2.1% on Friday, according to Bloomberg. Although volatile, the stock has surged almost 800% in the past year, even after falling by more than half from its peak in June.\n\nThe upcoming shareholder meeting will include a vote on new capital-raising measures, with Trump expected to attend. His Tokyo visit will follow closely after his participation in the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong on August 28\u201329.\n\nThe move highlights the Trump family's growing involvement in digital assets. A Las Vegas-based firm tied to Trump associates recently announced a $1.5 billion deal to transition into a crypto treasury, including tokens linked to World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated venture.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, disclosed earlier this year that it had accumulated more than $2 billion in Bitcoin.\n\nSeparately, cryptocurrency miner American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is pursuing acquisitions in Asia, targeting listed firms in Japan and possibly Hong Kong.\n\nThe developments come as Japan continues to embrace digital assets, marked by regulators approving the country's first yen-denominated stablecoin on August 18 and the upcoming WebX2025 forum, where Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is expected to speak.\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 23, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.

Pointing to conversion efforts taking place in South America and Africa,\" he said that Western Union is seeking partnerships related to on-ramps and off-ramps for the purchase and sale of stablecoins. He added:\n\"Well, we're already innovating in several places in the world on moving money and settling, so both in South America and in Africa, we are innovating our settlement processes to move money quicker and to more easily convert into local currency in partnerships with some of the infrastructure companies you had on this show.\"\nThe move coincides with the increasing importance of digital services to the company's business, believes McGranahan.\nNext evolution\nDigital fund transfers account for $1 billion of Western Union's revenue and are expanding more quickly than its traditional retail segment. Still, retail performance can't be measured only in terms of a cash-based business, McGranahan said.\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nWith the recent passage of President Donald Trump's \u2018the big, beautiful bill,' which increases access to finance, customers frequently fund transactions from bank accounts or cards, said the 55-year-old CEO. He added:\n\"The same is true on the payout side, our payout to account, payout to digital wallet business around the world is growing north of 30% in almost all geographies, so we see the value proposition more about funding and paying out regardless of whether the person wants to do it from their app or they want to do it in a retail location.\"\nWith 60% of business now international, Western Union sees future growth in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. \"We've been adapting for 175 years,\" McGranahan said. \"Stablecoins are just the next evolution.\"\n175-year-old payment giant has a strong message on stablecoins first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 22, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 22, 2025, where it first appeared."

      "text": "Michael Saylor and Senator Lummis send a hard-nosed response on 'double taxation' originally appeared on TheStreet.\nStrategy's Michael Saylor and U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) are actively seeking reform to what Saylor calls the \"unfair\" double taxation of Bitcoin miners and stakers.\nLummis explained how the current tax regime creates a situation where miners suffer taxation twice for the same reward \u2014 once when they receive block rewards and again when they sell the rewards.\nBitcoin mining is the process of using computing power to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to verify transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.\nMiners are taxed twice, once when they get new coins as a reward and again when they sell them.\nJoin the discussion with WendyO on Roundtable here.\nOn X, Lummis wrote,\n\"For years, miners and stakers have been taxed TWICE. Once when they receive block rewards, and again when they sell it. It's time to stop this unfair tax treatment and ensure America is the world's Bitcoin and Crypto Superpower.\"\nSoon after, Saylor jumped into the conversation, saying, \"We must end unfair taxes on BTC miners if America is going to be the world's Bitcoin Superpower.\"\nAccording to Cryptoquant, Bitcoin miners are earning the least they have in a year, but the majority still refuse to sell their coins. Miner income fell to $34 million on June 22, the lowest since April 20, as lower transaction fees and a lower Bitcoin price reduced revenues.\nThe slump is attributed to declining Ordinal inscription activity, which had previously raised fees throughout the quarter. The firm's Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability score now classifies miners as \"extremely underpaid.\"\nMichael Saylor and Senator Lummis send a hard-nosed response on 'double taxation' first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 30, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 30, 2025, where it first appeared."

TMTG controls the social networking app Truth Social, the streaming platform Truth+, and the fintech brand Truth.Fi.\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nTMTG\u2019s Bitcoin holdings now account for two-thirds of its total liquid assets of roughly $3 billion.

He further noted that the company plans to rigorously implement its bitcoin strategy and create a utility token to work across the Truth Social ecosystem in the coming future.\nGiven that Trump is the largest shareholder in TMTG, the company is likely to continue engaging with cryptocurrencies moving forward.\nOn July 8, the company indicated its plan to launch the \"Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip\". The firm has already submitted a filing regarding the same to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDuring his presidential campaign last year, Trump vowed to transform the U.S. into \"the crypto capital of the world.\""

The pivot caught the attention of markets and investors alike, especially with one big name surfacing in recent regulatory filings: Donald Trump Jr.\nTrump Jr., whose name only appeared in filings last month, was revealed as a significant shareholder in Thumzup Media Corporation (TZUP), according to the company's July registration statement for a $50 million offering. Though it remains unclear when exactly he took a stake in the firm.\nTrump Jr. linked to sudden drop in Thumzup stock\nShares of Thumzup Media Corporation (TZUP) dropped nearly 46% Tuesday after the company announced it would buy Dogehash Technologies, Inc., a North American crypto miner that is focused on Dogecoin and Litecoin.\nIn the midday session, the stock had plummeted from $8.28 to $4.60 \u2014 one of its steepest single-day declines since going public. The market responded harshly to the deal, which will see Dogehash shareholders receive 30.7 million shares of Thumzup in exchange for their holdings.\nThe combined company, to be called Dogehash Technologies Holdings, Inc., will trade on the Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol XDOG.\nDogehash currently operates 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners, most powered by renewable energy. The company also has plans to expand its output through 2026 and is working on Dogecoin Layer-2 infrastructure and DeFi staking initiatives.\nCEO Robert Steele said the acquisition \u201caccelerates our evolution from a digital-marketing platform into a diversified digital-asset infrastructure and treasury company.\"\nTrump Jr.'s stake adds political weight to Dogecoin pivot\nAlthough Trump Jr. has not publicly commented on the deal, his stake in the company puts a political spotlight on Thumzup\u2019s crypto ambitions. With Dogecoin already tied to meme culture and online personalities, the Trump family connection only amplifies the attention \u2014 and scrutiny.\nThumzup's market value has taken a hit, sliding from around $75 million to nearly half that in less than 24 hours. Still, it trades above its 52-week low of $2.06, though well below its $16.49 peak.\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 19, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.
