  "description": "NAPERVILLE, Ill., Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Track Group, Inc. (OTCQB: TRCK), a global leader in offender tracking and monitoring services, today announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025 (\u201cQ3 FY25\u201d). In Q3 FY25, the Company posted (i) total revenue of $9.1 Million (\u201cM\u201d), a decrease of approximately 1% over total revenue of $9.2M for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\u201cQ3 FY24\u201d); (ii) Q3 FY25 gross profit of $4.6M representing an increase of approximately 8% ove",
  "content": "Net income attributable to shareholders in Q3 FY25 was $1.4M compared to a net loss of ($0.9M) in Q3 FY24, an increase of $2.3M. Net loss attributable to shareholders in 9M FY25 was ($1.1M), compared to ($2.8M) for 9M FY24, a change principally attributable to an increase in operating income, partially offset by increases in interest expense and income tax expense.\n\nCash balance of $4.9M at June 30, 2025 increased 37% compared to $3.6M at September 30, 2024. The increase in cash position was due to an increase in operating income, a decrease in payments to vendors and proceeds from the sale of our Chilean subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in collections from customers.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q3 FY25 was $1.8M compared to $1.6M for Q3 FY24. Adjusted EBITDA for 9M FY25 was $4.4M compared to Adjusted EBITDA for 9M FY24 of $3.4M primarily due to an increase in operating income in 9M FY25 compared to 9M FY24. Adjusted EBITDA in 9M FY25 as a percentage of revenue increased to 16.7%, compared to 12.6% for 9M FY24.\n\nOperating income in Q3 FY25 of $0.8M was up approximately 244% compared to an operating loss of ($0.5M) in Q3 FY24. Operating income for 9M FY25 of $0.9M was up approximately 156% compared to operating loss of ($1.7M) for 9M FY24. This rise in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenue and a decrease in operating expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. Operating expenses were down $0.9M in Q3 FY25 compared to Q3 FY24, primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative payroll, benefits, and payroll taxes of $0.4M due to the sale of our Chilean subsidiary on November 1, 2024 and a settlement expense related to a contract dispute of $0.5M in Q3 FY24.\n\nGross Profit of $4.6M rose by 8% ($0.3M) in Q3 FY25 compared to Q3 FY24. Gross profit for 9M FY25 was $13.1M compared to gross profit of $12.4M for 9M FY24. This improvement stems from factors including reduced monitoring center costs and device repair costs, partly offset by a decrease in revenue.\n\nTotal Q3 FY25 revenue of $9.1M was down 1% compared to Q3 FY24 revenue of $9.2M. Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 (\u201c9M FY25\u2019) of $26.1M was down approximately 4% compared to revenue of $27.1M for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 (\u201c9M FY24\u201d). The decrease in monitoring revenues is driven principally by a decrease in people assigned to monitoring for clients in Virginia and Washington D.C., and due to our recently sold Chilean subsidiary. This decrease was partially offset by revenue increases for clients in Illinois and the Bahamas who experienced increases in the number of people assigned to monitoring.\n\nNAPERVILLE, Ill., Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Track Group, Inc.
