      "summary": "President Trump’s attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook—an unprecedented move in the Fed’s 112‑year history—has sparked alarm among economists and legal experts over the erosion of central‑bank independence.  Trump’s stated goal of cutting the federal funds rate to 1.3% from the current 4.3% would likely trigger higher inflation and, over time, raise borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business debt.  The move follows a pattern of presidential pressure on the Fed, from Johnson and Nixon to the present, and underscores the risk that political interference could destabilize UST yields, the DXY, and broader market confidence.  Analysts warn that a Fed dominated by the president would undermine the institution’s ability to pursue its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, potentially leading to prolonged inflation and tighter credit conditions.",
