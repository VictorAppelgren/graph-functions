  "description": "In one new corner of the internet, users are invited to \u201cpaint the world.\u201d And paint they have. Welcome to wplace - an ever-evolving, gamified global map overflowing with drawings made on a more than 4-trillion-pixel canvas.",
  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 In one new corner of the internet, users are invited to \u201cpaint the world.\u201d And paint they have. Welcome to wplace - an ever-evolving, gamified global map overflowing with drawings made on a more than 4-trillion-pixel canvas.\n\nImages of Icelandic singer Laufey float over Reykjav\u00edk, while tributes for the late Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla surround Corpus Christi, Texas. The crest of San Lorenzo and other soccer clubs fill Buenos Aires. \u201cSquid Game\u201d fanart can be found on the outskirts of Seoul. And Walter White\u2019s opening monologue from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d sits near Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nWplace launched July 21, but the artwork is already overwhelming - ranging from simple stick figures and thin-lettered words, to colorful fanart and highly detailed images users build under online pseudonyms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wild, and chaotic and crude,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, a University at Buffalo professor of communication whose research includes analyzing digital spaces. That\u2019s part of wplace\u2019s appeal, he added, describing the site as a somewhat of a \u201crebellion\u201d against what the internet has become.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to break Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of a reminder that things can be done differently.\u201d\n\nWplace has garnered more than 10.6 million users worldwide as of Thursday, co-founder Enzo Watanabe told The Associated Press. With that explosion in just over a month, moderation challenges have arisen. Watanabe said via email that the project\u2019s growth \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d - but acknowledged that \u201cadjusting to the high demand has been challenging.\u201d\n\nThe game was developed in Brazil over three months by a single person, he said, and is now run by a team of 46, in addition to volunteers.\n\nNew users begin with a small, fixed number of pixels, and more become available every 30 seconds. The more you contribute, the more pixels are available to you - sort of \u201clike a leveling system\u201d seen in video games, said Moira Hembns, a 19-year-old user from Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nEven with bigger pools of pixels, it can take a lot of time to bring map paintings to life. \u201cEvery art piece takes me hours to design in advance,\u201d said Hembns. One drawing she recently finished, of a Pok\u00e9mon named Leafeon in her hometown, took her two days to design outside of wplace - and then another day to build in it, she said.\n\nBut Hembns notes that she loves art, and checks the map and places pixels almost every morning now. Muhammad Aliy Fattah bin Yusrizal, a 21-year-old from Malaysia, similarly says wplace has become an outlet for his creativity.\n\nThe site \u201cis one of the places that I can express myself,\u201d Fattah said, noting he\u2019s mostly contributed art dedicated to his favorite video games and placed atop his home country.\n\nUsers from around the world also team up to bring larger projects to life - like \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d which sits in a corner of Yuma County, Arizona. Real-life resident Krista Rider, 25, started by drawing two homes. It now has over 50, connected by paths, patches of grass and rivers.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something nice that could lift people up, give them something that they feel like they\u2019re contributing to, whether it\u2019s big or small,\u201d Rider said.\n\nMuch of wplace\u2019s spaces are filled with an endless array of pop culture references - often intertwined with symbols of local and national identity, protest and other reflections of daily life seen worldwide. In his own time scrolling through wplace\u2019s map, Ophir notes he\u2019s seen anything from small towns highlighting a restaurant they love, to tributes to local musicians, to broader imagery of political tensions and global conflicts.\n\n\u201cIn a way, every person is zooming in on what reflects them and who they are,\u201d Ophir said.\n\nAbove Gaza, users have painted Palestinian flags and messages of solidarity amid Israel\u2019s ongoing war. Images of war are also seen on the border between Russia and Ukraine - some use their pixels to depict military tanks or planes, while others write messages calling for peace. Washington, D.C., is covered with political messages, many of which focus on President Donald Trump.\n\nCarly Kocurek, associate dean of Lewis College of Science and Letters at Illinois Tech and director of the school\u2019s game design program, says there\u2019s a long history of \u201cdigital spaces as a places for protest.\u201d\n\nThat expressive desire, she said, is \u201cpart of why people are looking (at wplace), even if that\u2019s not necessarily what they\u2019re doing there.\u201d\n\nWhile unfiltered chaos is arguably much of the point of wplace\u2019s interactive map, the site still outlines general rules barring inappropriate content, bots, disclosing someone else\u2019s personal information or painting over other art \u201cusing random colors or patterns just to mess things up.\u201d Wplace says it has systems in place to erase drawings that go against its rules - and a report button to flag serious cases.\n\nBut users in online discussion threads dedicated to wplace have complained that such moderation is not enforced, or addressed in a timely manner - with some stressing particular concern about hate speech and doxing.\n\n\u201cThe amount of moderators they have currently is not really enough for the amount of people that are actually on the site,\u201d says Aaron Hickerson, a 35-year-old user in Germany. \u201cIt kind of leaves the system that they have overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nSome say they\u2019ve seen their work disrupted - or, in video game terms, \u201cgriefed\u201d - by the same users over and over again. And others have pointed out map art that includes racist words or images, sexually explicit content, vandalized pride flags and Nazi symbols. In response, users have made collective callouts to help cover up such content.\n\nWplace said it aims to \u201ckeep improving\u201d moderation - in addition to looking for technology that will aid server performance and potentially provide more security features.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is big, but we are doing our best,\u201d Watanabe said.\n\nSome users have also become used to their art simply being covered up over time. Emily Northrip, a college student in Boston, recently completed a drawing of the superhero character Invincible. When she returned days later, someone else had drawn pupils over his goggles.\n\nBut Northrip found the addition funny. Wplace is \u201ca public server,\u201d she said, \u201cIf someone wants to draw something over your pixels, they can.\u201d\n\nJessa Lingel, associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School, notes that people have come together to sustain collaborative spaces like Wikipedia or even Archive of Our Own. Still, it takes a lot of work. And \u201cunfortunately, the long arc of internet history does not bend towards self-regulation or responsibility,\u201d she notes.\n\nWith the resources required to meet erupting demand, some question whether wplace should keep accepting new submissions forever.\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want it to stay around forever, because I think it\u2019ll just fall apart if it does,\u201d Hembns said, noting wplace could perhaps create a snapshot capturing the map so far - or pause and open future contributions later, similar to a predecessor, Reddit\u2019s now-retired r/place.\n\nWatanabe on Thursday told the AP wplace intends \u201cto continue welcoming new contributions,\u201d as well as host in-platform events.\n\nRegardless of wplace\u2019s future, experts like Lingel expect pockets of artistic collaboration to continue emerging online - even they don\u2019t attract as much attention.\n\n\u201cSome last longer than others, and some make a splash - and others are just used quietly in a little tiny corner of the internet that most people don\u2019t know about,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who notices them.\u201d",
