  "content": "A truck reportedly carrying 12,000 Samsung Galaxy phones was stolen near the Heathrow Airport in London.\n\nAmong the units that were stolen are 5,000 Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 models. In total, the value of the units stolen is said to be around $9.6 million.\n\nAccording to a report by Yonhap News TV (via Android Authority), aside from the 5,000 Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 models, 5,000 Galaxy Watch 8 models are also part of the cargo stolen.\n\nIn addition, the cargo also included devices such as the Galaxy S25 series and Galaxy A16 range.\n\nAuthorities reportedly believe that the truck was stolen after it was moved to a warehouse. All products are insured, which means that no actual losses were incurred due to the incident.\n\nHas the Truck Been Found?\n\nAfter the police launched an investigation, the stolen truck was eventually recovered, according to the report. However, it has not been confirmed as of writing if the Samsung products it carried have been recovered.\n\nLaunched just a few weeks earlier, the Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, and the Galaxy Watch8 series have widely been anticipated by Samsung fans all over the world.\n\nAll three models come with upgraded specs and features. The Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7, in particular, have been described by Samsung as the thinnest and most advanced in the Z series.",

      "text": "At Samsung Unpacked on Wednesday, the company revealed the latest in its series of thin foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Fold7.\nCalling the new device its thinnest and lightest yet, Samsung noted it measures 4.2 mm when unfolded, 8.9 mm when folded, and comes in at only 215 grams.\nIt also goes all in on multimodal AI, shipping with Samsung's newest One UI 8 and promising the ability to share your screen in real time while chatting out loud with the included AI assistant.\n\"Galaxy Z Fold7 combines Galaxy AI with powerful hardware to deliver our most advanced smartphone experience yet,\" said TM Roh, President and Acting Head of the Device eXperience (DX) Division at Samsung Electronics, in a blog post. \"This next chapter of foldables brings together design and engineering, with AI built specifically for the foldable form. It gives people the ultra experience they want \u2014 powerful, immersive, intelligent, and portable all in one.\"\nThe original Galaxy Fold was... rough. Cool idea, but the hardware just wasn't there yet \u2014 screens were fragile, hinges failed, and Samsung even pulled review units before launch to fix the issues. Still, they didn't quit. Each new version cleaned things up a bit. By the time the Fold 3 came out, it felt like something you could actually use every day, not just show off. It got tougher, slimmer, and started leaning into what makes a foldable useful\u2014bigger screen, more space to juggle apps. Now with the Fold 7, it's less about proving the concept and more about refining it. Samsung's still chasing that dream of a phone that's also a tablet, and honestly? They're getting damn close.\nThe new Galaxy Z Fold 7 offers a cover display with a wider 21:9 aspect ratio that might feel more like a traditional smartphone, while the hinge has been redesigned for durability, Samsung promises. saying, \"The upgraded structure significantly reduces the visibility of the crease along the foldable display.\"\nSamsung also boasts a new 200-megapixel camera, promising four times the detail as the previous 50-megapixel setup. The camera system uses an AI-powered Provisual Engine, too, to apparently deliver sharper images and better color, as well. The front main camera has a new, wider 100-degree field of view, which is shown off nicely, says Samsung, on the massive inner display of the foldable phone.\nThe company promises its multimodal AI will help you in real time, like analyzing images of desserts and then recommending a nearby spot that has something similar. Gemini can then also save the list of restaurants and set a calendar reminder, all without you having to launch apps and enter info.\nYou can pre-order the Galaxy Z Fold7 July 9, and it will generally be available starting July 25. It comes in Blue, Silver, Black, and Mint (online-only).\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission."

Learn more.\nA truck carrying thousands of Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7 units just got stolen\n2 hours ago\n- A truck carrying 12,000 Galaxy phones, including 5,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 models, was stolen in London.\n- The shipment was apparently worth almost $10 million, but it was insured.\n- This also comes a few days after Samsung confirmed that its new phones broke pre-order records for Galaxy foldables.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 seem more popular than previous Galaxy foldables. Now, it looks like these Samsung phones may have been popular enough to steal en masse.\nYonhap News TV (h/t: FNN News) reports that a truck carrying 12,000 Galaxy phones was recently stolen near London Heathrow airport. This shipment included 5,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 devices and 5,000 Galaxy Watch 8 models, along with older devices like the Galaxy S25 series and Galaxy A16 range.\nIt\u2019s believed that the shipment was stolen after it was moved to a warehouse following its arrival at the airport.\nThe outlet reports that the cargo was worth 13.3 billion won (~$9.6 million), but that there was no actual loss as it was insured. British police apparently launched an investigation after the incident and found the container in question, but it\u2019s unclear if any Samsung products were recovered.\nNevertheless, this might be a sign of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7\u2019s initial popularity. Samsung previously reported that the Galaxy Z7 series broke pre-order records for Galaxy foldables in India, the US, and Korea.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Samsung has finally lifted the lid on its new foldable lineup, announcing the Galaxy Z Fold7, Galaxy Z Flip7, and long-awaited Galaxy Z Flip7 FE, a budget-friendly flip-fold aimed at price-sensitive buyers.\nBut there's one shocking caveat: the Galaxy Z Flip7 FE isn't sold by any of the big U.S. carriers.\nBudget Foldable with Familiar Specs\nThe Galaxy Z Flip7 FE is basically a slightly modified version of the Galaxy Z Flip6, with the same form factor and user experience but minor internal variations. According to GSM Arena, it's meant to make Samsung's foldable technology available to more people, at a reduced price, making it the most affordable model in the new foldable lineup.\nAlthough Samsung has not released a complete spec comparison just yet, initial hands-on reviews indicate that the FE model keeps all of Flip6's most important features in place, such as the clamshell form factor and cover display. Through this, you can save money by reducing some performance and materials specs.\nNo Carrier Availability in the U.S.\nDespite the phone's affordability and mainstream appeal, U.S. carriers are not offering the Galaxy Z Flip7 FE at launch, Sam Mobile reports. Neither Verizon, AT&T, nor T-Mobile has listed the device for pre-order or availability, and no major third-party retailers are bundling it with carrier plans.\nThat leaves U.S. buyers able to buy the Flip7 FE only unlocked, either from Samsung or from big-box sellers such as Amazon and Best Buy. The unlocked model offers convenience for buyers to choose their carrier, but it's a significant departure from the common American buyer purchasing behavior, which tends to center on carrier-subsidized installment plans.\nMissed Opportunity for Samsung?\nSince the majority of smartphone purchases in the U.S. are done through carriers, excluding the Flip7 FE from selling through those channels might stifle the device's success in a prime market.\nBeing the most affordable foldable Samsung has ever made, the FE could have appealed to first-time foldable buyers or shoppers who want the premium tech at a mid-tier price point.\nWhere Can You Buy the Flip7 FE?\nIf you're in the United States and looking to get the Galaxy Z Flip7 FE, there are still buying options available to you:\n- Samsung.com - Purchase unlocked directly from the manufacturer.\n- Amazon - Look for competitive pricing and quick shipping.\n- Best Buy - Provides trade-in promotions and financing for even the unlocked models.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "When bending foldable phones, particularly flagship devices such as the Honor Magic V5 and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, against one another, it's easy to be bamboozled by marketing. On paper, the Ivory White Magic V5 measures 8.8mm thick when folded, compared to Samsung's official 8.9 mm thick Fold7.\nAs one of the prolific leakers, Ice Universe, showed in a side-by-side video comparison, the real-life results are different. The Fold7 actually looks thinner when held side-by-side, regardless of what the spec sheets indicate.\nThe Pre-Applied Screen Protector Twist\nAccording to the leaker, it all boils down to one tiny but significant detail: the pre-applied screen protector on the Magic V5. Honor's official measurement leaves out the screen protector, even though it is applied right out of the box.\nSamsung, on the other hand, doesn't include a comparable addition, making their advertised thickness more representative of the true device.\nFrom the looks of it, even the small technicalities are enough to distort marketing claims, especially for \"world's thinnest\" titles. A 0.1mm difference is impressive until one understands it may well not even be true or perceivable.\nWhy These Micro-Metrics Don't Matter\nIn reality, you won't even notice 0.1mm's worth of difference in your hand. You won't even notice a 1g weight difference. And yet brands will still tout those tiny differences like they're revolutionary breakthroughs. Being the \"lightest\" or \"thinnest\" will certainly sound good in a press release, but these micro-metrics hardly ever make a difference in user experience at all.\nRather than dwelling on specs, consumers need to care about what really counts: display quality, hinge strength, battery life, multitasking capabilities, and software optimization. These are the actual differentiators that impact day-to-day use with foldable phones.\nReal-World Comfort > Spec Sheet Bragging Rights\nMost foldable phones today have become so thin and light that they are comfortable and premium to hold in the hand, whether folded or unfolded. The pursuit of the \"world's thinnest\" title becomes more about vanity and less about usability, a temporary crown that doesn't even have to be based on fact.\nSo, unless you're trying to win a specs argument at the dinner table, your decision to buy a foldable should hinge on features that meet your real needs, not on fractional differences that disappear the moment the phone enters your pocket.\nChoose Wisely, Not Lightly\nSpecs can be deceiving, particularly when they're presented without complete context. The Honor Magic V5 might appear thinner on paper, but actual use is a different matter. According to GSM Arena, instead of being misled by flash statements and micro disparities, make your decision based on the phone's behavior where it counts.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
