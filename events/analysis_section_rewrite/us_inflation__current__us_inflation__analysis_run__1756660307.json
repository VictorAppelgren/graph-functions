If Fed signals a pause or inflation stays above 2.6 %, expect ust10y to rise to 4.30 %+; if Fed cuts, expect a 10‑20 bps decline.”\n\n7. **Ensure compliance with naming policy**  \n   - Use lowercase snake_case for drivers (`us_core_pce`, `fed_policy`, `us_tariff_liberation_day`).  \n   - Keep asset names simple (`ust10y`, `spx`, `ndx`).\n\n**Revised Core Paragraph (illustrative)**  \n> The **ust10y** sits at **4.23 %** after a 2.3 bps rise, reflecting market pricing of a September Fed cut (89 % probability) (U21K4ALYQ). Sticky **us_core_pce** at 2.6 % keeps cut odds high, while the **us_tariff_liberation_day** ruling (effective Oct 14) injects short‑term pressure, pushing the yield above the 4.20 % tightening threshold (H0B8KAOD1, 3952FOSRQ). Tech‑sector weakness (spx, ndx) has added a risk‑off tilt, supporting the current yield level (3YAQ8JUPL). In the next 0–3 weeks, the key catalysts are the Fed meeting (16‑17 Aug), the next PCE release, and the tariff ruling on Oct 14. If the Fed signals a pause or inflation remains above 2.6 %, expect ust10y to rise to 4.30 %+; if a cut occurs, expect a 10‑20 bps decline.",
