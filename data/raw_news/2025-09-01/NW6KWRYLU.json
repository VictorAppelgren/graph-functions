  "title": "\u201886\u2019 Blu-Ray Review: A Modern Mecha Anime Classic",
  "description": "Based on a series of ongoing light novels, this anime adaptation of the '86 'only covers the initial story, but there\u2019s enough here to warrant some series inspection.",
  "content": "Based on a series of ongoing light novels, this anime adaptation of the 86 only covers the initial story, but there\u2019s enough here to warrant some series inspection.\n\nThe premise has a future war between the Republic of San Magnolia and the Empire of Giad. On the surface, this war is being fought by autonomous machines called Juggernauts, a kind of quadrupedal tank of sorts. However, the reality is much darker and culturally provocative.\n\nThe initial and open twist is that San Magnolia has two races: Alba and Colorata. The Alba are white haired with silver eyes and make up the bulk of San Magnolia\u2019s 85 districts; however, the 86th district is where the Colorata live.\n\nThe latter have varying hair and eye colors; it\u2019s these 86-ers that are, in fact, the true pilots of the Juggernauts in the war, as they are treated as second-class citizens compared to the Alba.\n\nWe are introduced to this situation as Lena is made a Handler to a new Juggernaut unit called Spearhead Squadron on the Eastern Front of the war. Lena also knows that people pilot the Juggernauts and clearly feels deeply for them, often to the ridicule of her peers.\n\nHowever, this particular squadron has a habit of driving their Handlers mad, as its leader, Shin, is known as the Undertaker.\n\nAs the series progresses, more about the war is revealed, and the reality of how it is being waged is even bleaker and more gruesome than it first appears.\n\nIn addition, the portrayal of the cultural setup between the dominant Alba and subservient Colorata is handled in a refreshingly non-preachy manner. It\u2019s very clearly an allegory for real-world racism and the dehumanizing effects that it entails, but it\u2019s dealt with in a more thoughtful and human way.\n\nWhile some may argue that quadrupedal tanks aren\u2019t mecha, you should probably go and check out the Armored Core series, among many others, where this kind of thing is fairly commonplace and has been so for decades by this point. In short, catch up.\n\n86 also borrows many solid concepts from the real robot side of the mecha aisle, with Armored Trooper VOTOMS being the most notable example.\n\nMuch in the same way that the Juggernauts are mass-produced units, with psychologically damaged pilots from years of fighting, Shin especially bears similarities in character to Chirico from VOTOMS.\n\nWhile VOTOMS\u2019 big twist was very much a deus ex machina, the major reveal in 86 is more personal and really quite awful.\n\nThe first season ends on a pretty big victory, but there are a lot more novels yet to be adapted, and I hope they\u2019ll get the anime treatment at some point in the future, as the story gets a lot more involved and interesting as the scope of the war progresses.\n\nAs for this anime series, it\u2019s incredibly well done. The combat and direction, as well as the characterization, are all involved and engaging. The animation is also excellent, and uses a hybrid 2D/3D approach for the characters and mecha, respectively.\n\nNaturally, as this is a Blu-ray release, the audio and visuals are pristine throughout. There isn\u2019t much in the way of extras, but you get the whole first season across three discs.\n\nOverall, the 86 is a modern mecha anime classic and harks back to the likes of Armored Trooper VOTOMS, albeit with a darker and more gruesome twist. This is also a great introduction to the story from the light novels, and comes genuinely recommended for people who want their wartime anime drama to be both engaging and culturally thought-provoking.\n\n86 The Complete First Season is available on Blu-ray via Amazon for $24.50.\n\nDisclosure: VIZ Media sent me this Blu-ray set for the purposes of this review.\n\nFollow me on , and . I also manage and am currently featured in the exhibition currently touring Japan.",

      "text": "\"FUCKIN' GLORY TO THE SPEARHEAD SQUADRON!\" \u2015 A message on the hangar's chalkboard, Kujo Nico.\nThe Eastern Front's First Ward's First Defensive Squadron \"Spearhead\" (\u6771\u90e8\u6226\u7dda\u7b2c\u4e00\u6226\u533a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9632\u885b\u6226\u968a\u201c\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u201d, Toubusensen Dai-ichi Senku Dai-ichi Bouensentai \"Supiaheddo\"?), or Spearhead Squadron (\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u6226\u968a, Supiaheddo-Sentai?) for short, is a Processor squadron credited as the most elite unit on the Republic's Eastern Front. In reality, however, it was a suicide squadron designed to purge its members, who were approaching the end of their military service terms.\nThe squadron's surviving members were later integrated into the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package as the 1st Armored Group's Headquarters Assigned Squadron \"Spearhead\" (\u7b2c\u4e00\u6a5f\u7532\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u672c\u90e8\u4ed8\u6226\u968a\u201c\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9\u201d, Dai-ichi Kikou Gur\u016bpu Honbuzuke Sentai \"Supiaheddo\"?).\nChronology[]\nSpearhead Squadron is a multi-generational unit of Processors from all over the Eastern Front who managed to survive until near the end of their service. Because of the skills the members acquired at this time, they are generally regarded as the Republic's most elite unit in the East, matching Sledgehammer Squadron in the North, Razor Edge Squadron in the South, and Longbow Squadron in the West.\nHowever, this was only the squadron's public image. In reality, it was founded as part of the Republic's secret initiative to purge the Eighty-Six. While promising to reinstate their citizenships once their terms came to an end, the Republic's leadership had no intention of actually letting them reach their deadlines, both due to their prejudices and to erase evidence of their human-rights violations. To this end, as their service went on, they would re-assign them to units with higher casualty rates. Spearhead Squadron was the final link in this chain: a suicide squad designed to purge its members. If all else failed, the surviving members would simply be sent on a one-way mission into Legion territory one month before the end of the unit's operation time.\nShin's Generation[]\nMany members of this generation of Spearhead Squadron had already known each other before its formation in April of RY 367, led by Captain Shinei Nouzen and First Lieutenant Raiden Shuga.[1]\n- Shin and Raiden were the first of the core squadron, having fought together since RY 364.\n- Kurena and Theo joined them in RY 365.\n- Anju and Daiya have been together since their enlistment and join Shin's squadron sometime after Kurena and Theo.\n- Shin, Raiden, Kurena, Theo, Daiya, and Anju entered Spearhead from Claymore Squadron.\n- Kaie and Haruto entered Spearhead from Luscinia Squadron.\n- Kino entered Spearhead from Scale Squadron.\nDue to the members all having loved ones never return from their service, they were all fully aware of Spearhead Squadron's true purpose. Regardless, since they would die anyway, they all opted to rather do so fighting the Legion than try to take pointless revenge on the Republic.[2] Despite the constant suicide missions they were send on, the unit had a surprisingly high survival rate due to the skills of its members. They also inherited a tradition from Claymore Squadron where if one of them were to die, since Processors do not receive a burial, the squadron leader\u2014Shin\u2014would take a piece of their Juggernaut and keep it; a custom that members from other squadrons readily accepted.[3]\nThrough Shin's ESP ability to \"hear the voices of the dead\", the squadron learned that the Legion had become capable of self-replication; by harvesting the brains of deceased Processors, they were able to create new AIs and models, which they would nickname Black Sheep and Shepherds. This meant that they would be able to continue functioning past their six-year expiration date, which the Republic had bet their entire strategy on reaching.[4] For the squadron, though, they were able to effectively identify and eliminate these new models by linking all members to Shin's ability through the Para-RAID. However, this process was severely traumatizing for their Handlers, which the members did not care for since they never had a good relationship with any of them. As a result, the squadron became infamously known as the \"Reaper's Unit\".[3]\nThe squadron's string of bad relationships with their Handlers finally came to an end with their last one, Major Vladilena Miliz\u00e9, whom they opened up to over time. As the unit's operation time came to a close, the Republic intensified their missions to purge the remaining members, slowly dwindling them down before sending the squadron's five surviving members on the dreaded special reconnaissance mission.[5] However, before reaching the border, they took a detour by first engaging the Dinosauria containing the vestiges of Shin's older brother\u2014Shourei\u2014and miraculously obtained victory with zero casualties, partly thanks to Lena using an unauthorized artillery strike to destroy a large portion of the Eastern Front's Legion. Afterward, the squadron said their goodbyes to their Handler before cutting contact and moving on, much to her protest.[6]\nUpon reaching the border, the five survivors enshrined four of their Juggernauts, which had been damaged beyond repair along their journey, alongside Fido and Shin's 576 Juggernaut fragments before continuing eastward by taking turns piloting their one remaining Juggernaut. The group ended up surviving a whole month in occupied territory before they were finally about to be overwhelmed during a battle with the Legion. However, they were rescued by an unlikely savior: Shourei, who had survived their battle by transferring his consciousness into to a backup unit. He then carried their unconscious bodies out of Legion territory. Shortly afterward, the survivors were found by military forces belonging to the Federal Republic of Giad and given asylum, whilst Rei was destroyed by them.[7]\nRito's Generation[]\nWith Shin's generation seemingly entirely wiped out, the squadron received new members gathered from the Eastern Front, while Lena was demoted and transferred to command the Br\u00edsingamen Squadron led by Captain Shiden Iida and First Lieutenant Shana. This new generation of Spearhead was led by Captain Rito Oriya and First Lieutenant Irina Misa.\nFollowing the Fall of Gran Mur and the occupation by the Federacy, the surviving Processors of Spearhead and other squadrons would join the Federacy's military and attend their mandatory education in officer academies.[8]\nStrike Package[]\nThe Spearhead Squadron would be reformed inside the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, with its known members being the five survivors, Dustin Jaeger, and many other Processors. Rito and his squadron would take up the name of their previous squadron: Claymore.[8]\nOrganization[]\nShin's Generation[]\n- [Handler] 5th Handler of Spearhead Squadron - Was the handler prior to Vladilena Miliz\u00e9.

He is the closest thing the squadron has to a father figure.\n- Fido - Rescued by Shin as the only surviving scavenger drone in a battle, Fido is responsible for: scavenging materials including food and reusable products from the city ruins, scavenging parts from destroyed friendly vehicles, and supplying friendly units with ammunition and fuel during battle.\n- TP - TP is a stray cat adopted by Daiya that became the squadron's pet. The cat was called many different names by different people in the squadron before settling on TP. Although it is adopted by Daiya, its favorite person is Shin as it can sleep on him while he is reading.\n- [First Platoon] Role: Vanguard, responsible for close-quarters engagements.\nRito's Generation[]\n- [Handler] - Since Lena was demoted for launching an unauthorized artillery strike to save the survivors of Shin's generation, a new handler took over.\n- [Leader] Rito Oriya - The captain of this generation.

      "text": "\"The Eighty-Six's closest companion, as well as their final resting place.\" \u2015 Volume 1 Chapter 2\nThe M1A4 Juggernaut (M1A4 \u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8, Emu-ichi \u0112-yon Jag\u0430\u0304n\u043e\u0304to?) is the sole Feldre\u1e9e of the Republic of San Magnolia, manufactured by Republic Military Industries. While developed as an answer to the hordes of advanced drones of the Giadian Empire's Legion, the Juggernaut is markedly inferior to the various types of Legion in firepower, protection, and mobility. Its classification as an unmanned weapon is an ostensible one, as the machines are piloted by the Eighty-Six, who are deemed non-humans under the Republic's discriminatory policies.[1]\nNomenclature[]\nA Juggernaut in current English usage is a literal or metaphorical force regarded as merciless, destructive, and unstoppable. The word originates from the Hindu deity Jagannath. Its designation of M1A4 stands for Model 1 Alteration 4.\nDescription[]\nThe silhouette of the Juggernaut resembled that of a prowling spider, but the two grappling arms and its brandished main battery are reminiscent of a scorpion's tail and pincers. It is a machine with four long, jointed legs with whitish-brown aluminum-alloy armor. The legs are fitted with oscillation sensors to detect approaching ground enemies and its maneuverability is slightly superior to that of a treadmill tank, the grappling arms also granted the Juggernaut vertical maneuverability, allowing them to scale buildings or cliffs to gain higher ground.[2]\nCockpit[]\nA Juggernaut's cockpit is similar to a jet fighter's, it has a clamshell cockpit and the inside is filled with a multitude of switches, LCD screens, and twin control sticks to the left and right. The biggest difference was that instead of a bulletproof glass windshield, the Juggernaut's cockpit was enclosed by an armored canopy, so the pilot could not see outside the unit. To compensate for that, the cockpit was equipped with three screens and a holo-window that provided all data of the battlefield.[2][3] However, the resolution for these displays is extremely low, which leads to low crew visibility and awareness. Due to the dark and cramped space of the cockpit, Processors often nickname it as the 'Walking Coffin'.\nProtection[]\nSince the Juggernaut was classified as a drone, the amount of protection it possesses can only be described as bare minimum, and the Processors piloting the Juggernaut, there was little chance of surviving a hit. Much like most conventional AFVs, the Juggernaut lacked any sort of life-preserving equipment such as airbags, and the Processor is only kept strapped into the seat by a harness.[1] The Juggernaut makes use of aluminum alloy armor much like certain real-life light AFVs such as the FV107 Scimitar, but its armor was so fragile that it isn't even capable of resisting shrapnel or small arms fire, and thus can be penetrated easily by all the combat types of Legion. In fact, the cockpit of the Juggernaut is morbidly referred to by Processors as \"the Guillotine\" for its tendency to snap off from the rest of the machine when struck. The resulting injuries are often fatal because there are no cushions to protect the body of the Processor from striking against the insides of the metal cockpit. The Juggernaut also lacked CBRN protection, according to Theoto Rikka the Juggernaut cannot even ward shallow rivers as the cockpit is not waterproofed.[4]\nArmament[]\nFor its main armament, the Juggernaut is equipped with a magazine-fed 57mm smoothbore gun that can fire Armour Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) and High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds.[5] The APFSDS projectiles are used to penetrate heavily armored Legion units such as the L\u00f6we. The HEAT shells are used against light armored Legions such as the Ameise, and against fortifications like concrete bunkers and gates. The magazine of the gun can be quickly swapped out and reloaded by an M101 Barrett scavenger drone. For its secondary armaments, the Juggernaut is equipped with two 12.7mm heavy machine guns. On top of it, two sets of wire anchors are also fitted to a unit for various uses on the battlefield.\nDuring the initial production, High-frequency blades were introduced as an optional weapon that could be placed on the grappling arms instead of the 12.7 mm heavy machine guns. They had enough force to even cut into the tough armor of the Dinosauria like it was made of butter. [6] Nonetheless, almost no processor used high-frequency blades as it required Juggernaut to sprint through gunfire and bombardment to close in on the enemy.\nMobility[]\nUnlike the more complicated hexapedal systems of the Ameise and Grauwolf and the octopedal systems of the L\u00f6we and the Dinosauria, the Juggernaut use a quadrupedal movement system, as a result of the Republic's inept engineering capabilities being unable to develop a sufficiently powerful power pack or an adequate ECU to support a more complex drivetrain. Because of the weight constraints of the underpowered quadrupedal design, the Juggernaut could only have light armor and small calibers guns. Another drawback is that the Juggernaut has a much higher ground pressure than the Legion units due to its weight being distributed to only four legs. As a result, The processors of the Juggernaut must avoid soft, marshy terrain otherwise risk getting stuck.\nIn addition to its inferior movement system, the Juggernaut is also a very fragile machine, unable to undergo rapid maneuvers for very long without breaking down, limiting the extent to which Processors can use the Juggernaut's maneuverability. The cruising speed of the Juggernaut itself is 60km/h, slower than even a L\u00f6we.[7] The Juggernaut does make up for its inferior top speed through its multi-directional mobility, more specifically vertical mobility, which it uses to exploit weak spots above most Legion units.\nHistory[]\nAt the start of the war with the Giadian Empire, the technological inferiority of the Republic of San Magnolia was made clear. Within half a month, the Republic Army was decimated and its remnants forced to using delaying tactics to prolong the war. It was necessary to produce a new weapon that could fight the Legion's overwhelming numbers.\nBy the end of the first year of war, Republic Military Industries completed their development of a new vehicle, which was based on technology recovered from Legion wreckage, and quickly started production. However, the new M1A4 Juggernaut was a rushed design, resulting in it being inferior in many aspects to the Legion. Despite its flaws, the lack of a better machine made the Juggernaut the primary weapon of the Republic.\nUnknown to the Republic citizens, who knew of the Juggernaut as an autonomous drone, the Juggernaut has to be piloted by Eighty-Six since the Republic AI technology is simply inadequate to develop a serviceable AI that can effectively counter the Legion. Since the Eighty-Six are considered non-humans, the Republic is able to fabricate the lie that the Juggernaut is not manned by humans and that there are no human casualties in the ongoing war. The use of the term Processor to refer to the Eighty-Six pilots contributes to the Republic's lies.\nThe Juggernaut remained the Republic's primary weapon until the Fall of the Gran Mur and in the following siege. Soon after the liberation by the Federal Republic of Giad, the surviving processors switched to the more advanced XM2 Reginleif. Even so, the Juggernaut will not be officially retired; they have been transferred to secondary missions in the rear, such as towing equipment and cargo.\nTactics[]\nOwing to the sub-par specifications of the Juggernaut, a variety of tactics for dealing with the Legion have been passed down through the ranks of Processors. When a Legion incursion is spotted, the squadrons will set ambushes on the predicted path of the Legion units. Achieving the element of surprise is crucial because it allows the Juggernauts to target the weaker rear armor of the otherwise impenetrable L\u00f6we as well as weaken the enemy without risk of damage.\nOnce the first volleys are fired, the Juggernauts employ fire and maneuver tactics to temporarily suppress the Legion and allow other Juggernauts to flank the enemy positions. Using team maneuvers is especially necessary against the heavy armoured L\u00f6we, although a few exceptional Processors such as Shinei Nouzen are capable of handling a L\u00f6we alone. These Processors utilize high mobility tactics to take on the L\u00f6we alone, but due to the fact that the Juggernauts are poorly designed and made, the moves that the Processors execute can seriously damage the Juggernaut itself. This poses a lot of stress on the maintenance of the Juggernaut. This is the reason why the maintenance team of the Spearhead squadron always reserves two to three operational Juggernauts for Shin. Attacking from elevation is also a preferred method against the L\u00f6wes and Grauwolfs, both of which have difficulty elevating their weapons to target enemies above them.\nThe presence of the Legion's Skorpion artillery units is a significant danger to Juggernauts as their light armor can be pierced by shrapnel from the high-explosive shells. To prevent an artillery strike, the Juggernauts prioritize the elimination of the Ameise, which serves as forward artillery observers for the Scorpions.\nSelecting terrain is another crucial aspect of tactics as soft ground like swamps can be a deathtrap for Juggernauts. Processors scrounge for maps from the surrounding ruins to determine favorable terrain.\nTrivia[]\n- The main gun of the Juggernaut appears to be based off the Bofors 57 mm Naval Automatic Gun L/70. However, the Juggernaut's cannon is smoothbore instead of rifled. The Bofors 57mm is also designed to fire APFSDS, API (Armor-Piercing Incendiary) and HE-Fragmentation rounds.\nGallery[]\nReferences[]\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 Asato Asato; Shirabi (2019-03-26). 86--EIGHTY-SIX 1.

      "text": "\"Heil dem Reich!\" \u2015 Imperial Salute.\nThe Giadian Empire (\u30ae\u30a2\u30fc\u30c7\u5e1d\u56fd, Gi\u0430\u0304de Teikoku?), also referred to as the Empire of Giad or Former Empire of Giad, was a technologically superior power to the east of the Republic of San Magnolia that unleashed the Legion, the world's first autonomous combat system, against all neighboring countries in Republic Year 358.\nThe inability of other countries to make any contact with the Giadian government has given rise to the theory that the Legion went rogue four years before the war started and overran the Giadian Empire before expanding outward.\nCulture[]\nFlag[]\nThe national symbol of Giad is a two-headed eagle, which can be found on the nation's black and red flag as well as the coat of arms. This symbol did not change following the transition to democracy.\nCuisine[]\nThe Empire preferred coffee over tea as their hot beverage of choice.[1]\nEthnicities[]\nThe Giadian Empire was ethnically and racially diverse. While the groups that dominated the region were the Rubela and the Aquila, other races were not prohibited from holding high positions in society, such as noble status. The Rantz Clan was an example of Alba nobility within the empire.\nThe highest of the nobles however belonged solely to the esper races of the Onyx and Pyrope respectively. The Onyx and Pyrope nobles were in constant friction with each other, and maintaining racial purity within these races was seen as the utmost importance. Thus, mixing Pyrope and Onyx heritage was seen as taboo, save for the royal family which was required to have mixed Onyx and Pyrope heritage. It was due to this taboo that the union between Reisha Nouzen and Yuuna Maika was not blessed, and they were exiled by their respective families.\nWhile the Empire did not heavily discriminate based on race, they did discriminate based on class, as seen in the warrior-slaves of the Vargus.\nLanguage[]\nGiad's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. Due to the diversity present in the nation, other languages and writing scripts are used along side the official language by certain minorities, such as a Japanese-like script seen in the borderlands of the old Imperial territories.[2][3] While they speak the same language as San Magnolia, Roa Gracia, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.[4][5]\nHistory[]\nFor the last 200 years prior to the Empire's fall, the royal family were reduced to puppets to be controlled by the high nobility.\nInventing the Legion[]\nThe Giadian Empire created the Legion by combining an AI invented by the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia and mechanical technology invented by the Alliance of Wald. In SY 2139, the Empire declared war on its neighboring countries and sent the Legion to invade them.\nRevolution[]\nThe Empire would fall 5 years after the war's beginning, toppled by the populace displeased by imperial warmongering. Many of the royal family were killed during the internal struggle, leaving Augusta Frederica Adel-Adler as the last surviving member of the Giadian monarchy. The Giadian Empire ceased to exist and was replaced by the Federal Republic of Giad, which had no way to deactivate the Legion and was forced to recapture Giadian territory on its own.\nTrivia[]\n- Giad is heavily inspired by Germany in various stages of its history, the Empire being inspired by Germany's many empires (the Holy Roman Empire, German Empire, and to an extent the Austro-Hungarian Empire) while the Federal Republic was inspired by the Federal Republic of Germany. The two-headed eagle may be a reference to the Reichsadler, a prominent symbol of Germany and Austria-Hungary. The symbol is still used to this day by Germany under the name of the Bundesadler."

      "text": "There are a few anime series that have the legacy of Armored Trooper VOTOMS. So it is wondrous to see the original TV series readily available and the chance to savor some bitter coffee yet again.\nArmored Trooper VOTOMS was the follow-on mecha anime from writer and director Ryosuke Takahashi after the hugely successful Fang of the Sun Dougram.\nMuch like how the mecha in Dougram were treated as practical machines, VOTOMS took that approach even further and made the main mecha something mass produced and very vulnerable.\nSet against the backdrop of a hundred-year war in the Astragius Galaxy between the Gilgamesh and Balarant forces. The seemingly unremarkable soldier Chirico Cuvie finds himself initially mixed up in some kind of military conspiracy.\nIt\u2019s here amongst the streets of Uoodo city that Chirico makes some unlikely friends in the form of Gotho, Vanilla and Coconna.\nThis trio adds much of the humor and humanity to the series, as Chirico is effectively a psychologically traumatized mecha pilot after fighting in a brutal war.\nHowever, not everything is as straightforward as it seems and over time it becomes clear that Chirico is mixed up in something more involved than simple military corruption.\nVOTOMS did a lot of very interesting things for a mecha anime during the early 80s. Not only were the Scopedog mecha generic and mass-produced, but there were also much smaller than the typically massive mecha of that era.\nClocking in at around four meters, the armored troopers in VOTOMS were perfect for urban warfare or the thick and dense foliage of the jungle. It also made them more relatable in terms of their scale and helped to make them more believable.\nWhat\u2019s more, the characterization of Chirico was unlike any other anime protagonist. Traumatized and broken by the war, each battle was a struggle and outright victories were few and far between for him.\nSo you would think that with all of this that VOTOMS would have slipped into obscurity but in fact, it is still one of the most successful anime series ever created, with new installments and merchandise being made in Japan even today.\nMuch of what makes VOTOMS so special is how believable and relatable it is compared to other shows and Chirico fulfills that everyman role that the viewer can identify with.\nNot to mention that Kunio Okawara\u2019s brilliantly understated and militaristic mecha design helps to ground the show even further.\nUnlike Dougram though, VOTOMS also had another major advantage over its peers and that was how it changed its location over the course of four chapters.\nStarting in the city of Uoodo on the planet Melkia, we also traveled to the jungles of Kummen, then the ravaged planet of Sunsa and finally the mysterious planet of Quent.\nEach chapter brought with it new challenges and mysteries for Chirico to unravel and various modifications to the multitude of armored troopers he would use.\nSlowly, Chirico and his increasing band of friends figure out what is really going on and the narrative finale is still one of my favorite and most surprising in all of anime.\nThat means this new release of VOTOMS on Blu-ray is something I cannot enthuse about enough. While it is still only standard definition on Blu-ray, unlike other recent releases in this format, the picture quality is very good and is entirely watchable.\nThe extras are simple and just include the compilation OVAs for each of the four chapters I mentioned above and some additional background episodes. The most important aspect to this release though is that it contains the entirety of the original 52-episode TV series.\nThis is because the original VOTOMS TV series is responsible for influencing a lot of Western mecha design and games. From the Heavy Gear series to more modern video games such as Titanfall, the approach used for mecha in VOTOMS has had an enormous impact on how mecha are treated all over the world.\nIn the case of Heavy Gear, the team behind that series openly cited VOTOMS when it came to how they treated their own mecha. The emphasis on mass-produced units, as well as a more believable approach, is something that ultimately resonated with fans outside of Japan.\nThis is why this release is so important and timely, it helps to show the origins of Western mecha for all to see. That without the work of Ryosuke Takahashi and Kunio Okawara in anime like Dougram and VOTOMS, we wouldn\u2019t have any kind of mecha in the West.\nOverall, VOTOMS is a fascinating series not least for how it changed how mecha anime worked structurally but also how it influenced how mecha were perceived outside of Japan. This new Blu-ray release then is uniquely relevant in a cultural sense and if you ever wondered where the whole trope of \u201crealistic\u201d mecha came from, then buckle in and acquire a taste for bitter coffee.\nArmored Trooper VOTOMS is released by Maiden Japan on March 12 and can be purchased from the Sentai Filmworks store for a very reasonable $32.99.\nDisclosure: Maiden Japan sent me this Blu-ray set for the purposes of this review.\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. I also manage Mecha Damashii and do toy reviews over at hobbylink.tv.\nRead my Forbes blog here."

      "text": "| SPOILER ALERT! This page contains spoilers from the light novel! Read at your own risk. |\nVladilena Miliz\u00e9 (\u30f4\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30fc\u30ca\u30fb\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30bc, Vuradir\u0113na Mir\u012bze?), shortened to Lena, is the female protagonist of the 86 -Eighty Six- series.\nShe is the commander of Shinei Nouzen and the Spearhead Squadron, whom she communicates with via the long-distance communication device known as the Para-RAID. After the Spearhead Squadron's departure, she becomes known for demanding orders and highly competent leadership, earning the nickname of Bloody Reina.[\u2020 2]\nShe was later sent as the Republic of San Magnolia's representative for the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, of which she is the tactical commander.\nAppearance\nLena has the silver eyes and hair of a Celena. She is 160 centimeters tall, although she appears taller due to her heels. One of her more distinguishing features is her double ahoge. Although not frequently commented on, Lena is actually rather well-endowed. Amongst the Strike Package's 1st Armored Group, she is only behind Shiden and Kurena in that department.[18]\nLena typically wears the Republic Army's Prussian Blue and White female dress uniform. She also wears various dresses, ranging from an old-fashioned silk gown she wears within her family's estate to a black evening dress that resembled mourning clothes at the Lune Palace. After the departure of the Spearhead Squadron, she dyes a streak of red into her hair to remember them, and begins to wear a black-colored form of the dress uniform. She later reverts back to the standard uniform and would remove the streak of red, as requested by Shin.[6] During the winter months and the Strike Package's stay in the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia, she wore a white and blue coat above her uniform.\nPersonality\nLena was born into the former noble household of Miliz\u00e9. After an encounter with the Eighty-Six outside the Eighty-Five Sectors when she was 10, Lena dedicated herself to becoming a Handler to assist the Eighty-Six on the frontlines. Her determination resulted in her skipping multiple grades, graduating at the top of her class, and becoming a major at the young age of 16. In the military, she has a reputation for effectively leading the Juggernaut squadrons. She has excellent tactical ability and can analyze combat data to determine the Legion's reinforcement rates.[19]\nLena exhibits a disregard for social opinions she deems immoral or useless. Despite taunts and jeers from other Handlers who dislike her close relationship with the Processors under her command due to their belief that they are traitorous sub-humans, Lena maintains her daily communications and puts in an effort to develop closer bonds with her squadrons.[20] She remains steadfast in her opinion that the Eighty-Six can no longer be viewed as traitors due to the Giadian Empire having assumed to have fallen.[citation needed]\nHer mother's focus on social status and bloodlines, as well as the insistence\u2014that, as the daughter of the Miliz\u00e9 family, Lena should resign from the army and marry another noble\u2014are disdainful to Lena. Lena believes that the war is far more important than trivialities regarding marriage and social standing. Such ignorance towards the war from citizens of the Republic annoys Lena, who has witnessed the cruelty that allows the people of the Eighty-Five Sectors to maintain their lifestyle.[10]\nLena's sheltered upbringing and her isolation from her peers due to her rapid advancement to become a Handler have resulted in her being na\u00efve. She believes that she can spout her outlandish ideals to the Republic without the fear of her punishment.[21] Lena can also be authoritative when necessary and can use unscrupulous methods\u2014such as guilt-tripping, bribing, and using physical threats\u2014to achieve an objective.[22][23] Though she is educated in social etiquette, she lacks friends besides Annette because she has outstripped all other peers in terms of education. At the same time, her noble lifestyle gives her no chance to learn basic skills such as sewing.[24]\nReputation\nWithin the Republic Armed Forces, specifically their headquarters of Palace Blancneige, Lena gained a reputation of being a \"drone loving princess\" who cared too much about the Eighty-Six.[25] Other officers would often mock her for her strange ideals and view of the world. Once Lena began to act upon her ideals and inconvenienced the other officers, the mocking slowly turned to resentment. She was said to be someone who couldn't differentiate between human beings and livestock, or an idiot who threw away her rank to help the Eighty-Six.[23] Despite that, the other officers couldn't touch her so long as her uncle protected her.\nLena would become known as an effective leader during the defense of the Republic, rallying together the Eighty-Six under her in the interest of mutual survival. Even before the large-scale offensive and the fall of the Gran Mur, she managed to gain the respect of the Processors under her command through effective leadership and her artillery support hitherto unused by the Republic. Her leadership was highly demanding to her Processors, resulting her in receiving her moniker and later Personal Name of Bloody Reina. Lena is fond of the name as a form of self-deprecation, as she feels that she is stained by the blood of the Eighty-Six she has sent to die by her orders; ironically, her squadrons have the lowest fatality rate.[1][23]\nOnce she joined the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, the Eighty-Six uniquely regarded her with respect despite her being an Alba. The Strike Package's Federacy staff had their reservations, but ultimately accepted Lena as a tactical commander after her initiation.[6] She would be endearingly regarded as the \"Queen of the Eighty-Six\", especially by the Spearhead and Br\u00edsingamen squadrons.[26]\nBackground\nLena was born on July 12th RY 350 / SY 2131. Her father\u2014Vaclav\u2014described her as independent and observant as a child, learning easily without being taught.\nWhen Lena was 10, her father took her to see the Eastern Front's front lines in a Republic scout plane. Cruising above the desolate concentration camps, layers of minefields, and the ravaged battlefields, Lena had her first experience witnessing the Eighty-Six's hardships. While the Legion was known to have potent anti-aircraft weapons called Stachelschwein, Vaclav knew that flying at night would greatly reduce the chance of Legion attacks, as the Legion's auxiliary power systems were dependent on solar power. However, a stroke of bad luck resulted in a patrolling Ameise unit spotting the plane and directing anti-aircraft fire towards it. Struck in the left engine, the plane was forced to crash land, killing Vaclav. The Ameise approached the plane's burning wreckage but was destroyed by a Juggernaut piloted by Shourei Nouzen before it could attack Lena. Shourei rescued Lena and brought her back to his squadron's base. While he forbade her from interacting with the rest of the squadron out of fear that they would harm her for being a Republic citizen, Shourei spoke with and entertained Lena until she could be returned to the Republic. His conversation with her about fighting the Legion to prove himself a citizen of the Republic and return to his younger brother profoundly affected Lena.[27]\nOnce Lena returned to the Republic, she resolved to become a soldier to help Shourei and the other Eighty-Six fight for their freedom. She was able to skip multiple grades and enlist in the Republic Army. Placed in the 91st Group for training, Lena was the youngest of the trainees. Her diligence in her work earned her significant recognition, and she became the first of the 91st Group to be promoted to the rank of Major at the age of 16.[10]\nAbilities\nDespite Lena's humble opinion regarding her own abilities, she is undeniably one of the best officers the Republic has to offer. Her talents, combined with her determination, allowed Lena to be promoted to the rank of Major at the age of 16. Unlike her fellow handlers, Lena took her role seriously and was determined to do everything she could to help her Processors during combat. During her tenure as the Handler of the Spearhead Squadron, her effective support helped the Squadron to a degree that for a brief time it suffered zero casualties. As time passed, she became even bolder and willing to use questionable methods such as guilt-tripping, bribery, and physical threats to achieve an objective. During the special reconnaissance mission and after, Lena often deployed the interception cannons as artillery support without authorization, which incurred the ire of her commanding officer.\nQuotes\n\"Don't leave me behind...\" \u2015 to the Spearhead Squadron, during their departure on the special reconnaissance mission.[22]\nTrivia\n- Lena is easily frightened by even the mention of rodents or spiders[27]. She is also afraid of ghosts[28].\n- Lena's Personal Mark is the silhouette of a woman clad in a crimson dress, or Bloody Reina. [29]\n- Lena uses violet flower-scented perfume frequently. Shin associates the smell with her[30].\n- Lena is Seiichirou Yamashita's favorite female character in 86 -Eighty Six-, along with Kurena. When asked regarding which part of Lena's body he likes, he instantly answers \"legs\" with no hesitation, followed by her ahoge. Sh\u014dya Chiba's answer to the question was Lena's face.[31]\n- There are various parallels between Lena and the goddess Freyja.\n- Lena's romantic partner is Shin, who parallels Odin. Odin is often linked to or assumed to be the same as \u00d3\u00f0r (Freyja's Husband) due to their shared etymological source.\n- Lena's command vehicle is called the Vanadis, another name for Freyja.\n- The Br\u00edsingamen Squadron serves as Lena's personal guard. In Norse mythology, Br\u00edsingamen is the necklace of Freyja.\n- Lena's alcohol tolerance is so low, that a single sip is enough to reduce her into drunken stupor[32].\n- Due to her sheltered upbringing, Lena is hilariously poor in some of her life skills.\n- Lena's characterization is very similar to Leila Malcal, the deuteragonist of Code Geass: Akito the Exiled. Their similarities include:\n- Both of them are from noble background, acting as commanders of a suicide squad consisting of racial minorities treated as sub-humans by their home country.\n- Their love interest is an ace pilot acting as the leader of the said suicide squad.\n- They hold the military rank of major during the start of the story.\n- They have an uncle figure superior looking after them in the military.\n- Their best friend is a genius female scientist of the same age.\n- She is the only living major character (other than Annette) to have personally met Shourei when he was still alive.\n- Her associated perfume in the All-Star Perfume Battle is violet.[11]\nFootnotes\n- \u2191 Mistranslated as Lieutenant (of the Navy) (\u5927\u5c09, Daii?). Captain (\u5927\u5c09, Taii?) is the correct rank, as she had been demoted one step.\n- \u2191 Bloody Reina is a play on her full name of Vladilena and her moniker of \"The Bloodstained Queen\". The original Japanese was written as Bloody Regina (\n\u9bae\u8840\u306e\u5973\u738b , Buraddirej\u012bna). The Latin word Regina was substituted with the Spanish word Reina in the English translation, as the translator felt that Bloody Reina was phonetically closer to Vladilena. Asato Asato has also approved of the English translation's adjustment.\nReferences\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Volume 1 Epilogue\n- \u2191 TheZackZeal | Roman Lempert Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Magical Girl Regina \u2606 Lena\n- \u2191 Dengeki Bunko Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Explanation of her birth year\n- \u2191 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 Volume 4 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Asato Asato Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Volume 7 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 9\n- \u2191 10.0 10.1 10.2 10.3 10.4 10.5 10.6 Volume 1 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 11.0 11.1 Alter.1 All-Star Perfume Battle\n- \u2191 Dengeki Bunko Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 CHARACTER | TV ANIME \"86-Eighty SIX- Official Website\n- \u2191 Franciska Friede - Anime News Network\n- \u2191 Genevi\u00e8ve Doang - Anime News Network\n- \u2191 Hannah Buttel - Anime News Network\n- \u2191 Fernanda Ornelas - Anime News Network\n- \u2191 Volume 7 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Episode 1\n- \u2191 Episode 2\n- \u2191 22.0 22.1 Volume 1 Chapter 7\n- \u2191 23.0 23.1 23.2 Volume 2 Prologue\n- \u2191 24.0 24.1 Alter.1 Raiden + Kurena\n- \u2191 Episode 1\n- \u2191 Volume 7 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 27.0 27.1 Volume 1 Chapter 3\n- \u2191 Alter.1 Theo + Kaie + Haruto + Fido\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 Volume 5 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 86 \u30a8\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 Radio\n- \u2191 Alter.1 HELP!

      "text": "News: New Gundam Extreme VS 2 X Boost Media Previews Brand New Units\nPosted on : 19-10-2020 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: Arcade\n0\nWith the upcoming arcade closed beta test announced in November for the latest in the Extreme VS series, EXVS2 X Boost, the newest teaser imagery showcases some brand new units to the fold!\n- Unicorn Gundam Unit 3 Phenex from Mobile Suit Gundam NT\n- Gundam Flauros from Iron Blooded Orphans\n- Kabakali from Reconguista in G\n- Star Build Strike from Gundam Build Fighters\nOne of these lucky units will actually be added to the current EXVS2 roster, whereas the other three will have to wait until the X Boost official release. We don\u2019t exactly know what the prerequisites are, but I\u2019m assuming it will be the Unicorn Phenex since the current NT lineup is missing its flagship mobile suit.\nAs for those patiently waiting for Maxiboost ON DLC for their home versions, there\u2019s still no news to be had. But at least the game is still getting regular quality of life updates as evidenced by the recent v1.06 patch that vastly improved matchmaking options.\nNews: Gundam Extreme VS Maxiboost ON announced for PS4 in JP/NA/EU in 2020\nPosted on : 27-01-2020 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n1\nGundam Extreme VS Maxiboost ON is finally coming to the PS4 in 2020, and fans around the world cannot wait.\nIn a surprise announcement during the 2020 Gundam VS stream by Bandai Namco last week which also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Gundam Extreme VS franchise, players were treated with the announcement that Maxiboost ON (MBON or MakiON depending on where you\u2019re from) is heading to home consoles this year. With many players thinking the VS franchise was never returning after the lackluster reception of Gundam Versus, Bandai Namco finally delivered what they wanted, another entry in the EXVS series. What made it even more satisfying was that the NA and EU branches announced the game was being localized as well, which was met with huge applause.\nSo what can we expect from MBON on the PS4? For now, we get all 183 playable units across 36 Gundam series that were last available before Bandai Namco moved onto Gundam Extreme VS 2. So we\u2019ll see newcomers that also appeared in Gundam Versus such as Thunderbolt\u2019s Full Armor Gundam and Psycho Gundam and Crossbone Gundam\u2019s Phantom Gundam, among many others. Local multiplayer is back as well for those who don\u2019t want to jump into the online madness. As for the rest of the content, we can expect the usual stuff from previous home entries, such as arcade routes, boss rush, mission modes and of course online co-op and online versus. I also wouldn\u2019t expect the roster to be final as I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get DLC in the form of units from Gundam Versus/Gundam EXVS 2, similar to how Full Boost got Maxi Boost units as DLC.\nHere\u2019s to hoping we hear more of a detailed release date in the near future, but until then, I\u2019m planning on firing up Full Boost on my PS3 to get some needed practice! Check out the North American announce trailer below while you\u2019re at it and let us know what you think!\nVideos: Starwing Paradox Finally Gets Some Proper Gameplay Footage\nPosted on : 02-10-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n2\nOver at 4Gamer, they have a new interview with one of the developers behind the upcoming arcade mecha game Starwing Paradox. Released later this year in the Japanese arcades, it utilizes the talents of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto for the character designs and Ippei Gyoubu for the mecha. Up until now, the game has been looking great but we now finally have some gameplay footage of the game in action (shown below) and now I am not so sure about it.\nPut simply, Starwing Paradox looks a lot like a multiplayer version of Another Century\u2019s Episode R on the PS3 and that\u2019s not good really. Admittedly, Starwing Paradox has a different control setup and a bespoke motion activated cabinet but even then, this kind of aerial ranged combat approach with analog boosting, as per the flawed Zone of the Enders games, doesn\u2019t fill me with much hope.\nHowever, the only thing here that gives me hope is that Byking is behind Starwing Paradox. They are a solid developer that made the initial Gundam Extreme Versus games, as well as crazily awesome games like Gunslinger Stratos. Admittedly, Byking also made Magician\u2019s Dead and that was mostly terrible but I am still hoping that Starwing Paradox will turn out okay, despite this somewhat worrying gameplay footage.\nVideos: New Gundam Extreme Versus 2 Intro Video and PV\nPosted on : 30-09-2018 | By : donkey show | In : Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n1\nAs the arcade release of Gundam Extreme Versus 2 gets closer, Bandai Namco have finally revealed the intro animatic and several new mobile suits to the fray!\nThe new intro includes some new faces to the franchise, which now has a stunning roster of over 160 units! Some of these new units include the following:\n- Try Burning Gundam\n- Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex\n- Gundam AGE-1 Granza\n- Zaku Amazing\n- Montero\n- Astray Blue Frame D\n- Gundam Maxter\nThey\u2019ve also released a new PV detailing some new additions to the gameplay system, including two new burst types:\n- Mobility Burst\n- Linkage Burst\nGundam Extreme Versus 2 will be entering Japanese arcades on October 30th, 2018. We\u2019ll continue to update you with more information as it comes along. Until then, let us know what you think in the comments!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhLrC-MKWk\nNews: Gundam Extreme Versus 2 Initial Roster And Location Tests Announced\nPosted on : 04-05-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: Arcade\n1\nAs the rest of the world has Gundam Versus on the PS4, Japanese arcades are gearing up for the upcoming Gundam Versus Extreme 2. On May 12 and 13, stores in Tokyo and Osaka will be able to play test the game for the first time. There\u2019s also some confirmation on the playable roster, including three new entries to the franchise:\n- Tri Burning Gundam \u2013 new\n- Gundam Maxter \u2013 new\n- Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex \u2013 new\n- Hi-Nu Gundam\n- Nightingale\n- Extreme Gundam Type Leos II Vs\n- Gundam Kimaris Trooper\n- Astray Red Frame\n- Astray Blue Frame\nAs Gundam Versus appears to have floundered a bit since releasing last year, it will be interesting to see if they continue to share units between this game and the console version. As always, we\u2019ll let you know more as it comes along. Let us know what you think of the three new units!\nReviews: Super Robot Wars X (9/10)\nPosted on : 08-04-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : Reviews\nHardware: PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita\n0\nSince the end of the Z series, the Super Robot Wars games have tried to change up the setup somewhat, such as including series without mecha in Super Robot Wars V. Well, the latest Super Robot Wars X follows on from that and but a fresh isekai angle to the mix.\nFrom the start, Super Robot Wars X wears its isekai, or alternate world, intentions on its sleeve. With the inclusion of such series as Aura Battler Dunbine and Machine Hero Wataru, the whole premise feels very fantasy themed. Something that is only emphasized further with the main OG mecha being a magic-oriented unit.\nVideos: Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS 2 Announced For 2018\nPosted on : 11-02-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News, Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n2\nBandai Namco have recently announced that Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS 2 will be hitting arcades in 2018. Unlike Gundam Versus, this is being positioned as a true sequel to the Extreme VS franchise which started in 2018. We can only assume this will continue the crazy manga-based story of jumping between Gundam timelines and universes to stop some wacky AI that threatens to destroy everything. And as to be expected from previously released Extreme VS titles like Maxi Boost and Maxi Boost ON, it probably will not head to the console space any time soon.\nAs always, we\u2019ll let you know when more is announced! Until then, check out the teaser video below and let us know what you think!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhLrC-MKWk\nVideos: Build Strike Gundam, Farsia, Gundam Pixie, and Efreet Schneid Coming To Gundam Versus\nPosted on : 16-01-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News, Videos\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n0\nSeveral new DLC units have been announced during the Gundam Games Announcement stream on January 16. Aside from revealing God and Master Gundam gameplay, we saw Missing Link units Gundam Pixie and Efreet Schneid, Farsia from Gundam Age, and a fan favorite in Build Strike Gundam Full Package from Gundam Build Fighters. We were also given proper release dates for the units below, including a separate G Sound DLC package for those that did not buy the Premium G Sound Edition:\n- Jan. 23: God Gundam, Master Gundam, G Sound DLC, Update 1.10\n- Jan. 30: Gundam Pixie, Farsia\n- Feb. 6: Build Strike Full Package, Efreet Schneid\nAs to whether or not the G Sound edition will be available outside of Japan is still yet to be determined. In regards to the units, perhaps we\u2019ll be seeing more Build Fighters units now that the titular protagonist from the first series has been added. Until then, check out the video below to see Build Strike gameplay and the rest of the announcements as well, such as G Generation Genesis for the Switch and a tease of the new Gundam Breaker for the PS4!\nNews: Border Break is Finally Coming to PS4\nPosted on : 14-01-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : News, Videos\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n1\nBack in 2009, you may remember that we reviewed the awesome Border Break. Well, it finally seems that after nearly a decade the game will be getting a console port on the PS4. Not only will the game support mouse input, along with DualShock 4, it will also have an all-new story mode. The console version of Border Break will also come in two major flavors; an online free-to-play version and a boxed release with most of the content included. The free-to-play setup is actually not that far from how the game currently works in the arcades, so it will be interesting to see how it does. While there is no news yet on when this PS4 version of Border break will be released, there are plans for an open-beta sometime in February. It is also worth pointing out that the game is currently only slated for a Japanese release but considering the fact that the PS4 is region free means you will still be able to easily import and play the game."

That's why I have to take them with me. I'll take everyone who fought and died alongside me to my final destination.\" \u2015 to Lena, regarding his promise.[1]\nShinei Nouzen (\u30b7\u30f3\u30a8\u30a4\u30fb\u30ce\u30a6\u30bc\u30f3 Shin'ei Nouzen?), shortened to Shin, is the male protagonist of the 86 -Eighty Six- series.\nHis Personal Name is Undertaker (\u30a2\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc And\u0101teik\u0101?).\nHe is the leader of the Spearhead Squadron, as well as the default operations commander of the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package. Among the Eighty-Six, he is known as the Reaper (\u6b7b\u795e Shinigami?) of the Eastern Front. His ability to hear the voices of the Legion designated him as a high-priority target with the callsign of B\u00e1leygr (\u30d0\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30b0 B\u0101reigu?).\nAppearance\nShin has the bloodred eyes of a Pyrope and the jet-black hair of an Onyx. His pale features and slender physique are characteristic of the Giadian Empire's nobles.[21] He is described to be rather handsome, attracting the attention of a few of his female comrades.\nShin almost always wears a sky-blue scarf to conceal the jagged scar on his neck. He obtained this scarf from the captain of his first squadron. Before he was gifted the scarf, his scar was concealed by bandages.[14]\nAs the Spearhead Squadron's leader, he wears a desert camouflage uniform scavenged from an abandoned Republic military depot. He later switches to the Federacy's steel-colored panzer jacket dress uniform, which generally does not allow for modifications. The combat flight suit however is much more lenient, allowing for Shin to wear his trademark scarf.\nPersonality\nShin is an incredibly kind person, even after being wronged by so many people in his life. He considers himself to be at fault in the matter with his brother and believes he is the one that needs to apologize. Even after being ostracized and feared by the other Eighty-Six, Shin felt that it was his responsibility to shoulder the deaths of his comrades and let them pass peacefully into the afterlife.\nHe had always been the only person left alive until he met Raiden Shuga. Thus, even after meeting a companion that could survive along side him, he always felt it was his duty as the survivor to silently carry the tags of the fallen to his final destination.[1] Even once letting go of his fallen comrades on the border between San Magnolia and Giad, he still used his comrades' deaths as an excuse to return to the battlefield.[25]\nShin's ability to hear the voices of the Legion places enormous mental strain on him, even when he has become accustomed to listening to the constant wails of the dead. The weight of both his responsibilities and the effects of his ability have contributed to his stoic nature and lack of mirth. Despite that, he has a gentle side to him that usually comes out when interacting with Fido.\nHis kindness also manifests in selflessness to an extreme degree. This is demonstrated in when he chooses to face the Shepherd alone to put his brother to rest, as well as when he forcibly takes control of the Spearhead Squadron's last Juggernaut and attempts to hold off the Legion so that the rest of his squadron can escape.[26][10]\nShin had a distinct lack of care for himself. He compared himself to the Legion, calling himself a ghost, aimless and wandering.[27] Consequently, he often threw himself into dangerous situations without regard for his own safety, somehow surviving through luck and combat skill. This tendency grew worse once Shin had completed his mission of putting his brother to rest and losing his raison d'etre.\nEven once he reunited with Lena and was pulled out of his suicidal craze, he still could not fathom that he was allowed to be selfish. He believed he could live even without a future to look forward to, or happiness which he could call his own. When Lena asked him for a wish he wanted fulfilled, he couldn't think of anything. His answer in the end was to take Lena to the sea, which he admitted was probably different than what Lena's question had intended.[28]\nShin eventually did realize his feelings for Lena. Once he confessed them to her during their stay in the Alliance of Wald, he was noted to be free of the shackles of pride binding him to the Eighty-Sixth Sector. He now genuinely has a future to look forward to, as well as a new found attachment to the world and humanity.[29]\nReputation\nShin is known as the Reaper of the Eastern front, a practical legend among the Eighty-Six. Both a moniker of reverence and fear, those who were assigned in the same squadron as him dreaded their fate of certain demise, or accepted that they would die knowing Shin would carry on their memory. No one would survive long term in a squadron with Shin present, no one except the one known as Wehrwolf.\nShin is often compared to a plague bringer or a prophet of death.[4] His notoriety would spread from the word of his previous mechanics or squad mates which were transferred out of his squadron, such as Rito Oriya. His reputation would achieve a similar status in the central Republic military, due to stories of him breaking his Handlers and driving some to suicide through his ability to hear voices of the dead.[30]\nAfter entering the Federacy military, Shin soon earned a similar fearsome reputation due to his cold demeanor, headless skeleton mark, and exceptional combat skills. He also earned the jealousy of many junior officers due to his relatively fast promotion. He was initially mistaken for royalty due to his mixed Pyrope and Onyx heritage, and was often provoked into fights which he would win easily.[31]\nBackground\nBorn on May 19th RY 351 / SY 2132, Shin lived with his family in the First Sector of the Republic before the war with the Giadian Empire began. It is implied he lived a sheltered life, surrounded by \"only kindness and affection\". He also appeared to have developed his extrasensory ability early on, hearing \"voices that spoke without words\" from his family.[27] He would often play with the daughter of his father's colleague, Henrietta von Penrose, whom Shin called Rita.[32]\nShin and his family were forced to relocate to an internment camp when the war began due to the Republic's discriminatory policies. Shin's father was first to enlist in the Republic military, accepting the Republic's promise that Shin and the rest of his family would have their rights restored in exchange for military service. Despite this, the Republic does not uphold its promise. Upon delivering the news of Shin's father's death, it informs Shin's mother that the military service was in exchange for only one person's citizenship. Continuing to trust the Republic, Shin's mother also enlists to protect her sons, leaving eight-year-old Shin and his eighteen-year-old brother Shourei in the care of an Adularia priest, a friend of the Nouzens who had resisted the Republic's policies and remained in the village-turned-internment-camp's church.[27]\nShortly afterward, Rei receives notice of his mother's death on the battlefield and an enlistment form for him, proving the Republic's promise to be a lie. Shin, to whom the concept of death was not yet comprehensible, implores Rei to explain why their mother would not be returning. Shin's pleas caused the grieving and frustrated Rei to snap and choke Shin in a fit of violent rage. Rei brings Shin to the brink of death before the priest intervenes and resuscitates him. Shin is left with a jagged scar around his neck as a reminder of his brother's hatred. The near-death experience also opens Shin's telepathic ability to a broader range of human consciousnesses, including those of the Legion, by temporarily experiencing the post-mortem collective consciousness of humanity. Rei avoids Shin after the incident and refuses to say farewell or even glance at Shin when he enlists and leaves Shin behind with the priest.[27]\nThe life in the internment camp was particularly harsh for Shin. In addition to the terrible condition of the camp, Shin was also discriminated by other Eighty Six due to his Giadian noble blood. Hence, the caretaker priest, who was a former soldier of Republic's army, decided to teach Shin how to fight. [29]\nFour years after Rei's enlistment, Shin hears his brother's voice among the laments of the Legion and realizes that Rei is dead. On that day, Shin enlists with the military and becomes a Processor.[27]\nAbilities\nTelepathy\nA genetic feature that is seen in people of Pyrope heritage, specifically the Maika Clan. Those with the extrasensory ability can communicate with family members by hearing their thoughts. This ability makes use of the part of the brain known as the Night Head and is the basis for the Para-RAID's communication abilities.[1] The range and limitations of the ability are unspecified in people other than Shin.\nIn Shin's case, his ability was originally restricted to only his family, including both the Maika and his non-Pyrope father. However, during his near-death experience after being attacked by his brother, Shin's consciousness temporarily entered the abyss of death, and he was able to hear the voices of those who had died. Upon being resuscitated, Shin retained the power to hear the voices of the dead that were still among the world of the living. The ability allows him to detect the Legion because the Legion was designed with the human neural system as a basis for their central processing system. While the Legion's original replica processors are not as easily detected by Shin, being more of an electric haze to his ears, the Legion's processors which have derived from the neural systems of dying Eighty-Six create easily distinguishable, and haunting, voices that Shin can hear.[33]\nThe voices Shin hears can be transmitted through the Para-RAID. Shin has traumatized many incompetent and abusive Handlers with the haunting voices of the Legion, albeit unintentionally for the most part. By turning the synchronization rate of his Para-RAID to the maximum, he drove one particularly abusive Handler to suicide. When linking with other Processors, Shin turns the synchronization rate lower. The transmission of voices also allows linked Processors to determine the positions of nearby Legion using the voices' distance and direction.[33]\nShin can also hear the voices of certain Leviathans.[34] It is unclear if other Maika are able to as well, or how Shin obtained this ability if it is exclusive to him.\nIntelligence\nDue to his habit of reading as a pastime, Shin has accumulated a great deal of knowledge in various fields, including obscure and old concepts like the salic law.[28]\nShin has a good grasp of military tactics and strategies, despite never receiving any formal training or education. During his time in the Eighty-Sixth Sector, Shin is able to analyze Legion deployment patterns and formulate an interception plan accordingly, allowing the Spearhead Squadron to operate effectively even in the absence of handlers.\nShin is also very observant. During the short period they lived together, Shin managed to correctly guess Frederica's true identity based on clues like the way she was treated, as well as Frederica's conduct and speech unfit for her age. [35]\nCombat Skill\nEven during his first sorties with only one month of training, Shin's maneuvers, judgment, and decision-making were well above what was expected of him. Although he had never experienced combat before, his instincts as an Onyx immediately kicked in, granting him a precise awareness of the battlefield. His awareness extended beyond what is normally possible, to the point that he was aware of the movements of the enemy's reload system.[14]\nCurrently, Shin's combat skills are unmatched by other Processors, as he has honed his skills to levels far above the other veterans. Combining his reflexes and telepathic ability, he can perform attacks that no other Processor can do, such as charging three L\u00f6we at once in a frontal attack. His Undertaker is specialized for his melee-oriented combat style, replacing its standard machine guns with high frequency blades, with all of its limiters being broken to maximize mobility.[4] Due to this, however, there are situations where he could be completely useless against long ranged targets once his main smoothbore gun ran out of ammunition.\nShin was able to quickly pick up the controls of Lerche's Chaika in order to fool the Ph\u00f6nix during the siege of Revich.[36]\nHis capabilities as a Feldre\u00df pilot are weaker when fighting fellow humans, however, as he isn't used to fighting opponents he can't hear with his ability. This is proven during his time in the Alliance of Wald, where he was able to be matched by Olivia Aegis during their training simulations.\nShin is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat, taking down the much larger Raiden in a fistfight and stating that he could disarm and kill three Republic soldiers before they can even remove their safeties.[37] Even in his earlier years as a Processor, his bullies didn't dare touch him due to fearing his strength.[15] His proficiency in various forms of combat ties back to his heritage as a Nouzen, an Onyx clan that served as the Giadian Imperial guard.[8]\nFederica herself believes that Shin is one of the most skilled warriors, if not strongest, in his clan's history. His combat skill is exceptional even compared to the Giadian Imperial guard, of which many also came from the Nouzen clan.[25]\nQuotes\n\"Dicit ei: Legio nomen mihi...\"(He replied: My name is Legion...)[\u2020 2] \u2015 Mumbling to himself before a sortie.[21]\n\"This is the best outcome I could have hoped for, but you guys got the short end of the stick... What will you do? Knowing that you'll die tomorrow, will you hang yourself today?\" \u2015 to Raiden, regarding the Special Reconnaissance Mission and their upcoming battle with Shourei.[38]\n\"If, one day, you make it to our final destination, would you please leave flowers?\"\u2015 to Lena, handwritten on a piece of paper.[26]\n\"It's been a while, Handler One.\" \u2015 to Lena, reunion at the Processor memorial.[39]\nTrivia\n- Shin is known to be an avid reader, reading various types of books to take his mind off of the voices of the Legion. The literature Shin reads are references to works or events that influenced the author during her writing of the novel. The literature he is known to have read are:\n- All Quiet On the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque (Volume 1)\n- Second Variety by Philip K. Dick (Triage - Black Tag)\n- The Mist by Stephen King (Triage - Black Tag)\n- Takasebune by Mori \u014cgai (Volume 4)\n- Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler (Triage - Black Tag)\n- The Bible (Volume 1)\n- Thou Shalt Not Die by Akiko Yosano (Triage - Black Tag)\n- The Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Paul Dirac (Manga Chapter 7)\n- Moby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville (Episode 4 BD version)\n- Shin carries around a 9 mm pistol which he obtained from Isuka. He uses the sidearm to euthanize his comrades that have been mortally wounded. The motion of cocking the gun and aiming to put his comrades out of their misery is second nature to him, a habit he would carry even outside the Eighty-Sixth Sector.[18] He claims that he has no attachment to the weapon.[25]\n- By possessing both the enhanced martial prowess of an Onyx and psychometry of a Pyrope, Shin is the only known Esper that has two special abilities so far, with Frederica being the only other potential candidate. While Svenja Brantolote is similarly a mix of two noble races, her abilities were merged into one instead of being separate.\n- His cooking is bland and unappetizing due to his lack of care, though he is adept at using a knife.[35]\n- Shin knows how to sew, having learned the skill to repair his clothes. He often has to help Kurena with mending her clothes, though this may just be a ploy by Kurena to get a chance to talk with him more often.[40]\n- Shin is referred to as B\u00e1leygr by the Legion, a name of Odin meaning \"Flaming Eye\". The various parallels between Shin and Odin include:\n- Both Shin and Odin have red eyes, although Odin only has one.\n- Shin gained his ability to hear the Legion on the verge of death. Odin gained his power and wisdom through the same means.[41]\n- Shin collected the tags of his fallen comrades into a box, while Odin collected the souls of esteemed warriors in Valhalla.\n- Shin is Lena's romantic partner, while Odin (through his hypostasis of \u00d3\u00f0r) is Freyja's husband. Within the Strike Package, Lena commands the unit from a vehicle known as the Vanadis, another name of Freyja. It is also said that Freyja receives half of the fallen warriors in F\u00f3lkvangr, while the other half goes to Valhalla. With the addition of the anime, Lena's box of doodles could be seen as the F\u00f3lkvangr to Shin's Valhalla.\n- Shin is the leader of the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package, which deploys an armament called the Mk. 1 Arm\u00e9e Furieuse. The Arm\u00e9e Furieuse is French for the \"Ghost Riders\", an alternate name of the Wild Hunt which was led by Odin.\n- \"Shin\" is word play on the Japanese word for \"Death\" (\u6b7b, Shi?) and the English word \"Sin\".[27]\n- Shinei Nouzen can be rendered in kanji as \u771f\u745b \u51cc\u9704, Shinei meaning \"True Crystal\" and Nouzen being derived from \"Nouzenkazura\". Note that the canon spelling of his name is in romaji, the novels in Japanese use katakana, while the kanji spelling has never been used within the novels.[42][43]\n- Despite what he said to Lena in Episode 6, Shin does not like sweets[44][45]. This is likely due to the terrible sweets made for him by Annette during his childhood.\n- Shin's internment number is E022-23093.\n- Shin has a dismissive attitude towards maintaining the condition of his Feldre\u00df, which he abuses constantly during battle. This aspect of him lead to many arguments with his mechanics.[46]\n- Shin has an unusual ability to be completely silent as he walks and moves around, also extending to other things like opening doors. This trait is also shared by his father and brother.[47]\n- Shin's characterization is very similar to Akito Hyuga, the protagonist of Code Geass: Akito the Exiled. The various parallels between Shin and Akito include:\n- Both of them are ace pilots and leaders of a suicide squad of a race treated as sub-humans by their home country.\n- They pilot white-colored quadrupedal mechs, and their combat style is to engage in fierce melee battles.\n- They gained their special power to hear from the dead after their elder brother attempted to kill them in the past.\n- It's their life goal to kill their brother on the battlefield.\n- Their personal moniker are strongly related to the dead - \"Undertaker\" for Shin and \"Ghost of Hannibal\" for Akito, helped with the fact that they were often the sole survivor of their previous squadrons.\n- Their love interest is a young girl with aristocrat background acting as their squad commander, and the first one to treat them humanely.\n- Although mix-blooded, Shin is still eligible to become a head of the family, according to Yatrai Nouzen. However, he needs to marry a pure-blooded Onyx princess from a high-ranking Nouzen branch family with a long pure-blooded history. [48]\n- Due to Billy Kametz's deteriorating health and eventual death from stage IV Colon Cancer in 2022, Aleks Le took over the role of Shin in the last two episodes.\n- His associated perfume in the All-Star Perfume Battle is temple juniper.[19]\nFootnotes\nReferences\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Volume 1 Chapter 3\n- \u2191 2.0 2.1 Volume 1 Prologue\n- \u2191 Volume 3 Chapter 7\n- \u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 Volume 10 Brand\n- \u2191 Dengeki Bunko Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 Volume 6 Epilogue\n- \u2191 Alter.1 May 19th (Shin\u2019s Birthday) - Part 2\n- \u2191 8.0 8.1 Volume 2 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 11 D-Day Minus Two\n- \u2191 10.0 10.1 10.2 10.3 10.4 10.5 10.6 Volume 2 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 Volume 7 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 9\n- \u2191 Volume 11 Epigraph\n- \u2191 14.0 14.1 14.2 14.3 Volume 10 Pledge\n- \u2191 15.0 15.1 Volume 10 Misericorde\n- \u2191 Volume 10 Undertaker\n- \u2191 Asato Asato Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 18.0 18.1 Volume 2 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 19.0 19.1 Alter.1 All-Star Perfume Battle\n- \u2191 Dengeki Bunko Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 21.0 21.1 21.2 21.3 21.4 Volume 1 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 Dengeki Bunko Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 CHARACTER | TV ANIME \"86-Eighty SIX- Official Website\n- \u2191 24.0 24.1 Volume 5 Mechanical Design Illustration 2\n- \u2191 25.0 25.1 25.2 Volume 3 Chapter 9\n- \u2191 26.0 26.1 Volume 1 Chapter 7\n- \u2191 27.0 27.1 27.2 27.3 27.4 27.5 Volume 1 Interlude 3\n- \u2191 28.0 28.1 Volume 6 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 29.0 29.1 Volume 8 Prologue\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Volume 2 Chapter 5\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Prologue\n- \u2191 33.0 33.1 Volume 1 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 12\n- \u2191 35.0 35.1 Volume 2 Chapter 3\n- \u2191 Volume 5 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Chapter 5\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Chapter 6\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Epilogue 2\n- \u2191 Alter.1 Raiden + Kurena\n- \u2191 TheZackZeal | Roman Lempert Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Asato Asato Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv4730233\n- \u2191 Asato Asato Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Alter.1 August 25th (Raiden\u2019s Birthday)\n- \u2191 Episode 2\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 The Nouzen Family\u2019s Succession Situation - 86 Side Story"

      "text": "\"Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood, Justice, Nobility\" \u2015 Republic's Moral Principles.[1]\nThe Republic of San Magnolia (\u30b5\u30f3\u30de\u30b0\u30ce\u30ea\u30a2\u5171\u548c\u56fd Sanmagunoria Kyouwakoku?), shortened to the Republic, is the setting for Eighty-Six, Under Pressure, Fragmental Neoteny, and Dies Passionis.\nThe Republic is a country located on the western edge of the continent and was the first nation to transition towards democracy after a brutal revolution. Its capital city is Libert\u00e9 et \u00c9galit\u00e9.\nAfter the failure of the Second Great Offensive against the Legion, the Republic ceases to exist as a whole with 70% of the population decimated.\nCulture[]\nFlag[]\nThe Republic of San Magnolia's \"five-hued\" flag consists of the country's crest imposed on five stripes, each a different color: blue, red, white, black, and yellow. Each color represents one of the Republic's main moral principles: freedom, equality, brotherhood, justice, and nobility.[1]\nThe flag drawn on a barrack wall in the Spearhead Squadron's base is reversed vertically and horizontally, which Lena attributes to the Republic's sins against the Eighty-Six: oppression, discrimination, intolerance, atrocity, and vulgarity.[3]\nCuisine[]\nThe cuisine of the Republic is divided in two, the heavily artificial foods of the Eighty-Five Sectors and the assortment of free range, canned, and farmed foods of the Eighty-Sixth Sector. Due to the war, the Republic was forced to give up most of its land dedicated to producing food. Those inside the Eighty-Five live off of a diet consisting of factory-made synthetic meals, supplements, and the occasional genuine articles should they belong to the upper class. Families with spacious estates, such as Annette's, are able to grow their own produce should they desire.[4] The Eighty-Six have more freedom to scavenge, raise farm animals, and hunt, but they also are provided with \"synthetic glob\" by the production facilities of the internment camps.[1][5]\nAfter the large-scale offensive, some of the older Republic citizens were delighted to eat meat, but the children threw the meat away without eating a single bite. They said it smelled like blood.[6]\nThe Republic prefers tea over coffee as their hot beverage of choice.[7] The Spearhead Squadron is shown to drink dandelion coffee instead of real coffee, as they could not import beans since the start of the war.[8]\nEthnicities[]\nThe Republic initially prided itself on being a nation of diverse cultures opening to all races and ethnicities. As they implemented the open immigration policies, many ethnic groups settled within The Republic. These minorities would later become known as the Colorata collectively while the Republic's population remained majority Alba.\nAlthough they presented themselves as a country of equal rights, the social structure remained the same as before the revolution. The top level of the social ladder was Celena, the former noble class. Below them are Adularia and Alabaster. Colorata was at the bottom of the social structure though this discrimination mostly happened in subtle ways.\nImmigrants seemed to have some difficulty in upward mobility in social classes. Nevertheless, some Colorata families with noble lineage (such as the Nouzen family) successfully climbed up the social ladder and lived comfortable life relatively.\nIdeology[]\n\"A nation of fools who sent their very patron saint to the gallows\" - Brigadier General Kharstachl expresses the foolishness and delusion of the Alba people and their government.\nPerhaps, the most defining traits of the Republic's culture is their ideology of Alba Supremacy. The central part of the ideology is the belief which the Alba is the most superior race who stands above all other races on the continent; All things created by the Alba is inherently superior than other races' creation such as the government system, weapons, equipment etc.\nThe ideology has taken a deep root in the Republic society. Although in the past, the Alba Supremacists tended to avoid expressing their belief publicly and the most radical group was kept in check, as the Republic still officially promoted freedom and equality among citizens. The war against Giadian Empire, however, had strengthened the movement to an extreme level. After a decade of government-sponsored education and propaganda, the vast majority of Republic's citizens has became firm believers of Alba Supremacy.\nThe consequences of Alba Supremacism are horrendous. It was the main driving force behind The Special Wartime Peace Preservation Act, Presidential Order #6609, which is now widely regarded as the most abhorrent act of persecution in the recorded history of humankind. The feeling of superiority also hampered the progress and development of the nation as there are no incentive for improvements. As a result, The Republic is actually far behind other countries in many aspects despite their claim of superiority. Furthermore, their delusional thought of racial supremacy has breed a culture of decadence; indifference and ineptitude within every facets of Alba society. In fact, even before the invasion of the Legions, the Alba military was so slacked off that they are virtually under no condition of combat readiness at all, leading to the Legions to march through Republic's territories undisputed.\nEven after the fall of the Gran Mur and all horrors of the Legion inflicting upon them, some of the Republic's citizens still held their racist view firmly. For the most ardent supporters of Alba Supremacy, they will absolutely reject anything contradicting their belief, in spite of evidences saying otherwise. In fact, they have reached the frightening level of denialism where they delude themselves with the invented reality instead of accepting the truth.\nAfter the total annihilation of the Republic and the majority of the Alba population, most of the surviving Republic citizens went mad and blamed everything on the Federation and the 86 for letting their nation destroyed to the point of starting an armed insurgency against them. Fed up, the Federation and the 86 purged the rebels mercilessly and kicked the survivors to the frontline against the Legions.\nLanguage[]\nSan Magnolia's national language is what would be considered modern English (although it is unknown if they call the language by that name), much like the rest of the continent. They write in the standard Latin script and are not taught other scripts such as a Japanese-like script seen in the borderlands of the old Imperial territories.[9] While they speak the same language as Giad, Roa Gracia, and Wald, there are dialectal differences between the nations.[10][11]\nChronology[]\nFounding[]\nThe Republic of San Magnolia was once a monarchy ruled over the land's native people, the Alba, and a subset of Alba known as Celena were its nobility, wielding the Esper power known as the \"Celena Intimidation\". However, over three hundred years ago, in Republic Year 1 (Stellar Year 1782), the monarchy was toppled in a democratic revolution and the Republic, the world's first modern democracy, was founded to replace it. The revolution was led by a woman who would later be called San Magnolia, whose martyrdom resulted in her becoming the namesake of the Republic. The ultimate irony of the revolution, however, was that, despite successfully transitioning to a democracy, the country did not change much as a society at all, with many of the former noble families surviving and going on to take up high-ranking positions within the new Republic.\nFollowing the revolution, the newly founded Republic received a huge influx of refugees who were drawn to the nation's ideals of \"equality\". These migrants of mostly non-Alba descend would be classified by the Republic as \"Colorata\", an act that Ernst Zimmerman and Viktor Idinarohk would later proclaim as the Republic's first major mistake as a society. Over time, this distinction gave rise to an \"us-and-them\" mindset amongst the Alba citizens and gradually, due to the majority Alba population usually holding higher positions than the minority Colorata, evolved into a belief that the Alba are the superior race. This also had an effect on the Republic's scientific progress, as them already considering themselves \"superior\" caused them to begin lagging behind other nations due to having no real drive to innovate. Despite all of these racist views, however, the Alba and Colorata populations generally got along just fine until the war with the Giadian Empire broke out.\nWar with the Giadian Empire[]\nIn Republic Year 358 (Stellar Year 2139), the Giadian Empire declared war on the Republic. The Republic's military forces were routed by the Empire's autonomous Legion war machines within half a month. In desperation, the Republic decided to withdraw all citizens to within 85 administrative sectors centered around the capital city that could be more easily defended from the Legion's advance. The Special Wartime Peace Preservation Act, Presidential Order #6609, was also enacted, designating all Colorata citizens within the Republic as threats to the nation and supporters of the Empire so they could be stripped of their civil rights and forcibly removed to internment camps outside the 85 sectors. The Republic's Alba population was largely receptive and even enthusiastic about the new law despite its blatant racism due to a long undercurrent of prejudice against the Colorata, who were descended from immigrants. The Colorata themselves protested and rioted to have the law repealed, but the government violently quashed this unrest and carried out the mass relocation. For the next year, the Colorata were forced to build the Gran Mur, a defensive wall encompassing the 85 sectors.[1]\nRepublic Military Industries finally introduced a countermeasure against the Legion in Republic Year 359 (Stellar Year 2140); the M1A4 Juggernaut, a combat drone hailed as vastly superior to the Giadian Legion. In reality, not only were Juggernauts flimsier and less advanced than Legion units, Republic Military Industries had also failed to create its own AI to run the Juggernauts, and resorted to conscripting the Colorata as pilots who were considered completely expendable. The Republic's military designated these pilots as \"Processors\" to further dehumanize them, and placed its own remaining soldiers in charge of managing Juggernaut squadrons as \"Handlers\". While the military and upper echelons of the government were fully aware that they were using the Colorata as sacrificial troops to keep the Legion from breaching the Eighty-Five Sectors, the public were oblivious and accepted the official media reports that claimed, year after year, the war had ceased causing human casualties.[1]\nBy Republic Year 367 (Stellar Year 2148), the war was no longer viewed as an existential threat to the Republic, and its people enjoyed a moderately idyllic lifestyle behind the Gran Mur. Thanks to the Juggernauts and their Processors fighting all of the battles, the military had been relegated to a make-work institution to help reduce unemployment. It was also believed that the war's end was in sight, since the Republic had intercepted a report that the Giadian Empire had fallen from within four years prior. The report also revealed that the Legion only had an operational lifespan of six years, causing the Republic to adopt a stratagy of procrastination: simply waiting out and delaying the Legion's advance until they hit they expiry date, not even bothering with an offensive strike since they could simply reclaim lost territory once the enemy had shut down.[1]\nAs for the Colorata, now mockingly rebranded as \"Eighty-Six\" due to them residing outside the Eight-Five Sectors, they were promised to have their citizenships reinstated if they completed a six-year military service term. However, the Republic's leadership had no intention of holding up their end of the deal. Fearing that they would become a pariah state after re-establishing contact with other surviving nations, the Republic intended to erase all evidence of the Handler-Processor system by purging the Eighty-Six. To this end, they would reassign Processors to different squadrons with higher casualty rates throughout their service. If all else failed, survivors would simply be sent on suicide missions one month before the end of their terms.\nThe First Great Offensive[]\nUnbeknownst to the Republic, the Legion had a workaround for their expiry date. By harvesting the bodies of deceased people, they were able to create AIs based on their brains that would be nicknamed \"Black Sheep\" and \"Shepherds\". The Republic's Spearhead Squadron eventually learned of these new models, including a railgun-type Legion that could easily topple the Eighty-Five Sectors' defenses.[12][13] However, when their Handler delivered a report on it to the higher-ups, they just arrogantly dismissed it; a decision that would cost the Republic greatly.[14]\nOn August 25th RY 368 (SY 2149), during the Republic's Revolution Festival, while the Handlers of the Northern Front were partying and neglecting their duties, the Legion launched a massive offensive, destroying the minefield and Gran Mur surrounding the Eighty-Five Sectors via bombardments from the Railgun Type Morpho before invading the country. Fortunately, the very same person who first submitted the report on the Black Sheep, Captain Vladilena Miliz\u00e9, immediately stepped up and took charge of the situation. Ignoring her superiors, she contacted all Processors using an illegally modified Para-RAID and allowed them into Republic Territory by deactivating the remnants of the minefield and blasting open the gates of the Gran Mur. Despite the sheer animosity between them, the Eighty-Six still relied on the Alba-controlled food and power plants, causing them to come to their aid for the sake of mutual survival, with some Alba volunteers joining as well. The result was a bloody, two month-long siege.[15]\nDue to the lives of leisure they had lived until now, the Alba population was utterly incapable of fighting back against the Legion and, as a result, a majority of citizens were slaughtered.[16] The Legion carried out planned raids that killed a total of ten million people, who then had their brains harvested to create more Shepherds.[17] Overall, despite the Republic's defensive actions, they were slowly being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Legion. Just when all hope appeared lost, however, military forces from another nation, the Federal Republic of Giad, suddenly appeared and helped break the siege. In turn, the Republic aided the Federation by lending its own forces to help destroy the Railgun Type Morpho, ending the Legion's offensive.[18]\nFederacy Occupation[]\nFollowing the large-scale offensive, the Republic welcomed the Federacy's forces as heroes. However, their reprieve was short-lived, as the latter revealed that, despite their actions to repress the truth, the international community was fully aware of the severe human-rights violations committed by the Alba. Subsequently occupying the nation, the Federacy's first act was to secure the safety of the Eighty Six whilst working with pro-Processor groups to confirm casualties, which turned out to be in the millions. Outraged by the Republic's actions, the Alba population was only given the bare minimum of humanitarian aid, whereas the Eighty Six were offered full Federacy citizenships, which the 86 gladly accepts and completely renounce all ties toward the Alba.[14]\nDespite the disdain for the Republic in the eyes of the international community, the other nations had also lost a lot of manpower in the siege and desperately needed more personnel to liberate the country's northern regions, which were still under Legion control. Thus, they offered the Republic a chance to redeem themselves and end their country's occupation by contributing to their international strike force, the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package. However, only few progressive and disillusioned Alba actually took up the offer, with most believing that the mass volunteering of Processors, who were unable to live normal lives after growing up on the battlefield, would represent them, even though they were no longer their citizens, continuing to have them to carry their burdens whilst hypocritically blaming them for the occupation. [19]\nYvonne Primev\u00e9re as the Republic's representative made formal complaints to Ernst Zimmerman, in regards of the Eighty-Six\u2019s treatment. She demanded the return of the Eighty-Six, the Federacy's military to leave the Republic, and for the return of their sovereignty. In response, the Eighty-Six make it clear that they had no loyalty to the nation that oppressed them. The Federacy rejected their request outright.[20]\nRecapture operations of the Republic's former territories were being spearheaded by the Federacy's Western Army, with the later addition of reinforcements from the United Kingdom of Roa Gracia.[2]\nThe Second Great Offensive[]\nSection Under Construction\nForeign Relations[]\nAlliance of Wald[]\nThey approached the alliance because of their neutrality, after the Federacy had repeatedly refuse to allow the Republic to make contact with Vladilena Miliz\u00e9.[2]\nGiadian Empire[]\nA former hostile nation that once made a declaration of war against the Republic. Faced with the Empire\u2019s overwhelming military strength, the Republic Armed Forces were decimated within half a month. False rumors were spread that the Republic\u2019s defeat in the war came as a result of the Colorata\u2019s spying. Having been trapped, humiliated, and thrust into a state of emergency by the Empire, the Alba discriminated against the Eighty-six is the result of believing the Eighty-Six to be \u201cprogeny of the Empire\u201d. Despite pouring all their efforts into producing a Republic-made unmanned drone, no attempt ever achieved the level where it could withstand live combat. The Republic refused to admit that the superior Alba failed to produce a unmanned machine when the inferior Empire could.[1]\nThey learned of the Empire's demise fours years ago when they intercepted the Empire's communications. Even with the fall of the Empire, they continued their atrocities against the Eighty-Six.[1]\nFederal Republic of Giad[]\nThe Republic's citizens at first gratefully applauded the Federacy's aid in the large-scale offensive.[14] However, the relationship quickly turned soured as soon as the Federacy began the occupation. The Federacy troops were disgusted by the Republic's atrocities against the Eighty Six. Unlike the Republic's upper class, the Federacy had no obligation toward the Republic's citizens, thus no incentive to appease them. Consequently, support for the Republic was kept at a minimum level. Nonetheless, with the ongoing war against the Legion, leaving the Republic's citizens idle was undoubtedly wasteful. Therefore, the Federacy decided to have the Republic's citizens contribute to the war effort. They were forced into labor-intensive restoration work and mandatory combat training. Naturally, the Republic's citizens, accustomed to comfortability and safety, became increasingly dissatisfied with these hardships. However, despite this, a small number of Alba actually realizes the folly of their countrymen and seek the redemption for their mistakes and blind arrogance.\nThe Republic government was also upset with the occupation, which rendered them powerless puppets. The more extreme element, such as The Holy Magnolian Order of Pureblood, deludedly insisted on preposterous demands, like withdrawing the Federacy's military, restoring the Republic's sovereignty, and returning the Eighty-Six to The Republic government.[20] Recently, The Republic government also spread the propaganda that the success of the Strike Package is due to management by the Republic's capable officers.[2]\nDespite relying on the Federacy for survival, there were pieces of evidence that The Republic attempted to sabotage the Federacy's military operation intentionally and unintentionally. For instance, The Eighty-Sixth Strike Package received a faulty map from the Republic during the mission in the city of Charit\u00e9 and subsequently lost the Phalanx Squadron to the Legion's ambush.\nAfter the total destruction of the Republic from the failed Second Great Offensive, 70% of the Alba population are decimated with only 30% of the population managed to be evacuated to the Federacy. Distraught and driven to absolute madness by the destruction of their country, the huge portion of the surviving Alba ungratefully instigated armed rebellions against the Federacy as they blame them and the Eighty-Six for the loss of their nation. Fed up, the Federacy conducts a massive purge on the Alba, decimating them even more and effectively destroying the Holy Magnolian Order of Pureblood for good. The Alba rebels lose their will to rebel are then forcefully conscripted and put into the frontline alongside the Eighty-Six.\nMilitary[]\nOverview[]\nThe Republic lagged behind other countries in many fields, including the military. While most countries on the continent had already adopted Feldre\u00df into their armed forces, the Republic Armed Forces still relied on traditional land vehicles. When the war against the Giadian Empire began, the Republic Armed Forces were completely wiped out within weeks. Consequently, the government decided to impose extreme, racist measures to rebuild its military by stripping the Colorata populations of their citizenship, relocating them to internment camps, and forcing them to fight the war on behalf of the Alba population.[1]\nUp until the fall of Gran Mur, the Republic's military was divided into two groups. The first group was an official armed force that consisted exclusively of the Alba. These soldiers' duties almost entirely did not involve direct combat, including bureaucrats, engineers, artillery crews, etc. The second group was the Eighty-Six, the former citizens of the Republic who were persecuted and exiled to the Eighty-Sixth Sector of the nation. The Republic forced the Eighty-Six to be a meat shield and bear the brunt of casualties.\nFollowing the introduction of the M1A4 Juggernaut, two new positions were created: The Eighty-Six piloted the Juggernauts, Processor, and the Republic soldiers who oversaw the Juggernaut squadrons, Handler.\nMain Article: Processor & Handler\nThe Republic's military was plagued by problems that severely diminished its combat effectiveness. Their most serious problem was an extremely hostile relationship between the official Republic soldiers and the Eighty-Six. In the eye of the Republic soldiers, the Eighty-Six were nothing more than expendable livestock. As a result, the Eighty-Six had to fight the Legion with minimal to no assistance. Before the Republic could develop its own Feldre\u00df, the Eighty-Six were sent out to the battlefield only with rocket launchers and other explosives. They had to fight against Legion's Feldre\u00df as the infantry.[5]\nEven after the Juggernaut entered the service, the situation hardly improved for the Eighty-Six. They would receive only rudimentary training on operating the Juggernaut before being deployed to their bases on the combat wards.[21] The Juggernaut itself was significantly inferior to the various types of the Legion\u2019s drones in firepower, protection, and mobility. Even worse, they were outnumbered by the Legion in nearly every engagement. Unsurprisingly, the attrition rates for Processors were extremely high. On average, only 1 out of every 1000 recruits survived their first year of deployment.\nOn the other hand, the official armed forces of the Republic faced a different type of problem. Although they generally did not suffer any casualties outside death from accidents, the secure and comfortable life behind the wall had caused the Republic's armed forces to lose all their combat readiness entirely. The indiscipline and negligence of duty were everywhere; the sight of soldiers getting drunk while on duty was not uncommon. Mant essential installments, such as the interception cannons, were inoperable due to a lack of maintenance.\nThe prime example of the Republic's incompetence was the Handlers of the Processors. Theoretically, they were to oversee the Juggernaut squadrons and provide tactical support during combat. However, the quality of Handlers was appallingly terrible. The government used military positions as temporary jobs for the unemployed of the Eighty-Five Sectors. Consequently, the people applying for the jobs were generally at dead last regarding qualifications. Combined with widespread discrimination against the Eighty-Six, the Handlers often had neither skills to command the Juggernaut Squadrons nor the willingness to carry out their duties. Some Handlers even mismanaged their squadrons deliberately, often leading to unnecessary casualties.\nThe 86 reviles their Alba handlers and superiors with a passion and many even think of mass desertion to let the Legions come and massacre the Alba. After the fall of the Republic, many 86 fantasizes massacre the Alba in revenge but only stopped by the Federals and their fellow 86 out of necessity.\nIronically, the Republic could have turned the tide against the Legion if they'd committed to the war effort. They possessed a communications system immune to Legion electronic warfare and a state-of-the-art command and control system. Their Interception Cannons proved to be very effective against a large formation of Legions. And they actually had the means to mass-produce advanced fighting vehicles. Sadly, these advantages were utterly negated by the incompetence of civil and military personnel and the obsession with racial purity.\nBrigadier General Karlstahl commented that the Republic's personnel were there only to fill the ranks. They had neither traditions nor dignity. They lacked education as soldiers and shirked from training. They only reaped the benefits of military service without appreciating the pride or duty that came with it. [22]\nFollowing the Republic's occupation by the Federal Republic of Giad, its military was heavily restricted by the Federacy due to severe human rights violations. The Republic's military was practically prohibited from having combat arms. Many incompetent or unnecessary personnel were also dismissed. The remaining were those who worked in administrative tasks and the military police. Still, the international community gave them a chance to redeem themselves by contributing to the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package. Despite this, however, only a handful of Alba officers (e.g, Vladilena Miliz\u00e9, Henrietta von Penrose, and Dustin Jaeger) contributed, as the populace thought the many Eighty-Six volunteering were enough to pull the Republic's weight.\nMaintaining civil order was the role of the military police. Naturally, the military police could only act within Federacy military regulations. The MPs on patrol had to remove the banners of the Patriotic Knights' supporters.[20] During the retaking of the First Sector, the military police in charge of the shelter went out to hunt to serve the Republic\u2019s citizens meat.[6]\nThe Republic's military officers were shown to be severely fanatical, yet incompetent, even after the fall of the Gran Mur.[20]\nSadly, even with all horrors and sufferings they went through, The remarkable ineptitude of the Republic's military was still unchanged. After the Republic's population evacuation was decided, no high-ranking officers wanted to be in charge since it was a risky operation. Any failure would place a black spot on the commander's track record. The Republic even requested the Federacy for Lena, a mere colonel, to take command. So they could put all blame on her in case anything went wrong. [23]\nEquipment[]\n- Standard Rifle:\nThe standard model used by the Republic Armed Forces employed high-caliber, full-size rifle bullets, and as such was made entirely out of sturdy metal alloy. This was done on the assumption they might have to fight armored opponents, but as a result, the rifles were exceptionally heavy. The Republic's soldiers consider the Republic\u2019s assault rifles to be terribly heavy. Soldiers in the Eighty-Five Sectors hate having to carry them around, let alone practice using them.[12]\n- Anti-Personnel Rifle:\nMain Article: FN FAL\n- Standard Sidearm:\nMain Article: P226\n- Interception Cannons:\nMain Article: Mine Fields and Interception Cannons\n- M1A4 Juggernaut:\nMain Article: M1A4 Juggernaut\n- M101 Barrett:\nMain Article: M101 Barrett\n- Para-RAID:\nMain Article: Para-RAID\nUniform[]\nTBA\nGovernment[]\nPre-Fall Government[]\nOfficially, the Republic of San Magnolia was a democratic country where the government was formed through the election. In reality, however, all political power was concentrated within the upper class, comprised of former nobilities from the old Alba Kingdom. They occupied most, if not all, important positions in the country's upper echelon through nepotism and patronage system. The political processes, such as elections, were purely to maintain the facade of democracy and, by extension, protect the privileges of the upper class.\nThe faulty establishment caused the political system to grow dysfunctional over time. By the time of the Legion War, the Republic's upper echelon was full of self-serving, delusional elites. The politicians were spineless cowards who only sought to appease the masses rather than actually governing. The top-brass bureaucrats were only concerned with a good track record instead of true competency and merit. The rank-and-file officials also became lazy and ignorant, focusing only on getting paid and doing a bare minimum.\nIn the large-scale offensive, the government was too late to realize the severity of the situation, where the Legion had already invaded the Eighty-Fifth Sector. Even worse, when they finally acknowledged the gravity of the problem, the government still prioritized the safety of the privileged class over the regular citizens. They deliberately delayed the emergency declaration so the upper class, the Celena, could flee safely before the roads became congested with refugee traffic. [24] As a result, 90% of Republic citizens were killed, mostly Adularia and Alabaster. In the aftermath, the Republic\u2019s president and high officers were heavily criticized by the Federacy's commander of the rescue forces.[14]\nInterim Government[]\nAs part of the Federacy's occupation, the Republic's government was disbanded and a puppet administration\u2014intended to be controlled by the Federacy\u2014was established.[20]\nThe Interim Government have no doubt that the Alba has established the greatest form of government in the history of humankind; a system wherein the superior race stands above all other races on the continent. They would never lose to the Legion, as they are the creation of an inferior race.[20]\nThey blamed the Eighty-Six\u2019s incompetence for the Republic's downfall. They criticized the Eighty-Six's failure to achieve victory over the course of a decade, despite claiming to have given them \"superb weapons\". Furthermore they condemned the Eighty-Six for the Gran Mur\u2019s collapse, for which they claimed the Eighty-Six has intentionally sabotaged the structural design.[20]\nVladilena Miliz\u00e9 suspects the interim government\u2014under the influence of the Patriotic Knights\u2014intentionally gave the wrong map of the Charit\u00e9 Underground Labyrinth to the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package.[25]\nPatriotic Knights[]\nYvonne Primev\u00e9re is the leader of The Holy Magnolian Order of Pureblood, Pure-White, Patriotic Knights. She has been rapidly gathering support from the old Republic\u2019s citizens and building up her position within the interim government.[20]\nOutraged by effectively having their nation stolen from them, they were determined to retain the Republic's independence and return to the former status quo. The Processors of the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package referred to the fanatics she led as \"Bleachers\". The Bleachers advocated for the return of the Eighty-Six to the Republic and the exit of the Federacy's hand in San Magnolian affairs.[20]\nFollowing the string of successes obtained by the Strike Package, the Bleachers attempted to spin a narrative around how their success was attributed to Vladilena Miliz\u00e9's leadership alone, proving that the Eighty-Six were better off under the command of the Republic. Colonel Miliz\u00e9 vehemently denied that notion, stating that the credit of the Strike Package's successes went to the Federacy, the United Kingdom, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the Strike Package's Processors.[2]\nThe organization is officially dismantled after the failed armed rebellions the surviving Alba against the Federacy with Yvonne Primev\u00e9re and her people are executed by the Federacy while surviving members are pushed to the frontlines against the Legion.\nLocations[]\nEighty-Five Sectors:[]\nThe 85 officially recognized sectors of the Republic where the Alba reside, spanning an area of roughly 23 thousand square kilometers. This constitutes less than half of the Republic's territory prior to the start of the war. The First Sector is located in the heart of the Republic, and the other Sectors spread out from its four sides in a rectangular fashion with numbers designated by order of closeness to the First Sector. The higher a Sector's number grew, the worse its residential environment, public safety, standard of education, and unemployment rate became. Most of the production industries are located in the Outer Sectors; industries like solar power plants, geothermal power plants, and wind farms are situated nearer to the peripheries of the Gran Mur.\nGran Mur:[]\nMain Article: Gran Mur\nThe Gran Mur (\u5927\u8981\u585e\u58c1\u7fa4, Guran My\u016bru?) is great fortification surrounding the Eighty-Five Sectors built by the Eighty-Six forced into labor. The Gran Mur[\u2020 2] acted as the Republic's final defense line, as well as a deterrent against Eighty-Six dissent. The fortification fell at the rounds of the railgun type Morpho, alongside a large concentration of Legion stationed in the Northern Front. The rest of the fortification's gates would be blasted away at the orders of Vladilena Miliz\u00e9 in order to clear a path for the Eighty-Six during the defense of the First Sector.\nFirst Sector (Libert\u00e9 et \u00c9galit\u00e9):[]\nLibert\u00e9 et \u00c9galit\u00e9 (\u30ea\u30d9\u30eb\u30c6\u30fb\u30a8\u30c8\u30fb\u30a8\u30ac\u30ea\u30c6, Riberute Eto Egarite?) is the capital city and administrative sector of the Republic. The First Sector had been an affluent neighborhood since the days of the monarchy, and its inhabitants were all families that had lived there for multiple generations. The pure-blood noble houses of the Celena are the primary residents. Colorata citizens were a rare sight in the First Sector even before the War began.\n- Miliz\u00e9 Estate: The residence of the Miliz\u00e9 household.\n- Palace Blancneige: The administrative headquarters of the Republic Armed Forces and operational center for Handlers. Originally the residence of the old kingdom's royal family. Following the siege, it was converted to military barrack for the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package.\n- Presidential Palace Lu\u00f1e: The center of the Revolution Festival.\nNorthern Capital Sector (Charit\u00e9):[]\nCharit\u00e9 (\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30c6, Sharite?) is the secondary capital of the Republic, infamous for its underground subway system which was given the moniker of \"The Charit\u00e9 Underground Labyinth\". Charit\u00e9 was brought to ruin and abandoned following the fall of the Gran Mur, where its subway system became a Legion production site. Charit\u00e9 was retaken nine months later by the Eighty-Sixth Strike Package.\nEighty-Sixth Sector:[]\nThe unofficial sector of the Republic where the Eighty-Six reside. The sector houses many internment camps where the Eighty-Six are forced into labor and experimented upon, as well as bases from which the Processors operate from. Additionally, the area is a no-man's land outside the Republic's defensive perimeter of minefields and artillery. The minefields contain both anti-tank mines to guard against Legion, and anti-personnel mines to keep the Eighty-Six outside.\nMine Fields and Interception Cannons:[]\nA large anti-personnel and anti-tank minefield surrounding Republic 120 kilometers away from the Gran Mur. Interception Cannons are placed along this line as artillery support against the Legion, although rarely used, as well as a deterrent to threaten deserting Processors. Most of the interception cannons were inoperable, due the Republic reducing its own armory and slothful maintenance.[3][14] These cannons did eventually see use under the command of Vladilena Miliz\u00e9, who did not hesitate to fire them as support for her Br\u00edsingamen Squadron.\nEastern Front:[]\nA frontier characterized by prairies, forests, and wetlands.\n- First Ward: A region where the Legion's advancement is the fiercest, it is the position of the Spearhead Squadron.\n- Processor Memorial: A glass encased gravesite on the old border between San Magnolia and Giad erected by the Federacy. There lay silently four Juggernauts and one Scavenger, along with 576 Juggernaut fragments with their Processor's names etched onto them.\n- Fifth Ward: The position of the Stiletto Squadron.\n- Sixteenth Ward: The position of the Falx Squadron.\n- Twenty-Seventh Ward: The position of the Bayonet Squadron.\n- Thirty-Fifth Ward: The position of the Halberd Squadron.\nWestern Front:[]\n- First Ward: A region where the Legion's advancement is the fiercest, it is the position of the Longbow Squadron.\nNorthern Front:[]\nIt snowed often enough that Processors in this region learned cold preservation techniques for their Juggernauts.\n- First Ward: A region where the Legion's advancement is the fiercest, it is the position of the Sledgehammer Squadron.\nSouthern Front:[]\n- First Ward: A region where the Legion's advancement is the fiercest, it is the position of the Razor Edge Squadron.\nTrivia[]\n- The Gran Mur was destroyed on the day of the Republic's Revolution Festival, August 25th of 2149.[26]\n- The area of the Republic and the Eighty-Sixth Sector combined is approximately 132,603 km2.[\u2020 3] This would be nearly equivalent to the size of England.\n- The Republic of San Magnolia has clear similarities to several republics in our world, especially France:\n- The capital being named Libert\u00e9 et \u00c9galit\u00e9, which is taken from the French national motto \"Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.\"\n- The Saint Magnolia statue is a symbol inspired by Marianne, a character from the painting \"La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple\" symbol of the revolution and the republic in France, like San Magnolia.\n- The story of Saint Magnolia, the patron saint of the Republic, resembles the story of the French heroine Jeanne d'Arc.\n- The country seems to have embodied every negative stereotype about the French military during World War II, including a desire to avoid any kind of sacrifice, incompetent leadership but also a line of fortifications (the Maginot line), and a complete loss of the will to fight by the leaders once said fortified line was breached. The only thing stopping them from surrendering outright was the Legion's inability to accept such an offer.\n- The Wartime Peace Preservation Act, Presidential Order #6609 is a reference to Executive Order 9066.\n- Asato also clearly indicates Nazi Germany (which itself was the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise to power) and the Final Solution as a template for the Republic's atrocities.\n- Magnolia flowers, the namesake of the Republic of San Magnolia, are also the state flower of many states in the American South and is the national flower of North Korea. A possible reference to the historical use of slavery in the South and the authoritarian regime of North Korea.[27]\n- Before the war, the Republic prided itself on its ability to grow living tissue and reconstitute it with artificial materials, as exemplified by the nerve-like crystals used in the Para-RAID.[28]\n- According to the novel Dies Passionis, Saint Magnolia was the royal princess of the royal house of the Alba Kingdom.\nFootnotes[]\n- \u2191 Immediately prior to the large-scale offensive, the Republic had a population of over ten million as stated in Volume 6, Chapter 1. It is mentioned that ten million Republic citizens were killed by the Legion during the large-scale offensive after the fall of Gran Mur, meaning that 90% of Republic citizens were killed and there is less than a million left.\n- \u2191 Gran Mule in Volume 1, Gran Mur in all subsequent volumes\n- \u2191 The Republic proper has an area of 23,000 km2, which assuming the shape of a circle would have a radius of 85.5 km. Add to that the 120 km needed to reach the Spearhead Squadron's base (r = 85.5 + 120 = 205.5) and run it through the circle's area formula (r2\u03c0) and the result above would be obtained.\nReferences[]\n- \u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 Volume 1 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 Volume 7 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 3.0 3.1 Volume 1 Chapter 7\n- \u2191 Asato Asato's Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 5.0 5.1 Volume 1 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 6.0 6.1 Volume 4 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Volume 7 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Asato Asato's Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Episode 11\n- \u2191 Roman Lempert's Official Twitter Account\n- \u2191 Volume 5 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 12.0 12.1 Volume 1 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 1 Chapter 5\n- \u2191 14.0 14.1 14.2 14.3 14.4 Volume 1 Epilogue\n- \u2191 Volume 3 Interlude\n- \u2191 Volume 8 Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 3 Chapter 9\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Chapter 3\n- \u2191 20.0 20.1 20.2 20.3 20.4 20.5 20.6 20.7 20.8 Volume 4 Chapter 2\n- \u2191 Fragmental Neoteny Manga Chapter 1\n- \u2191 Volume 11, The First Sector\n- \u2191 Volume 11, D-Day Plus Three\n- \u2191 Volume 11, In the San Magnolian capital, Libert\u00e9 et \u00c9galit\u00e9: 26.8.368 RY.\n- \u2191 Volume 4 Chapter 4\n- \u2191 Volume 2 Interlude\n- \u2191 [- Wikipedia]\n- \u2191 Volume 9 Chapter 1"

  "argos_summary": "The review praises the anime adaptation of 86 for its engaging storytelling, strong character development, and high-quality animation, noting its thoughtful exploration of racism and dehumanization through the conflict between the Alba and Colorata. It highlights the series\u2019 blend of action and emotional depth, drawing parallels to classic mecha works like Armored Trooper VOTOMS. The Blu\u2011ray release is commended for its pristine audio\u2011visual quality, though it lacks additional extras. Overall, the reviewer recommends the set for fans of war\u2011driven, culturally resonant anime.",
