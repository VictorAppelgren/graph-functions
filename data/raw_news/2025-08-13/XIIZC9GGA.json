  "content": "ATLANTA, Aug. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GLO24K, a U.S.-based global beauty brand, proudly announces the launch of its latest innovation: the Bionic 7-Color LED Eye Care Mask, a cutting-edge device designed to target the delicate and sensitive skin around the eyes. This advanced beauty tool combats visible signs of aging\u2014such as puffiness, under-eye bags, dark circles, wrinkles, and fine lines\u2014through the power of NASA-inspired LED technology.\n\nAs a pioneer in the LED beauty device market, GLO24K developed this tool to deliver professional-level skin rejuvenation from the comfort of home. With 108 high-performance LED diodes and 7 targeted light colors, the Bionic Eye Mask provides customized, results-driven care that surpasses most products on the market.\n\nWhy LED Technology Works\n\nOriginally developed by NASA to accelerate healing in space, LED (Light Emitting Diode) therapy has since been embraced by dermatologists for its ability to stimulate collagen production and cell regeneration\u2014without pain, downtime, or invasive procedures.\n\nEach light color in the GLO24K Bionic Eye Mask delivers a specific benefit:\n\nIn just 3 minutes per session, several times a week, users will notice firmer, healthier-looking skin around the eyes.\n\nWhat Makes GLO24K Better Than the Competition\n\nUnlike most eye masks that use a single LED color and fewer than 50 diodes, the GLO24K Bionic Eye Mask is packed with 108 premium LED lights and offers 7 distinct color modes\u2014providing a more comprehensive, targeted treatment. It also includes a vibration mode to improve blood flow and increase product absorption\u2014features that most competing products simply don't offer.\n\u2022 Unisex and suitable for all skin types\n\u2022 Designed with durability and ease-of-use in mind\n\nAt a comparable price, GLO24K delivers more technology, better results, and a luxury experience without the luxury markup. It's where value meets performance.\n\nCelebrity-Approved Skincare Tech\n\nLED light therapy is no longer a hidden secret\u2014celebrities like Kourtney Kardashian, Jessica Alba, Chrissy Teigen, and Victoria Beckham regularly use LED masks in their routines. Top Hollywood facialists, including Joanna Vargas and Shani Darden, rely on this technology to deliver red-carpet-ready results to their A-list clients.\n\nGLO24K's Bionic Eye Mask makes that same advanced skincare technology more accessible\u2014without compromising quality.\n\nAffordable Luxury with Real Results\n\n\"Today's consumers are informed and selective\u2014they want innovation, performance, and value,\" says Eli Shwartz, Co-Owner of GLO24K. \"We created the Bionic 7-Color LED Eye Mask to outperform the competition not just in features, but in actual results. It's powerful, effective, and beautifully designed\u2014all at a fair price. That's what we call affordable luxury.\"\n\nThe Bionic Eye Mask is part of GLO24K's full line of LED-powered skincare tools for the face, neck, and eyes\u2014all clinically tested and dermatologist-approved for visible anti-aging results.\n\nGLO24K products are available online and in retail locations, spas, doctor's offices, airline catalogs, and beauty boxes across the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the UAE.\n\nWhere Beauty Meets Technology\u2014Welcome to the Next Generation of Skincare.\n\nFor press inquiries, wholesale opportunities, or more information, visit: www.glo24k.com",
