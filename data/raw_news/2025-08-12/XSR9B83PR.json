  "title": "Trump Tells Goldman Sachs CEO He Should Stick to DJ\u2019ing",
  "description": "David Solomon has not indicated that he\u2019s thinking about quitting his day job any time soon.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump thinks that the leader of one of America\u2019s biggest banks should focus on his DJ career\u2014rather than delivering dire forecasts of how Trump\u2019s tariffs will hurt American consumers.\n\nThe president took to Truth Social on Monday to attack David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs who has sometimes also gone by the moniker \u201cDJ D-Sol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution.\u201d\n\nThe screed comes days after the investment bank released a report predicting that consumers would soon feel the burn of his trade policies.\n\nThe report, spearheaded by Goldman\u2019s longtime chief economist Jan Hatzius, predicted that consumers would ultimately absorb 67 percent of the cost of recent tariffs (up from the current estimated burden of 22 percent).\n\nGoldman\u2019s predictions follow up on a similar report that the bank released in July, which predicted pain for consumers\u2019 wallets and a drop in earnings for American businesses.\n\nHatzius is widely respected on Wall Street, in part for his correct prediction in 2008 that mortgage defaults could trigger a recession.\n\nSolomon has led Goldman since 2018, navigating the bank through scandals and reducing the number of hours junior bankers are allowed to work.\n\nHe has embodied the work-life balance that he\u2019s tried to cultivate by performing electronic dance music in his spare time, gracing stages at nightclubs and major music festivals.\n\nThe New York Times wrote in 2017 that Solomon presents a \u201cyouthful, unguarded side that is rare in the wealthy, button-down world of high finance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that unguarded side that drew Trump\u2019s mockery on Tuesday, at a time when the president has lashed out at officials inside and outside of government who have delivered numbers he didn\u2019t like.\n\nIronically, the president has had several former Goldman execs serve under him across his two administrations, including Gary Cohn, Anthony Scaramucci, and Steve Mnuchin.\n\nThe pipeline of talent from Wall Street to Pennsylvania Avenue has slowed in Trump 2.0, but the bank\u2019s fingerprints can still be traced to the halls of government around the world: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, for instance, spent 13 years at the bank before moving to the public sector.\n\nSolomon donated $2,000 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign in 2000, and has donated to various Democratic candidates in the years since.\n\nGoldman contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s 2025 inaugural committee, joining several other prominent banks, including J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, and Citibank.",

      "text": "After a sharp rally in the S&P 500 to a record high, investors are turning their attention to upcoming corporate earnings announcements, which may offer some important clues on how President Trump\u2019s tariff policies are filtering through to the corporate bottom line.\nS&P 500 companies will start reporting their earnings for the second quarter of the financial year on July 15, beginning with some large financial services companies.\nBased on announced policies, the effective US tariff rate has risen by roughly 10 percentage points to 13%. Economists in Goldman Sachs Research estimate the effective tariff rate will eventually be increased by an additional 4 percentage points to 17%.\nPresident Trump first announced increased tariffs in February this year, but investors are still trying to work out exactly how the increased taxes are affecting US companies. \u201cClients have been keenly focused on who will ultimately shoulder the cost of tariffs,\u201d writes David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, in a recent report.\nHow will tariffs affect S&P 500 stocks?\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs Research assume that companies will pass on 70% of the direct cost of tariffs to consumers through higher prices. But the core measurement for US consumer prices increased less than expected in May. Some recent business surveys have indicated lower pass-through of tariff costs to consumers.\n\u201cEarly earnings results offer conflicting messages on the margin outlook,\u201d Kostin writes. \u201cCompanies have so far only announced modest price increases this year, although increases have been larger among firms most exposed to tariffs.\u201d\nOn the other hand, if companies themselves have to absorb a larger-than-expected share of the cost of tariffs, their profit margins will come under pressure. Revisions to analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of corporate margins suggest that some companies may not be able to fully offset the impact of tariffs.\nSome companies will be able to tap into built-up inventories to minimize the hit to their margins from tariffs. The aggregate S&P 500 inventory-to-sales ratio was largely unchanged in the first quarter of 2025, but some companies built up their inventories before tariffs were implemented\nHow are US tariffs impacting corporate earnings and profitability?\nAnalysts also expect the growth in earnings-per-share, a key measurement of companies\u2019 profitability, to drop off this quarter. The consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies\u2019 earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year\u2014down from 12% in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, consensus forecasts imply that margins contracted by 50 basis points to 11.6% from 12.1%.\n\u201cWe expect the S&P 500 in aggregate will beat the low bar set for the second quarter,\u201d Kostin writes.\nThe outlook for demand, meanwhile, still appears solid. Goldman Sachs Research expects nominal GDP in the US to grow at an average rate of 4.5% year-on-year in 2025. It also forecasts positive real income and spending growth for companies across all income cohorts. And sales revision breadth, which measures the difference between the number of companies with upward and downward revisions to their future sales estimates, has jumped back into positive territory after a sharp decline in April.\nHow are tariffs impacting capital expenditures and investment?\nTariffs and policy uncertainty don\u2019t appear to have substantially dampened companies\u2019 investment spending plans. Goldman Sachs economists found in a recent report that analysts raised capital spending expectations overall, when measured by weighted average.\nHowever, those estimates for capital spending vary widely by company. Revisions to companies\u2019 spending plans have been greatest for the sectors and stocks most exposed to the continuing development of AI, such as utilities (which provide power for data centers) and information technology. By contrast, analysts have cut capital expenditure estimates in most other sectors. Economists at Goldman Sachs Research found that capital expenditure estimates have been lowered for companies more affected by policy uncertainty, tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs.\nWhat is the forecast for the S&P 500?\nIn total, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that S&P 500 earnings-per-share will grow 7% in 2025 to $262. That\u2019s slightly above the median strategist 2025 forecast for a 6% increase to $260.\nThe team\u2019s estimate incorporates a modest drag on economic growth and a one-time boost to inflation from tariffs, which is likely to weigh on some sectors. But this is expected to be offset by growth in certain sectors such as information technology, communication services, and healthcare.\nKostin\u2019s team forecasts that the S&P 500 will return 3.5% over the next 12 months (as of July 7), reaching 6500.\nThis material is provided in conjunction with the associated video/audio content for convenience.

      "text": "A top aide to former President Barack Obama roasted President Donald Trump for firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over an abysmal jobs report.\n\u201cFrom now on, all jobs numbers will be coming from the guy who says he\u2019s 6\u20193\u2019\u2019 and weighs 215,\u201d read the caption to an unflattering image of Trump in his golf threads posted by David Axelrod, who served as chief strategy advisor to both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and then as a top aide in the Obama White House.\nOn Friday, Trump fired Erika McEntarfer as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) after the agency released data showing U.S. employers had only created 73,000 new jobs in July, falling well below the 109,000 forecasted by the White House. BLS also revised its estimate of employment statistics for the previous two months by more than 250,000.\nTrump accused McEntarfer of having \u201cRIGGED\u201d the jobs numbers in order \u201cto make the Republicans, and ME, look bad\u201d amid outcry at the largest non-COVID-related drop in more than 45 years.\nThe move has prompted backlash from Trump\u2019s political opponents, with Democrats accusing his administration of politicizing economic data, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blasting him as a \u201cbad leader\u201d who \u201cshoots the messenger\u201d over numbers he doesn\u2019t like.\nTrump\u2019s physician claimed in 2016 that he was 6\u20193\u201d and weighed 236 pounds. Critics noted that Trump doesn\u2019t appear to stack up in photos beside other public figures known to be of that height.\nThe president again listed his height as 6\u20193\u201d, but his weight as 215 pounds, when he was booked in Fulton County on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\nThe issue resurfaced earlier this week after Trump gave a press conference Thursday standing beside NFL star Harrison Butker, who dwarfs the president in photos from the event despite supposedly standing a mere inch taller than him."
