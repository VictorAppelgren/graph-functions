  "content": "Every single desktop PC, console, or laptop has one of these. It won't boost your frame rate, nor does it have billions of transistors, and it's not manufactured using the latest chip process nodes. That might sound boring, right? Not at all! The power supply unit is incredibly important because, without it, our computers would do absolutely nothing.\n\nWhile power supply units don't make flashy headlines like the latest CPUs or GPUs, they're seriously cool pieces of engineering. So, let's put on our virtual lab coats and dissect the humble PSU, breaking down its components and seeing how each piece plays a critical role.\n\nMany computer parts have names that require a bit of tech knowledge to understand exactly what it does (e.g. solid state drive) but in the case of the power supply unit, it's pretty obvious. It's a unit. And it supplies power!\n\nSince we can't just dust off our hands and proudly say \"article done\" with that kind of statement, we better start having a look at one. For this article, we are examining a Cooler Master G650M. It is a fairly standard (if older) unit with a design that is similar to many other PSUs on the market. It also includes one particular feature not found in every PSU, which we will explore later.\n\nThis PSU is built in the standard ATX form factor and follows the ATX12V v2.31 specification. This means it will fit in most computer cases. There are other form factors for smaller or specialized cases, such as those used by certain vendors or servers.\n\nWhile many PSUs share the same width and height, the length may vary depending on the design. As of writing, newer PSUs often comply with the ATX 3.0 standard, which adds features such as support for the 12VHPWR connector used by modern high-end GPUs.\n\nPSUs are also usually labelled by how much power they can supply as a maximum; in the case of the Cooler Master, it can provide up to 650 watts of electrical power. We'll see what that actually means in this article, but you can get PSUs that deliver just a small number of watts, as not everything computer-wise needs hundreds of watts to run. The majority of desktop PCs will run fine in the range of 400 to 600 W, though.\n\nPSUs like this one are contained within a metal box, usually black or bare metal, so they can be heavy. Laptops nearly always have a PSU that sits externally to the computer and is almost always plastic, but the insides are very similar to what we'll see in this one.\n\nMost desktop PC power supplies come with a switch to isolate the mains electricity supply and a fan to keep things nice and cool, but not all do (or need to). Not all of them will have a metal body full of holes, either \u2013 those found in servers rarely have them.\n\nBut as you can see in the picture above, we've already taken a screwdriver to our example, so let's rip off the lid and jump inside.\n\nI'm back in black: Why computers can't use wall power directly\n\nBefore we start rummaging about with the insides of a PSU, let's think about why we even need one in the first place. Why can't we have the computer connect directly into the mains outlet? The answer lies in the fact that modern computer parts are expecting the electrical power to be delivered in a very different form to that provided by the outlet.\n\nThe graph below displays how mains electricity (US = blue and green lines; UK = red line) is supposed to be. The x-axis shows time in milliseconds and the y-axis shows voltage in volts. The best way to think about voltage is that it's a measure of energy difference between two points.\n\nIf a voltage is applied across a conducting material (e.g. a length of metal wire), the difference in energy will make electrons in the material flow from the higher energy level to the lower one. These are one of the building blocks of atoms, that make up the material, and metals have lots of electrons free to move about. This flow of electrons is called a current and gets measured in amps.\n\nOne good analogy for the techno-speak is that electricity can be thought to be like water in a hose: voltage is akin to the pressure you're using, the flow rate of the water is the current, and any restrictions in the pipe acts the same as electrical resistance.\n\nWe can see that mains electricity varies over time and this is known as an alternating current voltage supply - or just AC, for short. In the US, the mains voltage alternates 60 times per second, reaching a peak of 340 V or 170 V, depending on the location and supply. The UK hits a slightly lower peak, and varies a little slower, too. Almost all countries around the world have mains outlet voltages like this, with just a few having lower or higher peak voltages.\n\nThe need for a PSU lies in the fact that computers don't work with AC: they need a constant voltage, one that never changes, and it also needs to be of much lower level. Using the same graph scales, it looks something like this:\n\nIt's so much lower that it's barely visible, but modern computers primarily use +12V, +5V, and +3.3V rails. The -12V rail remains included for compatibility but is virtually unused by contemporary consumer hardware. Because these values are constant, they're called direct current or DC, for short. So a big part of what a PSU does, is convert AC to DC (cue the guitars...). Time to open the unit and have a look at how it does this!\n\nSo a big part of what a PSU does, is convert AC to DC (cue the guitars)... time to open the unit and have a look at how it does this!\n\nAt this stage, we should warn you not to open a PSU unless you're trained. Even after it's unplugged, large capacitors can store dangerous voltages that may cause severe injury or even be lethal.\n\nThe layout of this PSU is similar to many others, and although the make and model of the various parts used inside will be different, they fundamentally do the same thing.\n\nThe mains outlet connection to the PSU is at the top-left hand corner of the picture and the supply essentially runs clockwise around the picture, until reaching the output of the PSU (big cluster of colored wires, bottom left-hand corner).\n\nIf we flip the circuit board over, we can see that compared to connections on a motherboard, these are broad and deep \u2013 they're designed to have lots of current flowing through them. Something else that's immediately obvious is the big gap running down the middle, like a river cutting a path in a field.\n\nThis highlights the fact that all PSUs have two clearly defined sections to them: primary and secondary. The former is all about setting up the input voltage so that it can be efficiently changed from the mains supply level; the latter is everything about that change and the processes afterwards.\n\nThe very first thing the PSU does to the mains electricity isn't about changing it from AC to DC, or dropping voltage \u2013 instead, it's all about smoothing out the input voltage. Because we have lots of electrical devices in our homes, offices, and business that switch on and off, as well as emit electromagnetic signals, the varying AC is often lumpy and with the occasional spikes (the length of the variations isn't constant either). Not only do these make it harder for the PSU to adjust the mains, it can also damage some of the components inside it.\n\nThis PSU has two stages of so-called transient filters, the first of which is directly applied to input socket, using 3 components called capacitors to do the job. Think of these as being like a speed bump for sudden changes in the input voltage.\n\nThe second stage of filtering in this PSU is more complex, but essentially does the same thing.\n\nThe yellow blocks are more capacitors, whereas the green rings wrapped in copper wire are inductors (although they're usually called chokes when used this way). Inductors store electrical energy in a magnetic field but this field also 'pushes back' on the voltage supplying the energy \u2013 so a sudden spike in the voltage results in a sudden kick back from the magnetic field to suppress it.\n\nThe two little blue discs are yet more capacitors and just below them (hidden under a black plastic cover) is a metal oxide varistor (MOV). These are also used to help counter jumps and spikes in the input voltage; you can read more about different types of transient filter circuits here.\n\nThis section of a PSU is often the first sign of where costs have been cut to ensure the model hits a specific budget. Cheaper ones will have less filtering, and the cheapest of all will have none at all (which is not what you want!).\n\nNow that we're all smooth and chilled, let's get on with the day job of a PSU: changing the voltage.\n\nRock down to electric avenue: AC to DC conversion\n\nRemember that the PSU needs to change an AC voltage that might be averaging 120 volts (technically, it's root mean squaring 120 volts, but that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue) and hack that down into DC voltages of 12, 5, and 3.3 volts.\n\nThe first thing that gets done is an AC to DC conversion, and this PSU uses a component called a bridge rectifier. In the picture below, this is the flat black object glued to the chunk of metal (which acts as a heatsink).\n\nOnce again, this is another area where a PSU manufacturer can cut costs, with cheaper components doing a worse job of the AC-to-DC conversion (e.g. emitting more heat). Now, if the input voltage peaks at 170 volts (which is the case for 120V mains), then the bridge rectifier will output 170 volts DC.\n\nThis gets passed on to the next stage of the PSU and in the one we're looking at, it's called an active power factor correction converter (APFC). This circuit adjusts the current flow in the unit to take into account that it is full of components that store and release energy in a complex way; this can result in the actual power output of the unit being less that what you're supposed to be getting.\n\nSome cheaper PSUs use passive PFC, which relies on fixed components and cannot dynamically adjust current draw. It's less efficient and not compliant with modern energy standards, making it unsuitable for high-performance systems.\n\nThe APFC can be seen in the image above - those big cylinders on the left are capacitors and they store the adjusted current, before sending them on to the next step in the PSU's chain of processes.\n\nThis section tucked behind the APFC is called a pulse width modulation circuit (PWM, for short). Its job is to take the DC voltage and use several field effect transistors to switch the voltage on and off at a very high rate \u2013 it essentially converts the DC voltage back into an AC one. It does this because the part of the PSU that turns the mains voltage right down into 12 volts is a transformer. These devices use electromagnetic induction and a set of two coils of wire (one having more loops in the coil than the other) to step down the voltage; however, transformers only work with an alternating voltage.\n\nThe frequency of the AC voltage (the rate at which it varies, measured in hertz, Hz) significantly affects how efficient the transformer is \u2013 higher is better \u2013 which is why the 50/60 Hz mains supply gets changed into one that varies at something like 50/60 thousand Hz. The more efficient a transformer is, the smaller it can be. This super fast switching of the DC voltage is the source of the name for this type of device: a switched mode power supply (SMPS).\n\nYou can see 3 transformers in the picture below - the largest generates just the 12 volt output; in other PSUs, the big transformer might make all of the voltages. The next larger one creates a single 5 volt output that we'll talk about in a bit, and the smallest one acts as an isolator for the PWM circuit, keeping it safe from harm and also stopping it from causing interference with other voltages in the PSU.\n\nVarious PSUs will have different ways of creating the required voltages, isolating the PWM circuit, and so on. It'll all depend on budget constraints and how much power the unit needs to offer. All of them, though, will need to take the output off the transformer and turn it back into DC.\n\nIn the image below, the large chunk of metal is the heatsink for the bridge rectifiers that do this conversion. We can also see in this specific PSU, the circuit board in the middle of the picture corresponds to a cluster of voltage regulation modules (VRMs) that create the 5 and 3.3 volt outputs.\n\nAt this stage it's worth talking about something called ripple.\n\nIn a perfect world, with perfect PSUs, the varying AC voltage would be converted into a constant, never-wavering DC voltage. In reality, though, it's not 100% spot on, and the DC voltages do vary ever so slightly.\n\nThis variation is called the ripple voltage and for a PSU, you want it to be a small as possible. Cooler Master doesn't provide the size of the ripple voltage in the specifications for this PSU model, so we turned to a detailed review to find them. One review by the now-archived JonnyGuru found that the +12V line in their tests had ripple voltage peaking at 0.042 volts (42 millivolts). According to ATX specifications, ripple voltage should not exceed 120 millivolts on the +12V line and 50 millivolts on the +5V or +3.3V lines.\n\nThe image below shows you how this compares to what is required. The red line is the targeted constant +12V DC, the varying blue line is what we're actually getting (although the ripple itself isn't constant).\n\nThe quality of the capacitors used throughout the PSU play a significant role. Smaller, cheaper ones would result in the ripple being bigger, which is not what we want. If it's too big, then the complex electronic circuitry in the rest of the computer might operate in an unstable manner. Fortunately, in our example, 40-odd millivolts is okay: not great, but not bad.\n\nNo matter what is used to create the output voltages and ensure they're DC in form, there's still a few more bits of circuitry needed before we start waving cables out the place. It all relates to managing the PSU's outputs, ensuring that if a high demand for power is taking place on one particular voltage, then the others aren't going to be nobbled in the process.\n\nThe chip you can see here is called a supervisor and monitors the outputs, checking that they're not delivering too much or too little voltage and current. It's not very sophisticated, though, as all it does it shut off the PSU, if any of those problems occur.\n\nMore expensive supply units use digital signal processors (DSPs) to monitor what's going on, and these can also adjust the voltages if required, as well as send details about the status of the PSU to the computer using it. Not overly useful for the typical PC user, but for computers used as servers, compute machines, and so on, it's often a desired feature.\n\nAll power supply units come with long bundles of wires, sprouting out of their back. The number of bundles, and how they're connecting to the main unit will differ across the vast array of models available, but they'll all provide some standard connections.\n\nSince voltage is a measure of difference, there needs to be two wires for a given output: one for the indicated voltage (e.g. positive 12 volts, or +12V for short) and a reference wire that the difference is measured against. This wire is known as the ground or common line, and the two form a loop: running out the PSU, to the device needing the power, and then back into the unit.\n\nThe flow of current runs through these loop wires, but since some of the loops will only have a small amount of current flowing in them, several ground wires can be shared by different loops.\n\nThe first of which is the obligatory 24-pin ATX12V version 2.4 connection - it offers multiple wires for the various voltages, plus a few specific ones.\n\nAn important one is the +5V standby wire - for as long as the PSU is switched on and plugged in, this wire is always live. This is because a computer doesn't really switch off, when you tell the operating system to shut down. The motherboard draws the power it needs to remain active off the standby connection.\n\nThere will also be another 8 pin connector for the motherboard, that provides two sets of +12V and ground wires, and most PSUs will also provide at least one PCI Express 6 or 8-pin power connector.\n\nGraphics cards can only take a maximum of 75W from the motherboard PCI Express slot, so this connector offers additional power for today's monstrous GPUs.\n\nThis particular PSU actually runs two PCI Express power connectors off the same wires, for cost reasons, so if you had a really powerful graphics card in the computer, it would be best to use a separate bundle of wires.\n\nThe difference between the 6 and 8-pin PCI Express connector, is an extra two ground wires. This allows a higher level of current to flow down the +12V wires, helping to feed hungrier GPUs.\n\nModern GPUs, like Nvidia's RTX 50 series, use the now infamous 12VHPWR connector that can deliver up to 600 W through a single cable. Many new PSUs include this connector to meet updated ATX 3.0 specifications.\n\nOver the past few years, we've seen an increase number of power supply units proudly wear a tag of 'modular' in their description. All this means is that some of the power connectors are wired to another connector, that slots directly into the PSU. So instead of having a mass of cables and connectors clogging up the inside of the computer case, you can remove what don't need to save some space.\n\nThis Cooler Master model, like many others, uses a fairly basic connection system for the modular cables.\n\nEach connector provides one each of +12V, +5V, and +3.3V wires, along with two ground wires, and depending on what device the cable is going to be attached to, the connector at the other end of the cable will either use the same wiring configuration, or something simpler.\n\nThe Serial ATA (SATA) connector above is used to provide power for hard drives, solid state drives, and peripherals such as DVD burners.\n\nThis familiar shape goes by the snappy name of an AMP MATE-N-LOK 1-480424-0 power connector. Well, most people call it a Molex connector, but that's actually the name of the company that developed it. It provides one +12V, one +5V, and two ground wires.\n\nThe output supply cabling of a PSU is another area where costs can be saved or given a higher budget, either to improve looks or flexibility of the wires. The thickness (or gauge) of the metal wire used in the cables plays a part, too, as thicker wires have less electrical resistance than thinner ones, which results in less heat being generated as current flows through them.\n\nAt the beginning of this article, we said that most power supply units are named after the maximum amount of power they can offer. At the simplest level, electrical power is simply voltage multiplied by current (e.g. 12 volts x 20 amps = 240 watts) and while such a statement will have many engineers chomping at the bit to correct this remark, it works well enough for our purposes.\n\nLike most branded or generic models, our PSU comes with a label providing various snippets of information about how much power each voltage line can provide.\n\nHere we can see that the total power available from all the +12V lines added together peaks at 624 W; add in all the others stated on the label and we get a total of 760 W, so what gives? Well, it's down to the fact that the normal +5V and +3.3V lines are created using VRMs off the +12V output of the PSU.\n\nAnd, of course, all of the output voltages come from a single source: the mains outlet. So the rating of 650 W is the maximum the PSU can provide as a total across all lines. So if you were using 600 W on the +12V output, you'll only have 50 W left for everything else. Fortunately, the majority of hardware inside a modern PC takes the bulk of its power off the 12V lines anyway, so it's rarely a problem assuming you've picked the right PSU model for your needs.\n\nNext to the power specifications, there's a label saying '80 Plus Bronze.' This is an efficiency rating that's part of a voluntary program, not a legal requirement, used to help consumers gauge how efficiently a PSU converts wall power into usable DC power. The efficiency also depends on what size of load the PSU is attempting to serve (i.e. how much current is being drawn down the various lines) .\n\nMost recently, a new \"80 Plus Ruby\" energy efficiency rating was introduced that surpasses the current highest tier, Titanium. Initially, Ruby-rated PSUs will be used in data centers, though it's unclear when they will be available for consumer PCs. These Ruby-rated PSUs could just as well be labeled 90 Plus, as they are required to maintain at least 90% energy efficiency across the entire power delivery system, even under a light 5% load at 230V, 277V, and 480V AC-DC, as well as 380V DC.\n\nIf we take our Cooler Master unit, running so that it's providing 325 W of power (50% of its max rating), then we can expect it to have an efficiency of 80 to 85%, depending on the mains supply voltage. This would result in the unit drawing 382 to 406 W from the wall outlet. A higher 80 PLUS rating doesn't mean the PSU gives you more power, it just wastes less during all the filtering, rectifying, switching, and transforming stages.\n\nAlso note that the peak efficiency is somewhere between 50 and 100% loading; some manufacturers provide charts showing how you can expect the unit to perform under different loads and supply voltages.\n\nIt's worth paying attention to this information sometimes, especially if you've tempted to lay down a stack of bucks on a 1000 W PSU. If your computer is going to use anywhere near that power level, then its efficiency is going to take a bit of a sting.\n\nYou might see some PSUs claiming to be single rail or multi-rail (or offer a switch to flip between the two). The term rail is just another word for the specific voltage that the power unit generates. Our Cooler Master example has a single 12 volt rail and all the various power connectors that provide +12V draw current off that rail, if used. A multi-rail PSU will have two or more systems providing the 12 volts - however, there's a big difference in how this is implemented.\n\nPSUs for data center applications or compute servers will have multiple rails for fault tolerance, so if one fails, it won't affect the others. In multi-rail PSUs, each rail has its own overcurrent protection (OCP). This improves safety by preventing a single short circuit from drawing excessive current, which can reduce the risk of damage or fire. In our sample, the PSU provides up to 52 amps of current off the +12V line, equating to 624 watts of electrical power. A cheap multi-rail version of the same unit might have two +12V lines shown in the specification, but each will only provide 26 amps of current (or 312 W).\n\nFor most desktop users, a well-designed PSU with a single +12V rail is perfectly safe and reliable. Multi-rail designs primarily add extra safety layers for specialized systems, such as servers or high-end workstations.\n\nPower supply units come in a wide range of prices. A quick run through popular listings on Amazon shows that a basic but serviceable 500 W Thermaltake unit goes for around $50, while higher end models go all the way up to $400 for a fully modular 1300 W powerhouse from be quiet, or even more for a massive 1600W PSU from Seasonic.\n\nBut what are you getting for your money? The ability to deliver more power is the obvious one, but it's how that power gets delivered.\n\nThe ultra cheap model permits up to 25A of current on the +12V lines, whereas the wallet buster provides over 3 times more, at 83A. Today's CPUs and graphics cards use the +12V lines for almost all of their power requirements, but surely 25A is enough?\n\nGiven that you can now buy a desktop CPU with 64 cores and pair it with an equally titanic graphics card, each capable of drawing 450 W or more at full load, a cheap PSU absolutely would not be up to the demand. In contrast, a more expensive unit will have the headroom to handle these power-hungry components. And with a premium CPU and GPU easily exceeding $3,000 combined, spending a few hundred more on a quality PSU is a wise investment rather than a shock.\n\nBut what you're really paying for is the quality of the components used inside the PSU. Go back to the start of this article and look at the guts of the Cooler Master unit we've been taking apart. There's not a massive amount of parts there, and since virtually every bit is critical to the operation of the device, it's not hard to see why spending more is not always money for nothing.\n\nAnd with that, we bring our dissection of the PSU to a close (and leave a trail of bits all over the floor). It's a fascinating piece of a kit and the level of engineering involved in designing and manufacturing a good one is surprisingly complex.\n\nIf you've got any questions about power supply units or the one currently sitting in your computer, quietly doing its job, fire them our way in the comments section below as usual.

  "summary": "The article discusses the anatomy of a Power Supply Unit (PSU), a device that supplies power to power computers. This article focuses on a Cooler Master G650M, a standard unit that can provide up to 650 watts of electrical power. The PSU is designed in the standard ATX form factor and follows the ATX12V v2.31 specification, which means it can fit into most computer cases. While many PSUs share the same width and height, the length may vary depending on the design. Modern PSUs are often more flexible and often come with features such as support for the 12VHPWR connector used by modern high-end GPUs. However, the article also discusses why computers cannot connect directly into the mains outlet due to modern computer parts expecting the electrical power to be delivered in a different form to that provided by the outlet.",

      "text": "Voltage regulator module\nA voltage regulator module (VRM), sometimes called processor power module (PPM), is a buck converter that provides the microprocessor and chipset the appropriate supply voltage, converting +3.3 V, +5 V or +12 V to lower voltages required by the devices, allowing devices with different supply voltages be mounted on the same motherboard. On personal computer (PC) systems, the VRM is typically made up of power MOSFET devices.[1]\nOverview\n[edit]Most voltage regulator module implementations are soldered onto the motherboard. Some processors, such as Intel Haswell and Ice Lake CPUs, feature some voltage regulation components on the same CPU package, reduce the VRM design of the motherboard; such a design brings certain levels of simplification to complex voltage regulation involving numerous CPU supply voltages and dynamic powering up and down of various areas of a CPU.[2] A voltage regulator integrated on-package or on-die is usually referred to as fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) or simply an integrated voltage regulator (IVR).\nMost modern CPUs require less than 1.5 V,[3] as CPU designers tend to use lower CPU core voltages; lower voltages help in reducing CPU power dissipation, which is often specified through thermal design power (TDP) that serves as the nominal value for designing CPU cooling systems.[4]\nSome voltage regulators provide a fixed supply voltage to the processor, but most of them sense the required supply voltage from the processor, essentially acting as a continuously-variable adjustable regulator. In particular, VRMs that are soldered to the motherboard are supposed to do the sensing, according to the Intel specification.\nModern video cards also use a VRM due to higher power and current requirements. These VRMs may generate a significant amount of heat[5] and require heat sinks separate from the GPU.[6]\nVoltage identification\n[edit]The correct supply voltage and current is communicated by the microprocessor to the VRM at startup via a number of bits called VID (voltage identification definition). In particular, the VRM initially provides a standard supply voltage to the VID logic, which is the part of the processor whose only aim is to then send the VID to the VRM. When the VRM has received the VID identifying the required supply voltage, it starts acting as a voltage regulator, providing the required constant voltage and current supply to the processor.[7]\nInstead of having a power supply unit generate some fixed voltage, the CPU uses a small set of digital signals, the VID lines, to instruct an on-board power converter of the desired voltage level. The switch-mode buck converter then adjusts its output accordingly. The flexibility so obtained makes it possible to use the same power supply unit for CPUs with different nominal supply voltages and to reduce power consumption during idle periods by lowering the supply voltage.[8]\nFor example, a unit with 5-bit VID would output one of at most 32 (25) distinct output voltages. These voltages are usually (but not always) evenly spaced within a given range. Some of the code words may be reserved for special functions such as shutting down the unit, hence a 5-bit VID unit may have fewer than 32 output voltage levels. How the numerical codes map to supply voltages is typically specified in tables provided by component manufacturers. Since 2008 VID comes in 5-, 6- and 8-bit varieties and is mostly applied to power modules outputting between 0.5 V and 3.5 V.\nVRM and overclocking\n[edit]The VRMs are essential for overclocking. The quality of a VRM directly impacts the motherboard\u2019s overclocking potential. The same overclocked processor can exhibit noticeable performance differences when paired with different VRMs. The reason for this is that a steady power supply is needed for successful overclocking. When a chip is pushed past its factory settings, that increases the power draw, so the VRM needs to match its output accordingly.[9]\nSee also\n[edit]- Switched-mode power supply applications (SMPS) applications\n- Pulse-width modulation\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Harding, Scharon (September 17, 2019). \"What Is a MOSFET?

On the +5V rail, we have a drop of 0.14V giving us 2.80% which is slightly worse than the cold test\u2019s 2.6%. Moving over to the +12V rail we see a drop of 0.10V leaving us with 0.83% which is better than the cold test\u2019s 0.92%. The +5Vsb rail showed a drop of 0.14V giving us 2.80% which is better than the cold test\u2019s 3.0%. So we see an improvement on the +12V rail, but the +3.3V rail stays the same and the +5V rail dips a bit more. Averaging out the main three rails, we end up with 2.42%, which is a fraction worse than the 2.39% we achieved in the cold test. In the end, we are still just barely clearing the above average mark.\nThis unit just is not getting there. We do clear 80+ Bronze again in the hot box, but we can see that we dropped a smidge in Test 2, and just hit the mark in Test 8. The max efficiency I was able to achieve in the hot box was 87%.\nLooking at the temperatures in the last column, we can see we came within 1\u00b0 on the intake side of that max operating temperature spec. of 40\u00b0C. Our difference from intake to exhaust actually went down by 1\u00b0 in the hot box from 16\u00b0 to 15\u00b0.\nIt is time for some ripple. You might notice my scope shots have some blue in them. The blue stripe represents the max ripple allowed by spec on that rail. It is there to make it a little easier to see how close to spec we are getting during each test.\n| G650M \u2013 Oscilloscope Tests | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Test # | +3.3V | +5V | +12V1 | +5VSB |\n| 1 | ||||\n| 2 | ||||\n| 3 | ||||\n| 4 | ||||\n| 5 | ||||\n| 6 | ||||\n| 7 | ||||\n| 8 | ||||\n| CL1 | ||||\n| CL2 |\nWe see 19mV (39% of spec) peak on the +3.3V rail, a 12mV (24% of spec) peak on the +5V rail, and we hit 42mV (35% of spec) on the +12V rail. Like my load tests, I include the +5Vsb, which peaked at 20mV (41% of spec). Overall, I would say these fall in the good category until you hit the +5Vsb that fell in the average category."

      "text": "ATX\nATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is a motherboard and power supply configuration specification developed by Intel to improve on previous de facto standards like the AT design. Originally released in July 1995, it was the first major change in desktop computer enclosure, motherboard and power supply design in many years, improving standardization and interchangeability of parts. The specification defines the dimensions; the mounting points; the I/O panel; and the power and connector interfaces among a computer case, a motherboard, and a power supply.\nOverview\n[edit]ATX is the most common motherboard design.[1] Other standards for smaller boards (including microATX, FlexATX, nano-ITX, and mini-ITX) usually keep the basic rear layout but reduce the size of the board and the number of expansion slots. Dimensions of a full-size ATX board are 12 \u00d7 9.6 in (305 \u00d7 244 mm), which allows many ATX chassis to accept microATX boards. The ATX specifications were patented by David Dent at Intel and co-developed with Astec America, a major manufacturer of power supplies.[2][3] The inaugural version 1.0 of the ATX specification was unveiled by Intel in July 1995.[4] Since then, ATX has been revised numerous times. The most recent ATX motherboard specification is version 2.2.[5] The most recent ATX12V power supply unit specification is ATX 3.0 released in February 2022.[6][7][8]\nEATX (Extended ATX) is a bigger version of the ATX motherboard with 12 \u00d7 13 in (305 \u00d7 330 mm) dimensions. While some dual CPU socket motherboards have been implemented in ATX, the extra size of EATX makes it the typical form factor for dual socket systems, and with sockets that support four or eight memory channels, for single socket systems with a large number of memory slots.\nIn 2004, Intel announced the BTX (Balanced Technology eXtended) standard, intended as a replacement for ATX. While some manufacturers adopted the new standard, Intel discontinued any future development of BTX in 2006. As of 2025[update], the ATX design still remains the de facto standard for personal computers.\nConnectors\n[edit]On the back of the computer case, some major changes were made to the AT standard. Originally AT style cases had only a keyboard connector and expansion slots for add-on card backplates. Any other onboard interfaces (such as serial and parallel ports) had to be connected via flying leads to connectors which were mounted either on spaces provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot positions.[9]\nATX allowed each motherboard manufacturer to put these ports in a rectangular area on the back of the system with an arrangement they could define themselves, though a number of general patterns depending on what ports the motherboard offers have been followed by most manufacturers. Cases are usually fitted with a snap-out panel, also known as an I/O plate or I/O shield, in one of the common arrangements. I/O plates are usually included with retail motherboards to allow installation in any suitable case. The computer will operate correctly without a plate fitted, although there will be open gaps in the case which may compromise the EMI/RFI screening and allow ingress of dirt and random foreign bodies. Panels were made that allowed fitting an AT motherboard in an ATX case. Some ATX motherboards come with an integrated I/O plate.\nATX also made the PS/2-style mini-DIN keyboard and mouse connectors ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5-pin DIN connector for the keyboard and were generally used with serial port mice (although PS/2 mouse ports were also found on some systems). Many modern motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse connectors in favor of the more modern Universal Serial Bus. Other legacy connectors that are slowly being phased out of modern ATX motherboards include 25-pin parallel ports and 9-pin RS-232 serial ports. In their place are onboard peripheral ports such as Ethernet, FireWire, eSATA, audio ports (both analog and S/PDIF), video (analog D-sub, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort), extra USB ports, and Wi-Fi.\nA notable issue with the ATX specification was that it was last revised when power supplies were normally placed at the top of many old computer cases rather than at the bottom, as with many modern computer cases. This has led to some problematic standard locations for ports, in particular the 4/8 pin CPU power, which is normally located along the top edge of the board, convenient for top-mounted power supplies. This makes it very difficult for cables from bottom-mounted power supplies to reach, and commonly requires a special cutout in the back plane for the cable to come in from behind and bend around the board, making insertion and wire management very difficult. Many power supply cables barely or fail to reach, or are too stiff to make the bend, and extensions are sometimes required due to this placement. Modern power supplies often have longer cables to alleviate this issue.\nVariants\n[edit]This section's factual accuracy is disputed. (April 2020) |\nSeveral ATX-derived designs have been specified that use the same power supply, mountings and basic back panel arrangement, but set different standards for the size of the board and number of expansion slots. Standard ATX provides seven slots at 0.8 in (20 mm) spacing; the popular microATX size removes 2.4 inches (61 mm) and three slots, leaving four. Here width refers to the distance along the external connector edge, while depth is from front to rear. Note each larger size inherits all previous (smaller) colors area.\nAOpen has conflated the term Mini ATX with a more recent[when?] 15 \u00d7 15 cm (5.9 \u00d7 5.9 in) design. Since references to Mini ATX have been removed from ATX specifications since the adoption of microATX, the AOpen definition is the more contemporary term and the one listed above is apparently only of historical significance. This sounds contradictory to the now common Mini-ITX standard (17 \u00d7 17 cm (6.7 \u00d7 6.7 in)), which is a potential source of confusion. A number of manufacturers have added one to three additional expansion slots (at the standard 0.8 inch spacing) to the standard 12-inch ATX motherboard width.\nForm factors considered obsolete in 1999 included Baby-AT, full size AT, and the semi-proprietary LPX for low-profile cases. Proprietary motherboard designs such as those by Compaq, Packard-Bell, Hewlett Packard and others existed, and were not interchangeable with multi-manufacturer boards and cases. Portable and notebook computers and some 19-inch rackmount servers have custom motherboards unique to their particular products.[10]\n| Form factor | Originated | Date | Max. size[a] depth \u00d7 width |\nSlots\n|\nNotes (typical usage, market adoption, etc.) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ATX | Intel | 1995 | 12 \u00d7 9.6 in (305 \u00d7 244 mm) | 7[b] | Original, successor to AT motherboard |\n| Proprietary, specific to crypto-mining specific motherboards[citation needed] | Unknown | 2011 | 12 \u00d7 8 in (305 \u00d7 203 mm) | 3 | 3 double-slot add-in cards with 1 slots of free space in between |\n| SSI CEB | SSI | ? | 12 \u00d7 10.5 in (305 \u00d7 267 mm) | 7 | Compact Electronics Bay |\n| SSI MEB | SSI | 2011 | 16.2 \u00d7 13 in (411 \u00d7 330 mm) | 12 | Midrange Electronics Bay |\n| SSI EEB | SSI | ? | 12 \u00d7 13 in (305 \u00d7 330 mm) | 7 | Enterprise Electronics Bay |\n| SSI TEB | SSI | ? | 12 \u00d7 10.5 in (305 \u00d7 267 mm) | 7 | Thin Electronics Bay, for rack-mount, has board component height specification |\n| microATX | Intel | 1997 | 9.6 \u00d7 9.6 in (244 \u00d7 244 mm) | 4 | Fits in ATX, and EATX cases. |\n| FlexATX | Intel | 1997 | 9 \u00d7 7.5 in (229 \u00d7 191 mm) | 3 | |\n| Extended ATX (standard) | Supermicro / Asus | ? | 12 \u00d7 13 in (305 \u00d7 330 mm) | 7 | Screw holes not completely compatible with some ATX cases.

While E-ATX and SSI EEB (Server System Infrastructure (SSI) Forum's Enterprise Electronics Bay (EEB)) share the same dimensions, the screw holes of the two standards do not all align; rendering them incompatible.[citation needed]\nIn 2008, Foxconn unveiled a Foxconn F1 motherboard prototype, which has the same width as a standard ATX motherboard, but an extended 14.4\" length to accommodate 10 slots.[12] The firm called the new 14.4 \u00d7 9.6 in (366 \u00d7 244 mm) design of this motherboard \"Ultra ATX\"[13] in its CES 2008 showing. Also unveiled during the January 2008 CES was the Lian Li Armorsuit PC-P80 case with 10 slots designed for the motherboard.[14]\nThe name \"XL-ATX\" has been used by at least three companies in different ways:\n- In September 2009, EVGA Corporation had already released a 13.5 \u00d7 10.3 in (343 \u00d7 262 mm) \"XL-ATX\" motherboard as its EVGA X58 Classified 4-Way SLI,[15] which requires an Ultra-ATX sized case to support four \"double-slot\" graphics cards.[16]\n- Gigabyte Technology launched another XL-ATX motherboard, with model number GA-X58A-UD9 in 2010 measuring at 13.6 \u00d7 10.3 in (345 \u00d7 262 mm), and GA-X79-UD7 in 2011 measuring at 12.8 \u00d7 10.0 in (324 \u00d7 253 mm). In April 2010, Gigabyte announced its 12.8 \u00d7 9.6 in (325 \u00d7 244 mm) GA-890FXA-UD7 motherboard that allowed all seven slots to be moved downward by one slot position. The added length could have allowed placement of up to eight expansion slots, but the top slot position is vacant on this particular model.\n- MSI released MSI X58 Big Bang in 2010, MSI P67 Big Bang Marshal in 2011, MSI X79 Xpower Big Bang 2 in 2012 and MSI Z87 Xpower in 2013 all of them are 13.6 \u00d7 10.4 in (345 \u00d7 264 mm). Although these boards have room for additional expansion slots (9 and 8 total, respectively), all three provide only seven expansion connectors; the topmost positions are left vacant to provide more room for the CPU, chipset and associated cooling.\nIn 2010, EVGA Corporation released a new motherboard, the \"Super Record 2\", or SR-2, whose size surpasses that of the \"EVGA X58 Classified 4-Way SLI\". The new board is designed to accommodate two Dual QPI LGA1366 socket CPUs (e.g. Intel Xeon), similar to that of the Intel Skulltrail motherboard that could accommodate two Intel Core 2 Quad processors and has a total of seven PCI-E slots and 12 DDR3 RAM slots. The new design is dubbed \"HPTX\" and is 13.6 \u00d7 15 in (345 \u00d7 381 mm).[17]\nPower supply\n[edit]The ATX specification requires the power supply to produce three main outputs, +3.3 V, +5 V and +12 V. Low-power \u221212 V and +5 VSB (standby) supplies are also required. The \u221212 V supply is primarily used to provide the negative supply voltage for RS-232 ports and is also used by one pin on conventional PCI slots primarily to provide a reference voltage for some models of sound cards. The 5 VSB supply is used to produce trickle power to provide the soft-power feature of ATX when a PC is turned off, as well as powering the real-time clock to conserve the charge of the CMOS battery. A \u22125 V output was originally required because it was supplied on the ISA bus; it was removed in later versions of the ATX standard, as it became obsolete with the removal of the ISA bus expansion slots (the ISA bus itself is still found in any computer which is compatible with the old IBM PC specification).\nOriginally, the motherboard was powered by one 20-pin connector. An ATX power supply provides a number of peripheral power connectors and (in modern systems) two connectors for the motherboard: an 8-pin (or 4+4-pin) auxiliary connector providing additional power to the CPU and a main 24-pin power supply connector, an extension of the original 20-pin version. 20-pin Molex 39-29-9202 at the motherboard. 20-pin Molex 39-01-2200 at the cable. The connector pin pitch is 4.20 mm[18] (about one sixth of an inch).\n| Color | Signal[A] | Pin[B] | Pin[B][C] | Signal[A] | Color |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Orange | +3.3 V | 1 | 13 | +3.3 V | Orange |\n| +3.3 V sense[D] | Brown | ||||\n| Orange | +3.3 V | 2 | 14 | \u221212 V | Blue |\n| Black | Ground | 3 | 15 | Ground | Black |\n| Red | +5 V | 4 | 16 | Power on[E] | Green |\n| Black | Ground | 5 | 17 | Ground | Black |\n| Red | +5 V | 6 | 18 | Ground | Black |\n| Black | Ground | 7 | 19 | Ground | Black |\n| Grey | Power good[F] | 8 | 20 | Reserved[G] | None |\n| Purple | +5 V standby | 9 | 21 | +5 V | Red |\n| Yellow | +12 V | 10 | 22 | +5 V | Red |\n| Yellow | +12 V | 11 | 23 | +5 V | Red |\n| Orange | +3.3 V | 12 | 24 | Ground | Black |\n|\n| Color | Signal | Pin | Pin | Signal | Color |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Green | PS_ON# | 1 | 6 | PWR_OK | Gray |\n| Black | COM | 2 | 7 | +12 VSB | Purple |\n| Black | COM | 3 | 8 | +12 V1 DC | Yellow |\n| Black | COM | 4 | 9 | +12 V1 DC | Yellow |\n| TBD | Reserved | 5 | 10 | +12 V1 DC Voltage Sensing Pin |\nYellow |\n| Pins | Female/receptacle on PS cable |\nMale/vertical header on PCB |\nMale/plug extender cable |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 4-pin | 39-01-2040 | 39-28-1043 | 39-01-2046 |\n| 20-pin | 39-01-2200 | 39-28-1203 | 39-01-2206 |\n| 24-pin | 39-01-2240 | 39-28-1243 | 39-01-2246 |\nFour wires have special functions:\n- PS_ON# (power on) is a signal from the motherboard to the power supply. When the line is connected to ground (by the motherboard), the power supply turns on. It is internally pulled up to +5 V inside the power supply.[5][21]\n- PWR_OK (\"power good\") is an output from the power supply that indicates that its output has stabilized and is ready for use. It remains low for a brief time (100\u2013500 ms) after the PS_ON# signal is pulled low.[22]\n- +5 VSB (+5 V standby) supplies power even when the rest of the supply wire lines are off. This can be used to power the circuitry that controls the power-on signal.\n- +3.3 V sense should be connected to the +3.3 V on the motherboard or its power connector. This connection allows remote sensing of the voltage drop in the power-supply wiring. Some manufacturers also provided a +5 V sense wire (typically colored pink) connected to one of the red +5 V wires on some models of power supply; however, the inclusion of such wire was a non-standard practice and was never part of any official ATX standard.\nGenerally, supply voltages must be within \u00b15% of their nominal values at all times. The little-used negative supply voltages, however, have a \u00b110% tolerance. There is a specification for ripple in a 10 Hz\u201320 MHz bandwidth:[5]\n| Supply (V) | Tolerance | Range, min. to max. (V) | Ripple, p. to p., max. (mV) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| +5 | \u00b15% (\u00b10.25 V) | +4.75 V to +5.25 | 50 |\n| \u22125 | \u00b110% (\u00b10.50 V) | \u22124.50 V to \u22125.50 | 50 |\n| +12 | \u00b15% (\u00b10.60 V) | +11.40 V to +12.60 | 120 |\n| \u221212 | \u00b110% (\u00b11.20 V) | \u221210.80 V to \u221213.20 | 120 |\n| +3.3 | \u00b15% (\u00b10.165 V) | +3.135 V to +3.465 | 50 |\n| +5 standby | \u00b15% (\u00b10.25 V) | +4.75 V to +5.25 | 50 |\nThe 20\u201324-pin Molex Mini-Fit Jr. has a power rating of, 9 amperes maximum per pin).[23] As large server motherboards and 3D graphics cards have required progressively more and more power to operate, it has been necessary to revise and extend the standard beyond the original 20-pin connector, to allow more current using multiple additional pins in parallel. The low circuit voltage is the restriction on power flow through each connector pin; at the maximum rated voltage, a single Mini-Fit Jr pin would be capable of 4800 watts.\nPhysical characteristics\n[edit]ATX power supplies generally have the dimensions of 150 \u00d7 86 \u00d7 140 mm (5.9 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 5.5 in),[24]: 23\u201324 with the width and height being the same as the preceding LPX (Low Profile eXtension) form factor (which are often incorrectly referred to as \"AT\" power supplies due to their ubiquitous use in later AT and Baby AT systems, even though the actual AT and Baby AT power supply form factors were physically larger) and share a common mounting layout of four screws arranged on the back side of the unit. That last dimension, the 140 mm depth, is frequently varied, with depths of 160, 180, 200 and 230 mm used to accommodate higher power, larger fan and/or modular connectors.\nMain changes from AT and LPX designs\n[edit]Power switch\n[edit]Original AT cases (flat case style) have an integrated power switch that protruded from the power supply and sits flush with a hole in the AT chassis. It utilizes a paddle-style DPST switch and is similar to the PC and PC-XT style power supplies.\nLater AT (so-called \"Baby AT\") and LPX style computer cases have a power button that is directly connected to the system computer power supply (PSU). The general configuration is a double-pole latching mains voltage switch with the four pins connected to wires from a four-core cable. The wires are either soldered to the power button (making it difficult to replace the power supply if it failed) or blade receptacles were used.\nAn ATX power supply is typically controlled by an electronic switch connected to the power button on the computer case and allows the computer to be turned off by the operating system. In addition, many ATX power supplies have a manual switch on the back that also ensures no power is being sent to the components. When the switch on the power supply is turned off, the computer cannot be turned on with the front power button.\nPower connection to the motherboard\n[edit]The power supply's connection to the motherboard was changed from the older AT and LPX standards; AT and LPX had two similar connectors that could be accidentally interchanged by forcing the different keyed connectors into place, usually causing short-circuits and irreversible damage to the motherboard (the rule of thumb for safe operation was to connect the side-by-side connectors with the black wires together). ATX uses one large, keyed connector which can not be connected incorrectly. The new connector also provides a 3.3 volt source, removing the need for motherboards to derive this voltage from the 5 V rail. Some motherboards, particularly those manufactured after the introduction of ATX but whilst LPX equipment was still in use, support both LPX and ATX PSUs.[25]\nIf using an ATX PSU for purposes other than powering an ATX motherboard, power can be fully turned on (it is always partly on to operate \"wake-up\" devices) by shorting the \"power-on\" pin on the ATX connector (pin 16, green wire) to a black wire (ground), which is what the power button on an ATX system does. A minimum load on one or more voltages may be required (varies by model and vendor); the standard does not specify operation without a minimum load and a conforming PSU may shut down, output incorrect voltages, or otherwise malfunction, but will not be hazardous or damaged.[26] An ATX power supply is not a replacement for a current-limited bench laboratory DC power supply; instead it is better described as a bulk DC power supply.[27]\nAirflow\n[edit]The original ATX specification called for a power supply to be located near to the CPU with the power supply fan drawing in cooling air from outside the chassis and directing it onto the processor. It was thought that in this configuration, cooling of the processor would be achievable without the need of an active heatsink.[28] This recommendation was removed from later specifications; modern ATX power supplies usually exhaust air from the case.\nATX power supply revisions\n[edit]Original ATX\n[edit]ATX, introduced in late 1995, defined three types of power connectors:\n- 4-pin \"Molex connector\" \u2013 transferred directly from AT standard: +5 V and +12 V for P-ATA hard disks, CD-ROMs, 5.25 inch floppy drives and other peripherals.[29]\n- 4-pin Berg floppy connector \u2013 transferred directly from AT standard: +5 V and +12 V for 3.5 inch floppy drives and other peripherals.[30]\n- 20-pin Molex Mini-fit Jr. ATX motherboard connector \u2013 new to the ATX standard.\n- A supplemental 6-pin AUX connector providing additional 3.3 V and 5 V supplies to the motherboard, if needed. This was used to power the CPU in motherboards with CPU voltage regulator modules which required 3.3 volt and/or 5 volt rails and could not get enough power through the regular 20-pin header.\nThe power distribution specification defined that most of the PSU's power should be provided on 5 V and 3.3 V rails, because most of the electronic components (CPU, RAM, chipset, PCI, AGP and ISA cards) used 5 V or 3.3 V for power supply. The 12 V rail was only used by computer fans and motors of peripheral devices (HDD, FDD, CD-ROM, etc.)\nATX12V 1.x\n[edit]While designing the Pentium 4 platform in 1999/2000, the standard 20-pin ATX power connector was found insufficient to meet increasing power-line requirements; the standard was significantly revised into ATX12V 1.0 (ATX12V 1.x is sometimes inaccurately called ATX-P4). ATX12V 1.x was also adopted by AMD Athlon XP and Athlon 64 systems. However, some early model Athlon XP and MP boards (including some server boards) and later model lower-end motherboards do not have the 4-pin connector as described below.\nNumbering of the ATX revisions may be a little confusing: ATX refers to the design, and goes up to version 2.2 in 2004 (with the 24 pins of ATX12V 2.0), while ATX12V describes only the PSU. For instance, ATX 2.03 is quite commonly seen on PSUs from 2000 and 2001 and often includes the P4 12V connector, even if the norm itself did not define it yet.[5]\nATX12V 1.0\n[edit]The main changes and additions in ATX12V 1.0 (released in February 2000) were:\n- Increased the power on the 12 V rail (power on 5 V and 3.3 V rails remained mostly the same).\n- An extra 4-pin Mini Fit Jr. (Molex 39-01-2040), 12-volt connector to power the CPU.[24]\n- Minimum 68% efficiency at full load.\nFormally called the +12 V Power Connector, this is commonly referred to as the P4 connector because this was first needed to support the Pentium 4 processor.\nBefore the Pentium 4, processors were generally powered from the 5 V rail. Later processors operate at much lower voltages, typically around 1 V and some draw over 100 A. It is infeasible to provide power at such low voltages and high currents from a standard system power supply, so the Pentium 4 established the practice of generating it with a DC-to-DC converter on the motherboard next to the processor, powered by the 4-pin 12 V connector.\nATX12V 1.1\n[edit]This is a minor revision from August 2000. The power on the 3.3 V rail was slightly increased and other smaller changes were made.\nATX12V 1.2\n[edit]A relatively minor revision from January 2002. The only significant change was that the \u22125 V rail was no longer required (it became optional). This voltage was required by the ISA bus, which is no longer present on almost all modern computers.\nATX12V 1.3\n[edit]Introduced in April 2003 (a month after 2.0). This standard introduced some changes, mostly minor. Some of them are:\n- Slightly increased the power on 12 V rail.\n- Increased minimal efficiency for full load from 68% to 70% and defined minimal required PSU efficiencies for light (50% minimal efficiency) and typical (60% minimal efficiency) loads.\n- Defined acoustic levels.\n- Introduction of Serial ATA power connector (but defined as optional).\n- Guidance for the \u22125 V rail was removed (but it was not prohibited).[31]\nATX12V 2.x\n[edit]ATX12V 2.x brought a significant design change regarding power distribution. By analyzing the power demands of then-current PCs, it was determined that it would be much cheaper and more practical to power most PC components from 12 V rails, instead of from 3.3 V and 5 V rails.\nIn particular, PCI Express expansion cards take much of their power from the 12 V rail (up to 5.5 A), while the older AGP graphics cards took only up to 1 A on 12 V and up to 6 A on 3.3 V. The CPU is also driven by a 12 V rail, while it was done by a 5 V rail on older PCs (before the Pentium 4).\nATX12V 2.0\n[edit]The power demands of PCI Express were incorporated in ATX12V 2.0 (introduced in February 2003), which defined quite different power distribution from ATX12V 1.x:\n- Most power is now provided on 12 V rails. The standard specifies that two independent 12 V rails (12 V2 for the four-pin connector and 12 V1 for everything else) with independent overcurrent protection are needed to meet the power requirements safely (some very high power PSUs have more than two rails; recommendations for such large PSUs are not given by the standard).\n- The power on 3.3 V and 5 V rails was significantly reduced.\n- The ATX motherboard connector was extended to 24 pins.[32] The extra four pins provide one additional 3.3 V, 5 V and 12 V circuit.\n- The six-pin AUX connector from ATX12V 1.x was removed because the extra 3.3 V and 5 V circuits which it provided are now incorporated in the 24-pin ATX motherboard connector.\n- The power supply is required to include a Serial ATA power cable.\n- Minimum efficiency of 60% for light load, 70% for typical load, and 70% for full load\n- Many other specification changes and additions\nATX12V 2.01\n[edit]This is a minor revision from June 2004. An errant reference for the \u22125 V rail was removed. Other minor changes were introduced.[33]\nATX12V 2.1\n[edit]This is a minor revision from March 2005. The power was slightly increased on all rails. Efficiency requirements changed: minimum 65% at light load, 72% at typical load, and 70% at full load. Introduced recommended minimum values of 75% at light load, 80% at typical load, and 77% at full load.\nATX12V 2.2\n[edit]Also released in March 2005[5] it includes corrections and specifies High Current Series wire terminals for 24-pin ATX motherboard and 4-pin +12 V power connectors.\nATX12V 2.3\n[edit]Effective March 2007. Recommended efficiency was increased to 80% (with at least 70% required) and the 12 V minimum load requirement was lowered. Higher efficiency generally results in less power consumption (and less waste heat) and the 80% recommendation brings supplies in line with new Energy Star 4.0 mandates.[34] The reduced load requirement allows compatibility with processors that draw very little power during startup.[35] The absolute over-current limit of 240 VA per rail was removed, allowing 12 V lines to provide more than 20 A per rail.\nATX12V 2.31\n[edit]This revision became effective in February 2008. It added a maximum allowed ripple/noise specification of 400 millivolts to the PWR_ON and PWR_OK signals, requires that the DC power must hold for more than 1 millisecond after the PWR_OK signal drops, clarified country-specific input line harmonic content and electromagnetic compatibility requirements, added a section about Climate Savers, updated recommended power supply configuration charts, and updated the cross-regulation graphs.\nATX12V 2.32\n[edit]This is the unofficial name given to the later revisions of the v2.31 specifications, published in May 2020[36]\nATX12V 2.4\n[edit]The ATX12V 2.4 specifications were published in August 2012.[citation needed] It is specified in Revision 1.31 of the Power Supply Design Guide for Desktop Platform Form Factors, which names this as ATX12V version 2.4.[37]\nIn July 2012, revision 1.3 of the Power Supply Design Guide for Desktop Platform Form Factors made inclusion of the floppy drive connector optional, instead of mandatory.[38]\nATX12V 2.51\n[edit]The specifications for ATXV12 2.51 were released in September 2021 and introduced support for Alternative Low Power Mode (ALPM) which supersedes the traditional S3 power state. Windows 10 implements this functionality as Modern Standby.[39]\nATX12V 2.52\n[edit]The specifications for ATXV12 2.52 were released in October 2021 introduces minor changes to the standard, most notably it requires power supply manufacturers to ensure power supplies with Alternative Low Power Mode (ALPM) support are able to withstand power cycles every 180 seconds (480 times per day or 175,200 per year). Power supply fans are also recommended to turn on with at least a two second delay for an improved user experience.[40]\nThis version also stated that the floppy drive connector should be excluded from PSUs, as opposed to merely being optional, and marked that connector's section in the specification as \"For Historical Reference Only\".[41]\nATX12V 2.53\n[edit]The specifications for ATXV12 2.53 were released in December 2021 and constitute another minor update to the ATX standard. ATXV12 2.53 makes further recommendations on efficiency and references the Energy Star Computers Specification Version 8.0 which was finalized in April 2020.[39][42]\nATX 3.x\n[edit]The specifications for ATX 3.0 were released in February 2022. It includes the new 16-pin 12VHPWR connector that can deliver up to 600 W for H+ and up to 675 W in H++ to graphics cards. These incorporate data lines for components to negotiate power capabilities with the PSU so they do not draw more power than the PSU is capable of delivering. The specification also has more strict requirements for handling spikes, two times the nominal output for 100 microseconds.\nThe \u221212 V supply is now specified as optional on the ATX motherboard connector,[43] and some PSU manufacturers (e.g. Corsair) have begun removing the \u221212 V supply from their PSUs. However, as of 2025, some motherboards (e.g. recent designs from ASRock) still use the \u221212 V supply - typically to power the amplifier for on-board audio - and functions that use it will not work as expected[44] when paired with a PSU that does not provide a \u221212 V supply.[citation needed]\nATX 3.1 replaces the 12VHPWR power connector with the 12V-2x6 power connector and reduces required power loss hold-up time from 17 milliseconds to 12 milliseconds.[45]\nATX power supply derivatives\n[edit]ATX12VO\n[edit]Standing for ATX 12-volt-only, this is a new specification published by Intel in 2019, aimed at pre-built systems in the first run, and stricter power efficiency requirements by the California Energy Commission going into effect in 2021.[46] Several OEMs were already using a similar design with proprietary connectors and this effectively standardizes those.[47]\nUnder this standard, power supplies provide only a 12 V output. ATX12VO introduces a new 10-pin connector to supply the motherboard, replacing the 24-pin ATX12V connector. This greatly simplifies power supplies, but moves DC-to-DC conversion and some connectors to the motherboard instead. Notably, SATA power connectors, which include 3.3 V and 5 V pins, need to move to the motherboard instead of being connected directly to the power supply.[47]\na.

Thus, an SFX power supply is mostly pin-compatible with the ATX power supply as the main difference is its reduced dimensions; the only electrical difference is that the SFX specifications do not require the \u22125 V rail. Since \u22125 V is required only by some ISA-bus expansion cards, this is not an issue with modern hardware and decreases productions costs. As a result, ATX pin 20, which carried \u22125 V, is absent in current power supplies; it was optional in ATX and ATX12V version 1.2 and deleted as of ATX version 1.3.\nSFX has dimensions of 125 \u00d7 63.5 \u00d7 100 mm (width \u00d7 height \u00d7 depth), with a 60 mm fan, compared with the standard ATX dimensions of 150 \u00d7 86 \u00d7 140 mm. Optional 80 or 40 mm fan replacement increases or decreases the height of an SFX unit.[50]\nSome manufacturers and retailers incorrectly market SFX power supplies as \u03bcATX or MicroATX power supplies.[51]\nSome manufacturers make SFX-L dimensions of 125 \u00d7 63.5 \u00d7 130 mm to accommodate a 120 mm fan.[52]\nTFX\n[edit]Thin Form Factor is another small power supply design with standard ATX specification connectors. Its dimensions are generally (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D): 85 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 175 mm (3.34 \u00d7 2.52 \u00d7 6.89 in).[53][54]\nWTX\n[edit]WTX power supplies provide a WTX style motherboard connector which is incompatible with the standard ATX motherboard connector.\nAMD GES\n[edit]This is an ATX12V power supply derivative made by AMD to power its Athlon MP (dual processor) platform. It was used only on high-end Athlon MP motherboards. It has a special 8-pin supplemental connector for motherboard, so an AMD GES PSU is required for such motherboards (those motherboards will not work with ATX(12 V) PSUs).\na.

It has a 24-pin ATX motherboard connector (same as ATX12V v2.x), an 8-pin secondary connector and an optional 4-pin tertiary connector. Rather than include the extra cable, many power supply makers implement the 8-pin connector as two combinable 4-pin connectors to ensure backwards compatibility with ATX12V motherboards.\nSpecification changes and additions\n[edit]High-performance video card power demands dramatically increased during the 2000s and some high-end graphics cards have power demands that exceed AGP or PCIe slot capabilities. For these cards, supplementary power was delivered through a standard 4-pin peripheral or floppy power connector. Midrange and high-end PCIe graphics cards manufactured after 2004 typically use a standard 6- or 8-pin PCIe power connector directly from the PSU.\nInterchanging PSUs\n[edit]Although the ATX power supply specifications are mostly vertically compatible in both ways (both electrically and physically), there are potential issues with mixing old motherboards/systems with new PSUs and vice versa. The main issues to consider are the following:\n- The power allocation between 3.3 V, 5 V and 12 V rails is very different between older and newer ATX PSU designs, as well as between older and newer PC system designs.\n- Older PSUs may not have connectors which are required for newer PC systems to properly operate.\n- Newer systems generally have higher power requirements than older systems.\nThis is a practical guidance what to mix and what not to mix:\n- Older systems (before Pentium 4 and Athlon XP platforms) were designed to draw most power from 5 V and 3.3 V rails.\n- Because of the DC-DC converters on the motherboard that convert 12 V to the low voltages required by the Intel Pentium 4 and AMD Athlon XP (and subsequent) processors, such systems draw most of their power from the 12 V rail.\n- Original ATX PSUs have power distribution designed for pre-P4/XP PCs. They lack the supplemental 4-pin 12-volt CPU power connector, so they most likely cannot be used with P4/XP or newer motherboards. Adapters do exist but power drain on the 12 V rail must be checked very carefully. There is a chance it can work without connecting the 4-pin 12 V connector, but caution is advised.[55]\n- ATX12V 1.x PSUs have power distribution designed for P4/XP PCs, but they are also greatly suitable for older PCs, since they give plenty of power (relative to old PCs' needs) both on 12 V and on 5 V/3.3 V. It is not recommended to use ATX12V 1.x PSUs on ATX12V 2.x motherboards because those systems require much more power on 12 V than ATX12V 1.x PSUs provide.\n- ATX12V 2.x PSUs have power distribution designed for late P4/XP PCs and for Athlon 64 and Core Duo PCs. They can be used with earlier P4/XP PCs, but the power distribution will be significantly suboptimal, so a more powerful ATX12V 2.0 PSU should be used to compensate for that discrepancy. ATX12V 2.x PSUs can also be used with pre-P4/XP systems, but the power distribution will be greatly suboptimal (12 V rails will be mostly unused, while the 3.3 V/5 V rails will be overloaded), so this is not recommended.\n- Systems that use an ISA bus should have a PSU that provides the \u22125 V rail, which became optional in ATX12V 1.2 and was subsequently phased out by manufacturers.\nSome proprietary brand-name systems require a matching proprietary power supply, but some of them may also support standard and interchangeable power supplies.\nEfficiency\n[edit]Efficiency in power supplies means the extent to which power is not wasted in converting electricity from a household supply to regulated DC. Computer power supplies vary from around 70% to over 90% efficiency.\nVarious initiatives exist to improve the efficiency of computer power supplies. Climate Savers Computing Initiative promotes energy saving and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging development and use of more efficient power supplies. 80 PLUS certifies a variety of efficiency levels for power supplies and encourages their use via financial incentives. Efficient power supplies also save money by wasting less power; as a result they use less electricity to power the same computer, and they emit less waste heat which results in significant energy savings on central air conditioning in the summer. The gains of using an efficient power supply are more substantial in computers that use a lot of power.\nAlthough a power supply with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading, such a unit is often less efficient and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit. For example, a 900-watt power supply with the 80 Plus Silver efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 85 percent efficient for loads above 180 W) may only be 73% efficient when the load is lower than 100 W, which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer. Thus, for a 100 W load, losses for this supply would be 27 W; if the same power supply was put under a 450 W load, for which the supply's efficiency peaks at 89%, the loss would be only 56 W despite supplying 4.5 times the useful power.[56][57] For a comparison, a 500-watt power supply carrying the 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 82-percent efficient for loads above 100 W) may provide an 84 percent efficiency for a 100 W load, wasting only 19 W.[58]\nSee also\n[edit]- AT (form factor)\n- BTX (form factor)\n- Computer form factor\n- Mini-ITX\n- PC 97\n- Power supply unit (computer)\n- SSI CEB\nExplanatory notes\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Mark, Soper; Prowse, David; Mueller, Scott (September 2012).

(April 2009) |\n| Passband modulation |\n|---|\n| Analog modulation |\n| Digital modulation |\n| Hierarchical modulation |\n| Spread spectrum |\n| See also |\nPulse-width modulation (PWM), also known as pulse-duration modulation (PDM) or pulse-length modulation (PLM),[1] is any method of representing a signal as a rectangular wave with a varying duty cycle (and for some methods also a varying period).\nPWM is useful for controlling the average power or amplitude delivered by an electrical signal. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by switching the supply between 0 and 100% at a rate faster than it takes the load to change significantly. The longer the switch is on, the higher the total power supplied to the load. Along with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), it is one of the primary methods of controlling the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery.[2] PWM is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors, which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching. The goal of PWM is to control a load; however, the PWM switching frequency must be selected carefully in order to smoothly do so.\nThe PWM switching frequency can vary greatly depending on load and application. For example, switching only has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 100 or 120 Hz (double of the utility frequency) in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) and tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. Choosing a switching frequency that is too high for the application may cause premature failure of mechanical control components despite getting smooth control of the load. Selecting a switching frequency that is too low for the application causes oscillations in the load. The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle. PWM has also been used in certain communication systems where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.\nIn electronics, many modern microcontrollers (MCUs) integrate PWM controllers exposed to external pins as peripheral devices under firmware control. These are commonly used for direct current (DC) motor control in robotics, switched-mode power supply regulation, and other applications.\nDuty cycle\n[edit]The term duty cycle describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on. When a digital signal is on half of the time and off the other half of the time, the digital signal has a duty cycle of 50% and resembles a \"square\" wave. When a digital signal spends more time in the on state than the off state, it has a duty cycle of >50%. When a digital signal spends more time in the off state than the on state, it has a duty cycle of <50%. Here is a pictorial that illustrates these three scenarios:\nHistory\n[edit]The Corliss steam engine was patented in 1849. It used pulse-width modulation to control the intake valve of a steam engine cylinder. A centrifugal governor was used to provide automatic feedback.\nSome machines (such as a sewing machine motor) require partial or variable power. In the past, control (such as in a sewing machine's foot pedal) was implemented by use of a rheostat connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor. It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat was one of several methods of controlling power (see autotransformers and Variac for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was yet to be found. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and robotic servomechanisms, and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers. PWM emerged as a solution for this complex problem.\nPWM telecommunications systems were invented just prior to the start of World War II, but at that time time-division multiplexing was already in use and there were only experimental PWM systems. This changed with the introduction of the cavity magnetron in 1940, which could produce pulses of microwave frequency energy but could not vary its frequency or precisely control its amplitude. A PWM encoder was used to trigger a magnetron in the British Army's Wireless Set Number 10, which provided long-distance telephone relay, up to 80 kilometres (50 mi).[3]\nThe Philips, N. V. company designed an optical scanning system (published in 1946) for variable area film soundtrack which produced the PWM. It was intended to reduce noise when playing back a film soundtrack. The proposed system had a threshold between \"white\" and \"black\" parts of soundtrack.[4]\nOne early application of PWM was in the Sinclair X10, a 10 W audio amplifier available in kit form in the 1960s. At around the same time, PWM started to be used in AC motor control.[5]\nOf note, for about a century, some variable-speed electric motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable power resistors or rotating converters such as the Ward Leonard drive.\nPrinciple\n[edit]Periodic pulse wave\n[edit]If we consider a periodic pulse wave with period , low value , a high value and a constant duty cycle D (Figure 1), the average value of the waveform is given by:\nAs is a pulse wave, its value is for and for . The above expression then becomes:\nThis latter expression can be fairly simplified in many cases where as . From this, the average value of the signal () is directly dependent on the duty cycle D.\nHowever, by varying (i.e. modulating) the duty cycle (and possibly also the period), the following more advanced pulse-width modulated waves allow variation of the average value of the waveform.\nIntersective method PWM\n[edit]The intersective method is a simple way to generate a PWM output signal (magenta in above figure) with fixed period and varying duty cycle is by using a comparator to switch the PWM output state when the input waveform (red) intersects with a sawtooth or a triangle waveform (blue).\nDepending on the type of sawtooth or triangle waveform (green in below figure), intersective PWM signals (blue in the below figure) can be aligned in three manners:\n- Leading edge modulation (top plot) uses a reverse sawtooth wave to generate the PWM. The PWM's leading edge is held at the leading edge of the window and the trailing edge is modulated.\n- Trailing edge modulation (middle plot) uses a normal sawtooth wave to generate the PWM. The PWM's trailing edge is fixed and the leading edge is modulated.\n- Centered pulses (bottom) uses a triangle waveform to generate the PWM. The pulse center is fixed in the center of the time window and both edges of the pulse are moved to compress or expand the width.\nTime proportioning\n[edit]Many digital circuits can generate PWM signals (e.g., many microcontrollers have PWM outputs). They normally use a counter that increments periodically (it is connected directly or indirectly to the clock of the circuit) and is reset at the end of every period of the PWM. When the counter value is more than the reference value, the PWM output changes state from high to low (or low to high).[6] This technique is referred to as time proportioning, particularly as time-proportioning control[7] \u2013 which proportion of a fixed cycle time is spent in the high state.\nThe incremented and periodically reset counter is the discrete version of the intersecting method's sawtooth. The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, as a function of the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.\nSpectrum\n[edit]The resulting spectra (of the three alignments) are similar. Each contains a DC component, a base sideband containing the modulating signal, and phase modulated carriers at each harmonic of the frequency of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a envelope (sinc function) and extend to infinity. The infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from aliasing distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern communication systems. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.[8]\nOn the contrary, delta modulation and delta-sigma modulation are random processes[clarification needed] that produces a continuous spectrum without distinct harmonics. While intersective PWM uses a fixed period but a varying duty cycle, the period of delta and delta-sigma modulated PWMs varies in addition to their duty cycle.\nDelta modulation\n[edit]Delta modulation produces a PWM signal (magenta in above figure) which changes state whenever its integral (blue) hits the limits (green) surrounding the input (red).\nAsynchronous delta-sigma PWM\n[edit]Asynchronous (i.e. unclocked) delta-sigma modulation produces a PWM output (blue in bottom plot) which is subtracted from the input signal (green in top plot) to form an error signal (blue in top plot). This error is integrated (magenta in middle plot). When the integral of the error exceeds the limits (the upper and lower grey lines in middle plot), the PWM output changes state. By integrating the difference of the error with the input signal, delta-sigma modulation shapes noise of the resulting spectrum to be more in higher frequencies above the input signal's band.\nSpace vector modulation\n[edit]Space vector modulation is a PWM control algorithm for multi-phase AC generation, in which the reference signal is sampled regularly; after each sample, non-zero active switching vectors adjacent to the reference vector and one or more of the zero switching vectors are selected for the appropriate fraction of the sampling period in order to synthesize the reference signal as the average of the used vectors.\nDirect torque control (DTC)\n[edit]Direct torque control is a method used to control AC motors. It is closely related with the delta modulation (see above). Motor torque and magnetic flux are estimated and these are controlled to stay within their hysteresis bands by turning on a new combination of the device's semiconductor switches each time either signal tries to deviate out of its band.\nPWM sampling theorem\n[edit]The process of PWM conversion is non-linear and it is generally supposed that low pass filter signal recovery is imperfect for PWM. The PWM sampling theorem[9] shows that PWM conversion can be perfect:\nAny bandlimited baseband signal whose amplitude is within \u00b10.637 can be represented by a PWM waveform of unit amplitude (\u00b11). The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level.\nFor comparison, the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem can be summarized as:\nIf you have a signal that is bandlimited to a bandwidth of f0 then you can collect all the information there is in that signal by sampling it at discrete times, as long as your sample rate is greater than 2f0.[10]\nApplications\n[edit]Servos\n[edit]PWM is used to control servomechanisms; see servo control.\nTelecommunications\n[edit]In telecommunications, PWM is a form of signal modulation where the widths of the pulses correspond to specific data values encoded at one end and decoded at the other.\nPulses of various lengths (the information itself) will be sent at regular intervals (the carrier frequency of the modulation).\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Clock | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | __| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____ _ __ ____ ____ _ PWM signal | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | _________| |____| |___| |________| |_| |___________ Data 0 1 2 4 0 4 1 0\nThe inclusion of a clock signal is not necessary, as the leading edge of the data signal can be used as the clock if a small offset is added to each data value in order to avoid a data value with a zero length pulse.\n_ __ ___ _____ _ _____ __ _ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | PWM signal | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | __| |____| |___| |__| |_| |____| |_| |___| |_____ Data 0 1 2 4 0 4 1 0\nPower delivery\n[edit]PWM can be used to control the amount of power delivered to a load without incurring the losses that would result from linear power delivery by resistive means. Drawbacks to this technique are that the power drawn by the load is not constant but rather discontinuous (see Buck converter), and energy delivered to the load is not continuous either. However, the load may be inductive, and with a sufficiently high frequency and when necessary using additional passive electronic filters, the pulse train can be smoothed and average analog waveform recovered. Power flow into the load can be continuous. Power flow from the supply is not constant and will require energy storage on the supply side in most cases. (In the case of an electrical circuit, a capacitor to absorb energy stored in (often parasitic) supply side inductance.)\nHigh frequency PWM power control systems are easily realisable with semiconductor switches. As explained above, almost no power is dissipated by the switch in either on or off state. However, during the transitions between on and off states, both voltage and current are nonzero and thus power is dissipated in the switches. By quickly changing the state between fully on and fully off (typically less than 100 nanoseconds), the power dissipation in the switches can be quite low compared to the power being delivered to the load.\nModern semiconductor switches such as MOSFETs or insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are well suited components for high-efficiency controllers. Frequency converters used to control AC motors may have efficiencies exceeding 98%. Switching power supplies have lower efficiency due to low output voltage levels (often even less than 2 V for microprocessors are needed) but still more than 70\u201380% efficiency can be achieved.\nVariable-speed computer fan controllers usually use PWM, as it is far more efficient when compared to a potentiometer or rheostat. (Neither of the latter is practical to operate electronically; they would require a small drive motor.)\nLight dimmers for home use employ a specific type of PWM control. Home-use light dimmers typically include electronic circuitry that suppresses current flow during defined portions of each cycle of the AC line voltage. Adjusting the brightness of light emitted by a light source is then merely a matter of setting at what voltage (or phase) in the AC half-cycle the dimmer begins to provide electric current to the light source (e.g. by using an electronic switch such as a triac). In this case the PWM duty cycle is the ratio of the conduction time to the duration of the half AC cycle defined by the frequency of the AC line voltage (50 Hz or 60 Hz depending on the country).\nThese rather simple types of dimmers can be effectively used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light sources such as incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which is caused by the dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low-frequency drive voltages. Perceivable flicker effects from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid (faster than the flicker fusion threshold), the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker.\nIn electric cookers, continuously variable power is applied to the heating elements such as the hob or the grill using a device known as a simmerstat. This consists of a thermal oscillator running at approximately two cycles per minute and the mechanism varies the duty cycle according to the knob setting. The thermal time constant of the heating elements is several minutes so that the temperature fluctuations are too small to matter in practice.\nVoltage regulation\n[edit]PWM is also used in efficient voltage regulators. By switching the voltage to the load with the appropriate duty cycle, the output will approximate a voltage at the desired level. The switching noise is usually filtered with an inductor and a capacitor.\nOne method measures the output voltage. When it is lower than the desired voltage, it turns on the switch. When the output voltage is above the desired voltage, it turns off the switch.\nAudio effects and amplification\n[edit]Varying the duty cycle of a pulse waveform in a synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) is distinctive because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the soundtracks of classic video games. The term PWM as used in sound (music) synthesis refers to the ratio between the high and low level being secondarily modulated with a low-frequency oscillator. This gives a sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM is equivalent to the sum of two sawtooth waves with one of them inverted.)[11]\nClass-D amplifiers produce a PWM equivalent of a lower frequency input signal that can be sent to a loudspeaker via a suitable filter network to block the carrier and recover the original lower frequency signal. Since they switch power directly from the high supply rail and low supply rail, these amplifiers have efficiency above 90% and can be relatively compact and light, even for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving servomotors. Field-gradient coils in MRI machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.\nHistorically, a crude form of PWM has been used to play back PCM digital sound on the PC speaker, which is driven by only two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V. By carefully timing the duration of the pulses, and by relying on the speaker's physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.) it was possible to obtain an approximate playback of mono PCM samples, although at a very low quality, and with greatly varying results between implementations. The Sega 32X uses PWM to play sample-based sound in its games.\nIn more recent times, the Direct Stream Digital sound encoding method was introduced, which uses a generalized form of pulse-width modulation called pulse-density modulation, at a high enough sampling rate (typically in the order of MHz) to cover the whole acoustic frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the SACD format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.\nElectrical\n[edit]SPWM (sine\u2013triangle pulse-width modulation) signals are used in solar inverter design. These switching signals are fed to the FETs that are used in the device. The device's efficiency depends on the harmonic content of the PWM signal. There is much research on eliminating unwanted harmonics and improving the fundamental strength, some of which involves using a modified carrier signal instead of a classic sawtooth signal[12][13][14] in order to decrease power losses and improve efficiency. Another common application is in robotics where PWM signals are used to control the speed of the robot by controlling the motors.\nSoft-blinking LED indicator\n[edit]PWM techniques would typically be used to make some indicator (like an LED) soft blink. The light will slowly go from dark to full intensity, and slowly dimmed to dark again. Then it repeats. The period would be several soft blinks per second up to several seconds for one blink. An indicator of this type would not disturb as much as a hard-blinking on/off indicator. The indicator lamp on the Apple iBook G4, PowerBook 6,7 (2005) was of this type. This kind of indicator is also called pulsing glow, as opposed to calling it flashing.\nSee also\n[edit]- Analog signal to discrete time interval converter\n- Class-D amplifier\n- Computer fan control\n- Continuously variable slope delta modulation\n- Delta-sigma modulation\n- H-bridge\n- Pulse-amplitude modulation\n- Pulse-code modulation\n- Pulse-density modulation\n- Pulse-frequency modulation\n- Pulse-position modulation\n- Radio control\n- Random pulse-width modulation\n- RC servo\n- Sliding mode control - produces smooth behavior by way of discontinuous switching in systems\n- Space vector modulation\n- Sound chip\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Butterfield, Andrew J.; Szymanski, John, eds.

      "text": "Transformer\n| Component type | Passive |\n|---|---|\n| Working principle | Electromagnetic induction |\n| Inventor | Michael Faraday[1] |\n| Invention year | 1831 |\n| Electronic symbol | |\nIn electrical engineering, a transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another circuit, or multiple circuits. A varying current in any coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core, which induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) across any other coils wound around the same core. Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday's law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\nTransformers are used to change AC voltage levels, such transformers being termed step-up or step-down type to increase or decrease voltage level, respectively. Transformers can also be used to provide galvanic isolation between circuits as well as to couple stages of signal-processing circuits. Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electric power.[2] A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications. Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect the power grid.\nPrinciples\n[edit]Ideal transformer\n[edit]An ideal transformer is linear, lossless and perfectly coupled. Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core magnetic permeability and winding inductance and zero net magnetomotive force (i.e. ipnp \u2212 isns = 0).[4][c]\nA varying current in the transformer's primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core, which is also encircled by the secondary winding. This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying electromotive force or voltage in the secondary winding. This electromagnetic induction phenomenon is the basis of transformer action and, in accordance with Lenz's law, the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding.\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a voltage source connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\nAccording to Faraday's law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of turns. The transformer winding voltage ratio is equal to the winding turns ratio.[7]\nAn ideal transformer is a reasonable approximation for a typical commercial transformer, with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio.\nThe load impedance referred to the primary circuit is equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance.[8]\nReal transformer\n[edit]Deviations from ideal transformer\n[edit]The ideal transformer model neglects many basic linear aspects of real transformers, including unavoidable losses and inefficiencies.[9]\n(a) Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consisting of[10]\n- Hysteresis losses due to nonlinear magnetic effects in the transformer core, and\n- Eddy current losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer's applied voltage.\n(b) Unlike the ideal model, the windings in a real transformer have non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:\n- Joule losses due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings[10]\n- Leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.\n(c) similar to an inductor, parasitic capacitance and self-resonance phenomenon due to the electric field distribution. Three kinds of parasitic capacitance are usually considered and the closed-loop equations are provided[11]\n- Capacitance between adjacent turns in any one layer;\n- Capacitance between adjacent layers;\n- Capacitance between the core and the layer(s) adjacent to the core;\nInclusion of capacitance into the transformer model is complicated, and is rarely attempted; the 'real' transformer model's equivalent circuit shown below does not include parasitic capacitance. However, the capacitance effect can be measured by comparing open-circuit inductance, i.e. the inductance of a primary winding when the secondary circuit is open, to a short-circuit inductance when the secondary winding is shorted.\nLeakage flux\n[edit]The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.[12] Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings.[13] Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.[12] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply.[13] Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury- and sodium- vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.[10]: 485\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.[14] A saturable reactor exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance[e] and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were the same, the transformers would share the load power in proportion to their respective ratings. However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary.[16]\nEquivalent circuit\n[edit]Referring to the diagram, a practical transformer's physical behavior may be represented by an equivalent circuit model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.[17]\nWinding joule losses and leakage reactance are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:\n- Primary winding: RP, XP\n- Secondary winding: RS, XS.\nIn normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, RS and XS are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (NP/NS) 2 = a2.\nCore loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:\n- Core or iron losses: RC\n- Magnetizing reactance: XM.\nRC and XM are collectively termed the magnetizing branch of the model.\nCore losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.[10]: 142\u2013143 The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.[10]: 142 With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90\u00b0. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.[17]\nThe resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations.[17] Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactance by simple summation as two series impedances.\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: open-circuit test, short-circuit test, winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\nTransformer EMF equation\n[edit]\nIf the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal, the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage Erms of the winding, and the supply frequency f, number of turns N, core cross-sectional area A in m2 and peak magnetic flux density Bpeak in Wb/m2 or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:[10]\nPolarity\n[edit]A dot convention is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's 'dot' end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's 'dot' end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a phasor diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\nEffect of frequency\n[edit]The EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.[10] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.[18] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50\u201360 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require protective relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\nOne example is in traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high-speed train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50 Hz down to 16.7 Hz and rated up to 25 kV).\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\nTransformers for higher frequency applications such as SMPS typically use core materials with much lower hysteresis and eddy-current losses than those for 50/60 Hz. Primary examples are iron-powder and ferrite cores. The lower frequency-dependant losses of these cores often is at the expense of flux density at saturation. For instance, ferrite saturation occurs at a substantially lower flux density than laminated iron.\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\nEnergy losses\n[edit]Transformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.[19] The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.[19][20]\nAs transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and eddy current losses are constant at all load levels and dominate at no load, while winding loss increases as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing energy efficient transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a trade-off between initial cost and operating cost.[21]\nTransformer losses arise from:\n- Winding joule losses\n- Current flowing through a winding's conductor causes joule heating due to the resistance of the wire. As frequency increases, skin effect and proximity effect causes the winding's resistance and, hence, losses to increase.\n- Core losses\n-\n- Hysteresis losses\n- Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core, caused by motion of the magnetic domains within the steel. According to Steinmetz's formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by\n- and,\n- hysteresis loss is thus given by\n- where, f is the frequency, \u03b7 is the hysteresis coefficient and \u03b2max is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron.[21] For more detailed analysis, see Magnetic core and Steinmetz's equation.\n- Eddy current losses\n- Eddy currents are induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.[21] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.\n- Magnetostriction related transformer hum\n- Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or \"transformer hum\".[22] This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency flyback transformers associated with television CRTs.\n- Stray losses\n- Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer's support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.[23]\n- Radiative\n- There are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small.\n- Mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission\n- In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. This energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork, thus amplifying audible transformer hum.[24]\nConstruction\n[edit]Cores\n[edit]Closed-core transformers are constructed in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form.[25] Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.[25] Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.[25][26][27] Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.[27]\nLaminated steel cores\n[edit]Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel.[28] The steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.[29] Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.[30] Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.[31] The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.[10]\nThe effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,[28] but are more laborious and expensive to construct.[32] Thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers, with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10 kHz.\nOne common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of E-I transformer.[32] Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.[32] They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.\nA steel core's remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.[33] Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass.\nOn transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.[34]\nDistribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.[35]\nSolid cores\n[edit]Powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common.[32] Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\nToroidal cores\n[edit]Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil, powdered iron, or ferrite.[36] A strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's reluctance. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.[10] : 485 The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10 kVA, and practically none above 25 kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.[37]\nAir cores\n[edit]A transformer can be produced by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an \"air-core\" transformer. An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.[13] The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,[13] but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.[38] Air cores are also used for resonant transformers such as tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\nWindings\n[edit]The electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from enameled magnet wire. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard.[39]\nHigh-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.[40] Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.[39] Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.[39]\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\nPower-frequency transformers may have taps at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as arc furnace transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.\nCooling\n[edit]It is a rule of thumb that the life expectancy of electrical insulation is halved for about every 7 \u00b0C to 10 \u00b0C increase in operating temperature (an instance of the application of the Arrhenius equation).[41]\nSmall dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these.[42] Large transformers are filled with transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings.[43] Transformer oil is often a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures.[44][45] Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure.[41] With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information.\nBuilding regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid-filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil, or be installed in fire-resistant rooms.[19] Air-cooled dry transformers can be more economical where they eliminate the cost of a fire-resistant transformer room.\nThe tank of liquid-filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins. Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling.[43] An oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a Buchholz relay, which, depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing, is used to either trigger an alarm or de-energize the transformer.[33] Oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have properties that once favored their use as a dielectric coolant, though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use.[46] Today, non-toxic, stable silicone-based oils, or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault.[19][47] However, the long life span of transformers can mean that the potential for exposure can be high long after banning.[48]\nSome transformers are gas-insulated. Their windings are enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and often cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas.[47]\nExperimental power transformers in the 500\u20131,000 kVA range have been built with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled superconducting windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.[49][50]\nInsulation\n[edit]Insulation must be provided between the individual turns of the windings, between the windings, between windings and core, and at the terminals of the winding.\nInter-turn insulation of small transformers may be a layer of insulating varnish on the wire. Layer of paper or polymer films may be inserted between layers of windings, and between primary and secondary windings. A transformer may be coated or dipped in a polymer resin to improve the strength of windings and protect them from moisture or corrosion. The resin may be impregnated into the winding insulation using combinations of vacuum and pressure during the coating process, eliminating all air voids in the winding. In the limit, the entire coil may be placed in a mold, and resin cast around it as a solid block, encapsulating the windings.[51]\nLarge oil-filled power transformers use windings wrapped with insulating paper, which is impregnated with oil during assembly of the transformer. Oil-filled transformers use highly refined mineral oil to insulate and cool the windings and core. Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used.\nBushings\n[edit]Larger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil.[52]\nClassification parameters\n[edit]Transformers can be classified in many ways, such as the following:\n- Power rating: From a fraction of a volt-ampere (VA) to over a thousand MVA.\n- Duty of a transformer: Continuous, short-time, intermittent, periodic, varying.\n- Frequency range: Power-frequency, audio-frequency, or radio-frequency.\n- Voltage class: From a few volts to hundreds of kilovolts.\n- Cooling type: Dry or liquid-immersed; self-cooled, forced air-cooled;forced oil-cooled, water-cooled.\n- Application: power supply, impedance matching, output voltage and current stabilizer, pulse, circuit isolation, power distribution, rectifier, arc furnace, amplifier output, etc..\n- Basic magnetic form: Core form, shell form, concentric, sandwich.\n- Constant-potential transformer descriptor: Step-up, step-down, isolation.\n- General winding configuration: By IEC vector group, two-winding combinations of the phase designations delta, wye or star, and zigzag; autotransformer, Scott-T\n- Rectifier phase-shift winding configuration: 2-winding, 6-pulse; 3-winding, 12-pulse; . . ., n-winding, [n \u2212 1]\u00b76-pulse; polygon; etc.\n- K-factor: A measure of how well the transformer can withstand harmonic loads.[53]\nApplications\n[edit]Various specific electrical application designs require a variety of transformer types. Although they all share the basic characteristic transformer principles, they are customized in construction or electrical properties for certain installation requirements or circuit conditions.\nIn electric power transmission, transformers allow transmission of electric power at high voltages, which reduces the loss due to heating of the wires. This allows generating plants to be located economically at a distance from electrical consumers.[54] All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.[23]\nIn many electronic devices, a transformer is used to convert voltage from the distribution wiring to convenient values for the circuit requirements, either directly at the power line frequency or through a switch mode power supply.\nSignal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits. Isolation transformers prevent leakage of current into the secondary circuit and are used in medical equipment and at construction sites. Resonant transformers are used for coupling between stages of radio receivers, or in high-voltage Tesla coils.\nHistory\n[edit]Discovery of induction\n[edit]Electromagnetic induction, the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832.[56][57][58][59] Only Faraday furthered his experiments to the point of working out the equation describing the relationship between EMF and magnetic flux now known as Faraday's law of induction:\nwhere is the magnitude of the EMF in volts and \u03a6B is the magnetic flux through the circuit in webers.[60]\nFaraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first toroidal closed-core transformer.[59][61] However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and EMF in the windings.\nInduction coils\n[edit]The first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil, invented by Irish-Catholic Rev. Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836.[59] He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\nFirst alternating current transformers\n[edit]By the 1870s, efficient generators producing alternating current (AC) were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an interrupter.\nIn 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.[62]\nIn 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.[59][63]\nIn 1882, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an initially widely criticized laminated plate open iron core called a 'secondary generator' in London, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States in 1886.[30] They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was highly successful and adopted for an electric lighting system.[64] Their open-core device used a fixed 1:1 ratio to supply a series circuit for the utilization load (lamps). However, the voltage of their system was controlled by moving the iron core in or out.[65]\nEarly series circuit transformer distribution\n[edit]Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.[64] Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.[66]\nClosed-core transformers and parallel power distribution\n[edit]In the autumn of 1884, K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy and Miksa D\u00e9ri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.[63] The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.[67] This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.[67] In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core.[64] The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed \"core form\" or \"shell form\" .[68]\nIn both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.[69] The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).[70][71] When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Bl\u00e1thy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and D\u00e9ri had performed the experiments;[72] In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.[73]\nTransformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word 'transformer' to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current[74] although the term had already been in use by 1882.[75][76] In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[77]\nWestinghouse improvements\n[edit]Building on the advancement of AC technology in Europe,[78] George Westinghouse founded the Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886.[79] The new firm became active in developing alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents for $50,000 in February 1886.[80] He assigned to William Stanley the task of redesign the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for commercial use in United States.[81] Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image). This design[82] was first used commercially in the US in 1886[83] but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.[82]\nWestinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed a core that was easier to manufacture, consisting of a stack of thin 'E\u2011shaped' iron plates insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Pre-wound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse obtained a patent for the new low-cost design in 1887.[72]\nOther early transformer designs\n[edit]In 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft ('General Electricity Company') in Germany.[84]\nIn 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very high voltages at high frequency.[85]\nAudio frequency transformers (\"repeating coils\") were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.[86]\nSee also\n[edit]Notes\n[edit]- ^ With turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density and the core area, the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary. The expression , defined as the derivative of magnetic flux with time , provides a measure of rate of magnetic flux in the core and hence of EMF induced in the respective winding. The negative sign in eq. 1 and eq. 2 is consistent with Lenz's law and Faraday's law in that by convention EMF \"induced by an increase of magnetic flux linkages is opposite to the direction that would be given by the right-hand rule.\"\n- ^ Although ideal transformer's winding inductances are each infinitely high, the square root of winding inductances' ratio is equal to the turns ratio.\n- ^ This also implies the following: The net core flux is zero, the input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted; there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer; input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved; these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved.[6]\n- ^ Direction of transformer currents is according to the Right-Hand Rule.\n- ^ Percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load.[15]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Archives Michael Faraday biography \u2013 The IET\". theiet.org.\n- ^ Bedell, Frederick (1942). \"History of A-C wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization\".

      "text": "Root mean square\nIn mathematics, the root mean square (abbrev. RMS, RMS or rms) of a set of values is the square root of the set's mean square.[1] Given a set , its RMS is denoted as either or . The RMS is also known as the quadratic mean (denoted ),[2][3] a special case of the generalized mean. The RMS of a continuous function is denoted and can be defined in terms of an integral of the square of the function. In estimation theory, the root-mean-square deviation of an estimator measures how far the estimator strays from the data.\nDefinition\n[edit]The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform.\nIn the case of a set of n values , the RMS is\nThe corresponding formula for a continuous function (or waveform) f(t) defined over the interval is\nand the RMS for a function over all time is\nThe RMS over all time of a periodic function is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a sample consisting of equally spaced observations. Additionally, the RMS value of various waveforms can also be determined without calculus, as shown by Cartwright.[4]\nIn the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.\nIn common waveforms\n[edit]If the waveform is a pure sine wave, the relationships between amplitudes (peak-to-peak, peak) and RMS are fixed and known, as they are for any continuous periodic wave. However, this is not true for an arbitrary waveform, which may not be periodic or continuous. For a zero-mean sine wave, the relationship between RMS and peak-to-peak amplitude is:\n- Peak-to-peak\nFor other waveforms, the relationships are not the same as they are for sine waves. For example, for either a triangular or sawtooth wave:\n- Peak-to-peak\n| Waveform | Variables and operators | RMS |\n|---|---|---|\n| DC | ||\n| Sine wave | ||\n| Square wave | ||\n| DC-shifted square wave | ||\n| Modified sine wave | ||\n| Triangle wave | ||\n| Sawtooth wave | ||\n| Pulse wave | ||\n| Phase-to-phase sine wave | ||\nwhere:\n|\nIn waveform combinations\n[edit]Waveforms made by summing known simple waveforms have an RMS value that is the root of the sum of squares of the component RMS values, if the component waveforms are orthogonal (that is, if the average of the product of one simple waveform with another is zero for all pairs other than a waveform times itself).[5]\nAlternatively, for waveforms that are perfectly positively correlated, or \"in phase\" with each other, their RMS values sum directly.\nUses\n[edit]In electrical engineering\n[edit]Current\n[edit]The RMS of an alternating electric current equals the value of constant direct current that would dissipate the same power in a resistive load.[1]\nVoltage\n[edit]A special case of RMS of waveform combinations is:[6]\nwhere refers to the direct current (or average) component of the signal, and is the alternating current component of the signal.\nAverage electrical power\n[edit]Electrical engineers often need to know the power, P, dissipated by an electrical resistance, R. It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant current, I, through the resistance. For a load of R ohms, power is given by:\nHowever, if the current is a time-varying function, I(t), this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is still meaningful to discuss the average power dissipated over time, which is calculated by taking the average power dissipation:\nSo, the RMS value, IRMS, of the function I(t) is the constant current that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current I(t).\nAverage power can also be found using the same method that in the case of a time-varying voltage, V(t), with RMS value VRMS,\nThis equation can be used for any periodic waveform, such as a sinusoidal or sawtooth waveform, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.\nBy taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, the power is found to be:\nBoth derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (that is, the load, R, is purely resistive). Reactive loads (that is, loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of AC power.\nIn the common case of alternating current when I(t) is a sinusoidal current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If Ip is defined to be the peak current, then:\nwhere t is time and \u03c9 is the angular frequency (\u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T, where T is the period of the wave).\nSince Ip is a positive constant and was to be squared within the integral:\nUsing a trigonometric identity to eliminate squaring of trig function:\nbut since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the sine terms will cancel out, leaving:\nA similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:\nwhere IP represents the peak current and VP represents the peak voltage.\nBecause of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets (for example, 120 V in the US, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies VP = VRMS \u00d7 \u221a2, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120 \u00d7 \u221a2, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.\nRMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle. However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses. The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each 24-hour day represents an average current of 5 amps, but an RMS current of 7.07 amps, in the long term.\nThe term RMS power is sometimes erroneously used (e.g., in the audio industry) as a synonym for mean power or average power (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see Audio power.\nSpeed\n[edit]In the physics of gas molecules, the root-mean-square speed is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is calculated using the following equation:\nwhere R represents the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol\u00b7K), T is the temperature of the gas in kelvins, and M is the molar mass of the gas in kilograms per mole. In physics, speed is defined as the scalar magnitude of velocity. For a stationary gas, the average speed of its molecules can be in the order of thousands of km/h, even though the average velocity of its molecules is zero.\nError\n[edit]When two data sets \u2014 one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance \u2014 are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure of how far on average the error is from 0. The mean of the absolute values of the pairwise differences could be a useful measure of the variability of the differences. However, the RMS of the differences is usually the preferred measure, probably due to mathematical convention and compatibility with other formulae.\nAudio Engineering\n[edit]RMS is used in audio engineering to measure signal volume, particularly in the case of audio processing. The alternative volume measurement is peak volume, in analog as the signal Vpp, or in digital as the -dB peak below clipping given the encoding format. Signal RMS in this context is often used as the comparator signal for compression, which produces a \"smoothing\" effect in compression by responding more slowly to sharp transients like those on drums.[7] RMS is also used as a mastering metric to compare against other time average units such as LUFs.[8]\nIn frequency domain\n[edit]The RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using Parseval's theorem. For a sampled signal , where is the sampling period,\nwhere and N is the sample size, that is, the number of observations in the sample and DFT coefficients.\nIn this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:\nRelationship to other statistics\n[edit]The standard deviation of a population or a waveform is the RMS deviation of from its arithmetic mean . They are related to the RMS value of by [9]\n- .\nFrom this it is clear that the RMS value is always greater than or equal to the average, in that the RMS includes the squared deviation (error) as well.\nPhysical scientists often use the term root mean square as a synonym for standard deviation when it can be assumed the input signal has zero mean, that is, referring to the square root of the mean squared deviation of a signal from a given baseline or fit.[10][11] This is useful for electrical engineers in calculating the \"AC only\" RMS of a signal. Standard deviation being the RMS of a signal's variation about the mean, rather than about 0, the DC component is removed (that is, RMS(signal) = stdev(signal) if the mean signal is 0).\nSee also\n[edit]- Average rectified value (ARV)\n- Central moment\n- Geometric mean\n- Glossary of mathematical symbols\n- L2 norm\n- Least squares\n- Mean squared displacement\n- Pythagorean addition\n- True RMS converter\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ If NM = a and PM = b.

      "text": "Speed bump\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (December 2023) |\nSpeed bumps (also called traffic thresholds, speed breakers or sleeping policemen) are a class of traffic calming devices that use vertical deflection to slow motor-vehicle traffic in order to improve safety conditions. Variations include the speed hump, speed cushion, and speed table.\nThe use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly used to enforce a speed limit under 40 km/h (25 mph).\nAlthough speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial\u2014as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed (despite that being the point), and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment.\nComposition\n[edit]Each of these devices can be made from a variety of materials, including asphalt, concrete, recycled plastic, metal, or vulcanized rubber. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.\nRubber products are pre-shaped to standard sizes to meet industry standards. Preformed rubber products are typically bolted down, making them easier to install or remove. Temporary bolt-down installations can be ideal for planners in testing the use and positioning of speed bumps before implementing them in a larger project. Bolt-down products can also be removed or relocated during winter snow periods\u2014where speed bumps are easily concealed and may be damaged by snowplows.\nHistory\n[edit]On June 7, 1906, The New York Times reported on an early implementation of what might be considered speed bumps in Chatham, New Jersey, which planned to raise its crosswalks five inches (13 cm) above the road level: \"This scheme of stopping automobile speeding has been discussed by different municipalities, but Chatham is the first place to put it in practice\".[1] The average automobile's top speed at the time was around 50 km/h (30 mph), but braking was poor by modern standards.[citation needed]\nArthur Compton was a physicist and winner of the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discoveries resulting in major changes in electromagnetic theory. He is commonly known for his work on the Compton effect with X-rays. He also invented what he called \"traffic control bumps\", the basic design for the speed hump, in 1953. Compton began designs on the speed bump after noticing the speed at which motorists passed Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was chancellor.[2]\nThe British Transport and Road Research Laboratory published a comprehensive report in 1973 examining vehicle behavior for a large variety of different bump geometries.[3] At the time speed humps were not permitted on public roads but had been installed on private roads.\nAccording to a publication by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the first speed bump in Europe was built in 1970 in the city of Delft in the Netherlands.[4]\nSpeed bumps\n[edit]A speed bump is also known as a sleeping policeman in British English, Maltese English and Caribbean English, a judder bar in New Zealand English, and a lying-down policeman in Colombia, Dominican Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Russia. A speed bump is a bump in a roadway with heights typically ranging between 8 and 10 centimetres (3 and 4 in). The traverse distance of a speed bump is typically less than or near to 0.3 m (1 ft); contrasting with the wider speed humps, which typically have a traverse distance of 3.0 to 4.3 m (10 to 14 ft).[5][6]\nSpeed bumps vary in length, but it is typical to leave space between the bump and either edge of an enclosed road (i.e., with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage. Spaces on either side may also allow more expedient passage for emergency vehicles, though effectiveness will depend on the type of vehicle and specific road design.\nDisadvantages\n[edit]Local authorities have cited disadvantages to speed bumps:\n- The city of Modesto in California, produced a fact sheet which contains the following disadvantages:[7]\n- Slow response time of emergency vehicles;\n- May divert traffic to parallel residential streets; and\n- Possible increase in noise and pollution for residents living immediately adjacent to the speed bumps.\n- The English town of Eastleigh states the following as disadvantages:[8]\n- Can cause damage to some vehicles;\n- Can increase traffic noise, especially when large goods vehicles pass by;\n- Required signs, street lighting and white lines may be visually intrusive;\n- Can cause discomfort for drivers and passengers;\n- Can cause problems for emergency services and buses.\nOther sources argue that speed bumps:\n- Distract drivers from other hazards such as children\n- Increase pollution as traffic travels in a lower gear using significantly more fuel per mile;\n- Are a compromise for more active enforcement;\n- Increase noise by creating tire-to-bump thumping and increasing the amount of engine-revving;\n- Cause spinal damage[9] and aggravate chronic backache.\nIn 2003, the chairman of the London Ambulance Service, Sigurd Reinton, claimed that delays caused by speed bumps were responsible for up to 500 avoidable deaths from cardiac arrest each year. He later denied the statement.[10]\nIn Sweden, an evaluation of spinal stress in bus drivers against ISO 2631-5 required on health grounds that:[11]\n- bus drivers avoid certain streets until the humps were modified; and\n- the maximum acceptable speed be reduced to 10 kilometres per hour (6.2 mph; 2.8 m/s) on one street for drivers encountering 150 humps in a day.\nSpeed bumps can also have adverse environmental impact. A study found that in one north London street with a speed limit of 20 miles per hour (32 km/h; 8.9 m/s) and fitted with road humps, a petrol driven car produced 64 per cent more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) than in a similar 20 miles per hour (32 km/h; 8.9 m/s) street fitted with road cushions. It also produced 47 per cent more particulate matter (PM) and nearly 60 per cent more carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.[12] Another study estimated that, for a private automobile, the increase in fuel consumption due a pass over a speed bump is responsible for fuel waste of 10ml.[13] This multiplied with the number of vehicles going over a particular speed bump every day suggests significant annual fuel wastage for a single speed bump.\nDynamic speed bumps\n[edit]Dynamic speed bumps differ from conventional speed bumps in that they only activate if a vehicle is traveling above a certain speed. Vehicles traveling below this speed will not experience the discomfort of a conventional speed bump. Dynamic speed bumps may allow the passage of emergency vehicles at higher speeds.\nThe Actibump system, successfully used in Sweden, is based on powered equipment integrated into the road surface, which operates a platform that is lowered a few centimeters when a speeding vehicle approaches. Any vehicle approaching at or under the speed limit will pass on a level road. The system measures the speed of an oncoming vehicle by using radar.[14]\nIn another design, a rubber housing is fitted with a pressure relief valve that determines the speed of a vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.[15][16]\nSpeed humps\n[edit]A speed hump (also called a road hump, or undulation,[17] and speed ramp) is a rounded traffic calming device used to reduce vehicle speed and thus sound volume on residential streets. Humps are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed in a series of several humps to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Common speed hump shapes are parabolic, circular, and sinusoidal.[17] In Norway, speed humps are often placed at pedestrian crossings.\nGenerally, speed humps have a traverse distance of about 3.7 to 4.3 m (12 to 14 ft) and span the width of the road. The height of each hump ranges from 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in).[17] The traverse distance and height of each hump determines the speed at which traffic will travel over the devices. Shorter traverse lengths and greater heights slow cars most drastically. When placed in a series 110\u2013170 m (350\u2013550 ft) apart, humps will reduce 85th percentile speeds by 13\u201316 km/h (8\u201310 mph).[18]\nWarning signs should be used to notify approaching motorists of upcoming humps. Humps generally have pavement markings to enhance visibility and a taper edge near the curb to allow a gap for drainage.[17]\nSpeed humps are used in locations where low speeds are desired and suitable for the surrounding traffic environment.[6] Speed humps are typically placed on residential roads and are not used on major roads, bus routes, or primary emergency response routes. Placement is generally mid-block between intersections.\nResults\n[edit]Speed humps typically limit vehicle speeds to about 25\u201330 km/h (15\u201320 mph) at the hump and 40\u201350 km/h (25\u201330 mph) at the midpoint between humps, depending on spacing. Studies show an average 18% reduction in traffic volume and an average 13% reduction in collisions.[17]\nComparison to speed bumps\n[edit]While similar to speed bumps, humps are less aggressive than speed bumps at low speeds. Humps are often used on streets, while bumps are used more in parking lots.[19] While speed bumps generally slow cars to 10\u201315 km/h (5\u201310 mph), humps slow cars to 25\u201330 km/h (15\u201320 mph). The narrow traverse distance of speed bumps often allows vehicles to pass over them at high speed with only mild disturbance to the wheels and suspension, and hardly affecting the vehicle cab and its occupants. The relatively long slopes of speed humps are less disruptive at low\u2013moderate speeds, but they create a greater, more sustained vertical deflection; at higher speeds, a more sustained deflection is less-absorbed by vehicle suspensions and has a greater effect on the vehicle as a whole.[20]\nProblems\n[edit]One problematic aspect of speed humps is their effect on emergency vehicles. Response time is slowed by 3\u20135 seconds per hump for fire trucks and fire engines and up to 10 seconds for ambulances with patients on board.[17] Speed humps are thus usually not placed on primary response routes. Speed cushions may be placed on these routes instead.\nOccasionally, there is an increase in traffic noise from braking and acceleration of vehicles on streets with speed humps, particularly from buses and trucks. Other effects include increased fuel consumption and emissions[citation needed] as well as increased wear and tear on brakes, engine and suspension components.\nDamage caused by snow plows during the winter months is an additional concern.\nHeavy sedans, trucks, and SUVs are less affected by speed humps, and may not have to slow down as dramatically.\nThin cuts are sometimes placed in the middle of a hump in order to allow bicycle traffic to pass through. However, forcing cyclists to take a particular line on the road compromises their ability to position themselves safely according to the other traffic on the road at the time.\nSpeed cushions\n[edit]Speed cushions are a type of speed hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.[21][22]\nWider, American-style ambulances might also be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the centre line during an emergency.\nAdvantages\n[edit]Speed cushions have several distinct advantages over similar traffic calming devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles and buses. Speed cushions address this problem by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.[23] Speed cushions are often less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report them to be just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks are also not slowed down.\nUse in North America and Europe\n[edit]Development of speed cushions has focused primarily on the European context. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, and the difference between them makes speed cushions more applicable.\nIn North America, however, consumer vehicles have a track width of 1,300\u20131,500 millimetres (50\u201359 in). Many emergency vehicles are also equipped with dual tires on their rear axles. The additional tires limit track width to as narrow as 1,200 millimetres (48 in), meaning speed cushions may not be suitable for their intended use.[citation needed]\nSpeed tables\n[edit]A speed table (also called a bus-friendly hump, flat top hump, or raised pedestrian crossing) is designed as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally long enough for the entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top.[24] The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions.[25] Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.\nSpeed tables can also be signed as pedestrian crossings, namely zebra crossings. A raised zebra crossing is referred to as a wombat crossing in Australia.[26] Other road features may be included, such as junctions, or even mini-roundabouts. Speed tables are used with zebra crossings repeatedly in Leighton Buzzard.\nResults\n[edit]Typical speeds resulting from 7-metre (22 ft) speed tables are 32\u201348 kilometres per hour (20\u201330 mph). One sample of 8 sites found a 45% decrease in accidents per year with the use of speed tables.[25] Wombat crossings may reduce casualties by 63%.[26]\nAdvantages\n[edit]Speed tables are effective in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly. Traffic speed, volumes, and accidents have been shown to decrease with the use of tables. Although not as responsive to emergency vehicles as speed cushions, speed tables cause less of a delay than humps and are typically preferred by fire departments over speed humps.[24]\nIn the United Kingdom\n[edit]In the UK, vertical deflection in highways for the purpose of traffic calming typically takes one of the following forms:\n- Road humps are the most common variety, and are usually round-topped.\n- Speed tables, a type of hump with a central plateau which is both long and broad, and which may include a pedestrian crossing, junction or roundabout, are preferred by some emergency services and bus operators.\n- Speed cushions, a raised portion of road with a flat top only extending over part of the carriageway's width, are used singly, in a pinch point, or in pairs or triples.\n- Rumble strips, uneven road surfaces, are now only used in rural areas and retail parks because of the noise.\nThe Department for Transport defines the regulations for the design and use of road humps.[27]\nOpposition\n[edit]Speed bumps in some areas have been removed after protests by local residents. Such protests cite the lack of any consultation as one factor.[28] For example, complaints from Derby residents prompted the removal of 146 speed bumps from streets at a cost of \u00a3460,000. Similar incidents have been reported elsewhere in the UK.[29] UK news sources reported a cyclist being killed in a crash while attempting to avoid a speed bump.[30]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Democratic Rate Plan Favored by Roosevelt [and other news]\".
