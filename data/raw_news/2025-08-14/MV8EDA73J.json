  "description": "Voters in Chicago who regret supporting embattled far-left Mayor Brandon Johnson have a stark warning for New Yorkers considering voting for socialist mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani: Don\u2019\u2026",
  "content": "Voters in Chicago who regret supporting embattled far-left Mayor Brandon Johnson have a stark warning for New Yorkers considering backing socialist Zohran Mamdani to lead the city: Don\u2019t make the same mistake.\n\nJohnson, dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s worst mayor\u201d by the Wall Street Journal editorial board, has drawn comparisons to Mamdani for their shared progressive stances \u2014 which have been playing out disastrously in the Windy City.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say to New Yorkers is do your homework. You have to know who you are supporting, who you are voting for, so people of New York don\u2019t walk around feeling the way I do,\u201d said Cata Truss, a Johnson voter and campaigner turned vocal critic.\n\n\u201cI have buyer\u2019s remorse in a way that I\u2019ve never had before,\u201d Truss, 59, told The Post this week.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be me,\u201d she added. \u201cDo the research, follow the money. Who is donating to his campaign? Who got him elected? That will be determining where people ought to vote.\u201d\n\nJohnson rose to the mayor\u2019s office in 2023, elbowing his disastrous Democratic predecessor Lori Lightfoot out of the primary and ultimately defeating centrist Paul Vallas in a two-man runoff.\n\nHis ascent, much like Mamdani\u2019s as the Democratic mayoral nominee, was given a major lift by minority and young activist voters, lured in by his adherence to left-wing doctrine, including a 2020 resolution Johnson introduced as Cook County Commissioner that would have defunded the police, a position he later sprinted away from.\n\nSince becoming mayor, Johnson\u2019s approval rating has hovered around the high-20s, thanks in part to Chicago spending more than $600 million to address some 50,000 illegal immigrants who have made their way to the city in recent years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m anti-Brandon Johnson because I\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s done to this city. All these resources he\u2019s used to take care of illegal citizens is hurting the city,\u201d said Doris Lewis, 81, a retired Chicago high school teacher from Hyde Park.\n\nChicago\u2019s budget woes have already become fodder for attacks in the New York City mayoral race, with ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, using the crisis to make an indirect dig at the frontrunner Mamdani.\n\n\u201cChicago is proof that incompetent leadership can turn a deep-dish city into a half-baked mess,\u201d he posted on X last week.\n\nMamdani and Cuomo, who has been coming in as the November contest\u2019s runner-up in recent polls, will also face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and lawyer Jim Walden, both running as independents, and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n\nLewis, the retired schoolteacher, said she voted for Johnson because he was a \u201cyoung black man with a family.\u201d But she realized her error once she saw how he was running the city, calling Johnson \u201ca disaster, a disgrace and a total disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really angry with myself because going in, I had a general idea that he was pushing an agenda for everybody else except black people,\u201d she said, accusing Johnson of \u201cplaying the race card\u201d to earn the community\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cWhat agenda does Zohran Mamdani have for the black community in New York City since that is who he is courting now?\u201d\n\nLewis predicted that electing Mamdani \u2014 who is the frontrunner in the November general election \u2014 \u201cwould be a disaster for New York as it is a disaster for Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocialism hasn\u2019t worked for black people, so I am anti-this guy in New York,\u201d she said.\n\nA February poll by M3 Strategies found just 20% of voters approved of the job Johnson is doing in Chicago. The embattled mayor is facing a handful of recall efforts, as well as multiple PACs raising millions of dollars to ensure he isn\u2019t re-elected in 2027.\n\nThe anti-Johnson sentiment was echoed among elected Democrats in the city.\n\nChicago Democratic Alderman Raymond Lopez, a self-described \u201cmiddle of the road Democrat\u201d who voted for Vallas and said he supports law enforcement, capitalism and personal responsibility, called on New Yorkers to \u201clearn from our mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of comparisons being made right now. Both are hyper-progressive, hyper-left socialist Democratic candidates,\u201d he said of the oft-made juxtaposition between Johnson and Mamdani.\n\n\u201cNow you have New York and Chicago duking it out for who is going to be the more socialist, the more progressive city in America. It\u2019s almost like a socialist nightmare,\u201d Lopez said.\n\n\u201cLearn from our mistakes and pick someone who is more focused on results and common sense than simply burning down the barn because you want to see fire.\u201d",

I\u2019m not getting out of this car. It\u2019s time to go to bed,\u201d he shouts at the officer, before being forcibly removed and booked into the jail shortly before 1 a.m., according to an arrest report retrieved by WCBD.\nMcLeod\u2019s eyes were \u201cextremely bloodshot and highly dilated \u2026 typical of an individual under the influence of a stimulant narcotic,\u201d according to the report.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether McLeod \u2014 who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 and served two terms as Charleston County Democratic Party chairman \u2014 was tested for drugs during his arrest.\nHe is facing misdemeanor charges for disorderly conduct.\nHis party leadership is calling on him to step down from the gubernatorial race, in which he is currently the party\u2019s only candidate.\n\u201cAfter reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,\u201d the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, said in a statement Wednesday.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."
