  "content": "The top U.S. ZIP Codes people are moving to in 2025 Americans are trading big cities for affordable suburbs \u2014 with Texas, Florida, and Arizona leading 2025\u2019s top moving destinations, per MovingPlace\n\nAmericans are always packing up and heading for new cities, but 2025\u2019s migration trends reveal a continued shift that's been happening for some time: Big cities are losing residents to their suburban and exurban neighbors.\n\nWith home prices and rents in many major metros reaching record highs, people are looking farther afield for affordable housing, more space, and a slower pace of life. In the process, they\u2019re fueling rapid growth in communities outside large urban centers.\n\nThe latest analysis from MovingPlace highlights the ZIP codes that drew the most new residents from January through May, 2025. According to the moving price-comparison site, Texas, Florida, and Arizona dominate the top of the list, suggesting the enduring appeal of the Sun Belt. These states offer a combination of warmer climates and housing stock that's more affordable than those in coastal hubs.\n\nTexas, in particular, is leading the pack, with six of the ten most popular inbound ZIP codes. Many of these areas are tied to major metro areas like Houston, Austin, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and San Antonio, but sit far enough outside the urban core to provide larger homes, newer developments, and less congestion. Florida\u2019s entry into the top tier reinforces the state\u2019s strong pull on retirees, remote workers, and families alike, while Arizona\u2019s shows the Phoenix metro\u2019s continued growth.\n\nContinue reading to see which zip codes made the list and why.",

      "text": "Americans are on the move. In 2024, a total of 25.87 million Americans (or 7.8% of the U.S. population) moved to a new home, whether to buy their first house, to leave the family nest for the first time, or simply to seek a change of scenery.\nWhile relocation is nothing new, recent shifts in politics, the climate, and affordability have dramatically shaped where Americans choose to go, making certain areas of the U.S. more popular over the years. The top motivations to move generally include the search for new or better housing, a new job, or to establish an independent household.\nBut that begs the question: where exactly are people going? Not just which cities or states, but which ZIP codes are emerging as the most popular destinations for movers?\nAffordability is pushing movers to the edges of metro areas, with the most popular ZIP codes being suburban rather than central.\nKey Findings\n- Cypress, TX (77433) had the highest move count with 3,638, making it the most moved-to ZIP in 2025.\n- This is followed by New Braunfels in Texas (78130) with 3,486 moves to the area and Winter Garden in Florida (34787) with 3,442 moves.\n- Texas dominates migration patterns, claiming 29 of the top 100 ZIP codes for inbound moves.\n- Suburban growth is accelerating with nearly all of the top inbound ZIP codes are on the edges of metro areas, not in city centers.\n- The Sunbelt dominates with Texas, Florida, and Arizona home to 9 of the 10 most moved-to ZIP codes in the U.S.\n| Table of Contents Full Methodology The Top 10 Hottest ZIP Codes in America The Hottest ZIP Code in Every State Full Hottest ZIP Codes Ranking What This Means for Movers and Residents |\nWhat We Did\nTo find the hottest ZIP codes in the U.S, MovingPlace.com analyzed proprietary data from parent company Porch Group, Inc., leveraging audience data from PGM. The dataset included 6.3 million moves between January 2025 and May 31st, 2025. MovingPlace.com\u2019s analysis identified the number of movers to each ZIP code in the U.S. and then analyzed which ZIP codes were seeing the biggest increase. The data study also analyzed the hottest ZIP code in every state.\nThe ZIP Codes Americans are Flocking to This Year\nAcross the country, the ZIP codes experiencing the highest influx of movers reveal what today\u2019s homebuyers and renters are looking for. Suburban and exurban areas dominate the list, with places like Cypress and Katy near Houston, Leander outside Austin, and Queen Creek near Phoenix leading the way, pointing to a growing preference for space, affordability, and newer housing options outside dense city centers.\nMany of these popular ZIP codes sit just beyond major metro hubs, offering the best of both worlds: access to thriving job markets and urban amenities, paired with quieter living, better schools, and a stronger sense of community.\nThese migration patterns tell a broader story, that Americans are redefining their relationship with urban life, prioritizing quality of life over proximity. The suburban shift is a defining feature of today\u2019s housing market, reshaping communities and driving growth along the edges of the country\u2019s most dynamic cities.\n1. Cypress, TX (77433) \u2013 3,638 Movers\nCypress leads the nation in inbound moves with 3,638 at the start of 2025. Located just northwest of Houston, this suburb offers a blend of affordable housing (with Zillow listing the average current house price at $415k), and an abundance of green spaces, which makes it a more appealing option for some than the nearby city center of Houston. Cypress has become a magnet for families and young professionals who want more space and a quieter lifestyle while still being within commuting distance of Houston\u2019s job market and urban amenities.\n2. New Braunfels, TX (78130) \u2013 3,486 Movers\nNew Braunfels, nestled between San Antonio and Austin, follows closely behind with 3,486 movers in 2025 so far. Its appeal lies in a unique mix of historic charm, outdoor recreation along the Guadalupe River, and affordable living costs compared to nearby big cities. The city\u2019s growing economy and cultural events draw those who want small-town living with easy access to major metros, earning it the second-highest population increase in the U.S. from 2022 to 2023, according to Census data.\n3. Winter Garden, FL (34787) \u2013 3,442 Movers\nWinter Garden, just outside Orlando, attracted 3,442 newcomers, reflecting Florida\u2019s ongoing appeal as a relocation hotspot. Known for its historic downtown, family-friendly neighborhoods, and proximity to theme parks and beaches, Winter Garden combines sunshine and lifestyle with relatively affordable housing compared with the rest of the state, making it ideal for families and retirees alike.\n4. Leander, TX (78641) \u2013 3,349 Movers\nLeander, a short 30-minute drive from Austin\u2019s metropolitan area, saw 3,349 people move in during 2025. This fast-growing suburb is sought after for its excellent school system, planned communities, and outdoor recreational opportunities. Leander offers residents the chance to enjoy the vibrant Austin tech scene while living in a quieter, more affordable area with plenty of new housing developments.\n5. Katy, TX (77493) \u2013 3,215 Movers\nKaty, located west of Houston, brought in 3,215 movers seeking its highly rated schools, family-friendly atmosphere, and booming local economy. Katy also has relatively affordable housing, with the average house price sitting at $352k, according to Zillow. The area\u2019s combination of suburban comfort with access to Houston\u2019s corporate hubs and cultural attractions appeals strongly to those wanting a balanced lifestyle.\n6. Queen Creek, AZ (85142) \u2013 3,059 Movers\nQueen Creek, a growing suburb southeast of Phoenix, attracted 3,059 movers. The suburb has been attracting a steady stream of new residents, particularly families and retirees, drawn by a sense of community that can be harder to find in busier urban areas. Its growth is fueled by affordable housing relative to Phoenix proper and access to sunny weather and outdoor activities. This popularity means that local realtors predict house prices will skyrocket in the coming years.\n7. Parker, CO (80134) \u2013 2,961 Movers\nParker, just 20 miles south of Denver, welcomed 2,961 newcomers to the area at the start of 2025. This suburb is favored for its open spaces and a community-focused lifestyle reflected in a packed calendar of events from Parker Days, a carnival drawing over 100,000 attendees, to tree-lighting ceremonies. Residents benefit from a balance of suburban living with easy access to Denver\u2019s urban amenities, job market, and outdoor recreation in the nearby Rockies.\n8. McKinney, TX (75071) \u2013 2,895 Movers\nMcKinney continues to thrive with 2,895 inbound movers. Part of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, it\u2019s known for its charming historic downtown, quality schools, and safe family-oriented neighborhoods. McKinney offers a mix of old-town character and modern growth, attracting residents who want a strong sense of community with access to city jobs. The city has big plans, with a host of multi-billion-dollar projects in the works, including a massive mixed\u2011use district, adventure park, and a JW Marriott resort.\n9. Roseville, CA (95747) \u2013 2,887 Movers\nRoseville, near Sacramento, pulled in 2,887 movers looking for an affordable California lifestyle with average house prices sitting at $658k, well below the state average of $904k according to the California Association of Realtors (CAR). The city\u2019s strong job market has made it a top pick for families and professionals leaving pricier coastal cities. Roseville combines safe suburban living with close proximity to the state capital\u2019s sought-after amenities.\n10. San Antonio, TX (78253) \u2013 2,883 Movers\nSan Antonio\u2019s 78253 ZIP code saw 2,883 movers. As one of Texas\u2019s largest cities, San Antonio offers a vibrant cultural scene, a diverse economy, and expanding suburban communities. This area appeals to those seeking urban amenities alongside affordable housing options, with strong growth in healthcare, military, and tech sectors.\n2025 Moving Trends Shaping America\nTexas Becomes America\u2019s Migration Hotspot\nTexas is by far the most moved-to state in 2025, claiming 29 of the top 100 hottest ZIP codes for inbound moves, nearly one-third of the entire list. From the Houston suburbs like Cypress (77433) and Katy (77493) to booming towns around Austin like Leander (78641), Pflugerville (78660), Georgetown (78628), and Kyle (78640), the Lone Star State\u2019s outer metro areas are magnets for movers.\nEven North Texas suburbs like McKinney (75071), Forney (75126), and Aubrey (76227) in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metro area are seeing thousands of inbound moves. Cypress alone recorded 3,638 moves, more than any other ZIP code in the country.\nAffordability, job growth, and space are key reasons why the state is seeing such an influx of visitors. Texas cities continue to attract employers in tech, energy, manufacturing, and logistics. No state income tax, large swathes of available land for development, and relatively lower housing costs than coastal states make it especially attractive to young families and remote workers.\nThe dominance of suburban ZIPs reflects this, they\u2019re moving to the edges of metros where they can afford larger homes, good schools, and a higher quality of life, all while remaining close to urban job centers. Add to this the warm climate and business-friendly policies, and Texas is an attractive relocation option.\nCity Centers Lose Ground as Movers Choose Suburbs\nThe study reveals that a pattern is emerging. Most of the fastest-growing ZIP codes appear not in the heart of cities but just outside of them. Places like Leander near Austin, Katy near Houston, and Queen Creek just outside Phoenix are drawing thousands of new residents. These suburban communities offer more space, newer homes, and better affordability, exactly what many movers are seeking today.\nThis isn\u2019t an entirely new trend. Suburban living was already on the rise, with recent Census data showing a 10.5% increase in Americans moving further out of metro areas between 2010 and 2020. According to the New York Times, the pandemic only fueled that momentum.\nFor many Americans, it\u2019s not just about leaving the more expensive city, but finding a lifestyle that feels more comfortable and manageable as well. Larger yards, quieter streets, and access to good schools make these suburbs attractive options for families and remote workers alike. With urban centers often crowded and costly, not to mention more dangerous, the edges of metro areas are becoming the go-to spots for people looking to put down roots.\nTexas, Florida, and Tennessee Drive Sunbelt\u2019s Migration Boom\nThe Sunbelt dominates when it comes to mover hotspots in 2025. Texas, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada together claim nine of the ten most popular ZIP codes for inbound moves across the country. For example, Cypress, TX (77433) leads with 3,638 new residents, followed closely by New Braunfels, TX (78130) with 3,486 moves, and Winter Garden, FL (34787) with 3,442.\nThese states aren\u2019t just popular by chance either. They offer a combination of factors that appeal to today\u2019s movers. Warm weather is a huge draw, especially for those leaving colder northern climates. Lower taxes and relatively affordable housing markets also make it easier for families, retirees, and remote workers to plant roots in these areas. Places like Queen Creek, AZ (85142) and Henderson, NV (89011) round out the list with thousands of new arrivals, proving the Sunbelt\u2019s pull extends beyond just Texas and Florida.\nWith sprawling suburbs, growing job markets, and plenty of housing options, the Sunbelt is meeting the demands of modern movers looking for space, comfort, and opportunity, reasons why this region remains a hotspot for movers.\nThe Hottest ZIP Code in All 50 States\nWhile the most popular ZIP codes for 2025 often appear in the Sunbelt region in the U.S., every state has its own unique hotspots attracting residents from both local and statewide areas.\nDiscover the single most popular ZIP code in each state where movers are flocking in 2025 in this interactive map. It highlights key migration hotspots across the country, showing how relocation patterns vary from coast to coast.\nEach pin reveals the city and the total number of movers drawn to these top ZIP codes, and show the trends that reflect broader shifts toward affordable living, job opportunities, and lifestyle preferences shaping American migration today.\nThe Hottest ZIP Codes in the U.S.\nExplore the complete list of America\u2019s most popular ZIP codes for 2025 in this interactive, searchable table.\nA growing number of people are trading city life for the suburbs in search of a better fit for their day-to-day lives. Meanwhile, Sunbelt states like Texas, Florida, and Arizona continue to dominate due to their warmer climates, lower taxes, and expanding job markets.\nUse the table below to see if the hottest zipcode in your state follows or bucks these trends.\nWhat This Means for Movers and Residents\nWith Americans increasingly heading to a handful of hot ZIP codes, this migration trend carries real implications for both the people relocating and those already living in these areas.\nFor movers, the data reveals a clear roadmap of where demand is rising, and with that comes both opportunity and competition. ZIP codes in suburban areas and Sunbelt states are seeing the largest influx, meaning that those looking to relocate to places like Cypress, TX, or Winter Garden, FL should be prepared for heightened demand in housing, schools, and services. Naturally, this means house prices are likely to rise in the coming years as popularity grows.\nFor current residents in these booming ZIP codes, the trend may be a double-edged sword. On one hand, increased interest can drive property values up and stimulate local economies with new businesses and infrastructure investment. On the other hand, it may also put pressure on roads, schools, and other services and lead to a tighter housing market that\u2019s tougher for locals to navigate.\nMethodology\nTo uncover where Americans are moving in 2025, MovingPlace.com analyzed internal data from 6,383,348 moves booked through Porch Group Inc. By examining the origin and destination ZIP codes of each move, we were able to identify which areas are seeing the highest inbound migration across the country.\nWe aggregated this data to calculate the total number of people moving into each U.S. ZIP code. From there, we ranked the top 10 most popular ZIP codes nationwide (those attracting the largest number of movers overall) as well as the single hottest ZIP code in every U.S. state. This approach allowed us to discern both national trends like suburban growth and the rise of the Sunbelt, and regional insights into where Americans are concentrating their moves.\nThe data was taken between January 2025 to May 31st, 2025.\nIn Partnership With PGM\nThis study was made possible with in-depth consumer insights provided by data provider PGM. Their advanced audience data helps businesses reach the right people through the right channels at the right time. This exclusive partnership enables MovingPlace to surface truly proprietary consumer trends shaping today\u2019s marketplace."
