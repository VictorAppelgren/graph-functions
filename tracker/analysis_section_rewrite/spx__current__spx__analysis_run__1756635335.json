      "feedback": "The draft fails the acceptance gate because it never maps to a canonical handle with a clear sign/magnitude or a dated catalyst window. Replace the generic “Tesla’s valuation” narrative with a concise, handle‑centric view on **TSLA** (and its index exposure to **ndx** and **spx**). Specify a 0–3‑week horizon: if the Miami verdict is upheld (LJZYDXVL3) TSLA shares will likely fall 2–5 % and earnings will be hit 5–10 % (≈$200 M). If the verdict is overturned, the upside could be 3–6 %. Add the Fed’s dovish cue (B1KYJ1GPU) as a catalyst on 16‑17 Sep, and the tariff escalation (B1KYJ1GPU) on 13 Aug as additional risk factors. Cite each claim with the source ID (e.g., “(LJZYDXVL3)”) and quantify AI‑spending support (5GZPY1XUE: $600 bn/yr). Remove extraneous legal/regulatory chatter that does not tie to a handle or catalyst. The revised paragraph should read: “TSLA is poised for a 2–5 % drop over the next 0–3 weeks if the $243 M verdict is upheld (LJZYDXVL3). A reversal would lift the stock 3–6 %. Fed’s 25‑bp cut signal (B1KYJ1GPU) and tariff hikes (B1KYJ1GPU) add downside pressure, while AI spending ($600 bn/yr, 5GZPY1XUE) provides a counter‑balancing tailwind.” This meets the mapping, catalyst, and quantification requirements.",
