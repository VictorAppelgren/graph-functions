  "title": "Israel\u2019s New Negotiating Stance Is Likely to Prolong Gaza War, Experts Say",
  "description": "A shift toward pressing for a permanent cease-fire deal, alongside plans for a new offensive in Gaza City, means the fighting is unlikely to end soon.",
  "content": "Over the past year, Israel has doggedly insisted that negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire be focused solely on a phased deal that would begin with a temporary truce and see some hostages released in exchange for some Palestinian prisoners, while deferring agreement on a more permanent pact.\n\nAnd yet, even as Hamas recently said that it would agree to a phased deal, the Israeli government has switched gears, saying it wanted only a comprehensive deal that would free all the hostages and end the war. It is as unclear as ever how, or when, that might happen.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military is also poised this week to call up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers for its advance into the heart of Gaza City.\n\nBoth those steps, experts say, would most likely prolong the war, not shorten it.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has vowed to keep fighting until Israel has decisively defeated Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades, by stripping it of its military and governing capabilities and forcing it to disarm.",
