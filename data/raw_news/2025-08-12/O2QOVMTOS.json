  "content": "NORFOLK, Va. (AP) \u2014 Government-run medical centers serving the nation\u2019s veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report from the VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General is based on surveys from late March and early April that were taken at 139 Veterans Health Administration facilities. Severe staffing shortages are not necessarily an indication of vacancies but refer to particular occupations that are difficult to fill.\n\nThe surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs \u2014 out of 484,000 \u2014 through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The VA later reduced the figure to nearly 30,000 jobs to be cut by this fiscal year\u2019s end on Sept. 30.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration said Tuesday that the surveys are unreliable because they do not reflect actual vacancies, which VA officials said were in line with historical averages. But Democratic lawmakers warned that veterans won\u2019t get the health care they need as VA positions become harder to fill.\n\nNearly all of the facilities \u2014 94% \u2014 reported a shortage for medical officer occupations that include doctors, while 79% reported shortages for nurses. The report noted that severe shortages for medical officers and nurses have been identified every year in the report since 2014.\n\nHe said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with \u201cnormal VA historical averages.\u201d\n\nBut Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration\u2019s profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate effort to incapacitate and to undermine veterans\u2019 support for and approval of the care they receive in VA hospitals and clinics,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to wait much longer for appointments. There won\u2019t be specialists available. They\u2019ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.\u201d",
