  "description": "M&T Bank Corporation ( NYSE:MTB ) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 30th of...",
  "content": "M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 30th of September to $1.50, which will be 11% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $1.35. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.7%, which is fairly typical for the industry.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable.\n\nM&T Bank has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 35%, which means that M&T Bank would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 11.1% over the next 3 years. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 31% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $2.80 total annually to $5.40. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.8% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that M&T Bank has been growing its earnings per share at 8.6% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that M&T Bank is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.",

It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases.

The bank\u2019s long\u2011term dividend track record shows steady increases, with a 6.8% annual growth since 2015 and a history of stable payments. The article also highlights the growing role of artificial intelligence in healthcare, noting that 20 AI\u2011driven companies\u2014ranging from diagnostics to drug discovery\u2014are under $10\u202fbillion in market cap and could offer early investment opportunities.
