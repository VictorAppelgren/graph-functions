  "description": "The global gold market has been thrown into fresh turmoil after a US government agency indicated that bullion would not be exempt from tariffs.",
  "content": "The global gold market has been thrown into fresh turmoil after a US government agency indicated that bullion would not be exempt from tariffs.\n\nImports of one kilo and 100-ounce gold bars are subject to reciprocal tariffs, according to a July 31 Customs and Border Protection letter reviewed by CNN. The revelation perplexed Wall Street traders, who had expected bullion to be exempt from duties.\n\nA tariff on gold would hike the cost of importing the metal into the United States, throwing a costly wrench into a global supply chain that flows between hubs in London, New York and cities in Switzerland.\n\nThe White House on Friday afternoon called potential tariffs on gold \u201cmisinformation\u201d and said it would clarify the issue.\n\n\u201cThe White House intends to issue an executive order in the near future clarifying misinformation about the tariffing of gold bars and other specialty products,\u201d a White House official confirmed to CNN on Friday afternoon.\n\nGold prices in New York, which had jumped 1%, pared their gains and traded up just 0.2% by Friday afternoon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff campaign has included a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland \u2014 among the highest rates that were implemented on Thursday.\n\nThe July 31 CBP letter clarified that gold bars imported from Switzerland are subject to reciprocal tariffs. The Financial Times first reported the ruling.\n\nThe revelation of a potential tariff was a surprising development for the market, which had been hoping to avoid the logistical headache of import duties.\n\n\u201cGold traders will be grappling with the implications of previously unanticipated tariffs,\u201d Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, head of global equities at Swiss bank UBS, said in a Friday note.\n\nGold futures traded in New York surged more than 1% late Thursday to a record high above $3,500 a troy ounce before paring gains. Gold traded at $3,460 a troy ounce as of Friday afternoon.\n\nGold, a safe haven during uncertainty, has soared 31% this year as investors have sought places to park their cash amid trade and geopolitical turmoil. A tariff could boost the price of gold but would put a strain on the supply chains underpinning the global market.\n\nGold bullion is used to back the financial contracts traded on the Comex exchange, a hub for trading based in New York. These gold bars are widely imported from Switzerland.\n\nA fresh tariff on gold imports would be an additional factor for Wall Street traders to consider when buying or selling gold on US-based exchanges.\n\nFutures contracts on US commodities exchange Comex are often used to hedge positions, with the assumption that traders can easily import gold into the United States to physically settle contracts if needed, said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS, in a note.\n\n\u201cThe tariff adds costs to this process, and with the bulk of refining capacity sitting in Switzerland which faces 39% US tariffs, these costs would be quite high,\u201d Teves said.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty around all this and until there is clarity, we expect the gold market and precious metals markets more generally to remain very nervous,\u201d she added.\n\nThe rise in New York gold prices held around 1% before retreating, which was not an enormous gain for the yellow metal. It was a signal that some traders expected the tariff ruling could be revised.\n\n\u201cThe market is waiting for more clarity,\u201d said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank\u2019s Asset Management Group. \u201cI think this is a market with significant questions about is this really what was intended?\u201d\n\nWhile the price of gold traded in New York rose, the price of gold in London was relatively unchanged, reflecting a growing premium for the New York market.\n\nOle Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said a tariff on gold could distort the market and make the New York exchanges less appealing for the global market.\n\n\u201cThese developments raise serious questions about the ability of the NY futures markets to offer a stable and trustworthy trading environment that offers the best price discovery \u2014 one that increasingly appears vulnerable to being hijacked by Trump\u2019s shifting tariff agenda,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nUS Bank\u2019s Haworth similarly said the tariff on gold imports would disrupt the current organization of the global gold trade. The New York market could lose its appeal for global investors if they have to reckon with the cost of tariffs, he said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a concern for Wall Street. Gold comes in all shapes and sizes: from coins and jewelry, to bullion used to back financial contracts, to physical bars sold at Costco. The ruling could have significant implications for the global supply chain.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the US, a long-standing and historical partner for Switzerland,\u201d Christoph Wild, president of the industry group Swiss Association of Manufacturers and Traders of Precious Metals, said in a statement.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump just enacted a new wave of tariffs on dozens of America\u2019s trading partners, marking a substantial escalation in ongoing trade tensions that could constitute the biggest change to the global economy in nearly a century.\nThe historic new trade policy follows months of false starts to Trump\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rollout and countless bilateral trade negotiations, a handful of which resulted in agreements that fended off even higher tariffs.\nTrump and his economic advisers have celebrated the considerably higher tariffs that have already gone into effect, correctly noting that they have raised more than $100 billion in tax revenue without leading to catastrophic inflation or a recession, as some economists had feared.\nThe president is moving forward with new, significantly more aggressive tariffs that economists fear could exacerbate budding economic problems, including rising inflation and slowing job growth, that are just now becoming more apparent.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs:\nWhat are the new rates?\nBefore Thursday, virtually every country\u2019s goods were subject to a minimum 10% tariff. Now rates vary substantially from country to country.\nThe highest rates imposed are on goods from Brazil (50%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), Switzerland (39%), Iraq (35%) and Serbia (35%).\nAn additional 21 countries also face levies greater than 15%. That includes several countries the US relies heavily on for a variety of goods, such as Vietnam (20%), India (25%), Taiwan (20%) and Thailand (19%).\nGoods from India could also be subject to an additional 25% tariff stacked on top of that because of an executive order Trump signed Wednesday that seeks to penalize India for purchasing oil from Russia. That second tariff is slated to take effect on August 27.\nThirty-nine countries\u2019 goods, as well as members of the European Union, are subject to 15% tariffs, according to a list the White House published last week.\nBesides Canada and Mexico, all other countries the US imports goods from will continue to face a minimum 10% tariff, albeit with a few exemptions.\nGoods from Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs if they\u2019re compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. If not, goods from Mexico are subject to 25% tariffs, while goods from Canada are subject to 35% tariffs, up from 25% previously.\nWhat\u2019s the deal with the trade deals?\nIn most cases, they\u2019re not exactly trade deals, per se, but rather rough sketches of ones that could take months, or even years, to finalize \u2014 assuming they don\u2019t fall apart.\nOver the past five months, Trump announced eight trade agreements. Of those, only two \u2014 with the United Kingdom and China \u2014 have been formalized. The agreement with China, which significantly lowered tariff rates both countries imposed on one another\u2019s goods, expires on August 12. If both countries fail to act, rates could spike again.\nMost agreements Trump announced involve trading partners committing to purchasing more American products, like oil, cars, Boeing airplanes, defense equipment and agricultural goods. They also involve hundreds of billions of dollars worth of investments in American businesses.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if the United States and other trading partners involved in agreements are on the same page about many of the proposed terms. For instance, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and a lead Japanese trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, both recently said many key details are still being worked out and are telling a vastly different story from Trump, who earlier this week said the country agreed to buy Ford F-150s.\nAre any goods exempt from the new tariffs?\nYes, plenty.\nOne notable exemption is smartphones, which aren\u2019t subject to any of the new rates. Additionally, goods for which Trump imposed separate sectoral tariffs or ordered investigations that could result in higher rates won\u2019t be stacked on top of country-specific \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\nFor the time being, that means pharmaceuticals, for instance, could be imported from countries duty-free. However, Trump is warning they could soon face significantly higher rates.\nThe EU sought to preempt those tariffs by negotiating a 15% tax on pharma exports to the US as part of the agreement announced with Trump. Other countries involved in trade agreements similarly are getting more favorable rates on certain sectoral tariffs.\nThere\u2019s also a partial exemption for certain goods manufactured abroad where at least 20% of their value comes from American materials and labor.\nWhen are these tariffs effective?\nTechnically they\u2019re already in effect, but there\u2019s a caveat.\nThe executive order Trump signed last week essentially states that most goods that were loaded on ships and in transit to the US before 12:01 am on Thursday will face whatever the prior tariff rates were until October 5.\nThis isn\u2019t the end\nIn addition to pharma tariffs, Trump has threatened to impose across-the-board tariffs on semiconductors and lumber. At an Oval Office event on Wednesday, for example, Trump said he would soon place a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, although he didn\u2019t give a timeline.\nAnd while the tariffs Trump just enacted could ultimately be rendered illegal, pending an ongoing court challenge, the president has plenty of levers he can pull to keep pushing his agenda for higher tariffs."
