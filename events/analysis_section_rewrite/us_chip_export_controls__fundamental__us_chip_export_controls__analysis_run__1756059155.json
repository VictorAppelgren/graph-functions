      "feedback": "This draft nicely maps a four‑pillar US‑led tech strategy into a multi‑year regime, but to reach world‑class quality it needs sharper first‑principles anchors, explicit regimes and transition conditions, tighter quantification from the cited sources, and a more explicit causal translation to asset prices and capital allocation. Actionable edits: (1) state invariant anchors up front, e.g., AI computing leadership is a function of (i) access to high‑end silicon and manufacturing capacity (US/ally supply chains), (ii) the breadth of the AI‑infrastructure stack (chips, memory, interconnects, software, and deployed workloads), (iii) sustained private‑capital incentives (CHIPS/IRA scale) and (iv) reciprocal alliance enforcement, as underscored by the 2022–24 export controls and CHIPS Act framework in Z244I6NYO and Sullivan’s remarks (cite Z244I6NYO and the NSC/FT quotes in 7). (2) formalize multi‑year regimes and transition states with regime names and triggers: Baseline (cooperative allies, China slow‑burn domestic upgrade; durable but evolving restraints), Escalatory (looser leakage through allied loopholes or China accelerates domestic capacity; legal/policy pushback grows), and Breakpoint (major shift in alliance participation or a China breakthrough in 7–nm–class fabs). Tie each regime to a transmission channel: export controls, allied cooperation (ASML/Tokyo Electron, Netherlands/Japan in Z244I6NYO), and private‑capital mobilization (CHIPS/IRA). (3) intensify the causal chain from policy to markets with explicit numeric levers: cite the Oct‑2022 controls on Nvidia/H100, the 2023–24 tightening to close loopholes, and the 15% revenue‑share mechanism (cite ZCJ6L84JV and Z244I6NYO/LA Times pieces), plus the likely capacity gaps (SMIC at 14–7 nm vs leading nodes at 5–3 nm; ASML’s EUV export constraints) to explain why Nvidia/AMD earnings paths and chip‑pricing signals should reprice over a multi‑year horizon (cite 6 and 10/11 as appropriate). (4) embed explicit, sourced catalysts and invalidation triggers: (i) allied sign‑offs or new export controls (Italy/Netherlands/Japan/ASML moves; Z244I6NYO), (ii) China’s rare earth/magnet policy shifts and domestic fab progress (30BKAWRYF; 5LXJQX4FN), (iii) the revenue‑sharing clause becoming legally challenged or repealed (7; 5LXJQX4FN), and (iv) a material shift in Nvidia/AMD licensing regimes or a new “diffusion rule”‑style policy (ZCJ6L84JV; 7). (5) dramatically improve quantification and avoid platitudes by anchoring claims to numbers: CHIPS Act funding of $52B, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the 15% revenue share; chip‑node gaps (7 nm/14 nm) and the EUV chokepoint (ASML); the net effect on Chinese access to H20/MI308 class GPUs; and the scale of potential TAM shifts in AI infrastructure (cite 7, 6, 10, 11). (6) tighten citations so every decisive assertion maps to an ID in SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile conflicts: e.g., the revenue‑sharing appears in multiple outlets (ZCJ6L84JV, Latimes 7, Latimes 5LXJQX4FN) with slightly different framing; acknowledge potential legal risk in the “export tax” framing (5LXJQX4FN) and distinguish policy certainty from political signaling (Z244I6NYO). (7) align with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a clean base case, a few clearly defined risks, and “what to watch” items in multi‑year horizon terms, plus a concise confidence assessment; avoid extraneous allusions not anchored in the IDs. (8) consider adding a compact sensitivity dial (low/mid/high disruption) to illustrate price/volume impacts on Nvidia/AMD equity and wider AI‑hardware equities under each regime. By tightening anchors, clarifying regimes, concretizing catalysts/invalidation, and tying every claim to the cited IDs, the analysis will achieve world‑class depth, rigor, and decision‑relevance.",
