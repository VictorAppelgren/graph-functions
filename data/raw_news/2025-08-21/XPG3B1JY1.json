  "content": "Collaboration Combines Satellite-Based Vegetation Risk Monitoring and AI/Science-Based Wildfire Modeling to Help Utilities Reduce Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) and Keep Power On During Extreme Weather\n\nLA JOLLA, Calif., and LE\u00d3N, Spain, Aug. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- , the leading provider of wildfire and extreme weather modeling, risk mitigation, and operational response solutions, today announced a strategic partnership with , a leading provider of vegetation risk intelligence. The collaboration will bring together Technosylva's AI and science-driven wildfire risk and extreme weather modeling and simulation capabilities with AiDASH's satellite and AI-powered vegetation risk intelligence to deliver more comprehensive wildfire risk mitigation for electric utilities.\n\nBy combining AiDASH's vegetation intelligence with Technosylva's advanced wildfire modeling, utilities will be able to forecast and mitigate vegetation and fire risks days in advance of an event. This integrated approach will allow emergency vegetation crews to be deployed with surgical precision, addressing high-risk areas before extreme weather hits. In many cases, these targeted interventions could provide effective additional mitigation before the use of Public Safety Power Shutoffs, potentially avoiding them or enabling more limited, localized shutoffs that minimize customer impact.\n\nThrough this partnership and integration, utilities will also be able to optimize their vegetation management spend to reduce wildfire risk. Vegetation management represents tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of annual spend for many utilities. By focusing and aligning these investments on the highest vegetation-related fire potential locations and assets, they can generate returns many times that same investment cost through reduced wildfire risk.\n\nA warming and drying climate, aging infrastructure, and increasing power demand continue to compound these risks for utilities nationwide. By combining real-time AI-driven wildfire science with satellite and AI-powered vegetation risk intelligence, the Technosylva and AiDASH integration enables utilities to make more precise, data-driven decisions for grid resilience and wildfire prevention.\n\n\"Our utility customers are always looking for ways to improve their efforts to predict and mitigate wildfire-related outages and protect communities,\" said Michael McGuire, Chief Commercial Officer at Technosylva. \"They've asked us for integrations like this one to help them support tighter connections between their organizational groups, for example, here between wildfire mitigation and vegetation management. Through this, we can support their continuous optimization of vegetation management spend to reduce risk, enhance situational awareness, and reduce the scope and impact of Public Safety Power Shutoffs. The result is greater system resilience and improved protection for both critical infrastructure and the communities that rely on it.\"",
