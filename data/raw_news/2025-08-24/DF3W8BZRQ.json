  "content": "For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Schloss Wachenheim AG (ETR:SWA) shareholders, since the share price is down 12% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 53%.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nSchloss Wachenheim saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 4.8% per year, over the last three years. This fall in EPS isn't far from the rate of share price decline, which was 4% per year. So it seems like sentiment towards the stock hasn't changed all that much over time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nWe know that Schloss Wachenheim has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Schloss Wachenheim's TSR for the last 3 years was -1.1%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nSchloss Wachenheim shareholders gained a total return of 2.2% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 4% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. Before forming an opinion on Schloss Wachenheim you might want to consider the cold hard cash it pays as a dividend. This free chart tracks its dividend over time.",

Total shareholder return over the same period was only \u20131.1%, largely due to dividend payouts, yet the company still offers a 4% dividend yield and a 43% payout ratio that is well covered by earnings. Forecasts project earnings growth of 5.9% and revenue growth of 4.8% with a 8% return on equity, while past performance shows modest earnings growth (0.8%) but stronger revenue growth (6.7%).",
