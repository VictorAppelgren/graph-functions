      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid foundation but requires enhancements in several areas to elevate its quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking the geopolitical dynamics to specific market reactions, such as energy prices or currency fluctuations, to clarify how these factors transmit through the economy. Second, ensure alignment with the multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term implications of the summit outcomes on U.S.-Russia relations and European security frameworks. Third, incorporate quantifiable data, such as estimates of economic impacts or military losses, to support claims and avoid generalizations. Additionally, increase citation density by referencing specific sources for each claim made, ensuring all critical perspectives are covered and any conflicts reconciled. Finally, refine the conclusion to clearly delineate the base case scenario, key risks, and specific catalysts to watch, enhancing clarity and coherence.",
