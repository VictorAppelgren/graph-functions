  "content": "At a United Nations Security Council meeting Sunday, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea offered an indisputable observation of the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip: \u201cThis war could end today if Hamas would let the hostages and all of Gaza go free.\u201d\n\nFrance, Britain and Germany, as stalwart American allies, backed her up.\n\nI wish that were true.\n\nIn fact, the envoys from these three countries condemned Israel\u2019s plan to take on the Hamas forces still controlling Gaza City, asserting that such action will \u201cworsen an already catastrophic situation.\u201d\n\nSo they proposed an alternative approach.\n\nI wish that were true too.\n\nAbout 20 Israeli hostages are believed to be still surviving, most likely in the subterranean fortress Hamas built with money and material provided by the \u201cinternational donor community.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for freeing them, Israel has been offering, through U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, to release thousands of convicted terrorists from Israeli prisons and guarantee safe passage out of Gaza to Hamas leaders who want to leave.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio last week noted: \u201cThe talks with Hamas fell apart on the day [French President Emmanuel] Macron made the unilateral decision that he\u2019s going to recognize the Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain would recognize a Palestinian state in September unless a ceasefire is in place. Again, in Mr. Rubio\u2019s words: \u201cWell, if I\u2019m Hamas, I\u2019ve basically concluded let\u2019s not do a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nAlso last week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that his government was suspending \u201cany exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice.\u201d\n\nNo one doubts that the war Hamas began and refuses to end has brought terrible suffering to Gaza civilians.\n\nTo say Hamas leaders don\u2019t care would be incorrect. On the contrary, Hamas leaders want to give as many Gaza civilians as possible the gift of \u201cmartyrdom\u201d in the jihad they are waging against a nation they regard as an outpost of a despised civilization with roots in ancient Athens, Rome and Jerusalem.\n\nHamas is no longer a formidable military machine but only an insurgency that funds itself by stealing and selling food. The United Nations acknowledges that 88% of the aid it brings into Gaza is stolen by Hamas or other armed groups.\n\nStill, Hamas continues to wage an effective propaganda war. A key asset is its wholly owned subsidiary, the Gaza Health Ministry, which gives the media unsubstantiated casualty figures, never distinguishing between fighters and civilians and always adding the dubious claim that most casualties are \u201cwomen and children.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times, the BBC and other outlets recently featured a photo of what they identified as a starving Palestinian baby. It turns out the child suffers from a terrible genetic disease. That he was not a victim of famine was obvious because his healthy brother was standing nearby, but that boy was cropped from the published photo.\n\nHamas recently posted a video of one of the hostages kidnapped more than 22 months ago from Israel. Evyatar David, 24, as emaciated as an Auschwitz inmate, was shown digging his own grave in a Hamas tunnel.\n\nIn response, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said (or, rather, sent out his deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, to say) he was \u201cvery shocked.\u201d Remind me: What purpose does the United Nations serve?\n\nThe plan approved Friday by Israel\u2019s security Cabinet for taking control of Gaza City may necessitate moving roughly 1 million Gaza civilians out of likely combat areas to safe zones.\n\nFood aid is to be massively increased, and additional distribution centers are to be established and run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an unfairly maligned American-Israeli project.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set out the plan\u2019s goals: \u201cWe want to liberate ourselves and liberate the people of Gaza from the awful terror of Hamas in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free, and to pass it to civilian governance.\u201d\n\nIsraelis are divided over the wisdom of the plan. Many think they have reached a point of diminishing returns militarily and should strategically retreat to security buffer zones.\n\nWhat about Gaza residents? Are they divided? Or would most prefer that Hamas release the hostages and seek a truce \u2014 or at least resume negotiations that could lead to delaying Israel\u2019s Gaza City plan?\n\nGaza residents who say such things publicly are likely to be summarily executed, with the Hamas-obedient international media giving scant coverage to either their courageous dissent or their untimely deaths.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s position was clearly articulated by Vice President J.D. Vance last week: \u201cNumber one, we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack innocent Israeli civilians ever again, and we think that has to come through the eradication of Hamas. Second, the president has been very moved by these terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, so we want to make sure that we solve that problem.\u201d\n\nI wish Germany, France and Britain were saying the same.\n\nThey are adamant that President Trump work with them to support Ukraine, a fledgling European democracy defending itself against a revanchist dictator. Does it not follow, as a matter of principle and self-interest, that they ought to work with Mr. Trump to support a mature Middle Eastern democracy defending itself against a terrorist proxy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose goal is openly and even proudly genocidal?\n\nI wonder whether Messrs. Merz, Starmer and Macron understand how tough they are making it for Atlanticists like me to push back against the growing number of Americans who regard West Europeans as fair-weather friends, always there for us when they need us.\n\u2022 Clifford D.
