  "content": "When A Used Diesel Truck With 200k Miles Might Be A Good Deal\n\nBuying a used vehicle is almost always a complicated and multifaceted experience. On one hand, searching for a new ride, and planning for all of the ways you'll use the car and personalize it can be immensely enjoyable. However, on the other hand, meeting sellers, inspecting, and test-driving a vehicle that's foreign to you, and haggling over prices can all be highly stressful activities. Those steps can become even more stressful if you're an automotive novice or looking for a vehicle type that you're unfamiliar with, like a high-performance sports car or a diesel truck. Shopping for diesel trucks, in particular, can be intimidating, due to the differences between gas and diesel engines and the fact that many people aren't experienced with diesel vehicles. Although gas and diesel engines share many similarities, diesels do come with a handful of different requirements, and some of your preconceived notions about shopping for a used vehicle may not apply when buying a diesel truck. For example, it's common for people to warn shoppers about used cars with high mileage. However, what constitutes high mileage can differ, especially in the case of diesels. Gas engines are typically considered to have high mileage once they've logged between 75,000 and 100,000 miles. In comparison, diesel vehicles can last much longer, and it's not odd to see used diesel trucks with well over 200,000 miles. However, just because a used truck has a diesel engine doesn't mean that you should ignore the mileage. If you're wondering how to determine when a used diesel truck with over 200,000 miles could be a good deal, stick around. As a former professional mechanic who has performed innumerable pre-purchase inspections on gas and diesel vehicles, I'll shed some light on the matter.\n\nWhen you have evidence that the truck was maintained properly When it comes to shopping for a used diesel truck, mileage only tells one part of the story. While it's important to check the odometer, it's arguably even more critical to investigate the vehicle's maintenance history and past use. One of the first things you should ask the seller when checking out a used diesel truck is if you can see the maintenance records. These documents can provide you with a detailed look into the truck's past and help you understand whether the previous owner cared for the vehicle properly. Ideally, the seller will be able to provide you with comprehensive documentation from reputable repair shops or dealerships that demonstrates years of proper care and maintenance. These documents should include things like routine oil changes and other fluid services, brake replacements, belt services, suspension maintenance, and more. Regular maintenance is one of the most efficient ways to keep a vehicle running smoothly, even with high mileage. If the owner cannot provide maintenance records, it's not an immediate sign that the truck is a bad deal. However, it could be a red flag, as you won't have any way to prove that the vehicle has been maintained properly. In addition to asking to see maintenance records, it's also vital that you ask about the truck's past use. Not all mileage is the same, and there can be substantial differences in the condition of a truck that was used for extensive highway driving and one used as a daily driver or abused as a work vehicle. It's important that you take the truck's past into consideration and that you use that information along with maintenance records to gauge the vehicle's condition.\n\nWhen the truck is in overall solid condition and the price is right Once you've investigated a used diesel truck's maintenance records and past use, you can take that information and compare it to what you learn from performing a physical inspection of the vehicle. This inspection process is one of the most critical parts of buying any used vehicle. It allows you to get a first-hand look at the truck, and there are a number of things you should check. You can start by inspecting the truck's interior, but don't spend too much time there, unless the cabin is in especially poor condition \u2014 a poorly maintained interior could be a strong sign that the previous owner didn't care for the vehicle properly, and it could be a major red flag. Next, pop the hood and check out the entire engine bay. Among the things you should inspect are the engine oil level and condition along with all other fluids, the belts, hoses, engine air filter, electrical connections, battery terminals, brake master cylinder and fluid lines, steering components, strut mounts, and more. From there, you can move on to checking the tires, brakes, body, and undercarriage. Look for signs of extensive rust and corrosion, as well as things like uneven tire wear, damaged brake components, and fluid leaks. Finally, you should test drive the truck to see how it runs, shifts, and handles. Take everything you learned from the previous steps and compare it to the truck's overall condition and the seller's asking price. If all of those factors align, then the vehicle could be a great deal, even with 200,000 miles.",

      "text": "Used Diesel Truck Checklist: 5 Things To Look For Before You Buy\nBuying a new vehicle can be a fun and exciting experience. However, it can also pose a lot of stressors and challenges. That's especially true when it comes to buying a used car, as used vehicles can come with hidden mechanical defects, and they may not be covered by a warranty or guarantee. All of those challenges can become even more imposing if you're looking for a used diesel truck. That's because diesel vehicles are distinct from gas cars in various ways, and if you're not an expert, there are several things you may overlook when shopping for a used diesel pickup.\nFor one, diesels are often subject to different regulations regarding emissions than are gas-powered vehicles. Diesel trucks also see a lot of use as work vehicles, meaning it's not uncommon for diesel pickups to have high mileage and other symptoms of years spent hauling heavy loads or pushing plows. Due to these factors and various others, shopping for a used diesel truck can be arduous, to say the least.\nFortunately, we can help with that. As a former professional auto repair technician who has worked on thousands of diesel trucks, I'll share some tips and tricks for buying one used. Remember, there are various differences between gas and diesel vehicles. While the buying process can be similar, there are also a few extra precautions you should take when searching for a diesel truck, which is exactly what we'll explore together in this article. So, from understanding the mileage to checking for illegal modifications, here are five things to look for before you buy a used diesel truck.\nCheck the mileage\nOne of the first things you should look for in a used diesel truck is the mileage. That may seem obvious, as most people are aware of the importance of a vehicle's mileage. However, it's worth mentioning specifically for diesels because what we consider high mileage for diesel vehicles isn't always the same as for gas cars.\nWhen it comes to gasoline engines, 75,000 to 100,000 miles is the standard threshold for what's considered \"high mileage.\" In fact, that's usually when manufacturers and experts recommend that drivers begin using high mileage engine oil. However, diesel engines are often more efficient than gas engines, and it's not uncommon for diesel vehicles to exceed 200,000 to 300,000 miles. It's important to consider these differences, because many people will look at a gas engine with 150,000 miles and will move to the next option. When it comes to diesel trucks, 150,000 miles isn't always that much \u2014 it does depend on other factors, though, which is what we'll explain now.\nWhen you're shopping for a used diesel, it's vital that you ask about the vehicle's history. That's because there can be a big difference between a work truck with 100,000 miles and any other personal vehicle with the same mileage. It's also worth remembering that diesel trucks \u2014 especially if they're used as work trucks \u2014 are often left idling for extended periods, which won't rack up mileage on the odometer, but will still lead to wear and tear. Ask to see maintenance records and about the type of work the truck performed. Doing so will help you determine if the truck was well-treated or used and abused.\nLook out for illegal or improperly-installed modifications\nRemember how we said diesel vehicles are often subject to different rules and regulations regarding emissions? That leads us into our next point: keep an eye out for illegal or improperly-installed modifications. That rule applies to all cars, but it's especially important when it comes to shopping for a used diesel truck due to the frequency with which people remove, modify, or delete diesel emissions control systems.\nOne of the most common mods you're likely to encounter on a used diesel truck is a straight pipe exhaust system. As the name implies, a straight pipe exhaust system is essentially a straight pipe running from the engine's exhaust manifold to wherever the previous owner decided to chop it off. The defining features of these systems include missing catalytic converters and mufflers and extremely loud performance. Many enthusiasts favor these mods due to that enhanced exhaust sound as well as the small horsepower boosts that they can provide.\nHowever, removing the catalytic converter from a diesel truck \u2014 or any other vehicle \u2014 is illegal, not to mention extremely harmful to the environment. Considering it's such a common mod, you should definitely check for a straight pipe system when looking for a used diesel truck. Signs of a straight pipe system can include a very loud exhaust, excessive smoke, and an exhaust pipe jutting out from the side of the truck.\nBesides straight pipe exhaust systems, you'll also want to look out for other illegal modifications, like diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) system deletes, as well as improperly installed legal ones. Things like performance chips, air intake systems, and suspension upgrades are legal in most places. However, not everyone installs these parts correctly, which can lead to mechanical defects and performance issues.\nCheck for rust, corrosion, and excessive wear and tear\nThe next thing you need to look out for when buying a used diesel truck is excessive rust, corrosion, and wear. This is true for all vehicles, but it's especially important for diesel trucks that have been used for work or that have seen a lot of use in areas with harsh winters or humid summers. Most people are aware of the fact that local weather plays a large role in whether a car develops rust and corrosion. That's because things like humidity, ice, and road salt all contribute to the development of corrosion and damage over time.\nMany people who live in areas that experience this type of weather don't have time to constantly wash their cars all winter long, which means that all of that salt and grime often sits on metal components for months at a time. While one severe winter is unlikely to cause large amounts of rust to form, several years' worth of heavy winters can contribute to a lot of corrosion. These factors are intensified in the case of work trucks. It's common for diesel pickups to be used as snow plows and other service vehicles. These rigs see huge amounts of use during a season, and they can develop corrosion and stress damage more quickly than a daily driver used to commute to and from the office.\nIt's important that you inspect the vehicle thoroughly to look for things like rust and damage. It's especially critical that you check the frame rails and suspension system, as these parts are some of the most likely to be affected by things like snow, humidity, salt, and heavy workloads.\nInspect the fluids\nIt probably goes without saying that you should be checking the fluids any time you're looking for a used car. However, it's worth going into a bit more detail here, due to a couple of differences between gas and diesel engines.\nFirst of all, used diesel engine oil is typically pitch black. That's worth mentioning because the standard engine oil used in gasoline motors very rarely reaches such a dark tone \u2014 if it does, it's usually a sign that the vehicle has gone way too long without a replacement or there are other issues at play. However, in diesel engines, the dark color is totally normal, thanks to the soot that these engines produce while burning. Remember this when inspecting the engine bay \u2014 while extremely dark oil is usually a red flag for gas vehicles, it's perfectly normal for a diesel engine.\nNext, it's important to remember that, if you're shopping for a newer used diesel truck, you'll need to check the DEF system. That means any diesel built from 2010 onward should have the system in place. We already mentioned that it's vital that you check to ensure that the system has not been tampered with or removed, but it's also critical that you inspect the fluid level and condition. That's because running out of DEF can be catastrophic for your engine. Some of the first symptoms of an empty DEF tank can include things like reduced performance and exhaust clogs, and it can cause the vehicle to enter limp mode. If you don't address those issues in a timely fashion, the engine is liable to develop worse and worse problems, meaning you should always check the DEF system before purchasing a used diesel truck.\nTake it for a test drive\nAnother thing that many people may overlook when buying a used vehicle is the test drive. However, the test drive is arguably one of the most important parts of shopping for a new car, whether it's used or not, and it's something that you absolutely cannot skip.\nThat's because the test drive is not only your chance to determine whether the vehicle is comfortable and enjoyable to drive for you personally \u2014 it's also a fantastic opportunity to identify mechanical malfunctions and other problems. The test drive is the culmination of the inspection process. It's the time when you can take all of the knowledge you've gained from inspecting the vehicle physically and compare it against the truck's handling, sound, comfort, and more.\nDuring the test drive, you'll want to stay alert for any abnormal sounds, like clunking, grinding, whining, or knocking. You'll also need to pay close attention to how the vehicle handles. That doesn't just mean driving the truck to determine whether it's comfortable for you, either. It also means feeling for things like vibrations in the steering wheel and brake pedal, lurches in the transmission, and various other strange sensations. The test drive is especially important if you're buying a heavily-used work truck to identify obvious issues, and it's an absolutely essential part of any diesel truck buying process."

      "text": "5 Mechanic-Approved Tips For Buying A Used Car\nBuying a used car can be like walking blindfolded into the ocean \u2014 it's hard to know if you're going to be able to float along peacefully or if you're about to be eaten by sharks. This is true whether you're buying from a private party or used car dealer, but there are a few things you can do before trading money for keys and a title that can help ensure you're getting a bargain and not a rotting lemon. In my 53 years, I have only owned three new cars: a 1994 Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and two early 2000s Volkswagen's. All of the other dozen or so vehicles I have purchased were at least 15 years old and had upwards of 100,000 miles on the odometer.\nSeveral of those were classic Jeeps bought with an awareness of known issues and the intention to restore them to their former glory, but most of those older vehicles were purchased to use as daily drivers. My confidence in buying older vehicles comes from my training and experience as an auto mechanic, a job I held for a few years spanning my '20s and '30s. Since then, I have continued to work on my own cars and those of friends, and I operated a mobile auto repair business for a few years as a side gig. Drawing from that experience, I offer you these tips to keep in mind when buying a used car.\nLook for rust in critical areas\nA big enemy of older cars is rust. A little surface rust is to be expected on older cars, but the oxidation of metal components can lead to costly repairs down the line, especially in certain spots. There are several ways to protect a car from rust, but slowing rust in progress or repairing existing rust damage is more difficult. Floor pans and rocker panels (the area beneath a car's doors) are especially prone to damage from rust. Pull up floor mats and peel carpeting back from the door sills and footwells if possible to check for hidden rust in those locations.\nBe especially mindful of obvious signs of rust repair: body filler around the fender wells, welded-in replacement floor or trunk panels, and mismatched paint. Carefully inspect the mounting points for the car's shocks and struts, which are different in design but perform the same function. These locations are prone to rust on many vehicles and usually require significant cutting, fabrication, and welding to repair properly. Floor or trunk pans are a simpler repair, but still require some welding. Inspect these locations from the inside of the car, and crawl underneath and check from below. If any of these spots are rusted through, it's probably best to walk away and find another vehicle.\nCheck for signs of water leaks\nRusted shock towers and body panels aren't the only places you should check for water damage when looking at a used car. Inspect the rubber seals around the doors, windows, trunk/hatchback, and sunroof if present. Sunroof drains can become clogged with leaves and dirt and back up with rainwater that leaks into the passenger compartment. The weatherstripping in all of these locations is subject to dry rot over time, which also leads to water leaks. A careful visual inspection should reveal places where the weather sealing has deteriorated to the point where it no longer works adequately, but there's a simple and thorough test you can do that only costs a few dollars.\nIf the seller permits it, take the car through a car wash and inspect the area around the doors, windows, and trunk or hatchback lid for water intrusion. Water leaks can lead to mold growth under the carpet, which is potentially hazardous to your health. Mold cleanup and carpet replacement is a tedious and potentially expensive job as well.\nInspect the frame for cracks or other damage\nBefore you even take a test drive in a car you're looking at, crawl underneath and inspect the frame for signs of damage. If you see any visible cracks, bid the seller good luck and farewell. You should also look for signs of prior repairs like welded-in frame segments, patch panels, or seams. Bring along a tape measure and check to see if the frame is square all around. Some surface rust is usually ok, but poke any rusty spots with a screwdriver or pocket knife to make sure the frame isn't rotted through.\nA bent frame can be a sign that a car has been in a previous accident, and frame repairs can be tricky and expensive. You should also be wary of a frame that looks too clean; fresh paint or coating can be a way to mask damage or previous repairs.\nLook high and low for signs of oil and coolant leaks\nThere are a few places on and around a car's engine you should check for coolant and oil leaks, both of which can lead to costly repairs down the road. Pay particular attention to valve covers (shown in the photo above) and head gaskets, where the cylinder heads meet the engine block. You can usually identify an oil leak by the accumulation of grime where oil is escaping from a mating surface. Oil pans and rear main seals (where the back of the crankshaft connects to the transmission) are also common points where oil can leak from the engine. Rear main seal repairs are especially costly, usually requiring the removal of the engine or transmission.\nCarefully inspect the radiator hoses, thermostat housing, and overflow reservoir for coolant leaks, which can lead to catastrophic damage from an overheated engine. There are two paths you can take if you discover a potentially problematic oil or coolant leak. You can try and estimate the cost of repairing the issue and negotiate a reduction in price, or simply find another potential purchase without these looming headaches.\nCheck the axles and brakes for wear\nAnother critical area you'll want to inspect carefully is a car's axles and brake components. If possible, jack up the car and grab each wheel at nine and three o'clock and try to wiggle the wheel back and forth. Repeat the test with your hands at 12 and six o'clock. Any excess play can indicate worn wheel bearings, tie rod ends, or other suspension components. Any of these conditions can be potentially dangerous; if a wheel bearing seizes, the wheel can come off the car at high speed.\nAt the very least, worn ball joints or tie rod ends will affect your ability to steer a car precisely, and ball joint failure can also result in the dangerous loss of a wheel. You should visually inspect the rubber boots around the tie rod ends, ball joints, and constant velocity joints for damage which can lead to the loss of lubricating grease and failure of these parts. Like with oil leaks, escaping grease will accumulate road dirt and other debris, making leaks easier to spot.\nIf possible, remove the wheels and check for wear on the brake pads and rotors. Have the seller or a friend push the brake pedal while you inspect the calipers to make sure they're moving freely in both directions and check for leaks at the wheel cylinders. Brake repairs aren't especially expensive, but poorly functioning brakes are dangerous and can be a sign that the vehicle has been neglected."

      "text": "How To Read Your Car's Oil Level On A Dipstick\nEngine oil is crucial to keep your car running smoothly, and while your engine isn't supposed to consume oil like it uses up fuel, you still tend to lose some of it as you use your vehicle daily. So, to ensure that you're not running out of this important lubricating fluid, you must check your car's engine oil level occasionally. Checking the oil level of your car is also one of the first things you should do if you're looking for the reason why your low engine oil pressure warning light turns on on your instrument panel.\nUnfortunately, unlike the fuel tank, most cars do not have an oil gauge inside the cabin. Instead, you have to go to the engine bay and find the oil level dipstick in your car to check how much engine you have left. So, if you haven't done that before, here's a step-by-step guide on how to read your car's engine oil level and find out if you still have enough oil to keep it running or if it's time to change the oil in your car.\nMake sure your car's turned off and cool\nWhen you're checking your car's engine oil, you have to ensure that it's turned off and cool. The primary reason for this is that engines are hot and dangerous when they're running, and you don't want to get caught or burned in the engine bay when getting to the dip stick. Furthermore, a running engine will have oil circulating throughout it, meaning you will not get an accurate reading of the amount of engine oil in the oil pan.\nAnother thing that many forget but is crucial for getting the correct oil level reading is to park your car on level ground. Parking on an incline means that the oil can pool on either side of your engine oil pan, which could lead to an inaccurate oil reading. While too little oil is bad, overfilling your engine with oil could also cause some damage, like excessive engine oil pressure leading to oil leaks or your engine burning oil alongside fuel in the combustion chamber.\nFind your engine oil dipstick\nWhen your car is turned off and the engine has cooled down somewhat, it's time to look for the engine oil dipstick. This dipstick is a long, thin metal strip with some markings at the end to show your car's oil levels. Note that some engines might have multiple dipsticks, so the first one that you see might not be the correct one for your engine oil. Depending on your car model, it might also have transmission and power steering fluids that need occasional top ups.\nEngine oil dipsticks are often attached to a yellow handle in your engine bay, with some manufacturers adding an oil logo to make it easier to find. If you can't find your engine oil dipstick at first glance or if you're unsure if you're holding the correct dipstick, you can always refer to your car's manual. This will show where the dipstick is located and tell you how much oil you should have left to safely use your car.\nHave a rag ready to wipe it clean\nBefore pulling your dipstick, always have a rag ready to clean the area around the dipstick area and the dipstick itself. Car engine bays are often dusty and dirty, so you want to ensure that nothing contaminates your engine oil while you're reading it. It's wise to clean up the area around the dipstick before pulling it out. If you have the time, a quick wipe of your engine cover would also help keep your working area clean and prevent dust from getting on your hands.\nAfter doing that, you can pull out the dipstick, but what you see is often not the correct oil reading. Since the dipstick lives inside the engine, oil can splash and travel up the stick when you're driving. To ensure you're getting an accurate report of your oil levels, you should wipe the dipstick clean after pulling it out the first time, fully stick it back in, and then pull it out again. After you do that, you should see the actual amount of oil remaining in your engine's oil pan.\nChecking your car's oil level\nMarkings on engine dipsticks vary. Some label two spots as \"full\" and \"low, while others have three or four unlabeled markings, which tell you how much oil is left in your engine. The oil level in your engine should always fall between the first and last markings to ensure that you have a safe amount of oil.\nIf the oil level falls near or below the lowest marking, then you have too little oil in your engine and should refill it with the correct engine oil classification. If the dipstick shows a reading somewhere in the middle, you can still choose to top the oil off. On the other hand, if the oil level is above the highest mark, your engine is overfilled with oil, so you should drain it a bit to prevent engine problems.\nIt's wise to consistently check your car's engine oil levels once a month, especially if it's getting old, and you should definitely check its level before embarking on a long road trip. That way, you can catch any issues before they become bigger problems and avoid getting stuck on the road.\nDon't forget to look at the color and viscosity of your oil\nAside from checking your engine oil levels, you should also look at the color and viscosity of your engine oil to see if it's still good enough to use or if you need to change it. Besides that, the color of your engine oil can tell you a lot of things. Fresh engine oil should be amber or yellow in color and look like freshly melted butter; it should also flow a bit and look like it's easy to pour. If your engine oil looks more orange or light brown, it signifies that it's already been used for a few miles but should still be good to go for a few more. However, you should consider scheduling your next oil change already in a few months' time.\nIf your engine oil is dark brown or black, like the photo of the engine oil in my car above, you should change it as soon as possible. Since I last had my oil changed almost six months ago, it's about time to change it.
