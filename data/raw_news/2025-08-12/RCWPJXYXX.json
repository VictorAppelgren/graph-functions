All dollar amounts in this press release are in U.S. dollars. Frederick H. Earnest, President and CEO of Vista, said, \"During the second quarter, we maintained a strong balance sheet and advanced the 15,000 tonnes per day Mt Todd Feasibility Study.

We are very pleased with the strong economic results, reduced initial capital, increased gold mineral reserves grade, and stable gold production over many years. The Feasibility Study represents a major milestone for Vista, highlighting a strategic shift toward a smaller initial scale, near-term development opportunity at Mt Todd while preserving optionality for expansion. As we continue to build on Mt Todd\u2019s strengths as a leading development opportunity within the gold sector, our immediate focus is on increasing awareness of the value of Mt Todd and pursuing the best path to deliver value for our shareholders.\" For more information on the 2025 Mt Todd Feasibility Study, please see news release.
