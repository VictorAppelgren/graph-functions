  "title": "Ford to invest $2B in Louisville Assembly Plant for new EV. What that means for workers",
  "description": "The $2B Ford investment promises to create a new Universal EV Platform for assembly, bring a new four-door midsize truck EV to Louisville.",
  "content": "Ford Motor Co. continues to select Kentucky for its newest investments.\n\nJust four months after Ford launched the 2025 Expedition from the Kentucky Truck Plant, Ford CEO Jim Farley was back in Louisville on Aug. 11 to announce a $2 billion investment into the smaller Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road.\n\nThe investment promises to create a new Universal EV Platform for assembly, bring a new four-door midsize truck EV, and secure 2,200 hourly jobs at the factory, a reduction of about 600 current employees. Workers at LAP are not expected to be laid off. Some workers will be eligible for a buyout, while others may look at a plant transfer to places such as at Kentucky Truck Plant.\n\n\"We have plenty of jobs for people,\" Farley said when asked about the reduction in workforce at LAP as part of $2 billion announcement.\n\nThis will be the first time in LAP's history that the plant will produce an electric vehicle and the truck is expected to be available for consumers in 2027, with an anticipated starting price of $30,000.\n\n\"The new pickup built here in Louisville is going to cure a lot of problems, like all those generic two row crossovers that dominate our industry,\" Farley said.\n\nFor the past three years, Ford has had a team working on the creation of a new, smaller and more affordable EV product to bring to consumers. This new EV and assembly process stemming from the Aug. 11 announcement is what Doug Field, chief EV digital and design officer at Ford, equated to a combination of \"the innovation of the startups, Tesla and Rivian with the ... storied history of Ford.\"\n\nAnd as the EV unit of the company has continued to struggle, reporting billions of dollars lost in the second quarter of 2025, Ford is ready to bet on Kentucky to make its next generation EVs.\n\nMore: Ford announces $5B investment, 4,000 new EV jobs, with Louisville to produce new EV truck\n\n\"There are no guarantees with this project,\" Farley said from inside LAP on Aug. 11. \"We're doing so many new things, I can't tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right. It is a bet. There is a risk.\"\n\nWill Ford close LAP to prepare for EV production?\n\nAs part of the $2 billion investment into LAP, Ford will transform the facility from running an assembly line to, instead, using what the company has called an \"assembly tree.\"\n\nThis new model of vehicle assembly will feature the new Ford Universal EV Production System and rather than a vehicle being assembled in a straight line from start to finish, the vehicle will be assembled in three parts, front, middle and rear, and will converge at the end to be put into one complete product.\n\nBryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said two key benefits from this change in how production will be done is that it reduces the amount of parts needed to assemble a vehicle and it makes the job more ergonomic and safer for workers.\n\nThe Louisville Assembly Plant will conclude the production of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair later in 2025 as those products' lifecycles come to an end.\n\nThe plant will then need to be stripped and retooled to be ready to produce the yet to be named EV truck. Currie said a plant retooling on average takes about 10 months to a year and during this time, LAP workers will go on temporary layoff status. Some workers may be able to work at the Kentucky Truck Plant while LAP is down.\n\nAdditionally, Ford plans to build up a stock of Escape and Corsair vehicles to be able to sell through the next 18 months or so as it gears up to produce the new EV truck.\n\nMore: Ford announces launch of new electric vehicle, investments in Kentucky and Michigan\n\nWorkers will be trained for EV production via a combinination of virtual reality and real life training, Currie said.\n\nWhy is Ford making an EV truck at LAP?\n\nIn 2023, as part of the negotiations with the UAW, the union and automaker struck a deal that some claimed put Louisville \"truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation,\" The Courier Journal reported in 2023.\n\nThe UAW and Ford agreed to pump major investments and changes into LAP following the end of the production lifecycle of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair in 2025.\n\nLAP was promised a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the 2023 contract and an \"all-new EV product.\" The announcement on Aug. 11 pushes that previously promised investment up to $2 billion.\n\nMore: Ford further pushes out production of 2 EVs to focus on affordability\n\nThe EV industry has sprouted up quickly across Kentucky, largely due to Ford's investment in the state. Todd Dunn, the president of UAW Local 862 which represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant where Super Duty's are made, previously said \"Kentucky is the new Michigan,\" due to the growth of the EV sector in the state.\n\nDunn and International UAW President Shawn Fain have previously shared excitement over maintaining a product commitment for LAP and job security for workers.\n\nWill the new EV truck battery be made at the BlueOval park in Glendale?\n\nNo. The batteries, a prismatic LFP battery, will be made in Michigan at a battery plant expected to start production in 2026. Ford executives told The Courier Journal the decision to make the batteries in Michigan rather than at the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale was \"just a question of scale\" and noted that the production of batteries in Michigan for a Louisville vehicle does not replace the company's need for other battery production plants.\n\nLAP first opened in the metro in 1955, assembling trucks. By 1987, truck production had moved across town to KTP and LAP received a $260 million expansion and began producing the Bronco II. Just a few years later in 1990, the Ford Explorer rolled off the line at LAP, and the plant would assemble this SUV and enjoy success for the next decade with sales peaking at 445,157 in 2000.\n\nIn 2007, LAP was on the shortlist to be closed as Explorer sales decreased and rising gas prices impacted consumer buying habits. Later that year, the UAW agreed to a new contract with Ford that provided a commitment to keep LAP open.\n\nExplorer production would eventually cease in 2010 and LAP saw a massive $631 million plant renovation. The next year, LAP reopened producing the Escape and by 2013, added production of the compact Lincoln crossover.\n\nBy the fall of 2018, Ford started to see a decrease in sales of the once-popular Escape, as competition from other brands in the compact SUV market grew. That same year also saw Ford move 550 jobs from LAP across town to KTP, as the demand for the Super Duty and other large SUV products continued to grow.\n\nIn 2019, Ford invested $550 million into LAP in preparation for the relaunch of the Escape, the Courier Journal previously reported. That year, the company also announced it would build the 2020 Lincoln Corsair, a compact SUV, at LAP.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Ford, like many businesses, saw plant closures and other points of infliction such as workers inside plants testing positive for COVID-19 as the company tried to continue producing vehicles while maintaining safety. In early 2021, as the pandemic continued to cause supply chain chaos, LAP saw work stoppages several times, delaying vehicle production.\n\nIn 2023, LAP once again experienced an extended temporary work stoppage fueled by quality control issues with the 2023-model Escape. Nearly 3,200 Ford assembly line workers were out of work for roughly four weeks, and vehicles were not produced during that time period as the company worked to fix a software issue.\n\nOn Aug. 11, Ford declared that LAP would secure 2,200 jobs and transform the first facility in the automakers portfolio to the new assembly tree model as the home to the new Universal EV Production System.\n\nDespite the plant's rocky past, LAP is poised to become a future leader in EV production for Ford.\n\n\"After decades of rumors about the future of LAP, today, the news harrived, jobs will be here in this plant in Kentucky for generations to come,\" Gov. Andy Beshear said at LAP on Aug. 11.\n\nMore: How long can Ford and carmakers hold off on bigger price hikes due to tariffs?\n\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter at @oliviamevans_.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Ford is investing $2B in LAP for new EV.

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. to invest $550M in Louisville plants ahead of Escape's relaunch\nAmid anxiety about a global recession, slowing vehicles sales and looming job cuts, Ford Motor Co. delivered some good news to Louisville workers Thursday \u2014 a $550 million investment in its local factories and plans to retain union jobs.\nMost of the spending will go toward upgrading and modernizing the Louisville Assembly Plant on Fern Valley Road as the automaker prepares to release its revamped Escape and Lincoln Corsair models.\nNo new jobs are part of the deal, according to the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority, which granted $40 million in tax incentives in return for the planned spending and a promise to retain 800 full-time workers for at least three years.\nFord promised to plow more than $2 billion into retooling and upgrading its Louisville factories nearly four years ago when it sealed a new United Auto Workers contract.\nBut most of the attention has been focused on the Kentucky Truck Plant on Chamberlain Lane, where more than $900 million has paid for new robotic riveting and other advanced equipment to build aluminum alloy bodies for Super Duty pickups and SUVs.\nRelated: Louisville Ford workers vote to authorize strike if needed, union leaders say\nThe $550 million includes $15 million in new construction at the plants as well as $535 million in equipment and installation costs.\nFord released a statement saying it \"builds more vehicles in the U.S. and employs more hourly workers in the U.S. than any other automaker \u2014 and we'd like to keep it that way. To do so, we must remain competitive.\"\nThe company said that it appreciates Kentucky and Louisville's \"strong support\" and that the incentives would help Ford remain competitive and support the 12,500-person local hourly workforce.\nThe Detroit automaker has been working on a new generation of the Escape, a popular compact SUV that it has relied on for sales. But the model has seen slipping sales in the last year amid aggressive competition.\nThe company's new investment involves several safety features for the luxury Corsair and the Escape, including an Escape hybrid and a plug-in electric hybrid, plus \"pre-collision assist\" capabilities, warnings for \"road departure\" and lane changes, and automatic emergency braking.\nMuch of that technology has become standard in newer high-end cars and SUVs.\nEarlier: Ford celebrates 50th anniversary of Kentucky Truck Plant\nLouisville Assembly has 3,800 hourly unionized workers, a force trimmed late last year when 500 assembly line employees were transferred to the Kentucky Truck Plant to support a 20% production increase for the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator.\nAt Louisville Assembly, Ford dropped one of its three shifts and indicated it would cut back production as it modified the plant and retooled for assembling the new models. The plant has been assembling cars and trucks there since the factory opened in 1955.\nSince the 2008 recession, the factory has gradually added workers and increased production of the Escape.\nUnder the finance authority's Jobs Retention Agreement, companies such as Ford, Toyota, GE Appliances and other large manufacturers can receive incentives for continuously upgrading and modernizing their facilities if they agree to maintain payroll levels for Kentucky residents.\nThe latest \"installment\" is the fifth for Ford since mid-2007, this time pledging to retain 12,070 jobs of full-time hourly Kentucky workers, an increase from 11,200 in the prior incentive package. Several hundred Hoosiers also work at the factories, so the full-time hourly employment count now is 12,100 plus an undisclosed number of temporary entry-level positions.\nThe 800 jobs already have been filled, but the company's extended package now requires the investment be made by the end of 2021.\nSee also: After year of controversy and turmoil, can Shaq help save Papa John's?\n\"Ford is a longtime pillar of employment in the greater Louisville area and we\u2019re thrilled the company is continuing to reinvest in its plants and retain its Kentucky workforce,\" agency spokesman Jack Mazurak said in an emailed statement.\n\"In addition to the tremendous economic impact of its two Louisville plants and their 12,000-plus direct jobs, Ford\u2019s supplier network supports thousands of additional Kentucky jobs,\" he said.\nIn recent years, automakers have scrambled to keep pace with an intensifying shift away from more traditional passenger vehicles, such as sedans and compact cars, toward SUVs, pickup trucks and crossovers.\nForbes Magazine has ranked Louisville among the top U.S. cities where manufacturing is thriving, and automotive-related employment and investment is a big part of the resurgence. The Louisville region's manufacturing-related jobs has grown by at least 30% since 2011.\nThat's significant because of the estimated multiplier effect of $1 spent spurring an additional $1.40 in economic activity.\nGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

      "text": "Ford to invest $2B in Louisville Assembly Plant for new EV. What that means for workers\n- Ford is investing $2 billion in its Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP) to produce a new electric midsize truck.\n- The investment will lead to the creation of a new Universal EV Platform and secure 2,200 jobs, though representing a reduction of about 600 current positions.\n- LAP will temporarily close for retooling to accommodate the new \"assembly tree\" production model.\n- The new EV truck is expected to be available in 2027 with a starting price of around $30,000.\nFord Motor Co. continues to select Kentucky for its newest investments.\nJust four months after Ford launched the 2025 Expedition from the Kentucky Truck Plant, Ford CEO Jim Farley was back in Louisville on Aug. 11 to announce a $2 billion investment into the smaller Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road.\nThe investment promises to create a new Universal EV Platform for assembly, bring a new four-door midsize truck EV, and secure 2,200 hourly jobs at the factory, a reduction of about 600 current employees. Workers at LAP are not expected to be laid off. Some workers will be eligible for a buyout, while others may look at a plant transfer to places such as at Kentucky Truck Plant.\n\"We have plenty of jobs for people,\" Farley said when asked about the reduction in workforce at LAP as part of $2 billion announcement.\nThis will be the first time in LAP's history that the plant will produce an electric vehicle and the truck is expected to be available for consumers in 2027, with an anticipated starting price of $30,000.\n\"The new pickup built here in Louisville is going to cure a lot of problems, like all those generic two row crossovers that dominate our industry,\" Farley said.\nFor the past three years, Ford has had a team working on the creation of a new, smaller and more affordable EV product to bring to consumers. This new EV and assembly process stemming from the Aug. 11 announcement is what Doug Field, chief EV digital and design officer at Ford, equated to a combination of \"the innovation of the startups, Tesla and Rivian with the ... storied history of Ford.\"\nAnd as the EV unit of the company has continued to struggle, reporting billions of dollars lost in the second quarter of 2025, Ford is ready to bet on Kentucky to make its next generation EVs.\n\"There are no guarantees with this project,\" Farley said from inside LAP on Aug. 11. \"We're doing so many new things, I can't tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right. It is a bet. There is a risk.\"\nWill Ford close LAP to prepare for EV production?\nTemporarily, yes.\nAs part of the $2 billion investment into LAP, Ford will transform the facility from running an assembly line to, instead, using what the company has called an \"assembly tree.\"\nThis new model of vehicle assembly will feature the new Ford Universal EV Production System and rather than a vehicle being assembled in a straight line from start to finish, the vehicle will be assembled in three parts, front, middle and rear, and will converge at the end to be put into one complete product.\nBryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said two key benefits from this change in how production will be done is that it reduces the amount of parts needed to assemble a vehicle and it makes the job more ergonomic and safer for workers.\nThe Louisville Assembly Plant will conclude the production of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair later in 2025 as those products' lifecycles come to an end.\nThe plant will then need to be stripped and retooled to be ready to produce the yet to be named EV truck. Currie said a plant retooling on average takes about 10 months to a year and during this time, LAP workers will go on temporary layoff status. Some workers may be able to work at the Kentucky Truck Plant while LAP is down.\nAdditionally, Ford plans to build up a stock of Escape and Corsair vehicles to be able to sell through the next 18 months or so as it gears up to produce the new EV truck.\nWorkers will be trained for EV production via a combinination of virtual reality and real life training, Currie said.\nWhy is Ford making an EV truck at LAP?\nIn 2023, as part of the negotiations with the UAW, the union and automaker struck a deal that some claimed put Louisville \"truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation,\" The Courier Journal reported in 2023.\nThe UAW and Ford agreed to pump major investments and changes into LAP following the end of the production lifecycle of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair in 2025.\nLAP was promised a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the 2023 contract and an \"all-new EV product.\" The announcement on Aug. 11 pushes that previously promised investment up to $2 billion.\nThe EV industry has sprouted up quickly across Kentucky, largely due to Ford's investment in the state. Todd Dunn, the president of UAW Local 862 which represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant where Super Duty's are made, previously said \"Kentucky is the new Michigan,\" due to the growth of the EV sector in the state.\nDunn and International UAW President Shawn Fain have previously shared excitement over maintaining a product commitment for LAP and job security for workers.\nWill the new EV truck battery be made at the BlueOval park in Glendale?\nNo. The batteries, a prismatic LFP battery, will be made in Michigan at a battery plant expected to start production in 2026. Ford executives told The Courier Journal the decision to make the batteries in Michigan rather than at the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale was \"just a question of scale\" and noted that the production of batteries in Michigan for a Louisville vehicle does not replace the company's need for other battery production plants.\nHistory of Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant\nLAP first opened in the metro in 1955, assembling trucks. By 1987, truck production had moved across town to KTP and LAP received a $260 million expansion and began producing the Bronco II. Just a few years later in 1990, the Ford Explorer rolled off the line at LAP, and the plant would assemble this SUV and enjoy success for the next decade with sales peaking at 445,157 in 2000.\nIn 2007, LAP was on the shortlist to be closed as Explorer sales decreased and rising gas prices impacted consumer buying habits. Later that year, the UAW agreed to a new contract with Ford that provided a commitment to keep LAP open.\nExplorer production would eventually cease in 2010 and LAP saw a massive $631 million plant renovation. The next year, LAP reopened producing the Escape and by 2013, added production of the compact Lincoln crossover.\nBy the fall of 2018, Ford started to see a decrease in sales of the once-popular Escape, as competition from other brands in the compact SUV market grew. That same year also saw Ford move 550 jobs from LAP across town to KTP, as the demand for the Super Duty and other large SUV products continued to grow.\nIn 2019, Ford invested $550 million into LAP in preparation for the relaunch of the Escape, the Courier Journal previously reported. That year, the company also announced it would build the 2020 Lincoln Corsair, a compact SUV, at LAP.\nDuring the pandemic, Ford, like many businesses, saw plant closures and other points of infliction such as workers inside plants testing positive for COVID-19 as the company tried to continue producing vehicles while maintaining safety. In early 2021, as the pandemic continued to cause supply chain chaos, LAP saw work stoppages several times, delaying vehicle production.\nIn 2023, LAP once again experienced an extended temporary work stoppage fueled by quality control issues with the 2023-model Escape. Nearly 3,200 Ford assembly line workers were out of work for roughly four weeks, and vehicles were not produced during that time period as the company worked to fix a software issue.\nOn Aug. 11, Ford declared that LAP would secure 2,200 jobs and transform the first facility in the automakers portfolio to the new assembly tree model as the home to the new Universal EV Production System.\nDespite the plant's rocky past, LAP is poised to become a future leader in EV production for Ford.\n\"After decades of rumors about the future of LAP, today, the news harrived, jobs will be here in this plant in Kentucky for generations to come,\" Gov. Andy Beshear said at LAP on Aug. 11.\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter at @oliviamevans_."

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. plant in Louisville may have to halt production again\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Fresh off a one-week shutdown, one of Louisville's Ford Motor Co. plants may be halting production for an additional two weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the supply chain.\nFord spokeswoman Kelli Felker confirmed to The Courier Journal on Tuesday that there is a tentative shutdown planned for the Louisville Assembly Plant for the weeks of Jan. 25 and Feb. 1. She declined to comment further.\nIf the shutdown takes place, roughly 3,900 hourly workers at the plant will be without regular pay for three of the first five weeks of the year. This follows planned annual downtime around the Christmas holiday at the end of last year.\nFord pumped the brakes on work at the Louisville facility last week to \"address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage,\" Felker previously told The Courier Journal. Workers headed back to the plant Tuesday.\nLouisville economy: Two iconic neighborhood diners say they're 'surviving' pandemic, but business is way down\nAs with the first shutdown, in the tentative two-week shutdown, UAW workers would receive roughly 75% of their regular pay, Felker confirmed Tuesday.\nUAW Local 862 President Todd Dunn told The Courier Journal Wednesday that employees had received a robocall last week about the shutdown and said it is likely, though he added there hasn't been official notification.\nWhen asked about the matter again on Wednesday, Felker said the shutdown is still tentative.\nThe Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is one of many automobile manufacturing giants, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen Group, to feel the pain of the slowdown of semiconductor production.\nSemiconductors, or chips, are integral in automobile automation, digital connectivity and security, among other things \u2014 powering items from brakes to windshield wipers. And as cars have continually modernized, the reliance on semiconductors also has increased.\nYet as car sales plummeted toward the start of the pandemic, autopart suppliers began to decrease their orders, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. And as these suppliers looked to increase inventory toward the end of the year, they struggled to obtain their desired amount from semiconductor manufacturers.\nOn Tuesday, Felker did not address an emailed question on whether the tentative shutdown relates to the global semiconductor shortage and what Ford is doing to address it.\nThe Louisville Assembly Plant produces the company's Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Truck Plant, off Chamberlain Lane, assembles the Super Duty pickup truck, the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator.\nFord has not halted production at the Kentucky Truck Plant so far this year.\nAlso see: Louisville car lot ending 75-year run as Cadillac dealer\nContact Ben Tobin at bjtobin@gannett.com and 502-377-5675 or follow on Twitter @Ben__Tobin."

      "text": "How long can Ford and carmakers hold off on bigger price hikes due to tariffs?\n- Ford CFO Sherry House said the industry can hold prices to a 1% increase through year-end.\n- Car buying experts expect to see prices rise greater than that by year-end.\n- Automakers reported taking big hits to profits due to tariffs.\nIt's been four months since President Donald Trump implemented 25% tariffs on all imported vehicles and auto parts, and carmakers have largely been able to offset the extra costs without having to pass it on to consumers \u2014 yet.\nHow long that trend can last depends on whom you ask.\nTerence Lau, dean of the College of Law at Syracuse University and former general counsel for Ford Motor Co.'s International Trade and Transactions practice group, put it this way: \"The Detroit 3 are being squeezed. The tariff on steel and aluminum, as well as on imported vehicles from their foreign subsidiaries, is hurting them deeply.\"\nIt's partly for that reason, experts predict consumers will pay more for new cars across all auto brands. Even if automakers don't substantially increase the manufacturer's suggested retail price, if they pull back on incentives, car buyers end up with higher payments.\nCox Automotive anticipates average transaction prices \u2014 the prices customers pay after trade-ins and discounts are applied to the MSRP \u2014 will rise 4% to 8% by year-end. J.D. Power has also predicted a 4% boost, or about $1,750 on average, will be added to the average transaction prices of 2026 model year vehicles rolling out later this year.\nDuring Ford's second quarter earnings announced July 30, CFO Sherry House said she has seen a 1% to 1.5% average increase to the prices automakers list their vehicles \u2014 called the MSRP \u2014 in retail car sales across the industry since tariffs took hold in April. She believes the auto industry can finish out the year without having to raise the list prices beyond that level.\n\"(Price increases) are probably a bit slower than we anticipated as (automakers) are using up inventory they have before turning to inventory that has higher tariffs on it,\" House said during a call with reporters. \"But we expect that these price increases, of about 1%, will probably hold as we finish out the balance of the year.\"\nA real head-scratcher\nHouse's estimate of the 1% to 1.5% increase on MSRPs across the industry since April is supported by data from Edmunds.com and Cox Automotive \u2014 leaving experts scratching their heads.\n\"That aligns with what we are seeing \u2014 at the consumer level, automakers are holding prices,\" said Mark Schirmer, Cox Automotive spokesman, in an email to the Detroit Free Press.\nBut he said because of the stable MSRPs and many automakers still offering discounts to keep shoppers coming to dealerships, profits are reduced.\nAt car shopping site Edmunds.com, Ivan Drury said his data also showed MSRP prices appear to be barely rising in any noticeable way since April.\n\"Although it seems so contrary to what 'should' have happened,\" as a result of tariffs, Drury, head of Insights at Edmunds.com, told the Free Press. \"Seems like we're still in a transitory stage.\"\nTariffs and high-income buyers drive up prices\nTransaction prices typically increase year-over-year by 3% to 4% as part of normal inflation, Schirmer said. But for the past two years, new-vehicle average transaction prices have been mostly flat or even lower year-over-year in some cases, he said.\nTherefore, any increase this year is going to feel like a lot and the expected hike in transaction prices will be the result of tariffs and market mix.\n\"Right now, high-income buyers are doing much better than low-income buyers, so they have not dropped out of market and that is shifting the mix of new vehicles sold, tilting it higher,\" Schirmer said. \"Thus, the average price paid for new vehicles in the U.S. is higher each month, because of tariffs and because this market is favoring the sale of higher-priced vehicles.\"\nCox has predicted that this might be the year that the industry sees a month with average transaction price topping $50,000.\n\"That is a real possibility,\" Schirmer said. \"Last December, prices were $49,000 \u2014 so even a modest increase in average transaction prices will get us there.\"\nData in Cars.com's recently released Industry Insight Report shows inventory trends that support that prediction. It reports that inventory for new cars priced under $30,000, of which 92% are imported, has shrunk for three consecutive months. But it said, \"In the $70,000-plus new car segment, the share of imported vehicles increased from 40% in May to 41% in June, suggesting automakers are adjusting for less price-sensitive consumers.\"\nTariff impact on the Detroit Three\nAt Ford, House said the company is managing its price increases on a vehicle-by-vehicle, segment-by-segment, basis. She said Ford studies \"all the cross-shopped vehicles and we make decisions based on that and how it\u2019s dynamically priced in the market. So we\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019ve handled it.\"\nStill, the Dearborn-based automaker reported on July 30 that it had $800 million in costs related to tariffs in the second quarter. Ford has said it has an advantage when it comes to tariffs because 80% of the cars it sells in the states are built here.\nYet, for the year, Ford expects tariffs to cost it $3 billion. House said Ford can bring that cost down by $1 billion through pricing on vehicles, production changes, how it brings in imported vehicles and parts and other measures. That puts Ford's estimated net tariff cost this year at $2 billion.\nGM, on the other hand, imports about 46% of the vehicles it sells here. The automaker reported Trump\u2019s ongoing automotive tariffs cost the company $1.1 billion in the second quarter and it expects tariffs to cost it $4 billion to $5 billion for all of 2025.\nStellantis reported a $2.6 billion net loss for the first half of 2025, a result the company attributed partly to the cost of tariffs. As an international company shipping vehicles and parts across the globe, Stellantis said it expects to lose approximately $1.7 billion from Trump's tariff policies this year.\nCar.com's Industry report said since January, the overall average new vehicle prices have increased by about $100 and U.S.-built vehicle prices are down nearly $200 on average. But imports from the United Kingdom, which accounts for just 1% of available inventory, had the most significant jump of more than $10,000, likely due to tariffs. Imports from Europe, which make up 5% of all inventory, rose by almost $2,500 per car. But many prices fell for vehicles from China, Canada, and South Korea.\nA snapshot of average MSRPs\nDrury pulled data for the average MSRP on all vehicles with at least 100 units of inventory to compare the average list prices in April with those in July.\nAt Ford, the Edmunds data showed the vehicle with the biggest percentage mark up in price was the Maverick pickup truck, going up 5.4% from $30,461 in April to $32,104 in July. The all-electric Mustang Mach E was next with a 4.2% hike going from an average list price of $42,229 in April to $43,993 in July.\nFord builds both those vehicles and the Bronco Sport in Mexico, so they are subject to the tariff \u2014 or tax Ford must pay on them when they cross the border. In May, Ford told its dealers prices on the Mach-E, Maverick pickup and Bronco Sport would increase by as much as $2,000 on some models. However, the data shows that the average sticker price on the Bronco Sport inched up by only 0.2% or $81 to $33,612 in July compared with April.\nThe Lincoln Nautilus, which Ford assembles in China, saw its April sticker price of $57,890 rise 1% or $580 to $58,470 in July.\nLooking across the rest of the Ford and Lincoln lineup, the average sticker prices for other models have increased by 1% or less. In some cases, prices have dropped. The average list price on a Lincoln Aviator is down 1.3% or $885 in July compared with what it was in April. A Ford Ranger's average list price tumbled by $1,328 or 3.2% to $39,895 in July versus April.\nHouse said in commercial vehicles, there is more pricing pressure, but at this point, \"we do think retail may hold given the tariff impact that all of the (automakers) are facing in the balance of the year. We\u2019re not providing anything beyond that point right now. In commercial, we expect it could continue to have pressure.\"\nThe average MSRPs for most other brands are similar to the shifts at Ford \u2014 some vehicles have seen big percentage price boosts since April, others have not.\nThe July sticker price for a Chevrolet Tahoe jumped 3% or $2,069 to $71,736 compared with April. But the sticker price on a Chevrolet Traverse is down 0.1% or $62 to $44,648 in July. GM builds both in the United States. It builds the Chevrolet Equinox in Mexico and the MSRP on it dropped by $250 to $30,728 in July, Edmunds data showed.\nThe Stellantis-made Jeep Gladiator, built in Ohio, had a July MSRP that was 2.5% or $1,131 higher than in April. But the Jeep Compass inched up by a mere 0.3% to $30,025 and it is made in Italy.\nThe issues automakers face\nBeyond the prices on the window sticker, there is the price a customer pays after trade-ins and negotiations: The transaction price.\nAccording to Schirmer at Cox Automotive, Ford's average transaction prices in June, the most recent data Cox has, are down by $1,216 compared with a year ago.\nLooking just at Ford, the average transaction price a car buyer paid in June 2024 was $55,662. In June this year, the average transaction price on a Ford vehicle was $54,446, Schirmer said.\nConversely, Ford's average MSRP in June this year was: $58,071, much higher than the transaction price. That's because Ford has been running big sales since April, including its \"From America, For America\" employee pricing for all that ended earlier this month.\n\"You can see the issue Ford is facing, like many other automakers: MSRPs are up a lot year-over-year. Average transaction prices are not,\" Schirmer said. \"In fact, Ford's average transaction price in this example is down. When MSRPs go higher (reflective of costs) and average transaction prices go lower (reflective of market), profits take a hit.\"\nWatch incentives, not just prices\nDrury said automakers raise MSRPs as the last resort knowing that consumers can absorb only so much before they leave the market altogether.\nHe speculates that many automakers might be holding off on more immediate price hikes to wait for 2026 model year launches and do it then. Or they could be holding off hoping for either tariff relief from the White House or for other automakers to make the first move.\n\"There is certainly no advantage to being the first mover in this case,\" Drury said.\nAs to how high prices can go before consumers leave the market depends on the vehicle and a person's pocketbook.\n\"On the sub-$40,000 cars, something like a 5% increase might go 'unnoticed.' But 10% ... might get some customers to balk,\" Drury said.\nDrury added, \"The upper price range vehicles like $50,000 and over might have more flexibility, but these are also the vehicles that customers could defect from either the brand or model as there are more options.\"\nDrury said as more of the 2026 models fill dealership lots toward the fall, \"maybe then (list) prices could see more movement.\"\nBut he noted a critical element to all of this is if carmakers start offering fewer incentives. In that case, the MSRP might not have to change much for carmakers to conserve cash and for car buyers it will still mean monthly payments will likely go up.\nJamie L.

      "text": "Here's why Ford isn't making as many vehicles in Louisville\nFord Motor Co. built 8,872 fewer Escape compact SUV's at its Louisville Assembly Plant last month compared with September last year, a 28 percent cut made in response to slowing consumer demand for its once hot-selling models.\nThe company also dialed back production of its higher-priced Lincoln MKC at the factory, cutting production by nearly 18 percent year over year in September and by more than 34 percent through the first nine months of the year.\n\"This is normal course of business for us. We match production to consumer demand, as we always do. During that month, we had one down week,\" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.\nNo changes in the workforce are envisioned for the sprawling factory on Fern Valley Road in South Louisville, Felker said.\nBut industry analysts caution that an overall drop in U.S. vehicle sales recently has put car and truck makers on edge and inevitably could lead to workforce cuts in selected plants. Ford reported an 11-percent drop in September sales, and blamed pent up demand after Hurricane Harvey last year in Houston and more weather-related hits from Hurricane Florence last month for a less-than-stellar comparison.\nThe bad news for the automaker and potentially for 4,400 hourly auto workers at LAP is that the Escape, assembled only in Louisville, competes in the hottest-selling vehicle segment. While sales overall continue to grow in compact SUVs, the Escape is losing traction with buyers.\nWhy? \"The Escape is very dated compared with its competitors,\" said Michelle Krebs, a spokeswoman and executive analyst with Cox Automotive, which tracks the industry.\nYou may like: Donald Trump's tariffs will cost Ford $1B, CEO Jim Hackett says\nEscape aren't moving as well because Ford has cut back on fleet sales. There's also the \"used factor\" when customers weigh buying a thee-year-old formerly leased Escape and a brand new SUV that looks the same. That depresses demand for the 2018's, Krebs said.\nDepending on the extras, new 2018s sell for $26,000 to $29,000, compared with a leased model with 32,000 miles. It's listed on local dealer websites for $16,000 to $17,000.\nThe automaker turned heads when it announced earlier this year that it's ditching passenger car production and going all in on trucks and SUV's. That's been controversial, she said.\n\"Ford is challenged right now. It's under a lot of scrutiny from Wall Street. Its stock price is down...because they haven't freshened their product lines.\"\nAlso, things aren't going to get any easier for the Escape because \"competition within the segment (and others) is expected to intensify as the pie no longer grows and the new models are introduced,\" Krebs said, noting that the segment's top seller, Toyota RAV4, also saw a sales dip in September.\nIn September 2017, Ford produced 31,778 Escapes at LAP, versus last month, when the output was cut to 22,906. Year to date through September, LAP turned out 284,826 units last year, compared with 236,292 this year \u2014 a 17-percent decline.\nLincoln MKC production is far more limited at the factory because of lower demand traditionally for the higher-priced model, which starts at $38,000. Some 3,736 Lincolns were assembled last month, compared with 4,546 in September of 2017. Year to date through September, production was trimmed from 43,571 to 28,452 this year.\nFord's Felker declined to forecast production plans during coming month, saying \"we don't discuss future product.\"\nTodd Dunn, president of United Auto Workers Local 862, which represents all hourly workers at both local Ford plants, said there's been no talk of layoffs that he's heard of, but \"it's always a concern when production drops off.\"\nLAP has felt the ups and downs of sometimes seasonal surges in sales as the U.S. auto industry has rebounded in the last decade. In summer 2015, when car and truck sales hit an historic high, Ford trimmed the usual two-week summer shutdown for equipment cleaning and re-tooling to one week at the Fern Valley plant.\nBut about 15 months later, Ford idled production there to compensate for an oversaturation of Escapes and MKC's on dealer lots.\nYou may like: Ford recalls 2 million F-150 trucks after seat belts caused fires\nGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

Ford will also be the first automaker to use prismatic LFP batteries to power EVs, which saves space and weight in the vehicles while also being more affordable than other batteries.\nSwitch Auto Insurance and Save Today!\nThe company is additionally using a new assembly line method that is expected to increase production speeds at the Louisville Assembly Plant by up to 40% when compared to the speed of production of the current Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, which are currently built on site.\nRecent investment announcements follow Ford losing $1.3 billion in the second quarter on the EV unit of the company and a further delay in the production of two EV products to 2028.\nFord in Kentucky: Ford announces $5B investment, 4,000 new EV jobs, with Louisville to produce new EV truck\nWhat is the new Ford electric vehicle?\nThe new EV vehicle is a midsize four-door pickup truck and will be \"as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost\" and have more passenger space than the competitor Toyota RAV4, Ford said. It will also feature a \"frunk\" or front trunk and have a truck bed, like several other EVs.\nWhere will the new EV truck be assembled?\nThe vehicle will be assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nHow much does the vehicle cost?\nThe truck will have a starting cost of around $30,000, The Courier Journal reported.\nPreviously: Ford further pushes out production of 2 EVs to focus on affordability\nWhen will the truck be available for purchase?\nThe truck is expected to be available to customers in the U.S. and overseas in 2027.\nFord EVs: How new UAW Ford agreement makes Louisville 'center of the universe' for electric vehicles\nHow much money is Ford investing in Kentucky?\nFord is investing $1.9 billion at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Gov. Andy Beshear said the investment is one of the largest economic development projects on record for Kentucky.\n\u201cThis announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky\u2019s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford\u2019s future,\" Beshear said. \"Thank you to Ford\u2019s leaders for their continued faith in Kentucky and our incredible workforce. Ford and Kentucky have been a tremendous team for more than 100 years, and that partnership has never been stronger than it is today.\u201d\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg also said the announcement is \"transformational\" and that the company has been \"part of the fabric\" of the city for more than a century.\n\u201cFord\u2019s decision to maintain a strong manufacturing presence here reaffirms that Louisville is the best place in America for manufacturing, we have momentum, and we look forward to building on this trusted partnership with Ford for generations to come,\" he said.\nPreviously: Ford will have 'Model-T moment' on Aug. 11, CEO Jim Farley says\nWill Ford announcement create new jobs in Louisville?

      "text": "Ford is boosting production at Louisville plant thanks to strong SUV sales\nCiting strong SUV sales, Ford Motor Co. announced Tuesday it will increase production by 20 percent starting this summer at its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.\nFord is moving 550 jobs from its Louisville Assembly Plant to the Kentucky Truck Plant\u2014 which assembles the Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Super Duty pickup.\nThat number is slightly higher than the 500 the Courier Journal reported in November.\nConsumer demand is fueling the changes, said John Savona, vice president of North American manufacturing for Ford.\nThe company said it saw retail sales of its Expedition increase 35 percent between 2017 and 2018. Navigator sales jumped 70 percent.\nRelated: Toyota to invest $238M, add Lexus and RAV4 hybrids at Kentucky plant\nAccording to Ford, production of Expeditions at the Kentucky Truck Plant grew from nearly 50,000 in 2017 to around 76,000 last year.\nNavigator production doubled in the same period to about 24,500.\nOn Tuesday, the company also unveiled a new \"Better Big\" marketing campaign, highlighting the Expedition's features, including second and third row legroom and a large sunroof.\nThe production increase is the second such effort related to customer demand for large SUVs, Savona said.\nEarly last year, the company announced a similar ramp-up along with a $25 million investment in the factory for manufacturing equipment updates, bringing its investment total to $925 million.\nThe Kentucky Truck Plant, on Chamberlain Lane in eastern Jefferson County, has about 8,100 hourly workers.\nFord spokeswoman Kelli Felker said part of last year's investment was the creation of a separate line for door assembly.\nPreviously: Cuts are coming to Louisville's Ford plants, but the impact is unclear\nEmployees needing to work on vehicle interiors would previously need to navigate around the large, open doors of the full-sized SUVs. By moving the doors to a separate assembly line, workers could keep up with the increased line speed, Felker said.\nThis year's production increase is made possible by last year's move, she said. The separate door line freed up physical space on the main assembly line, allowing Ford to add additional work stations \u2014 and workers \u2014 this year.\nThese workstations include pits and platforms, allowing more workers to operate in the same space.\nThe Louisville Assembly Plant, which is on Fern Valley Road near Interstate 65, makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC and has about 4,500 hourly employees. It will transition from a three-shift to a two-shift operation.\nThe employee shift is expected to start in April and be fully in place in July, following the traditional summer shutdown season.\nRead this: Truck manufacturer reveals plans for big warehouse in southwest Louisville\nReporter Matthew Glowicki can be reached at 502-582-4989 or mglowicki@courier-journal.com.

      "text": "After months of negotiations and a nearly six-week strike, Ford Motor Co. reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers, the union representing roughly 57,000 Ford workers nationwide.\nIn Kentucky, about 9,000 Ford UAW workers were on strike outside of the company's iconic Kentucky Truck Plant where the Super Duty truck is assembled for two weeks before a tentative agreement was reached on Oct. 25. Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, which represents 12,000 Ford workers at KTP, and the Louisville Assembly Plant, said the contract is estimated to be a $9 billion agreement over the course of its four-year national lifespan.\nKentuckians stand to reap the benefits of this new contract which promises $1.95 billion in product investments to KTP and LAP, the second largest contractual commitment in the agreement.\nBut Ford's reach in Kentucky doesn't stop there. The famed automaker has committed to producing an \"all new EV [electric vehicle] product\" at LAP, its joint venture battery park in Glendale, BlueOval SK, is on track for the first of the two plants to start production in 2025, and according to Dunn and Gov. Andy Beshear, the economic reach of Ford touches at least another 100,000 jobs across the state.\nIn other words, Ford is good for Kentucky's economy.\nLambert said Ford generates roughly $33.19 billion in economic output in Kentucky. This large sum is reflective of total generated revenues from Ford and the auto company's vendors and suppliers. Lambert also found that the government collects \"$1.3 billion in local, state, and federal taxes due to Ford\u2019s operations in Jefferson County.\"\n\"Those tax breaks [Ford] gets are paid for in the long term ... the tax benefits, specifically with these manufactures, almost always outweigh the cost,\" Lambert said. \"This state has always tried to work closely with Ford ... because you can still pick up other vendor and supplier businesses ... as long as these two plants are healthy and keep going.\"\nKentucky, home to the largest concentration of hourly Ford employees in the U.S. outside of Michigan, is set to emerge not only as a leader for the Ford brand but to take the lead in the production of EVs and batteries domestically. Ford did not respond to the Courier Journal's attempt for comment about its investments in Kentucky.\n\"Kentucky is the new Michigan,\" Dunn said.\nWill Kentucky become the 'center of the Ford universe?'\nEarly in his first term as Kentucky's governor, Beshear strategized with UAW officials including Dunn and executive leadership at Ford, Executive Chair Bill Ford Jr. and Ford CEO Jim Farley, to increase the automaker's footprint in the Commonwealth.\n\"Ford is fully committed to Kentucky, they believe in us and we deliver,\" Beshear said.\nFarley agrees, noting that the workforce in Kentucky can be relied on to elevate the Ford brand and create products consumers desire.\n\"I think in the end, it's kind of a partnership between Ford [and] the state, but it really only works because of the hard work of the people in the plant,\" Farley said in May about what has kept Ford committed to Kentucky.\nBeshear, who is \"proud to be a pro-union governor\" believes that in part, his communication with both Farley and International UAW President Shawn Fain has positioned not only the company, but the UAW to want to be here.\n\"When you as a governor can have a good relationship both with the leadership of the UAW and leadership of Ford, it puts us in the best position to succeed,\" Beshear said. \"I'm really proud of what we have done with Ford, really grateful for both Ford and the UAW about really creating that better future for our families.\"\nWith the backing of a household name brand like Ford continuing to support and prop up the state economy, Beshear is confident it will continue to expand the manufacturing economy across Kentucky.\n\"There is no question between BlueOval SK, the investment that's already been made at the truck plant and now at LAP, we are a center of the Ford universe, if not the center,\" Beshear said.\nDuring negotiations, the union worked tirelessly to try and include battery and EV operations, like the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, under the National Master Agreement. Despite union efforts, Ford sources had continually said this would not be possible due to the plant being a joint venture with a South Korean company.\nBut for the time being, the 5,000 workers who will be hired in Glendale will remain non-union.\n\"We're still going to have to organize it [BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, Kentucky] but we got some transitional stuff ... sounds like we got our foot in the door which is what I thought we'd end up to,\" Dunn said.\nWhat's next for KTP and LAP?\nKPT, which has seen continued product demand, will begin producing a hybrid electric vehicle of both the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, as part of the negotiated $750 million product commitment.\nCurrently, that plant is not outfitted to produce hybrid vehicles, Dunn said. The plant will need to undergo renovations either in layout or machinery to be able to produce hybrids, and Dunn speculates this new production of the hybrids alongside the gas engines could lead to more jobs at KTP.\nAccording to the UAW and Ford tentative agreement highlights posted Oct. 29 by the UAW, LAP will receive a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the four-year agreement and see the end of production of both the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after 2025 and will transition to producing an \"all-new EV product\" starting in 2026. LAP is one of three assembly plants with a committed future EV product in the tentative agreement.\n\"We got a plant that's got security, we got a United States that's got the security of having a product, ... we've significantly increased the wages, we've got a contract that's the best contract we've seen in two decades,\" Dunn said.\nHowever, Dunn worries the workforce may be reduced, noting that the transition to producing fully electric vehicles, \"brings challenges, eliminated jobs, but adds other opportunities.\" Most recently, a Ford Labor Relations Bulletin from Nov. 3 announced LAP would experience temporary layoffs throughout the remainder of the month \"due to parts related issues.\"\n\"We're going into something that we've never done before, so there is no right answer, but it's basically ... the ability to have other opportunities within electrification,\" Dunn said. \"So, we've got more opportunities that they're working on to be able to navigate our membership if affected [by workforce reduction].\"\nWhat happens during the contract ratification?\nNow that a tentative agreement has been reached, UAW locals that represent Ford workers across the country have started the ratification process. To become the governing contract between Ford and the UAW, members must pass the contract by a majority vote in a democratic election process."

      "text": "'I felt like a guinea pig.' 45-year-old man relives 38-day hospital battle with COVID-19\nCOVID-19 took Tony Arms\u2019 job on March 20. He never dreamed a few days later it would threaten his life, too.\nLike so many during the coronavirus pandemic shutdown, Arms felt the ripple effect at work well before he felt a tightness in his chest. Once Ford Motor Company shut down production, his job trucking parts for them became irrelevant. The 44-year-old left his final day at work and headed to Kroger across the Ohio River near his Clarksville, Indiana, home. As a diabetic, he knew he was at-risk.\nHe planned to grab supplies and hunker down with his wife of six years, Cindy Hellman.\nHe\u2019s a bit of a homebody who works nights. She\u2019s a social butterfly on the day shift, who enjoys line dancing with her girlfriends in the evenings while he's away.\nThey were finally going to have some quality time together, he thought.\nInstead, he\u2019d spend five weeks in a hospital bed fighting for his life without her by his side.\nBy the time I got Arms and Hellman on the phone in mid-May, he'd been home for nearly a week. He'd dropped 40 pounds in 40 days during his fight with COVID-19. He was grateful for the nurses who cared for him during his isolation, and on top of everything else, he was still waiting for his first unemployment payment from the state.\nLeap of Faith: Kentucky houses of worship prepare to reopen for 'new normal'\nIn more ways than one, he felt like a guinea pig. Kentucky was fumbling with unemployment in a pandemic just as doctors and nurses are trying to get a grasp on COVID-19.\nThe couple doesn't spend a ton of time with the news, but Hellman's daughter works in public health, and she's kept them well in the know about the virus. They remember sitting around with her at a birthday party in the second week of March as she speculated about postponing the Kentucky Derby. That seemed unthinkable.\nNo, they thought, surely they wouldn't do that.\nBut as Kentucky \u2014 and really the world as a whole \u2014 settled into its new normal, Arms started with a fever March 31. They treated it with Tylenol and it bobbed up and down until finally it just stayed up. Arms lost his appetite and sense of taste. Mashed potatoes went down OK, but not much else did.\nThey had a call with a doctor who told him he had all the symptoms of COVID-19, and they informally diagnosed him over the phone.\nBy April 5, he knew he wasn't going to be able to fight the illness on his own, and he went upstairs and took a shower to cool down. He checked into Clark Memorial Hospital not long after that.\nHe believes if he'd waited any longer, he would have died.\n\"There\u2019s no shot for this disease and this virus,\" he told me. \"Everybody that thinks like laissez-faire about it, I can\u2019t tell you how serious this thing is.\"\nYou may like: 60 days, 300 miles: How (a lot of) hiking helps our columnist cope with COVID-19 'isolation'\nTwo days later he celebrated his 45th birthday on April 7, and the nurses sang to him because the pandemic kept him from having visitors.\nThe first few days in the hospital he would call and text his wife, but as his body weakened and his breathing labored, so did his ability to communicate.\nAbout two days before they intubated him, he stopped using his phone. Hellman would call in for updates daily, but she wouldn't get to speak to him.\nOnce they put the tube in on April 11, no one would.\nBack at home, Hellman was quarantined to the full extent of the word, she told me. Not that she would have, of course, but when your daughter works in public health, there's no fudging the rules. Her groceries were delivered to her doorstep, and she was left alone to worry, work from home and plead with the unemployment office on his behalf for nine long, lonely days.\nShe'd gone from being that dancing social butterfly into a total COVID-19 cocoon.\nBack at Clark Memorial, Arms had a tube down his throat and no memory of arriving at the hospital. It was April 19, and he'd been unconscious for more than a week. He thought he'd been in a car wreck. He thought he was dying.\nFirst, he heard a man's voice, but he couldn't understand the words. Then he heard a woman, but it couldn't make out what she was saying either.\nIt was a dream-like hallucination, he told me. He couldn't move his arms, and he couldn't speak.\nThen he heard a woman tell him that they were going to take a ventilator out of him, and she pleaded with him to be calm as they unhooked him from the machine. He didn't feel any pain, he told me, just genuine uneasiness.\nThe ventilator saved his life, but it caused a host of other problems.\nYou may like: How are you? Fine? Really? How Louisville is feeling in the pandemic\nFor the next several days he struggled to form words. When sounds came from his mouth, they slipped out in whispers or growls. It took almost fives day before he had any voice at all.\nHe had to relearn how to swallow. The thirst in his mouth was unbearable, and even the slight trace of water from an ice chip would send him into a coughing fit.\n\"It was the driest (I'd ever been), it was torture,\" he told me.\nAt one point, they gave him a cracker, and he thought he'd be able to take it. The next thing he knew the crumbs were flying out of his mouth and the coughing started again.\nHe had no control over his muscles. His arms and his legs hung limp from days of heavy sedation. First, he needed to build up strength and then he had to will his limbs to do what he wanted them to do.\n\"You have to kind of push your own boundaries,\" he said. \"Slowly I got movement in my arms and legs.\"\nBy late April he was out of the woods, but he still had a long way to go with recovery. The doctors at Clark transferred him to the Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville. There they lowered his supplemental oxygen and helped him walk again.\nHellman still hadn't seen him in person, but she could watch his progress through videos. Through the screen, she saw him walk 280 feet when just days before he could barely move at all.\nShe finally brought him home on May 13, more than a month after he first checked into the hospital. He left Fraizer in a crowd of cheers from the doctors and all the staff.\n\"I hugged him and I cried because he was alive, and I was so grateful that they saved him,\" Hellman told me.\nYou may like: Kentucky man survives after COVID-19 left him paralyzed and in a coma for 10 days\nWhen I asked Arms what he was most looking forward to now that he was home, he rattled off a list of simple things. Taco Bell was high on that list, he told me, but so was having the strength to do home projects and a little woodworking.\nHe wanted the nurses that took care of him to know how grateful he was to them for being his family, but he also wanted the hospital and the community to know how overworked they were.\nFinancially the couple is managing, but they're still calling the unemployment office every day hoping for a check.\nNow that things are reopening, he's in talks with his company about what it might look like when he goes back to work. Meanwhile, his wife is building up a collection of fashionable masks to color coordinate with her wardrobe.\nHe was just fine with a medical mask, he told me.\nThey both laughed at their differences over the phone.\nAnd as I hung with them, I thought about everything that went into that laugh, from the tube down his throat to that growl and that whisper that first came out after he woke up.\nHe wouldn't get to hunker down with his social butterfly for the pandemic like he'd hoped, but he'd survived. They had years to look forward to together.\nThat quality time he was looking for in March just got the extension of a lifetime.\nFeatures columnist Maggie Menderski writes about what makes Louisville, Southern Indiana and Kentucky unique, wonderful, and occasionally, a little weird.

      "text": "Ford announces $5B investment, 4,000 new EV jobs, with Louisville to produce new EV truck\nIn This Article:\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nFord Motor Co. continues to make big bets on an electric vehicle future.\nThe automaker plans to invest $5 billion and have roughly 4,000 jobs focused on EV production across the Louisville Assembly Plant and the BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, Ford CEO Jim Farley announced in Louisville on Aug. 11.\nSwitch Auto Insurance and Save Today!\n\"We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters \u2014 design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership \u2014 and do it with American workers,\" Farley said.\nUtilizing a new universal EV platform built with a new assembly line model, the first vehicle to roll off the line will be a midsize four-door EV pickup truck with a $30,000 starting price coming to consumers in 2027.\nFarley called the announcement a \"Model-T moment\" for the company \u2014 a reference to the historic Ford vehicle that essentially launched the automaker 120 years ago. He likened the affordability and adaptability of the Model-T to the newly announced EV platform that the company has worked on for the last three years and said its implications on the market could be just as seismic.\nThe upcoming production shifts at LAP, which currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, appear to lessen the number of jobs on site from 2,800 to 2,200 hourly workers, Ford spokesman Mark Truby told the Detroit Free Press.\nSome of those 600 workers may take a buyout offer if they are ready to retire while others can transfer to nearby plants such as Kentucky Truck Plant, but there are no plans for layoffs, Truby said, adding there is \"room to grow\u201d with EV production.\nThe Aug. 11 announcement comes after Ford reported a recent loss of $1.3 billion in the second quarter on the EV unit of the company and announced a further delay in the production of two EV products to 2028.\nMore: Ford will have 'Model-T moment' on Aug. 11, CEO Jim Farley says\nFarley acknowledged the new \"radical approach\" and massive investment was a gamble amid a technology crossroads for the automotive industry and international competition.\n\"The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions and they fizzled out with idle plants, laid off workers and red ink,\" he said. \"At Ford three years ago, we set out to break that cycle ... we're talking about a vehicle that can sustain itself, have strong profits, so all of our workers and the community here has actually a sustainable future.\"\nHere's what we know about the historic EV investment from Ford:\nWhat is Ford's Universal EV Platform?\nFord is creating a new Universal EV Platform that will allow a family of \"affordable\" vehicles to be produced and scaled to meet customer demand.\nThe new EV platform will allow for a reduction in parts compared to a typical vehicle, create a need for fewer workstations in the plant and improve assembly time by 15%.\nFarley said Ford will be the first automaker to use prismatic LFP batteries to power the EVs. This battery type allows for both space and weight savings while being cheaper than other battery types currently on the market.\n\"Twenty-to-thirty percent less parts, 40% less time in assembly. It's just a radical approach,\" he said. \"We've never built a car this way. There are no guarantees. We have a busy 18 months until we start building this vehicle, but what I am confident about is we've done all the cost of ownership, and it is a radically better proposition for some customers.\"\nMore: Layoffs, buyouts and early retirements: What workers should consider in changing economy\nWhat new EVs will Ford make?\nThe first vehicle expected to be launched from this new universal platform is a midsize four-door EV pickup truck. The automaker is targeting a starting price of $30,000 and the truck will be assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road.\nFord executives said the vehicle should be profitable within 12 months of launch and will be affordable to consumers not just when compared to EVs but compared to all products on the market.\nThe truck is expected to be available to customers in the U.S. and overseas in 2027. Ford said the new-to-market truck will be \"as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost\" and have more passenger space than the competitor Toyota RAV4. Like many EVs, the truck will also feature a \"frunk\" or front trunk and have a truck bed.\nMeet the competitor: All-new Toyota RAV4 unveiled in world premiere. What to know about Kentucky-made hybrid\nFord will also deploy a new assembly line model, more than a century after the company first pioneered the moving assembly line. The new Universal EV Production System is expected to simplify vehicle assembly for \"safety, quality and speed.\"\nThe new assembly line is being coined an \"assembly tree\" and will feature three sub-assembly lines that run down their own lines at the same time and then join together to make the final product.\nThe new method, and reduction of parts, has allowed Ford to develop a way for the front and rear of the vehicles to be assembled separately and then combined later down the line with the structural battery, which will be the vehicle's floor.\nParts will now be moved down the assembly tree to workers in a kit that will contain all parts and tools needed, along with instructions for proper use, making the job simpler for employees.\nBryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said the assembly tree model is expected to enhance the quality of the vehicles, thanks, in part, to the reduction of the number of parts used during assembly.\n\"When you look at what can stop a line or can cause even initial warranty issues, it's the elimination of that,\" Currie said.\nFord expects this new assembly model to increase production speeds at LAP by up to 40% when compared to the speed of production of the current Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, which are currently built on site.\nThe assembly tree model and universal EV production platform are seen as key components for the future of the automaker that can be married into existing facilities. However, Currie said the universal platform will not be used for big internal combustion vehicles such as the Super Duty trucks made at Kentucky Truck Plant.\nWhat investment is Ford making in Louisville?\nWith its new $1.9 billion project, Ford will expand LAP by 52,000 square feet and upgrade the plant's digital infrastructure. This will make LAP the fastest network with the most access points for quality control scans of any Ford plant across the globe.\nThe Courier Journal previously reported Ford had filed plans to Louisville Metro Planning and Design Services in June that detailed the addition of new docks and large EV charging station.\nThe project, the third-largest economic development project in the state's history, secured $120 million in tax-based incentives at a special meeting Aug. 11 of The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.\nMore: Ford further pushes out production of 2 EVs to focus on affordability\nThis supplemental project adds to an existing Kentucky Jobs Retention Act program agreement between state government and the company. The performance-based incentive allows the company to recover up to a cumulative $550 million based on the company\u2019s overall $5.55 billion-plus investment.\nBy hitting annual investment and job targets, the company can be eligible to keep some of the new tax revenue it generates by claiming eligible incentives against its income tax liability and/or wage assessments, according to the state.\nWill Louisville see new Ford jobs?\nCurrently, LAP has 2,800 hourly workers and 200 salaried workers, a Ford spokesperson said.\nThe announcement from Aug. 11 indicates the EV project at LAP will start with 2,200 employees \u2014 600 fewer hourly jobs than are there currently.\nFord spokesperson Mark Truby said the company is not planning layoffs but instead some workers will likely take a buyout offer while others will have the option to transfer to the Kentucky Truck Plant or \u201cother plants in the area.\u201d\n\u201cThis project will start with 2,200 hourly workers, so 600 fewer workers than we have today, but it\u2019s a lot of headroom to grow,\u201d Truby said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say today that this is the only top hat to be built in Louisville, but we\u2019re focused on this product today and there is room to grow.\u201d\nWhy is the Louisville Assembly Plant getting a new EV product?\nDuring the 2023 contract negotiations with the UAW, which eventually led to Ford workers across the country being called out on strike, the union and automaker struck a deal that some claimed put Louisville \"truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation,\" The Courier Journal reported in 2023.\nFrom 2023: How new UAW Ford agreement makes Louisville 'center of the universe' for electric vehicles\nThe UAW and Ford agreed to pump major investments and changes into the Louisville Assembly Plant following the end of the production lifecycle of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.\nLAP was promised a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the 2023 contract and an \"all-new EV product.\"\nThe EV industry has sprouted up quickly across Kentucky, largely due to Ford's investment in the state. Todd Dunn, the president of UAW Local 862, which represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant where Super Duty trucks are made, previously said \"Kentucky is the new Michigan,\" due to the growth of the EV sector in the state.\nIn June, documents filed with Louisville Metro Government showed Ford is already in the early stages of retooling LAP to go from producing gas powered vehicles to EVs with the planned addition of 12,000 square feet of canopy to shelter 16 charging units and a substation, The Courier Journal first reported.\nDunn and International UAW President Shawn Fain have previously shared excitement over maintaining a product commitment for LAP and job security for workers.\nDetroit Free Press reporter Jamie LaReau contributed to this report.

      "text": "Ford Louisville Assembly Plant heads into week four of production halt. What that means\nThe Ford Louisville Assembly Plant will be shut down for a fourth week, with production stopped due to a software issue with the 2023-model Escape.\nKelli Felker, a spokesperson at Ford, confirmed the closure to the Courier Journal.\n\"We are vigilant about ensuring that the vehicles our customers receive are built with the quality they expect and we are taking the appropriate actions to deliver on that commitment,\" Felker added.\nSwitch Auto Insurance and Save Today!\nTodd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, the union that represents rank-and-file Ford workers at the two Louisville-based plants, told the Courier Journal that Ford engineers have found a solution to the software issue and that currently, only a \"small amount of cars\" need the software solution applied.\n\"We will be back to normal production or getting into normal production, the week after next,\" Dunn told The Courier Journal.\nHow many Ford Louisville Assembly Plant employees are out of work?\nNearly 3,200 Ford assembly line workers have been out of work for the past three weeks, and more vehicles have not been made. During the temporary shutdown, Ford employees with at least one year of seniority are supposed to receive 75% of their gross pay through unemployment and supplemental unemployment benefits, Felker told The Courier Journal.\n\"The income, it had a significant reduction in pay, which ultimately impacts our wallet,\" Dunn said regarding the more than 3,000 employees out of work.\nDunn noted that Ford has \"a lot of new hires\" right now and due to their lack of time with the company, many of these employees \"don't have benefits yet.\"\nYou may like:Are quality issues with Ford Escape to blame for Louisville plant pause? What to know\nOutside of the assembly line workers at the Louisville Assembly Plant, the now nearly monthlong halt to production impacts manufacturers across the state.\n\"Our suppliers are actually seeing the effects so ... it's just more than the auto worker inside the plant, it goes far beyond. It also affects the tax base of the community and ... the ability to be up on your bills and not behind on your bills at times when things are increasing,\" Dunn said. \"It's always a significant impact.\"\nWhy is the Ford Louisville Assembly Plant shut down?\nDunn said there is a \"corrective action\" in place for all new parts for future production. In this case with the software issue, a corrective action means all software would show up to the plant ready to be installed in the vehicles and would no longer suffer from the same quality issue that originally halted production.\nThe \"small amount of cars\" that have already been produced with faulty software will be reflashed, which means the company \"would be applying a solution with software to the vehicle that's already been built,\" Dunn said."

      "text": "Driving past the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant on Chamberlain Lane, things appear to be back to normal.\nThe nationwide five-and-a-half weeklong United Auto Workers strike against Ford Motor Co. came to an end on Oct. 25 when the union and company reached a tentative agreement. Roughly 9,000 workers at KTP were on strike for two weeks before a deal was struck.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nNow that the strike is over, workers have gone back to producing Ford vehicles, including the Super Duty truck, and are gearing up to vote to ratify the contract on Nov. 12 in Louisville.\nDuring the plant's 68-year history, LAP has often been in the shadow of Ford's $25 billion truck plant in Louisville, narrowly evading closure, seeing multiple work stoppages, experiencing changing product lines, and continually seeing consumer demand decrease for the products built there. Most recently, a Ford Labor Relations Bulletin from Nov. 3 announced LAP would experience temporary layoffs throughout the remainder of the month \"due to parts related issues.\"\nDespite these ever-growing challenges at LAP, Ford and the UAW have tentatively agreed to pump major investments and changes into the plant, giving it new life and helping set the tone for a transition to electric vehicle production, a continuation of Ford's plans in Kentucky, which include BlueOval SK, a more than $5 billion joint venture EV battery production park between Ford and SK On 50 miles south of Louisville.\n\"This new agreement is great news ... to see this kind of significant investment in our city's future is a testament to where our city is headed,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told the Courier Journal. \"Between this investment in LAP and what's going on at the BlueOval SK factory, Louisville is truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation.\"\nAccording to the UAW and Ford tentative agreement highlights posted Oct. 29 by the UAW, LAP will receive a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the four-year agreement \u2014 the second largest product investment outlined in the tentative agreement \u2014 see the end of production of both the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after 2025 and will transition to producing an \"all-new EV product.\"\n\"We got a plant that's got security, we got a United States that's got the security of having a product, ... we've significantly increased the wages, we've got a contract that's the best contract we've seen in two decades,\" said President of UAW Local 862 in Louisville Todd Dunn.\nUAW committed to getting 'job security' for members at Ford\nAt a practice picket on Aug. 25 at the UAW Local 862 union hall across from LAP, International UAW President Shaw Fain shared that it was a top priority for the negotiators to ensure the plant had a product commitment for the workers' future.\n\"Job security is one of our biggest issues, always is going into bargaining,\" Fain previously told media in Louisville.\nCurrently, LAP produces the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, both of which have a planned product lifecycle through 2025. Dunn, who represents roughly 12,000 workers at both LAP and KTP, had previously said he would not endorse a new National Master Agreement that did not have a product commitment for both KTP and LAP.\n\"It's our job to bargain for products,\" Fain said previously. \"The workers deserve product, I mean, the fruits of their labor, generate these massive profits. That's my expectation we have with the companies is that when new products come in, or when one product is going out, that we find a replacement for it and keep these plants going.\"\nLAP is one of three assembly plants with a committed future EV product in the tentative agreement. Ford did not respond to the Courier Journal's attempts for comment about the possible LAP transition.\nGreenberg said this transition to EV happening in Louisville \"shows the country and world that Louisville is a great place for advanced manufacturing\" and helps set the stage for future automotive advancements in the city.\n\"It's huge ... our main focus is to keep that plant open and running,\" Dunn said about the guarantee of a future product at LAP. \"That's why I committed that I needed to have product in my plant and that I couldn't support, and I wouldn't support this agreement unless we have product in that plant.\"\n\"We want their work to be building a vehicle that we're deeply passionate about where the customers can't imagine life without it,\" Farley told media in Louisville in May in regard to the future of the Ford Escape and LAP. \"So, I think they should be really excited about their future and they're going to continue to build really passionate products.\"\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said creating a future for LAP and its workers has been a focus for him throughout his time as governor.\n\"I believe that securing the battery plant really cemented the fact that there was going to be a bright future at LAP,\" Beshear said in reference to the Ford BlueOval SK Battery Park which will begin production of batteries for Ford vehicles in 2025, just 50 miles south of LAP.\nWith the new tentative agreement creating a future of EV production in the state, Ford will now have the \"whole lifecycle\" of production for EVs in Kentucky.\nNow, with the commitment of the second largest product investment across all U.S. Ford facilities, the future of LAP looks promising. Dunn said he previously suspected an EV product would come to LAP because Ford audited the plant recently, taking note of plant size and workforce operational space among other things.\nEVs take fewer parts to assemble when compared to gas engine vehicles and can lead to workforce reductions, which was a concern of the UAW. However, Dunn said one thing working in LAP's favor is the floor space, roughly 3.1 million square feet of space.\n\"Cash is king, and in assembly plants, floor space square footage is key. That will give us more opportunities to engage in future possibilities for a total all-electric plant,\" Dunn said.\nWhile he remains optimistic about future possibilities on the product line at LAP, Dunn said it is \"on my radar\" that the switch to electric production could lead to more layoffs. However, under the job security program tentatively agreed to between Ford and the UAW, there is an emphasis placed on protecting workers from the \"unpredictable impact\" the transition to EV may cause. The job security program would likely allow workers the chance to retain work at another Ford facility such as the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, according to the tentative agreement.\n\"I think the big thing is understanding how the process works, how much of our workforce is going to be affected, how to make sure that workforce is retained, and utilized in a different capacity, and be open-minded to how many other opportunities that we can take on,\" Dunn said.\nHistory of Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant\nLAP first opened in the metro in 1955, assembling trucks. By 1987, truck production had moved across town to KTP and LAP received a $260 million expansion and began producing the Bronco II. Just a few years later in 1990, the Ford Explorer rolled off the line at LAP, and the plant would assemble this SUV and enjoy success for the next decade with sales peaking at 445,157 in 2000.\nIn 2007, LAP was on the shortlist to be closed as Explorer sales decreased and rising gas prices impacted consumer buying habits. Later that year, the UAW agreed to a new contract with Ford that provided a commitment to keep LAP open.\nExplorer production would eventually cease in 2010 and LAP saw a massive $631 million plant renovation. The next year, LAP reopened producing the Escape and by 2013 added production of the compact Lincoln crossover.\nIn 2019, Ford invested $550 million into LAP in preparation for the relaunch of the Escape, the Courier Journal previously reported. That year, the company also announced it would build the 2020 Lincoln Corsair, a compact SUV, at LAP.\nDespite the plant's rocky past, LAP is poised to become a future leader in domestic EV production for Ford.\n\"Louisville has been a Ford Motor city, we still are a Ford city, and this agreement makes it very clear, we will continue to be a Ford city,\" Greenberg said.\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on Twitter at @oliviamevans_."

      "text": "Ford launches new Expedition SUV in Louisville with $500 million investment. Take a look\n- Ford has begun shipping the 2025 Expedition SUV, which is assembled at the Kentucky Truck Plant.\n- The company emphasizes quality control improvements after past recalls.\n- The new Expedition features a redesigned exterior, upgraded technology, and a starting price of $62,000.\n- Kentucky represents about 20% of Ford's hourly workforce.\nFord Motor Co. has officially started to ship its newest SUV, assembled in Kentucky, just six months after the all-new 2025 Ford Expedition was unveiled in dramatic fashion at the Texas state fair late last year.\nOn April 30, Ford CEO Jim Farley was joined by Rocky Adkins, a senior advisor to Gov. Andy Beshear, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and workers at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville to celebrate the launch of the new vehicle.\n\"Kentucky makes the greatest baseball bats, the finest American whiskey, raises a lot of very fast thoroughbreds ... But in my book, Kentucky's greatest contribution to America happens right here (at Kentucky Truck Plant),\" Farley said.\nIn addition to the Expedition, Lincoln, the luxury vehicle producer in the Ford portfolio, showcased its 2025 Lincoln Navigator, the flagship SUV in the Lincoln brand, which is also assembled at the Kentucky Truck Plant alongside the Expedition and F-Series Super Duty trucks.\n\"You are the horsepower of the auto industry in Kentucky, and you're showing America what's possible,\" Adkins said at the launch party.\nIn anticipation of the 2025 Expedition launch, Ford invested roughly $500 million into the Kentucky Truck Plant to bring it updated equipment, new technologies, additional vehicle testers and more, Farley said.\nHere's what we know about the new 2025 Ford Expedition SUV:\n'From Kentucky, for America'\nFord is branding the launch as \"From Kentucky, For America\" in an effort to remind consumers during uncertain economic times that the automaker is an American company, employing a large American workforce.\nBetween the Kentucky Truck Plant and Ford's smaller Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road, Kentucky currently represents about 20% of Ford's entire hourly workforce, a company spokesperson said. Last year, the Louisville area plants assembled more than 700,000 vehicles.\n\"At Ford, we believe we can, and we must build a strong manufacturing base in America,\" Farley said, adding that Ford is leading the way on revitalizing American manufacturing, with 80% of vehicles sold in the U.S. being assembled in the U.S. at facilities like the Kentucky Truck Plant or Louisville Assembly Plant.\nDuring the event, Farley took aim at automaker competitors, noting \"we never left America,\" and adding in that Ford has continued investment planned for the U.S., including the current construction of a plant in Ohio and Tennessee.\n\"Imagine, if the companies who import all the vehicles in the U.S., treated American manufacturing like Ford,\" Farley said. \"... if our competition moves forward and moves assembly production back to the U.S. at our levels, that would be equivalent of producing 15 new auto plants in the U.S. That's the difference.\"\nIn recent weeks as President Donald Trump has enacted a slew of tariffs, automakers like Ford have been caught in the crossfire. While Farley said he supports the Trump administrations mission to restore American manufacturing, he said there is still room to grow on securing \"a comprehensive set of policies to support our shared vision of that healthy and growing auto industry.\"\n\"We are not there yet,\" Farley said in regard to trade policy.\nWith the emphasis of Ford's latest marketing campaign, \"Built for America\" the company is hoping to \"remind Americans where things come from matters and Ford is different,\" Farley said.\nQuality control takes a front seat with new Expedition SUV\nIn 2023, the last time Ford launched a new vehicle out of the Kentucky Truck Plant, company officials harped on a new era of quality control standards coming into play. At the time, Ford was freshly off having seen nearly three million vehicles recalled in 2022 and surpassing $5 billion in warranty related costs in 2019.\nThe quality control efforts implemented at the truck plant and across town at the smaller Louisville Assembly Plant that produces the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, have produced mixed results. Ford has had several recalls, impacting at least 11,000 Super Duty trucks since the 2023 model launched along with recalls facing its other Kentucky-made vehicles.\nBut amid the ongoing effort to battle quality issues, Ford is confident its latest SUV to hit the road is a winner.\n\"We think it's the right time to emphasize that on quality, we will never be done with quality,\" Farley said. \"Every time you come here for a launch, you're going to be hearing about quality. It is a game of inches and millimeters.\"\nClaire Yarmak, a quality manager at Kentucky Truck Plant, told The Courier Journal quality control was a \"relentless\" focus for the automaker this go around, and led to the introduction of 20 new trained drivers to do tests and audits on 100% of the new vehicles and 72 new finished vehicle compliance audits to ensure vehicle features work as intended.\nOne of the most evident areas of quality control inside the Kentucky Truck Plant is the deployment of the Mobile Artificial Intelligence Vision System, an AI technology developed by Ford that uses machines to scan vehicles in real time and identify quality issues such as electrical, component and trim issues.\nThis technology was first used at the truck plant in 2023 with only 20 machines but ahead of the Expedition launch, the company installed more than 100 machines at the plant to up its quality control for the newest SUV.\n\"We do not want to go through the issues we have in the past, and so far, the quality looks great,\" Farley said.\nWhat are the features on the all-new 2025 Ford Expedition?\nThe 2025 Ford Expedition boasts a multitude of new features, packages and an upgraded design. To date, some 16,000 vehicles have been produced and are making their ways to consumers across all 50 states.\n\"Expedition is all about serving families that live big lives,\" said Adrian Aguirre, chief program engineer for Ford Expedition. \"We know these customers and we know them because we are obsessed with finding out what will make their lives easier and their experiences better.\"\nSo much of the newest vehicle's focus is around elevating the experience for families who spend a lot of time in and around their vehicle, from camping trips to long days hauling it across town, leading Aguirre to call it, the \"most dependable Expedition ever.\"\nWhile not a new generation vehicle redesign, the outside appearance of the vehicle has received a stylish facelift with a new take on the front grille, new headlights and taillights, and a new wheel design.\nOne of the hallmark features of the new large SUV is a power tailgate split into independently opening upper and power sections to create a variety of new features.\nThe three-row SUV which can seat up to eight people also features a \"squircle\" shaped steering wheel to make room for a newly revamped interior, touch screen display in the vehicle.\nThe manufacturer suggested retail price for the most basic version of the vehicle starts at $62,000 and goes up to a starting price of $86,655 for the Expedition Max King Ranch model. There are seven models of the vehicle available.\nHere are 15 additional new features on the 2025 Ford Expedition:\nNote: This list is not inclusive of all features for all models of the 2025 Ford Expedition.\n- Tremor off-road model\n- 24-inch front display screen\n- Horizontally split power tailgate\n- 9,600-pound towing capacity\n- Blue Cruise hands-free highway driving system\n- 15 Beverage Holders\n- Illuminated entry system with theater-dimming\n- Auto-dimming rearview mirror\n- Lane-Keeping system which includes Lane-Keeping assist, Lane-Keeping alert, road edge protection and driver alert\n- 360-degree camera\n- Rock crawl mode\n- Panoramic vista roof\n- Intelligent four-wheel drive with terrain management system\n- Pro-trailer hitch assist\n- 3.5L EcoBoost engine\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter at @oliviamevans_.\nThis story was updated to add a gallery."

      "text": "Ford transferring 500 jobs between Jefferson County assembly plants\nFord Motor Co. said Wednesday it will move 500 full-time hourly jobs at its Louisville Assembly Plant and shift all workers to similar assembly jobs at the automaker's truck plant in eastern Jefferson County.\nThe news comes after months of speculation about Ford's plans to restructure, and after the automaker's chief competitor, General Motors, announced this week it would close five factories in North America and trim 14,000 jobs, including management and professional staff.\nThe latest: What you need to know about Ford's shifting of Louisville jobs\nWorkers were notified during a midday town hall meeting in Louisville, and the automaker alerted United Auto Worker leaders before the announcement.\n\"Ford is adding more than 500 jobs at Kentucky Truck Plant and moving approximately that same number of jobs from Louisville Assembly Plant to nearby KTP to increase Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator production by 20 percent,\" Ford said in a statement.\n\"(The Louisville Assembly Plant) will move to a two-shift operating pattern next spring,\" Ford said.\nShawn Miles, a 17-year assembly worker at the plant, said rumors about possible layoffs had circulated around the plant in recent weeks.\nHe and many others felt relieved to learn that the 500 jobs aren\u2019t going away, just moving.\n\u201cAnytime they\u2019re not laying people off, it\u2019s a positive,\u201d Miles said Wednesday evening.\nRelated: Ford moving 1,150 workers in Michigan, Kentucky, but will preserve jobs\nLouisville Assembly has 4,530 hourly workers, which means slightly more than 12 percent of the unionized workforce will shift to KTP. The truck plant has about 8,200, and those relocated to the truck plant are considered new positions.\nUAW Vice President Rory Gamble said in a statement Wednesday that the labor union is working with members on the shift reduction and placement of members, who are protected by a collectively bargained contract.\n\u201cThe UAW will be working with our members to ensure they have a continuous work and help minimize, as much as possible, any hardship on members and their families,\u201d he said.\nThe UAW will begin negotiations with car companies in 2019 to craft a new contract.\nFord previously announced it intends to exit the passenger car market, except for its popular Mustang, to concentrate on SUVs and trucks. Analysts offered a fairly upbeat view of Ford's moves after GM's announcement earlier this week shocked the industry.\nIvan Drury, senior analyst for Edmunds, said in response to the news: \"Ford's gamble on trucks is paying off, which should put both investors and employees at ease.\"\nSee also: Ford Motor contract leads Kentucky company to expand in Southern Indiana\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University, said President Donald Trump, who is angry at GM, is sure to praise Ford for its \u201cno layoffs\u201d announcement.\n\u201cWhen people see GM make an announcement about cutting jobs, they think, \u2018When is the shoe going to drop?\u2019 If you\u2019re going to make an announcement about moving product, you should make certain it\u2019s coupled with an announcement that no layoffs will take place,\u201d Masters said.\n\u201cWhat Ford is trying to convey to the employees, and to the market, is that they are shifting their focus to the more profitable end of the market. And fortunately, especially at this time of the year, this announcement comes with no layoffs. It gives employees an opportunity to adjust to the transition that the company plans to make.\u201d\nFord said to meet demand for full-size SUVs and trucks, it's rebalancing production at some U.S. plants, \"further increasing our efficiency while retaining jobs for all full-time hourly employees.\"\nIt noted that Expedition retail sales are up 36 percent from a year ago, while Lincoln Navigator sales are up more than 80 percent from this time last year.\nFord built 8,872 fewer Escape compact SUVs at Louisville Assembly in September compared with the same month a year ago, a 28 percent cut in response to slowing consumer demand for its once hot-selling models.\nThe company also dialed back production of its higher-priced Lincoln MKC at the assembly plant, which is on Fern Valley Road near Interstate 65. It trimmed MKC production by nearly 18 percent year over year in September and by more than 34 percent through the first nine months of the year. In October, Ford actually increased production over the prior October by nearly 500 Escapes and MKCs.\nRead more: Here's why Ford isn't making as many vehicles in Louisville\nFord spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in early October that there were no job cuts planned at Louisville Assembly. The company is getting ready to post openings for the jobs at the truck plant in Louisville and in Livonia, Michigan, where workers are also expected to move from another assembly plant in nearby Flat Rock. Ford wants to give workers an opportunity to get the paperwork completed, Felker said.\nThe Expedition model has seen a 36 percent jump in sales, or 44,144 more vehicles from a year ago, while the Lincoln Navigator has seen an 80 percent increase in sales or 14,200 vehicles from a year ago.\nThe F-Series trucks are up 2 percent, or 749,456 pickups \u2014 outselling the nearest competitor, the Chevy Silverado, by 280,000 vehicles through October 2018. The shift changes and reallocation of workers will allow Ford to increase production of the Expedition and Navigator when demand is still increasing for both models, Felker said.\nGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

      "text": "Ford further pushes out production of 2 EVs to focus on affordability\nIn This Article:\nFord Motor Co. is extending its delay in launching two next-generation electric vehicles as the Dearborn-based automaker continues its focus on smaller and more affordable models that deliver profits, the company said.\nFord informed suppliers and employees in June that a full-size electric pickup, which is to be the successor to the F-150 Lightning, will be delayed to 2028, a company spokesman told the Detroit Free Press on Aug. 8. That's a delay of a few months longer than the initial delay set for late 2027. Prototypes for that vehicle will still launch in 2027. Ford plans to make that vehicle at its BlueOval City Assembly Plant in Tennessee.\nAdditionally, Ford is delaying production of its E-transit van, to be built at its Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, from 2026 to 2028.\n\u201cF-150 Lightning, America\u2019s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today\u2019s customer needs,\" Ford spokesman Ian Thibodeau said in a statement. \"We remain focused on delivering our Ford+ plan and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.\u201d\nSwitch Auto Insurance and Save Today!\nThis is not the first time Ford has shifted its EV strategy, and it won't be the last. Ford's EV lineup consists of the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit EV. The company is expected to make a big announcement on Aug. 11 at its plant in Louisville, Kentucky, outlining a future EV strategy. CEO Jim Farley has teased the announcement as being \"a Model T moment\" for the company, a reference to Ford's historic early car that helped build the 120-year company into a mass-market carmaker.\nFord, which leads the industry in recalls, has yet to make money on its EV sales. In fact, Ford has projected it will lose up to $5.5 billion in its EV and software operations for 2025. In the second quarter, Ford reported its Model e electric vehicle unit lost $1.3 billion in the quarter, a wider loss than the $1.1 billion it lost in the year-ago period.\nFarley has said Ford needs to look at the Chinese car companies as its main competitors going forward in the EV space. As the Free Press reported in June, Farley and Ford's executive leadership team went to China earlier this year with an agenda: to study every aspect of how Chinese auto companies operate, then apply those lessons across Ford in its other markets.\nThat's because Chinese automakers have been driving down costs on EV production, selling high-quality, well-designed EVs at affordable prices in Europe and Asia. Ford and other automakers are now focused on also producing lower-cost, smaller EV models using cheaper-to-make batteries that sit on a streamlined platform."

      "text": "Shutdown for Louisville's two Ford plants extended because of coronavirus\nUPDATE: Ford Motor Co. indefinitely extends shutdown of two Louisville plants amid COVID-19 fears\nFord Motor Co.'s two large factories in Louisville won't restart production on Monday after all \u2014 and the company hasn't set a date yet for when its workforce will return to the assembly lines.\nThat means that at least 13,400 hourly employees in Louisville will remain idle during what may become an extended shutdown.\nFord officials said Tuesday morning that \"in light of various governments\u2019 orders to stay and work from home, Ford is not planning to restart our plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico on Monday, March 30 as originally hoped.\"\n\"We are assessing various options and working with union leaders \u2013 including the United Auto Workers and Unifor \u2013 on the optimal timing for resuming vehicle production, keeping the well-being of our workforce top of mind,\" Kumar Galhotra, Ford's president of North America, said in a release. Unifor is a large private-sector union in Canada.\n[This story is being provided for free to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Competitors General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Tesla have also temporarily shut down operations in recent days amid growing concerns about risks to spread the coronavirus.\nKentucky coronavirus live updates: Get the latest information here\nFord operates Louisville Assembly Plant on Fern Valley Road, where compact SUV Escape and Lincoln Corsair are assembled; as well as Kentucky Truck Plant on Chamberlain Lane, where Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and F-250 and larger pickups are assembled.\nAutoworkers are used to temporary shutdowns for plant re-tooling and maintenance in the summers and after the holidays. But an extended layoff with no end in sight will require idled employees to file for unemployment and wait out when they can return to work.\nThe United Auto Workers union contract provides some unemployment supplement to boost regular jobless benefits for qualified full-time workers. The benefits delivers about 75% of full pay for many with more than a year on the factory floor. Employees with less than one-year seniority or who work as temporary workers can file for unemployment, benefit of which are based on their current earnings.\nFord has been backed into a corner as a result of the shutdowns. It's already shaky financial performance in recent quarters will only worsen when the company isn't running its factories. Reports out this week also indicate Fitch Ratings, the large credit rating agency, has downgraded the issuer default ratings of Ford and its subsidiary Ford Credit from BBB- from BBB.\nA downgrade usually follows a poor outlook for the company's operations, its future outlook or its industry. In the case of COVID-19, Ford and many other industries are dealing with all three issues that are certain to hammer earnings.\nLouisville workers are being reassured that the union and the company are looking out for the safety, UAW Local 862 president Todd Dunn said in a text. The shutdown doesn't just affect Ford workers and their families. The supplier operations that support Ford, which supply seats, lighting, door paneling and consoles, also employ several thousand employees in Michigan and across the region.\nGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.
