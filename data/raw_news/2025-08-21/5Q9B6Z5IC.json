  "title": "Guild Esports, Beckham\u2019s Former Team, Calls It Quits After 6 Years",
  "description": "Just 13 days short of its iron anniversary, British competitive gaming outfit Guild Esports, once backed by David Beckham, has announced it\u2019s shutting shop.",
  "content": "After nearly six years of operation \u2014 just 13 days short of its iron anniversary \u2014 British competitive gaming outfit Guild Esports & Gaming Limited, , has announced that it\u2019s shutting down operations for good.\n\nThe company, which finalized a ten-year lease on its headquarters in London\u2019s Shoreditch in 2022 , rebranded under the former soccer star in June 2020, turned heads when it completed its public market flotation on the London Stock Exchange the following October, .\n\nHowever, following its acquisition by DCB Sports in October 2024 for \u00a3100,000 ($134,000) \u2014 and withdrawing from the LSE to become a privately traded company \u2014 Guild has run into financial difficulties, which it attributed to the \u201ccurrent economic climate.\u201d Today (August 21), it took to socials to release an official statement.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, we must share the difficult news that Guild Esports & Gaming will be closing. Despite our best efforts, financial challenges and the current economic climate have made it impossible for us to continue operating.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, our mission extended far beyond competition. We\u2019ve been privileged to champion representation and create opportunities within our industry using esports and gaming as powerful tools for inspiration, inclusion, and empowerment.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that this closure disappoints the community that believed in us, and for that we are sorry. However, we hope this does not overshadow the work our dedicated staff delivered throughout our journey. This outcome is also not a reflection of the support of all our partners who supported our work in the esports space alongside us over the past five years.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who became part of the Guild family, from our fans and players to staff and partners - thank you. Your passion and belief helped us build something truly special.\u201d\n\nThe road to closure is paved with good intentions\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie: when it launched, Guild Esports was a thrilling proposition for a Brit like me. A homegrown team with superstar backing\u2026 what could go wrong?\n\nIn April 2021, as Guild was still riding the wave of excitement, , an Activision veteran behind Call of Duty League (and, er, Overwatch League and Major League Gaming), who said his new outfit wanted to redefine esports as we knew them.\n\nIt was one of the nicest conversations I\u2019ve had with a gaming exec \u2014 one underpinned by genuine positivity and a desire to shape the future of what was (and still can be) a very toxic place, with mental health, academy-nurtured talent, and team-building as core focuses for success.\n\nStill, it never quite worked out that way. Despite its ideologies, Guild Esports never quite struck the right balance between \u201cesports organization\u201d and \u201clifestyle brand.\u201d\n\nOn the most crucial stage, Guild never really registered massive successes, or even regular contender status, despite major signings like in 2021 (who lasted five months) and (a year), plus (who achieved mid-tier success over two years). Later, it promoted its and , but never quite managed to make anything of these ideas beyond the initial announcements.\n\nFor more casual fans like me, esports is an ever more unpredictable industry. Gone are the days of the mega deals with sponsors, even if the big-stage competitions continue. Still, I\u2019m sad Guild\u2019s gone. Let\u2019s hope, for the sake of other teams, it\u2019s not the next of many.",

      "text": "An esports company partly owned by one of the world\u2019s most iconic sportsmen is looking to raise \u00a320 million ($25.9 million) by listing its shares on the London Stock Exchange\u2013and with it, it\u2019s hoping to establish dominance in some of the most competitive games out there.\nGuild Esports, the esports business co-owned by David Beckham, today announced its plans to float on the main market of the LSE. With the megabucks it plans to raise, Guild hopes to establish itself in a number of titles including Fortnite, Rocket League, CS:GO and, rather unsurprisingly, FIFA. Additional funds will also be pushed into the Guild brand, apparently taking advantage of a growing esports apparel and merchandise market.\nThe young company, which only launched in June 2020, has quickly created a management team of esports veterans with experience as professional players, coaches, or media personalities. Its executive chairman is Carleton Curtis, an Activision and Red Bull veteran who became the architect of the Overwatch League and Call of Duty Leagues.\nThe deal will be led by British investment banking expert Zeus Capital, which has appointed a three-man team to operate as joint broker and joint bookrunner on the transaction.\nAs it stands, the Guild Esports presence is incredibly limited; the company\u2019s website offers little more than a shiny 3D logo, a link to recent news, and, naturally, a predictable range of links to social profiles. It\u2019s quite clear that the brand is new and somewhat disjointed\u2013and lacking finesse\u2013but with one of the most recognizable faces in sports (and fashion) with Beckham, there\u2019s no doubt this will change, should the LSE plan float."

Fresh off the back of a successful public market flotation on the London Stock Exchange last month\u2013with a market capitalization of over $50 million\u2013the team is now investing in the people who it hopes will help transform Guild into Europe\u2019s best esports squad.\nToday, the organization confirmed the signing of David \u201cDeevo\u201d Morrow to complete its professional Rocket League roster, ahead of the RLCS X Winter Split, which kicks off on November 12. This regional event takes place in both North America and Europe, with $100,000 prize funds shared out in each gathering.\nGuild has run a vast number of tryouts in the most recent trade window, and has said it\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d that Deevo would be the best person for the team, and fulfill its ambition of winning a major. He will join Thomas \"ThO.\" Binkhorst and Joseph \"noly\" Kidd in Guild\u2019s three-man team.\nDeevo is no stranger to success, having become RLCS S3 World Champion with now-defunct Canadian squad Northern Gaming, and just last month finished in the top eight at the Season X Fall EU Major with his last team, FC Barcelona. It\u2019s very fitting that Deevo, an Englishman, has left Barca for a team owned by Beckham, a fellow countryman whose golden years were spent at Barca\u2019s real-life soccer rivals, Real Madrid.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely excited to start my future with Guild and I hope to help bring them great success in the Rocket League Esports scene,\u201d Deevo said. \u201cI\u2019m accompanied by two world-class players and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll achieve great things as a team together. The staff here have been extremely welcoming and our coach, Gregan, will help guide us to be the best team in Europe.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThanks to all the fans that continue to turn out each week to support the team. We aim to bring you some trophies and continue to put on great shows for you this split.\u201d\nGuild\u2019s Rocket League coach, Mike \u2018Gregan\u2019 Ellis, said: \u201cIn tryouts, Deevo naturally fit with ThO and Noly, has loads of experience playing at the top, and has fantastic communication skills. Despite his long career, I can see that Deevo still has room to grow as a player and I think Guild is the perfect place for him to develop his skills.\u201d"

Flikk ranks in the Top 20 Fortnite pros in Europe, and most recently notched a third-place finish in the Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) Trio Finals this month. So far, he\u2019s earned over $100,000.\nWhat\u2019s more, the youngster will be representing the team from this weekend, where he\u2019ll take part in the $1M Super Cup, which was finalized earlier this week.\nGuild\u2019s partnership with Flikk is one it also hopes will introduce even more esports fans to its franchise. In its announcement, the company highlighted how Fr\u00f8slev has a combined social media following of around 240,000 across his channels, comprising 36,000 followers on Instagram (three times that of Guild itself), 60,800 on YouTube, 67,200 on Twitch, and 74,000 on Twitter.\nSpeaking about his latest move, Flikk said: \u201cGuild is the perfect fit for me, and I\u2019m determined to continue building on Guild\u2019s success, and my own personal achievements. The Guild organization has been really welcoming and helped me settle in, and I\u2019m eager now to get started and focus on my performance.\u201d\nCarleton Curtis, the executive chairman at Guild, added: \u201cWe are extremely proud of our latest signing with Flikk, and can\u2019t wait to see what he brings to the table as our inaugural Fornite pro-player. This signing marks another exciting move for Guild as we expand into a new esports discipline with Fornite and its enormous player base of over 350 million registered players.\u201d"

At the heart of its operations is CEO Carleton Curtis, the creator of the Overwatch League and Call of Duty Leagues, whose roles at Activision and Red Bull taught him more than a thing or to about branding and competition.\nThe market listing means that Guild becomes the first esports franchise to join the LSE.

Guild also plans to continually raise revenues through tournament winnings, sponsorship, merchandise, events, digital marketing opportunities and more.\nDirector of corporate finance at Zeus Capital Jamie Peel said: \u201cThe gaming industry has exploded in popularity, with esports quickly becoming a mainstream form of entertainment.

      "text": "Guild Esports, the London-based gaming organization part-owned by David Beckham, has announced its latest step in its aims to become an established lifestyle brand, signing a three-year sponsorship and merchandising deal with Danish sports and fashion manufacturer Hummel. With it, Guild has gained its first-ever \u201cofficial technical kit partner\u201d.\nThe new range of Guild products, which are scheduled to go on sale on October 1, includes a new jersey to be worn by Guild professional players, as well as a lifestyle hoodie, sweatpants, headwear, and luggage. Hummel also gains exclusive rights to the production and sale of Guild-branded apparel.\nGuild will receive a \u201cdouble-digit share\u201d of merchandising revenues sold through Hummel, with performance-linked bonuses; Guild projects the combined value of sponsorship and merchandising to be worth approximately \u00a31 million ($1.24 million) over three years. This could rise in line with high-street aspirations, as the pair are exploring opportunities to sell Guild-branded apparel in major retailers across the U.K. and Ireland\u2013a market that\u2019s yet to be tapped on a large scale by any esports team.\nThe agreement comes hot on the heels of Team Vitality\u2019s own partnership with Denmark\u2019s foremost sportswear company after it penned a three-year deal with Hummel in January. Red Bull Racing Esports signed a deal with the company in 2021; Danish esports giant Astralis was, perhaps unsurprisingly, Hummel\u2019s first high-ticket partnership in the esports space.\nOutside of esports, Hummel has become a cult brand during its 100-year history, striking deals with teams including Real Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur, and Everton FC, as well as the Danish national soccer team. Its iconic chevron-based designs are making a comeback, though it\u2019s yet to be confirmed whether this unique quirk will make its way onto Guild Esports\u2019 jerseys.\nJasmine Skee, who became the UK\u2019s only female CEO of a publicly listed esports organization when she was appointed to Guild\u2019s top role in January, said her company has done an impressive job attracting well-known brands to sponsor its organization\u2013including Sky Broadband, Coca-Cola, Subway, and Samsung\u2013and she was proud to unveil its first-ever technical kit partner.\n\u201cThis partnership shows the unique and consistent attraction of esports to brands across multiple sectors, even those not typically associated with gaming,\u201d she says. \u201cHummel has its roots in traditional sports such as football, but nevertheless, the brand is a big believer in the future of esports and the partnership with Guild puts the Hummel brand front and center with the young, engaged audience that makes up Guild\u2019s fanbase. This is a big draw for brands whilst Gen Z\u2019s market power is growing and while digital natives continue to flock to esports.\n\u201cHummel and Guild have been brought together not just by Guild\u2019s audience, but by our shared brand values. We\u2019re committed to furthering equality across esports and gaming, particularly in providing opportunities for women. We\u2019re delighted that our all-female teams in Valorant and CS:GO will compete in shirts created by a company just as supportive of them as we are. We are proud to work with a brand that shares our deep convictions.\n\u201cGuild is demonstrating esports\u2019 brand magnetism. With more fans than rugby or baseball, and able to engage with the notoriously difficult-to-reach Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha demographics, esports is the future.\u201d\nAllan Vad Nielsen, CEO of Hummel, was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the opportunity to welcome Guild Esports to its line-up of sports teams. He added: \u201cAs a brand, we have always been committed to developing local communities and promoting diversity and inclusion, and we see these values reflected in Guild\u2019s approach to esports.\n\u201cGuild\u2019s unique talent pipeline based on the traditional sports academy model aligns with our vision of building a strong foundation for the future of esports, and we look forward to work together to empower and inspire the next generation of esports athletes and fans.\u201d"

Despite being just 16 years old, he has won over $200,000 from 28 high-profile events.\nTaySon will join Nikolaj \u201cFlikk\u201d Fr\u00f8slev\u2013who joined Guild last November\u2013as well as Henrik \u201cHen\u201d Mclean and Anas \u201cAnas\u201d El-Abd, who together won January\u2019s Cash Cup trio. The newcomer\u2019s first opportunity to represent Guild will be in the upcoming FNCS season qualifier on February 5.\nAlways one to understand the potential of social media following, Beckham\u2019s Guild\u2013which looks to consolidate its own position on a variety of networks\u2013excitedly noted that Star\u010di\u010d\u2019s combined social following across Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube stands at one million. ESTNN also named him one of its 2020 Fortnite Players of the Year.\nGrant Rousseau, Guild\u2019s director of esports, said: \u201cSigning TaySon shows that we have no plans to slow down in 2021\u2013we\u2019re ready to take things to another level and cement our position as the Fortnite team to beat. We\u2019re the squad to watch out for this year, and we\u2019re ready for our rivals to try to catch us.\u201d\nTaySon said of the deal: \u201cI\u2019m really proud of how far I\u2019ve come, and to be ranked as the number-one player in Europe, I\u2019m now ready to take the next step with Guild. I\u2019m determined to make myself into an even better player with the help and support of my new team, and bring home trophies for Guild. You\u2019ll be seeing us take over the league tables again soon, so you better keep watching!\u201d\nWhile Guild is focusing heavily on expanding its professional teams with major talent, it was also quick to diversify its portfolio into lifestyle products. Late last year, Beckham unveiled its first-ever clothing range, which the company plans to expand in the near future."

Since the start of 2021, Guild has attracted top-tier talent, launched a clothing range, and engineered partnerships with Subway and HyperX. Crucially, it scored its first two major tournament wins with the Fortnite Championship Series European Grand Finals in March and the Rocket League EU Spring Regional this month.\nThese major breakthroughs are in no small part due to the vision and leadership provided by the company\u2019s executive chairman, Carleton Curtis, whose long career in esports marketing prepared him for a new challenge with Guild: creating a globally recognized brand from scratch, and developing a fanbase he describes as \u201cfar-reaching and diverse, transcending culture and geography.\u201d\nTo succeed, Curtis looks to embody the values the word Guild suggests: an association of talented people, pursuing a common goal, where the focus is placed more on developing players\u2019 health and mental well-being than their competitive skills\u2013as \u201cthis is where in-game success must start.\u201d\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nCurtis, 44, joined Guild from Activision Blizzard, where he helped create and manage the Overwatch League, Call Of Duty League, and Major League Gaming. Before this, he led the esports division at Red Bull, managing partnerships, live events, teams, athletes, social media, and more.\nWorking alongside fervent esports supporter Beckham\u2013who he says \u201chas a hands-on role developing Guild and our organization\u2019s culture\u201d and is \u201ckey to finding new talent through our academy,\u201d Curtis hopes to build a brand, culture, and squad of athletes that will finally destroy the stereotypes that continue to hold the industry back in the eyes of typical sports fans.\n\u201cThe industry is still quite young and in the early stages of its journey,\u201d he says. \u201cAs it matures and establishes itself as a core form of mainstream entertainment, it will professionalize\u2013and I want to use my experience to help Guild offer a lifestyle and entertainment experience that extends beyond core esports.\u201d\nWhile 2020 proved to be a uniquely destructive year, the wider social response to Covid-19\u2013people seeking entertainment from the safety of their own homes\u2013has helped Guild make an even bigger impression than predicted, even with its bullish growth strategy.\n\u201cThe pandemic has started to show the world how accessible esports is, and how it has broad appeal across many sections of society,\u201d Curtis explains. \u201cUnlike traditional sports\u2013where seasons and tournaments have faced widespread interruptions\u20132020 has been a lifeline for esports, and its safe virtual interactions have helped the industry grow and attract new audiences.\u201d\nHowever, there have still been challenges to overcome for Guild, which was tasked with creating and training its teams while operating under social distancing conditions\u2013something that\u2019s not as easy as you may expect. \u201cTeam interaction is vital to success, and restrictions have meant we\u2019ve had to pivot how our coaches and athletes practice and train,\u201d Curtis says.\nWhile he concedes that Guild is better-placed to adjust to this than traditional sports teams, it has still had a notable impact on what he believes is a revolutionary approach to coaching at his organization\u2013one he hopes will create a blueprint for other major players in esports.\n\u201cWe offer a drastic change in the traditional approach of esports organizations\u2013we don\u2019t just aim to represent ourselves, but the industry as a whole,\u201d Curtis explains.\nMuch like its co-owner Beckham, Guild looks to the English Premier League as a way to make its mark: specifically, an academy model based on the EPL\u2019s \u201cproven and highly professional player development systems,\u201d but with an equal focus on players\u2019 minds and bodies. As restrictions ease, Guild will be even more hands-on with its personalized, one-on-one approach.\n\u201cNurturing youth talent and building the esports stars of the future is at heart of what Guild is setting out to achieve; our ethos is to make esports a truly inclusive haven for everyone,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cOur training focuses on the physical health and mental well-being of our players, raising the bar for excellence in esports by focusing on the complete player, on top of the in-game training. It\u2019s a holistic and calibrated regimen.\u201d\nWhile Guild has attracted established talent to its roster, this is only the beginning of a long-term vision of success. Signings follow lengthy scouting processes, taking note of individual talents and reviewing what each athlete can offer its existing teams. \u201cA great player isn\u2019t always a good fit for your team composition, and may clash with established roles,\u201d he explains.\nThe results are already speaking for themselves: Guild now operates the number-one ranked Fortnite team in Europe (including Hen, Flikk, Anas, JannisZ and TaySon), a top-five Rocket League squad (Deevo, ThO and Noly), a top-three FIFA player (NRaseck), and a Valorant crew \u201cmaking big waves.\u201d\nStill the canny businessman, Curtis doesn\u2019t overlook the importance of social media; indeed, with each new signing announcement, Guild proudly highlights each athlete\u2019s existing social presence and the positive impact it will bring the organization. However, coaching extends to these mediums, too\u2013understandable, given how even innocent mistakes can lead to a public outcry.\nHe adds: \u201cOur players are highly trained not only in their career disciplines, but also in how to use their public platforms to show off the vision that Guild has for the wider industry.\u201d\nSometimes, Guild is acquiring talent to specifically connect with these audiences, such as its recent signings of variety streamers Niki \u201cNihachu\u201d and Georgina \u201cGee Nelly\u201d Rose Nelson. \u201cViewers are able to get an exciting introduction into the world of esports via their favorite creators and figures,\u201d Curtis adds. \u201cWe always want to have something new to offer.\u201d\nLooking ahead, he says that Guild is in an excellent position, with sponsorship deals in advanced negotiations and the organization \u201con track to deliver even stronger growth in 2021.\u201d Its roster continues to expand, too; Curtis believes his young company is \u201cwell positioned to achieve high rankings in tournaments, bringing in even more fans\u201d in the weeks and months to come.\n\u201cOur fans have learned to expect the best from us, and as we continue to expand our operations we are committed to maintaining a standard that enhances the legitimacy of the industry,\u201d Curtis concludes. \u201c2021 is going to be full of even more surprises, unveils, and exciting announcements. Suffice to say, it's going to be a very good year to be a fan of Guild.\u201d"

The company has penned a 10-year property lease for a 9,831 square foot facility at the center of the city\u2019s rapidly expanding technology hub, with a view to opening in Q2.\nGuild Esports promises a state-of-the-art space for its teams to develop their talents, modelled partly on football academies established by English Premier League clubs, including esports training rooms, equipment, and gaming spaces. Specialist fitness staff will also be available, reflecting Guild\u2019s desire to support the mental and physical well-being of its players and budding pros.\nAs for the wider operations of the company, 2 Chance St will house a dedicated content and editing suite, streaming rooms to drive content production, as well as an extensive roof terrace that will be used to host Guild events and sponsor-led campaigns. There will also be a Guild merchandise shop on street level, where the team anticipates a high footfall.\nAs is swiftly becoming a core strategy for esports teams, Guild is already exploring the commercialization, branding, and sponsorship opportunities that its new HQ can provide, including naming rights for the building; discussions with potential sponsors are already happening.\nOn the latest development for his team, Beckham said: \u201cI am really excited by the new global headquarters for Guild, which also sees the creation of a new home for the Guild Academy.\n\u201cThis marks the next important stage in building Guild\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s top esports organizations and it will be a focal point for our players, creators, and our many global fans.\u201d\nChief executive of Guild Esports Kal Hourd added: \u201cThe creation of an iconic location for our Guild Academy and headquarters in London\u2019s hottest technology hub will serve as a beacon and inspiration to our global fanbase, content creators, sponsors, and other stakeholders.\n\u201cIn addition to nurturing new talent and providing state of the art training grounds for our pro teams, we also expand upon brand recognition and unlock a range of commercialization opportunities, which we look forward to realizing in due course.\u201d"

Memberships will include two monthly sessions and access to all telemetric data to demonstrate areas of improvement.\nGuild Esports entered sim racing in 2023, following a successful \u00a3600,000 ($734,000) fundraiser, but it has already found success.
