  "title": "Michigan scandal timeline: Detailing Wolverines' NCAA run-ins late in Jim Harbaugh tenure",
  "description": "Here's a look at Michigan football's various scandals and NCAA run-ins during the final years of Jim Harbaugh's tenure with the Wolverines",
  "content": "By the end of his nine-year run as Michigan\u2019s football coach, Jim Harbaugh had transformed his alma mater into one of the top programs nationally, fulfilling the high expectations that greeted him when he was hired in December 2014.\n\nIn each of Harbaugh\u2019s final three seasons, the Wolverines won the Big Ten and made the College Football Playoff. They ended an agonizingly long losing streak to rival Ohio State, beating the Buckeyes in each of Harbaugh\u2019s final three years in Ann Arbor. In what would be his final act as Michigan\u2019s coach, Harbaugh helped lead the Wolverines to the College Football Playoff national championship at the end of the 2023 season, giving Michigan its first national title since 1997.\n\nAt a certain point, though, Harbaugh\u2019s Wolverines found themselves in the headlines just as much for their off-field transgressions as their on-field triumphs.\n\nThe final stretch of Harbaugh\u2019s Michigan tenure was mired in controversy, with the football program he had built into a behemoth at the center of multiple NCAA scandals.\n\nFirst, there was an NCAA investigation centered around impermissible contact Harbaugh had with recruits and players while access to them was limited during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCAA found that Harbaugh \"engaged in unethical conduct, failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance and violated head coach responsibility obligations\u201d and it handed him a four-year show cause.\n\nWhat followed was even more seismic. In October 2023, news first broke that the Wolverines were being investigated for illegal in-person scouting of future opponents, a scheme centered around previously little-known Michigan staffer Connor Stalions. After nearly two full and seldom uninteresting years, that saga came to a close on Aug. 15, with the NCAA slapping the Wolverines with what\u2019s projected to be a $30 million fine, suspending head coach Sherrone Moore for one game during the 2026 season, and handing Harbaugh and Stalions show causes of 10 and eight years, respectively.\n\nWith that turbulent, albeit incredibly successful, stretch in Michigan\u2019s long and storied history nearing its end, pending an appeal of the ruling from Michigan, here\u2019s a look back at some of the major events of the final years of Harbaugh\u2019s tenure:\n\nJan. 5, 2023: Michigan receives a draft of an NCAA notice of allegations in which the organization details allegations of impermissible contact with recruits during a dead period in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an off-field analyst being involved in on-field coaching. At the time, it is reported that Harbaugh met with recruits and bought them hamburgers at the Brown Jug, a popular restaurant near the school\u2019s Ann Arbor campus.\n\nJan. 20, 2023: Michigan co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss is fired after the university said he failed to attend a meeting to discuss whether he had received unauthorized access to computer accounts assigned to other people in December 2022. University police had confirmed there was an active investigation into potential computer crimes at Michigan\u2019s football facility, Schembechler Hall.\n\nMay 20, 2023: Three days after he was brought on as Michigan\u2019s assistant director of football recruiting, Glenn \"Shemy\" Schembechler, the son of legendary Wolverines coach Bo Schembechler, resigns after it was revealed he had liked a series of offensive Twitter posts, including from accounts that contended that slavery and Jim Crow segregation had positive effects on Black people and families.\n\nAug. 12, 2023: The NCAA takes the unusual step of publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation, with vice president of hearing operations Derrick Crawford noting in a statement that \"The Michigan infractions case is related to impermissible on and off-campus recruiting during the COVID-19 dead period and impermissible coaching activities \u2014 not a cheeseburger.\u201d\n\nAug. 21, 2023: Michigan suspends Harbaugh for the first three games of the upcoming season. The Wolverines go 3-0 in those contests, defeating East Carolina, UNLV and Bowling Green with four different head coaches.\n\nOct. 18, 2023: The NCAA notifies Michigan and the Big Ten that it has received allegations that the Wolverines were involved in a sign-stealing operation that involved advanced, in-person scouting that is illegal under NCAA rules. Harbaugh denied being a part of the scheme or having knowledge of it. One day later, it is revealed that the probe is centered around Michigan off-field analyst Connor Stalions, who reportedly purchased tickets in his own name to games at 12 different Big Ten schools in order to have people film the signals used by coaches of upcoming Wolverines opponents.\n\nOct. 26, 2023: Michigan confirms the FBI has joined the investigation into Weiss\u2019 unauthorized access into computer accounts.\n\nOct. 31, 2023: Central Michigan announces it\u2019s investigating photographs of a man who resembles Stalions, wearing sunglasses and a Chippewas hat, standing on the team\u2019s sideline for its game earlier that season against Michigan State.\n\nNov. 3, 2023: Stalions resigns from his position at Michigan, noting in a statement to The Athletic that he did \u201cnot want to be a distraction.\u201d\n\nNov. 10, 2023: The Big Ten suspends Harbaugh for the final three games of the regular season, citing a violation of the league\u2019s sportsmanship policy. Michigan files a temporary restraining order, but eventually drops the case and accepts the punishment. With offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore serving as the interim head coach, the Wolverines go 3-0 in those games, highlighted by wins against top-10 Penn State and Ohio State teams.\n\nNov. 17, 2023: Linebackers coach Chris Partridge is fired by the school after he allegedly destroyed evidence on a computer related to the sign-stealing scandal. Partridge, now an assistant coach with the Seattle Seahawks, denies the claim and is ultimately cleared of the allegation by the NCAA's August 15 findings.\n\nJan. 8, 2024: Michigan defeats Washington 34-13 in the championship game of the College Football Playoff, giving the Wolverines their first national title since 1997. Harbaugh says after the game that \"We stood strong and tall because we knew we were innocent\u201d when asked about the ongoing investigations into his program.\n\nJan. 24, 2024: Harbaugh leaves Michigan after nine seasons to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers. Two days later, Moore is elevated to head coach.\n\nMarch 16, 2024: Newly hired defensive line coach Greg Scruggs is arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated in Ann Arbor, with a blood alcohol level that\u2019s double the legal limit. He resigns five days later.\n\nApril 15, 2024: Michigan recruiting staffer and former star quarterback Denard Robinson is arrested after being involved in a single-car crash at 3 a.m. in Ann Arbor while intoxicated. He\u2019s suspended and one month later, the university confirms he\u2019s no longer with the program.\n\nAug. 5, 2024: A leaked notice of allegations from the NCAA states that Moore deleted a thread of 52 text messages with Stalions the same day reports first surfaced about the sign-stealing operation. Two days later, Harbaugh is given a one-year suspension and a four-year show cause by the NCAA for his role in the COVID recruiting violations.\n\nMarch 20, 2025: Weiss is indicted by the FBI on 14 counts of unauthorized access and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft. According to the indictment, Weiss hacked into university computer systems and accessed personal data of over 3,000 Michigan athletes, most of whom were women. The next day, Weiss is sued by two former Michigan athletes, who allege he accessed their private information for his personal use. At least 74 women have joined the lawsuit.\n\nMay 5, 2025: As part of a self-imposed sanction, Michigan suspends Moore for two games for the upcoming football season \u2013 a Week 3 matchup against Central Michigan and a Week 4 game against Nebraska.\n\nJune 27, 2025: Harbaugh and former Michigan president Santa Ono are among the 48 people from the university added to the lawsuit against Weiss. Plaintiffs allege that the school knew about Weiss hacking into computer systems, but still allowed him to coach in the Wolverines\u2019 semifinal loss to TCU in the College Football Playoff at the end of the 2022 season.\n\nJuly 29, 2025: Central Michigan receives a notice of allegations from the NCAA over its role in Stalions\u2019 sign-stealing scheme.\n\nAug. 15, 2025: The NCAA issues its findings in the Michigan in-person scouting case, including a 10-year show-cause for Harbaugh, eight years for Stalions, three years for Robinson and two years for Moore. Moore is also suspended for a game. Michigan announces hours later it will appeal the ruling.\n\nAug. 15, 2025: The NCAA's finding repeatedly reference Harbaugh's lack of cooperation in the investigation into Michigan and his status as a repeat offender. According to the NCAA in a section subtitled \"Head coach responsibility:\"\n\n\"The scouting scheme and recruiting violations in the football program demonstrate that Harbaugh violated the principles of head coach responsibility. Harbaugh did not embrace or enforce a culture of compliance during his tenure, and his program had a contentious relationship with Michigan's compliance office, leading coaches and staff to disregard NCAA rules.\n\n\"For the scouting violations that occurred during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, Harbaugh failed to demonstrate that he adequately promoted compliance or monitored his program. Harbaugh is also automatically responsible for the scouting and recruiting violations that occurred after Jan. 1, 2023. \"",

      "text": "Michigan escaped postseason ban, but know this: NCAA says U-M cheated, tainting title\nWhatever else you think of the punishment the NCAA handed down to Michigan football, know this: college football\u2019s governing body said the Wolverines cheated, tainting their 2023 College Football Playoff championship.\nThat\u2019s a price \u2013 a heavy one if you believe in karma.\nJust not enough of one for those without blue blood in their veins. Because after nearly two years of investigating an unprecedented sign-stealing scandal, the NCAA found more than enough evidence to issue a postseason ban \u2013 and then let the Wolverines off the hook.\nWorse, folks who helped oversee the investigation met with reporters Thursday afternoon and used words like \u201cKGB\u201d and \u201ccounterintelligence\u201d to describe what they\u2019d found.\nActually, they found that Connor Stalions, the former U-M staffer who orchestrated the sign-stealing scheme, described his cadre of football strategy spies as the \u201cKGB,\u201d and their work as \u201ccounterintelligence.\u201d\nThey also found that Stalions tossed his phone in a pond, destroyed materials, told witnesses to lie, and that those in his circle hinted an outside source funded the entire operation \u2013 though the NCAA couldn\u2019t corroborate that.\nStill, it looks bad. Just as it looks bad that former coach Jim Harbaugh refused to talk or share emails, another point the NCAA made Thursday.\nWait, there\u2019s more: Harbaugh didn\u2019t get along with U-M's compliance office, according to the NCAA. And some in his program said the football side viewed the rules side as \u201cscum of the earth.\u201d\nMichigan, and its supporters, will have to live with the perception these images create for decades. They\u2019ll have to live with this statement, too:\n\u201cSome of the witnesses believed that senior members of the football staff had no interest in knowing,\u201d said Norman Bay, the NCAA\u2019s chief hearing officer on the case.\nBut then Michigan won a national title, and beat Ohio State repeatedly, and, in the end, only had to write some checks \u2013 part of the NCAA penalty is a $50,000 fine and 10% of the football program\u2019s budget, along with a fine equivalent to the anticipated loss of all postseason competition revenue sharing for the 2025 and 2026 football seasons.\nThat could be upwards of $30 million if you include the cost of 10% of the scholarships awarded during the 2025-26 academic year, another fine the NCAA levied. So, yes, financial consequences. Add in a 25% reduction in recruiting visits during the 2025-26 period and that will be felt, too.\n(Well, once it's finally settled; the school announced Friday it plans to appeal, saying, in part, \"the decision makes fundamental errors in interpreting NCAA bylaws; and it includes a number of conclusions that are directly contrary to the evidence \u2013 or lack of evidence \u2013 in the record. We will appeal this decision to ensure a fair result, and we will consider all other options.\")\nAs for current coach Sherrone Moore? The NCAA tacked on a one-game suspension \u2013 to be served in the 2026 opener \u2013 to go with the self-imposed two-game suspension earlier this year (with Moore set to miss Weeks 3 and 4, against Central Michigan and Nebraska).\nDespite the fines and curtailments in recruiting \u2013 and the extra game for Moore, who deleted a string of text messages with Stalions; the NCAA didn\u2019t find any evidence Moore knew about the sign-stealing scheme \u2013 many will view the NCAA\u2019s ultimate message as soft.\nIt was.\nThe NCAA had a chance to hammer home that compromising the spirit of competition should never be acceptable.\nIt didn\u2019t. Not fully.\nThis isn\u2019t surprising, not when you sift through the numbers.\nThe most relevant one: 6.5 million.\nNo, that isn\u2019t how much the NCAA is fining Michigan for losing control of the face of its brand. That number, as noted earlier, could be as much as $30 million. That\u2019s not nothing, even in this era of obscene amounts of booster monies.\nBut that 6.5 million? That's how many people who watched U-M beat Alabama last year in the ReliaQuest Bowl on Dec. 31, making it the most watched non-New Year\u2019s Six bowl game for ESPN in nine years.\nNine years!\nIt was also ESPN\u2019s biggest audience for a non-CFP bowl since 2015. Think about that: A 7-5 Michigan squad playing a middling Alabama team \u2013 in the rain \u2013 and setting records.\nThis is the weight the winged helmet carries. It's great for business. And this is business.\nWhile the NCAA can say it didn\u2019t ban U-M from postseason games \u2013 even though it had more than enough evidence to do so \u2013 because it didn\u2019t want to unfairly punish current players, business comes first.\nThis is the takeaway. This will always be the takeaway, now more than ever as the NCAA continues to demonstrate the gutting of its justice division. This actually may be the last big case the NCAA gets to investigate, as the super-conference/NIL/transfer portal era moves the NCAA's watchdog responsibilities to the College Sports Commission.\nNow, it\u2019s true that current players, and almost all the current staff, had no part in the sign-stealing apparatus at the heart of the NCAA\u2019s investigation. Yet each of them knew what U-M was potentially facing when they agreed to play in Ann Arbor.\nThat\u2019s harsh, admittedly. The NCAA hasn\u2019t handed down a postseason ban since Oklahoma State basketball got one in 2020. Yet the freedom of movement for student-athletes is different now, and the NCAA could've adjusted accordingly.\nThe student-athletes are innocent in all this, of course. Yet they chose U-M in the first place, at least in part because of the school\u2019s success when it was breaking rules. It\u2019s messy all around.\nAbout the best thing we can say now is that it\u2019s over. The investigation, anyway.\nBut the speculation? The program\u2019s reputation?\n\u201cWe may never know the full extent to which others in the program knew what Mr. Stalions was doing,\u201d Bay said.\nAnd that\u2019s a shame, for everyone, especially for those who didn\u2019t know \u2013 and never will.\nContact Shawn Windsor: swindsor@freepress.com.

      "text": "Did Jim Harbaugh know about Michigan sign stealing? NCAA: 'Incomplete'\n- The NCAA imposed sanctions on Michigan football for a sign-stealing scheme orchestrated by former staffer Connor Stalions.\n- The NCAA found Stalions' actions were intended to gain a competitive advantage, and that he, along with Jim Harbaugh, failed to cooperate with the investigation.\n- While Harbaugh's involvement in the scheme is unclear, the NCAA found he fostered a culture of non-compliance within the football program.\n- The University of Michigan announced it will appeal the NCAA punishments, which include 4 years of probation and fines that will amass tens of millions of dollars.\nThe NCAA's Committee on Infractions Chair, Norman Bay, held a news conference Friday, Aug. 15, to answer questions about the punishment it imposed on Michigan football for its sign-stealing scandal that went from 2021-23.\nBay made clear at the top of his statement: The goal of Connor Stalions, the former Wolverines staffer and mastermind of the scheme, was obvious when he orchestrated the impermissible in-person advance scouting of 56 separate games of future (or potential future) opponents.\n\"The intent was clear,\" Bay said. \"To gain substantial competitive advantage.\"\nThe NCAA came to its conclusion in a 74-page report made public after gathering evidence including interview testimony, multiple witnesses, videos, photos, a master chart that listed Michigan's opponents and who could attend the games, a google calendar to track those attendees, a document called \"how to steal signals,\" a recorded phone call of Stalions, ticket receipts and transfer data among other evidence.\nStalions purchased tickets to games and then forwarded them to others, be it another staff member, interns student athletes or his own acquaintances. Stalions told them they were participating in \"counterintelligence\" and the group was referred to as the \"KGB\" (also the name of the primary security and intelligence agency of the Soviet Union from 1954-91).\n\"You don't put together a network of individuals called the KGB that records 'dirty film' where the costs is in the tens of thousands of dollars unless you intend to gain a substantial competitive advantage,\" Bay said.\nWhile Bay said the violations Stalions engaged in were deemed as Level I by the NCAA, what \"made this serious violation even more serious\" was U-M's failure to cooperate. Four staffers on U-M's staff \u2014 Stalions, former coach Jim Harbaugh, current coach Sherrone Moore and ex-staffer Denard Robinson \u2014 were found to not follow NCAA directives.\nDid Jim Harbaugh know? The 'record is incomplete'\nHarbaugh, Bay said, had a contentious relationship with the university's compliance office and led coaches and staff to disregard the NCAA rules. After gathering statements and conducting interviews, the NCAA found the monitoring efforts of the chief compliance officer and her U-M staff were \"not welcomed by the football program.\"\n\"They were viewed as 'a thorn in (Harbaugh's) side,' 'a roadblock' and described as 'scum of the earth,'\" Bay said.\nBay was asked if the NCAA found any evidence Harbaugh knew about the internal scouting ring led by a staffer he hired. There's no evidence found by the NCAA that Harbaugh knew about the scheme.\nHowever, the \"record is incomplete,\" Bay said.\nHarbaugh never turned over any emails or text messages, and refused to be interviewed by NCAA enforcement staff.\nAdditionally, any evidence Stalions had was long gone.\nHe smash his phone into \"1,000 pieces\" according to a recording of a phone call obtained by NCAA investigators, and threw that, along with his hard drive, into a pond.\n\"We may never know the full extent to which others in the program were aware of what Mr. Stalions was doing,\" Bay said.\nFinal punishment from NCAA imposed on Michigan\nThe final punishment imposed was multi-faceted: Four years of probation, a multitude of fines that will amass tens of millions of dollars, a three-game suspension for Moore, recruiting sanctions, show-causes for Harbaugh (10 years), Stalions (eight years), Robinson (three years) and Moore (two years).\nWhat it did not include was a postseason ban or the vacating of any of the victories during the time of the infractions. (Still, Michigan announced Friday afternoon it will appeal the NCAA's ruling.)\nThe rationale, per Bay, in part was U-M acted quickly when the NCAA notified the Big Ten and member institutions on Oct. 17, 2013, and there was no evidence \"anything (Stalions) did affected the outcome of Michigan\u2019s games (the rest of) that season,\" which included wins over Penn State, Ohio State, Alabama and Washington to win the national championship.\nThe NCAA determined it did not want to penalize the current student athletes and coaches involved in the program for the transgressions of those in the past, but the report did state the combination of the 2021 NCAA violations (recruiting sanctions) combined with those that were uncovered Friday as well as U-M's unwillingness to cooperate were \"sufficient grounds for a multi-year ban.\"\nSo why didn't they wipe any victories?\n\"Vacation of records is only in play when there\u2019s ineligible competition,\" Bay said. \"That was not a factor present in this case.\"\nA number of staffers under Harbaugh during his tenure have been punished for various infractions.\nFormer Michigan defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and defensive backs coach Steve Clinkscale both agreed to show causes with the NCAA in April for recruiting infractions. Moore, Harbaugh and Robinson are now repeat violators.\nStalions might never work in college football again, though he may return in an athletic-facing capacity if someone hires him after eight years.\nThe public debates have turned to this question: Does the NCAA punishment of Michigan meet the crime?\nDepending on the colors worn on gameday, there are very different answers.\n\"I think the penalty here was very significant,\" Bay said. \"I think it was meaningful, and I think it sends a message to the membership that these rules matter, that having a compliance program and a strong culture of compliance matter, and that schools and individuals that fail to comply will be held accountable.\"\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\nTony Garcia is the Wolverines beat writer for the Detroit Free Press.

      "text": "University of Michigan claps back at NCAA, will appeal sign-stealing punishment\nThe University of Michigan is appealing the NCAA's ruling on the Michigan football program sign-stealing investigation, which did not include a postseason ban, but did fine the school what is expected to be millions of dollars.\nThe school announced its decision Friday, Aug. 15, about four hours after the NCAA publicly issued its ruling.\nU-M self-imposed a two-game suspension (Weeks 3 and 4) on coach Sherrone Moore earlier this year. The NCAA on Friday added an aditional game suspension in 2026, among other punishments.\nStatements Friday came from U-M, athletic director Warde Manuel and Moore, who enters his second year following the January 2024 departure of former coach Jim Harbaugh, who left behind a trail of scandals and staffer arrests, to the NFL.\nHere are those statements in full from U-M:\nUniversity of Michigan statement\n\"We appreciate the work of the Committee on Infractions. But, respectfully, in a number of instances the decision makes fundamental errors in interpreting NCAA bylaws; and it includes a number of conclusions that are directly contrary to the evidence \u2013 or lack of evidence \u2013 in the record. We will appeal this decision to ensure a fair result, and we will consider all other options.\"\nWarde Manuel, Michigan AD, statement\n\"It is never our intent to be in a position where we are accused of any rules violations. I fully support Coach Sherrone Moore, our student-athletes and staff as they prepare for the season ahead. I appreciate Coach Moore\u2019s continued commitment to ensuring his program operates in compliance with applicable rules. I acknowledge the Committee on Infractions\u2019 decision to not penalize our current student-athletes by eliminating postseason opportunities; however, a postseason ban should never have been a consideration in this case. I fully support the university\u2019s decision to pursue an appeal. Coach Moore and I will not have any further comment.\"\nSherrone Moore, Michigan football coach, statement\n\"I am glad that this part of the process has been completed. I greatly respect the rules governing collegiate athletics and it is my intent to have our program comply with those rules at all times. I will continue to focus my attention on our team and the upcoming 2025 season.\"\nNCAA punishments in Michigan football sign-stealing case\nThe university of Michigan\n- Four years of probation.\n- Financial penalties:\n- $50,000 fine, plus 10% of the budget for the football program.\n- A fine equivalent to the anticipated loss of all postseason competition revenue sharing associated with the 2025 and 2026 football seasons.\n- A fine equivalent to the cost of 10% of the scholarships awarded in Michigan's football program for the 2025-26 academic year.\n- A 25% reduction in football official visits during the 2025-26 season.\n- A 14-week prohibition on recruiting communications in the football program during the probation period.\nConnor Stalions\n- An eight-year show-cause order, restricting him from all athletically related activities during the show-cause period.\nJim Harbaugh\n- A 10-year show-cause order, restricting him from all athletically related activities during the show-cause period, which will begin on Aug. 7, 2028, at the conclusion of his four-year show-cause order from a previous case.\nSherrone Moore\n- A two-year show-cause order, during which he is suspended from a total of three games. Michigan self-imposed a two-game suspension for Moore during the upcoming 2025-26 football season. The panel determined that a suspension for one additional game was appropriate. Therefore, Moore also will be suspended for the first game of the 2026-27 season. Apart from the three-game suspension, Moore is not prohibited from engaging in coaching or other athletically related activities during the show-cause period.\nDenard Robinson\n- A three-year show-cause order, restricting him from all athletically related activities during the show-cause period.\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Michigan Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]"

The NCAA imposed a $30\u2011million fine, a 10\u2011year show\u2011cause on Harbaugh, an eight\u2011year show\u2011cause on Stalions, and suspended head coach Sherrone Moore for a game, while Michigan avoided a postseason ban and vacated wins. The university has announced it will appeal the ruling, citing procedural errors and lack of evidence that Harbaugh knew about the scheme. Additional staff misconduct\u2014including arrests of coaches and recruiting staff\u2014further complicated the program\u2019s compliance culture. The case highlights tensions between competitive success and NCAA compliance obligations.",
