  "title": "President Trump Is Targeting Big Pharma With Tariffs",
  "description": "Pharma stocks like Novo Nordisk and Pfizer have dropped amid trade war risks.",
  "content": "On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC he plans to impose levies of up to 250 percent on imported pharmaceuticals, a jump from the 200 percent figure he floated in July. While no action has rolled out yet, pharma stocks dipped on the news, adding pressure to what\u2019s already been a historically bad stretch for healthcare investors. Novo Nordisk has dropped 46 percent in 2025, while Pfizer and Eli Lilly are lagging the S&P 500. Gilead is the only major drugmaker ahead of the benchmark year-to-date, while the rest of the sector has stalled.\n\nThe current setup resembles a \u201csequel to the purge movies,\u201d said Todd Sohn, technical strategist at Strategas Securities. Nearly $26 billion has exited healthcare ETFs since early 2023, making it one of the few sectors facing sustained outflows in a rising market. Trump\u2019s latest threat injects new uncertainty. The proposed tariffs follow his push to revive the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status for the U.S. and his campaign to pressure drugmakers to slash prices. All that leaves pharma stocks in a perfect storm of declining sentiment, policy pressure, and now a potential trade war.\n\nBut the risks go beyond Washington. High interest rates have weighed on pharmaceuticals\u2019 business model all year. The industry relies on multi-year R&D timelines and capital-intensive manufacturing, making it particularly vulnerable to higher financing costs. With Jerome Powell and the Fed hesitant to cut rates, that\u2019s eroded margins and investment appetite for Big Pharma. Meanwhile, structural shifts in the market have also undermined the health sector. Data from Strategas shows passive flows have rotated into cash, crypto, and cyclical ETFs and out of defensives such as healthcare.\n\nConcentration risk exacerbates the issue. The 10 largest S&P 500 stocks now make up roughly 40 percent of the index, leaving little room for the beaten-down corner of the market to gain traction.",

      "text": "Good morning, investors. After a few days off for my wedding in California, I\u2019m glad to be back in your inbox \u2014 now as a married man!\nNaturally, I had to come back in time to report on the key Federal Reserve meeting today. No one expects policymakers to change interest rates this afternoon, but tensions continue to rise inside the Eccles Building.\nFracturing Fed\nJerome Powell\u2019s authority at the Federal Reserve keeps chipping at the edges.\nFor the first time since 1993, more than one Fed governor could vote against the chairman in an official policy decision.\nThat won\u2019t change the outcome \u2014 prediction markets see 97% odds of no adjustment to interest rates \u2014 but a fractured consensus undermines the central bank\u2019s tradition of unity and its leader\u2019s grip on policy.\nTwo of the seven sitting governors, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, have made the case for a rate cut in recent weeks.\nAssuming they both follow through with dissenting votes Wednesday afternoon, it would be the first time that at least two governors have done so in 259 official meetings.\n\u201cIf they don't dissent, then the stock and bond markets could rally significantly on expectations that the FOMC participants are leaning toward cutting [in September], thus placating the two potential dissenters,\u201d said veteran strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.\nBoth Bowman and Waller are Trump appointees, and they have taken some political flak for aligning themselves with the president\u2019s calls for immediate rate cuts.\nThat said, Bowman and Waller have argued that the labor market is not as strong as consensus economists believe.\nTheir case for lower rates is rooted in signs of cooling wage growth and slowing job creation \u2014 an assessment that quietly contradicts the White House\u2019s narrative of economic strength.\nWage growth has moderated the last year (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nIn other words, while their stance aligns with Trump\u2019s preferred policy outcome, it does so for reasons that challenge his messaging.\nRegardless of whether Powell & Co. move forward with rate cuts this summer, his ability to project a sense of cohesion is increasingly in doubt.\nA visible split among the Fed\u2019s ranks risks eroding investors\u2019 confidence in the central bank, adding fuel to Trump\u2019s push to name Powell\u2019s successor well before his term ends in May 2026.\nThe labor market isn\u2019t as strong as most economists think, according to Waller and Bowman (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nA recent CNBC survey found that the leading contenders for the top Fed job include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed official Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett.\nAs Opening Bell Daily has reported all year, Trump has engaged in a colorful war of words with Powell:\n\u201cMr. Too Late\u201d\n\u201cJerome Powell is a real dummy\u201d\n\u201cHe should cut rates by 3%\u201d\n\u201cPowell is a knucklehead\u201d\nWith the name-calling from the Oval Office and successors circling, even symbolic dissent within the Fed could move markets as much as a tangible policy change.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, BitcoinIRA\nWhy smart investors use BitcoinIRA:\nTax Savings: When you trade in an IRA, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes that can be as high as 37%\nTop-Level Security: Assets are custodied with a US based custodian and insured up to $250M\u00b2\nWorld Class Customer Service: BitcoinIRA has a team of IRA specialists that will help guide you through every step of the process\nP.S.

      "text": "Lessons from the end of the financial world\nAnyone can beat the S&P 500 in a good year, but calling the crash that rewrote history requires far more conviction.\nDanny Moses did just that with his team in 2008, immortalized in Michael Lewis\u2019 book The Big Short and the Hollywood movie of the same name. He joined us to explain how that trade reshaped his worldview, what concerns him in today\u2019s markets and what he\u2019s most bullish on this year.\nThis Q&A has been lightly edited for clarity.\nYou were early and right on the trade of a generation. How did that experience reshape your trust in financial markets and the people who run them?\nDanny Moses: It is very difficult to see the literal end of the financial world and then unsee it.\nYou always need to pay attention to how the people peddling financial products are compensated, especially when they are using a bank\u2019s balance sheet to take on risk. It\u2019s always leverage that causes financial chaos.\nNobody, not even us, had any idea how levered the entire system was to really one thing \u2014 home prices.\nThe entire thesis was \u201chome prices never go down.\u201d Rating agencies didn\u2019t even have a model with declining home prices.\nWhen the defaults began and demand dried up, Wall Street pulled the warehouse lines they were providing to mortgage originators, which caused the MBS market to freeze. In some cases, they bought those mortgage companies and brought them in-house.\nI agree that banks became over-regulated after 2008, but it also spawned the proliferation of private equity and private debt. These asset classes lie outside the traditional banking system and, while not posing a systemic threat, should warrant caution \u2014 especially as the product finds its way to retail investors.\nThe same way investors believed that home prices would never drop, it\u2019s similar to the \u201cmark to model\u201d vs. \u201cmark to market\u201d we are seeing in the private markets.\nWhat concerns you most about today\u2019s financial landscape?\nDM: I\u2019m concerned that investor and consumer protections are being weakened through changes at the SEC, CFPB and other government agencies.\nThe advent of meme stocks, meme coins and giving retail investors access to sophisticated products \u2014 including private investments \u2014 screams \u201ccaveat emptor.\u201d\nThe biggest risk to the entire system is higher long-term rates [10-year Treasury yields]. A financialized economy can\u2019t grow or function smoothly in that scenario.\nThe same way the GFC was all about home prices, that\u2019s what 10-year yields represent today. We shifted risk from banks post-2008 to the government balance sheet. Gold and BTC are rallying while the dollar weakens \u2014 all signs of concern.\nWe are kicking the can on deficits and debt-to-GDP. We\u2019re not pricing in a recession.\nWhat happens to government receipts if the economy begins to contract?\nThe S&P 500 versus recession periods in last 75 years (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nWhat risks do you think retail investors are underestimating today?\nDM: This market has been the antithesis of behavioral finance \u2014 it\u2019s been about fastest access to information and execution vs. fundamental research and valuations.\n\u201cThis time is different\u201d can work for periods of time but not over the long run.\nEven secular themes like AI eventually become cyclical. Stick to quality and express themes through great companies like Alphabet that have great balance sheets, a global presence, and exposure to growth trends.\nLook no further than some public companies shifting their strategy and using their balance sheets to buy crypto \u2014 and in some cases issuing debt and equity to do it. Some of these companies trade at 2-4x their underlying asset value.\nAs an investor, why not just buy the crypto in an ETF to express that theme? It\u2019s inevitable that the gap narrows over time.\nThe moral hazard created post-GFC has baked in a BTFD [buy the f*cking dip] mentality.\nWhich sectors or themes are you most optimistic about over the next 12 months?\nDM: Energy. Especially nuclear. It\u2019s rare to find a theme both sides of the aisle agree on.\nWith the advent of AI, energy supply is needed and we are seeing capex and dealmaking in every area \u2014 the grid, nuclear plant construction, uranium mining.\nThe traditional energy sector [oil and gas] has gone through a massive transformation over the last several years because of ESG initiatives and M&A.\nThat\u2019s left fewer companies with healthier balance sheets. Current rig counts are at five-year lows and with oil in the mid-$60s, the sector looks undervalued.\nThe energy sector is under a 4% weighting in the S&P 500, and the long-term average is 7%.\nThe S&P 500 energy sector has lagged in 2025 (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nWhat\u2019s your current view on bitcoin, and how has it changed over time?\nThe advent of Bitcoin ETFs created not only a new avenue for buyers \u2014 including institutional capital \u2014 but also credibility, given that firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity are sponsors.\nThe reasons to own Bitcoin have changed over the years, and have evolved to a \u201cstore of value\u201d and a hedge against central bank and government incompetence, as no real commercial use case has developed.

For today\u2019s edition, we\u2019re unpacking why the central bank may skip rate cuts entirely until next year.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nWhat if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut at all?\nBond traders, prediction markets, and traditional data all point to rate cuts starting as soon as September, yet two of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks aren\u2019t buying it.\nStrategists at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley told clients they do not expect a single rate cut until at least 2026, even after Friday\u2019s dismal jobs data, which showed the US added just 73,000 jobs in July, far weaker than expected.\nWhile Opening Bell Daily remains in the camp that the central bank should have started lowering interest rates months ago, the no-cut argument should still be taken seriously.\nInterest rates still hover at multi-decade highs (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nBank of America\u2019s view hinges on a key distinction \u2014 markets are mistaking stagflation for a recession.\n\u201cLabor supply has cratered due to immigration restrictions,\u201d BofA economists wrote. \u201cSo while demand has also weakened, labor slack hasn\u2019t increased.\u201d\nThey point to stable unemployment and steady wage growth as evidence that the slowdown stems more from constrained supply than collapsing demand.\n\u201cThe downward revisions to job growth in May and June were undeniably concerning,\u201d BofA economists added.\n\u201cBut the silver lining is that more than half of the revisions were due to seasonal factors and public payrolls.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley agrees that the labor market has softened, though its team argues that inflation remains too sticky to justify rate cuts.\n\u201cTariff-related inflation could limit the Fed\u2019s dovish reaction function,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley strategists.\nFed Chair Powell has similarly pointed out that inflationary pressures from President Trump\u2019s trade policy still haven\u2019t fully filtered through to consumer prices.\n\u201cOur house view continues to be that the Fed won\u2019t cut this year, but will end up cutting more than expected next year,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists said.\nInflation has come in cooler-than-expected every month this year (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nIncidentally, both banks are now at odds with futures markets, which assign a roughly 90% probability for a 25-basis-point rate cut in September.\nThey also contrast with Goldman Sachs, which reiterated its view Monday that the US economy is near \u201cstall speed\u201d and so the Fed will deliver three rate cuts in a row starting next month.\nGoldman\u2019s economists estimate that underlying job growth has cratered to less than 50,000 payrolls a month \u2014 a level that has historically triggered rate cuts.\nPayroll growth has slowed over recent months (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nUltimately, the debate comes back to Powell\u2019s own words: \u201cIt\u2019s the unemployment rate.\u201d\nTo policymakers, that figure takes precedent over payroll growth or economic activity.\nAnd while hiring and job growth have lost momentum, the jobless rate remains historically low at 4.2%.\nThe unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2% last month (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nFor Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, that\u2019s not enough to justify rate cuts, regardless of markets betting on looser monetary policy.\nFrom the banks\u2019 perspective \u2014 though Opening Bell Daily disagrees \u2014 the Fed still risks moving too early rather than too late.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, BitcoinIRA\nWhy smart investors use BitcoinIRA:\nTax Savings: When you trade in an IRA, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes that can be as high as 37%\nTop-Level Security: Assets are custodied with a US based custodian and insured up to $250M\u00b2\nWorld Class Customer Service: BitcoinIRA has a team of IRA specialists that will help guide you through every step of the process\nP.S.

      "text": "Good morning, investors. Earnings season is underway and stocks keep hitting new records, yet the most important topic across Wall Street and Washington is Fed independence and what a post-Jerome Powell Fed looks like.\nBigger problem than Powell\nInvestors may finally get the rate cuts they\u2019ve been waiting for, but they may not like the way they arrive.\nMarkets should be asking how the Fed eases policy as much as they ask when. If political pressure \u2014 rather than economic data \u2014 drives the next move, it risks weakening the central bank\u2019s credibility and undermining global trust in US monetary policy.\nThat tension has come into sharper focus over the last several days:\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for a sweeping review of the entire Federal Reserve system\nRepublican US Representative Anna Paulina Luna formally referred Fed Chair Jerome Powell to the Justice Department over alleged misleading testimony to Congress\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said he will vote for an immediate rate cut\n\u201c[H]as the organization succeeded in its mission? If this were the FAA and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why this has happened.\u201d Bessent said.\nThe Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate hovers near multi-decade highs (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nAnd while President Trump has denied rumors that he plans to fire Powell, he has repeatedly slammed him for mismanaging the Fed. Among the president\u2019s recent quotes on the chairman:\n\u201cPowell is a knucklehead.\u201d\n\u201cJerome Powell is a real dummy.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Too Late\u201d\n\u201cHe should cut interest rates by 3% and do it immediately.\u201d\nTo be clear, the president, investors, and everyday Americans are right to be frustrated with Powell\u2019s inaction.\nOpening Bell Daily does believe the data warrants rate cuts.\nBut even so, eroding the Fed\u2019s credibility poses a long-term risk to markets.\nCPI has come in cooler-than-expected every month of the year (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nAs Opening Bell Daily reported Monday, Fed Governor Waller\u2019s call for a cut is logically consistent \u2014 inflation has indeed moderated and the labor market is cracking.\nBut the timing of his speech has raised political questions. If Waller or someone like him succeeds Powell, then markets will be justified in questioning whether the Fed\u2019s decisions are driven by data or the White House.\nThe global financial system rests, in part, on the idea that the Fed operates above the political fray.\nUndermining that now \u2014 with US debt at record highs \u2014 could invite far more volatility than any single rate decision.\n\u201cFiring Powell might be the quickest way to incentivize central banks to find [an alternative to US Treasurys],\u201d wrote veteran economist Ed Yardeni in a note to clients early Monday.\nMarkets will continue to cheer the prospect of lower rates. But if global investors sense even a whiff of political coercion, it may not matter how low the Fed goes.\nCredibility, once shaken, is harder to restore than interest rates are to adjust.\nIn the near-term, monetary easing will likely lift asset prices.\nBut beyond that, a Fed that appears politically compromised could send bond yields higher, weaken the dollar, and prompt foreign holders of US Treasurys to question America\u2019s economic leadership.\nMarket snapshot\nA message from our partner, BitcoinIRA\nWhy smart investors use BitcoinIRA:\nTax Savings: When you trade in an IRA, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes that can be as high as 37%\nTop-Level Security: Assets are custodied with a US based custodian and insured up to $250M\u00b2\nWorld Class Customer Service: BitcoinIRA has a team of IRA specialists that will help guide you through every step of the process\nP.S.

The Nasdaq Composite closed higher for the sixth trading day in a row, and the S&P 500 eked out an all-time high of its own despite a late-day pullback.\n\ud83c\udfe6Jerome Powell has been referred to the DOJ for criminal charges. A Republican lawmaker said it\u2019s based on his $2.5 billion renovation to the Federal Reserve building, and Powell is accused of lying about the project\u2019s scope. However, no formal charges have been filed. (Reuters)\n\ud83d\udcc8Consumers are ramping up spending.

      "text": "Welcome back from the weekend, investors. Investors just took in a slate of \u201cgood news\u201d economic data and the stock market is hovering at record highs as a result. Equities would rise even further if one Fed official gets his out-of-consensus preference next week.\nClear and present dissent\nAt least one policymaker at the Federal Reserve will dissent against Jerome Powell at the July meeting.\nIn a bold and unusually direct speech to close out last week, Fed Governor Christopher Waller laid out the case for an immediate rate cut.\nHe made it clear that he\u2019s prepared to vote for it before the end of the month, even if others aren\u2019t.\nHe built his argument with two core reasons:\nInflation is near the Fed\u2019s 2% target\nThe labor market is weaker than it looks\nIn an explicit divergence from Powell, he asserted that talk of tariffs fueling inflation is mostly noise.\n\u201cTariff increases are a one-time boost to prices that do not sustainably increase inflation,\u201d Waller said in prepared remarks in New York.\nWaller does not believe tariffs will cause sustained inflation increases (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nHe pointed out that wage growth has cooled, productivity is improving, and inflation expectations remain anchored \u2014 which together point to no threat of rebounding prices.\nMeanwhile, as solid as the economic data has appeared, Waller maintained that beneath the headline numbers cracks are indeed beginning to form.\n\u201cWith inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate,\u201d the Fed Governor said.\nWaller sees policy as too restrictive (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nIn his view, the recent string of government job revisions suggests that private-sector job growth has stalled and job openings are evaporating faster than people assume.\nOn top of that, new grads face the worst job market in years.\nJobs data has held up better than expected all year (Chart courtesy of Exhibit A)\nThe Fed\u2019s current policy rate range is simply too restrictive, according to Waller.\n\u201cIf the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy,\u201d Waller said.\nAs Opening Bell Daily has reported, Waller\u2019s boss Powell has a lengthy track record of delayed policy responses to economic data, dating back to the pandemic\u2019s four-decade high inflation spike.\nOne of our most popular charts of the year\nHowever, because Waller\u2019s latest speech aligns with President Trump\u2019s calls for Powell to cut rates, Waller has taken some political heat for aligning with the White House.\nBut to Neil Dutta, head of economics for Renaissance Macro, those attacks are unjustified.\nFor Waller to argue that the economy is not in fact as good as the White House claims doesn\u2019t exactly come across as supportive of the administration.\nPolitics aside, Waller\u2019s case is at least intellectually consistent.\n\u201cIf President Trump's goal is to leave his mark on the Fed, then he should proceed in a way that likely ensures that he is able to quickly fill the most seats,\u201d Dutta said.\n\u201cElevating Waller to the top job is the most obvious path to afford him that opportunity. Going the other route runs the risk of having a Chairman in Name Only no one respects.\u201d\nMarket snapshot\nElsewhere\n\ud83d\udcca Tesla and Alphabet report earnings in a busy week ahead. The giants will headline the 112 total S&P 500 companies reporting earnings this week as stocks hover at record highs. Other than corporate news, the economic data will be quiet ahead of the Fed\u2019s July 29-30 meeting. (Yahoo Finance)\n\ud83c\udfe6 Scott Bessent made the case for Trump not to fire Jerome Powell.
