  "description": "Across industries, AI has become a double-edged sword",
  "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the landscape of fraud prevention, creating new opportunities for defense as well as new avenues for deception.\n\nAcross industries, AI has become a double-edged sword. On one hand, it enables more sophisticated fraud detection, but on the other, it is being weaponized by threat actors to exploit controls, create synthetic identities and launch hyper-realistic attacks.\n\nFraud prevention is vital in sectors handling high volumes of sensitive transactions and digital identities. In financial services, for example, it's not just about protecting capital - regulatory compliance and customer trust are at stake.\n\nSimilar cybersecurity pressures are growing in telecoms and tech industries like SaaS, ecommerce and cloud infrastructure, where threats like SIM swapping, API abuse and synthetic users can cause serious disruption.\n\nFraud has already shifted from a risk to a core business challenge - with 58 per cent of key decision-makers in large UK businesses now viewing it as a \u2018serious threat\u2019, according to a survey conducted in 2024.\n\nSynthetic fraud refers to attacks that leverage fabricated data, AI-generated content or manipulated digital identities. These aren\u2019t new concepts, but the capability and accessibility of generative AI tools have dramatically lowered the barrier to entry.\n\nA major threat is the creation of synthetic identities which are combinations of real and fictitious information used to open accounts, bypass Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks or access services.\n\nDeepfakes are also being used to impersonate executives during video calls or in phishing attempts. One recent example involved attackers using AI to mimic a CEO\u2019s voice and authorize a fraudulent transfer. These tactics are difficult to detect in fast-moving digital environments without advanced, real-time verification methods.\n\nData silos only exacerbate the problem. In many tech organizations, different departments rely on disconnected tools or platforms. One team may use AI for authentication while another still relies on legacy systems, and it is these blind spots which are easily exploited by AI-driven fraud.\n\nWhile AI enables fraud, it also offers powerful tools for defense if implemented strategically. At its best, AI can process vast volumes of data in real time, detect suspicious patterns and adapt as threats evolve. But this depends on effective integration, governance and oversight.\n\nOne common weakness lies in fragmented systems. Fraud prevention efforts often operate in silos across compliance, cybersecurity and customer teams. To build true resilience, organizations must align AI strategies across departments. Shared data lakes, or secure APIs, can enable integrated models with a holistic view of user behavior.\n\nSynthetic data, often associated with fraud, can also play a role in defense. Organizations can use anonymized, realistic data to simulate rare fraud scenarios and train models without compromising customer privacy. This approach helps test defenses against edge cases not found in historical data.\n\nFraud systems must also be adaptive. Static rules and rarely updated models can\u2019t keep pace with AI-powered fraud - real-time, continuously learning systems are now essential. Many companies are adopting behavioral biometrics, where AI monitors how users interact with devices, such as typing rhythm or mouse movement, to detect anomalies, even when credentials appear valid.\n\nExplainability is another cornerstone of responsible AI use and it is essential to understand why a system has flagged or blocked activity. Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks help make decisions transparently, supporting trust and regulatory compliance, ensuring AI is not just effective, but also accountable.\n\nAI-enhanced fraud doesn\u2019t respect organizational boundaries, and as a result, cross-industry collaboration is becoming increasingly important. While sectors like financial services have long benefited from information-sharing frameworks like ISACs, similar initiatives are emerging in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nCloud providers are beginning to share indicators of compromised credentials or coordinated malicious activity with clients. SaaS and cybersecurity vendors are also forming consortiums and joint research initiatives to accelerate detection and improve response times across the board.\n\nDespite its power, AI is not a silver bullet and organizations which rely solely on automation risk missing subtle or novel fraud techniques. Effective fraud strategies should include regular model audits, scenario testing and red-teaming exercises (where ethical hackers conduct simulated cyberattacks on an organization to test cybersecurity effectiveness).\n\nHuman analysts bring domain knowledge and judgement that can refine model performance. Training teams to work alongside AI is key to building synthetic resilience, combining human insight with machine speed and scale.\n\nAs AI transforms both the tools of fraud and the methods of prevention, organizations must redefine resilience. It\u2019s no longer about isolated tools, but about creating a connected, adaptive, and explainable defense ecosystem.\n\nFor many organizations, that means integrating AI across business units, embracing synthetic data, prioritizing explainability, and embedding continuous improvement into fraud models. While financial services may have pioneered many of these practices, the broader tech industry now faces the same level of sophistication in fraud, and must respond accordingly.\n\nIn this new era, synthetic resilience is not a static end goal but a capability to be constantly cultivated. Those who succeed will not only defend their businesses more effectively but help define the future of secure, AI-enabled digital trust.\n\nWe list the best identity management solutions .\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "The AI arms race: why we need AI to fight AI attacks\nWhere humans fall short in online security\nGlitching videos. Spelling mistakes. No blinking. Robotic audio. Unnatural tone.\nHistorical hallmarks of a deepfake cyberattack may seem apparent to the well-informed individual, but if recent news events have taught us anything, humans can no longer be relied upon to correctly spot AI-generated content such as deepfakes.\nHowever, many online security frameworks still rely on human intervention as a crucial defense mechanism against attacks. For example, employees are expected to spot phishing emails and scams after completing corporate cybersecurity training. Remote identity verification often relies on a manual check of uploaded imagery, or a person-to-person video call to verify a user\u2019s identity.\nThe reality today is that humans can no longer detect generative AI content and should no longer remain a central defense mechanism. A new approach is urgently needed.\nFounder and CEO of iProov.\nThe threat landscape is changing two-fold\nAI-powered fraud and cyberattacks have captured several headlines recently. One notable example was global engineering firm Arup, which fell victim to a \u00a320m deepfake scam after a finance employee was duped into sending cash to criminals, following a series of hoax AI-generated video calls from senior officials.\nOn the incident, Arup\u2019s Global CIO, Rob Greig, said: \u201cLike many other businesses around the globe, our operations are subject to regular attacks, including invoice fraud, phishing scams, WhatsApp voice spoofing, and deepfakes. What we have seen is that the number and sophistication of these attacks has been rising sharply in recent months.\u201d\nHere, Greig underscores the two biggest changes AI is driving in the threat landscape today: attacks are rising in volume and sophistication. Generative AI tools that can create video, audio, and messages are now widely available and are accelerating the speed and scale at which attacks can be launched. What\u2019s more, the technology has become so sophisticated that humans cannot be reasonably expected to detect AI-powered attacks.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOther organizations are starting to worry too; a recent iProov survey of technology decision-makers found that 70% believe AI-generated attacks will significantly impact their organizations, while more than two-thirds (62%) worry that their organization isn\u2019t taking the threat seriously enough.\nThere are several ways AI is transforming traditional attacks.\nPhishing gets a power-up\nDespite widespread awareness of social engineering techniques, this method remains highly effective in cyberattacks. Verizon\u2019s 2023 Data Breach Investigations report revealed phishing was involved in 36% of breaches in 2022, making it the most common attack type.\nIt\u2019s commonplace for organizations to teach employees about spotting phishing attacks, like looking for typos, grammar errors, or awkward formatting. But with AI able to quickly create, polish, and scale personalized phishing messages, those training sessions have become redundant.\nTools like WormGPT, a malicious cousin of ChatGPT, are enabling bad actors to create convincing, personalized phishing messages quickly without any errors and in any language.\nAI is also helping make spear-phishing (highly targeted social engineering attacks) even more impactful and scalable. Traditional social engineering attacks become even more convincing when coupled with a deepfake phone call or voice note from a relative or colleague, for example, just like the Arup incident.\nWith AI creating convincing content that no longer requires a high technical skillset, the number of potential attackers is greatly expanded. The barrier to entry to create these attacks is also far lower than before, with generative AI tools now easily accessible from Crime-as-a-Service marketplaces.\nOnboarding becomes a top target\nRemote onboarding, the point where a user first sets up access to a system or service and verifies their identity, is a high-risk point in user journeys for any organization, and is another area AI-attacks are targeting. Allowing a criminal access to an organization's systems or accounts can cause significant, uncontrolled damage that can quickly spiral. Consider how easily a criminal could borrow money fraudulently, steal identities or weaponize company data once they have been given an account or granted access.\nKnowBe4, a US cybersecurity company, recently shared details of an attack it faced that illustrates this risk all too well. They unwittingly hired a North Korean hacker who used AI and a stolen ID to trick hiring teams and the identity verification process. Once onboard, the imposter almost immediately tried to upload malware before being detected.\nVerifying identities remotely is far more commonplace in today\u2019s global and digital age. Whether it\u2019s hiring a new employee like the KnowBe4 example, creating a bank account, or accessing government services; people are far more accustomed to verifying their identity remotely. However, traditional methods like video calls with human operators are clearly no longer able to defend against deepfake imposters. As KnowBe4\u2019s CEO said: \u201cIf it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone. Don\u2019t let it happen to you.\u201d\nSo, how can organizations stop it from happening to them?\nFighting fire with fire\nNo organization can ignore the emerging AI threats \u2013 the KnowBe4 and Arup examples should ring alarm bells for any enterprise. They also underscore how vulnerable humans are as a defense method. Employees can\u2019t be expected to spot every cleverly disguised phishing email, nor can human operators flawlessly manage remote identity verification. Bad actors knowingly exploit human vulnerabilities.\nOur recent deepfake detection study found only 0.1% out of 2,000 participants could accurately distinguish real from fake content, and despite this poor performance over 60% of people were confident in the accuracy of their detection skills. Regardless of how confident someone may feel scrutinizing a deepfake photo or email message during a cyber training session, the chances of detecting these when a notification is received in real life during a busy workday or while out running errands is considerably lower.\nThe good news is that AI is both sword and shield. And thankfully, tech leaders are recognising the power of technology as the solution, with 75% turning to facial biometric systems as a primary defense against deepfakes and the majority acknowledging the crucial role of AI in defending against these attacks.\nBiometric verification systems are transforming remote online identity verification, enabling organizations to verify that the user at the other end of the screen is not only the right person, but a real person. Liveness assurance, as this is called, prevents attackers using stolen or shared copies of victims\u2019 faces, or forged synthetic imagery.\nOrganizations must be aware that what truly differentiates biometric systems is the quality of this liveness assurance and not all liveness assurance systems are created equal. While many solutions claim to offer robust security, organizations need to dig deeper and ask critical questions.\nDoes the solution offer liveness assurance that continuously adapts to evolving threats like deepfakes through AI-powered learning? Does it create a unique challenge-response mechanism to make every authentication unique? Does the provider have a dedicated security operations center that provides proactive threat hunting and incident response to keep pace with emerging threats and ensure that defenses remain robust?\nImplementing these more advanced solutions are critical to staying ahead of the ever-evolving attacks, reducing the burden on individuals and ultimately bolstering organizational security in the AI-driven threat landscape.\nWe list the best identity management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best Linux distro for privacy and security of 2025\nSecure your PC from cyberthreats\nWe list the best Linux distros for privacy and security, to make it simple and easy to prevent PC damage and data loss from malicious content online.\nAlthough Linux is generally regarded as reasonably secure and a lesser security risk than Windows computers, Linux distros still needs regularly security updates to keep it secure, Additionally, privacy and security have become increasing concerns for internet users, not least with increased government monitoring and corporate collection of user data, and a long string of well-publicized hack attacked in which this user data has been stolen and mis-used.\nWhile Windows and macOS computers have some protections in place, and there are additional options such as using one of the best VPNs or Tor browser, a number of Linux distros are now available that put privacy and security at their core.\nFor some of these Linux distros it's a case of building in privacy protection by default using a variety of tools. For others, it's a matter of including security software as standard for those who need to do penetration testing.\nEach of these distros has a different focus on privacy and/or security according to user interests and needs. We\u2019ve assessed them on various factors, like the encryption tools they come with, how they manage their connections while ensuring privacy, the learning curve, documentation, and whether there\u2019s an active online community or forum for discussions.\nThe distros in this guide have all been crafted specifically to equip you with the means to defend your privacy and ensure you stay secure while browsing the internet.\nBelow we list what we think are the best Linux distros for privacy and security currently available.\nWe've also featured the best forensic and pentesting Linux distros.\nLinux Administration Bootcamp: Go from Beginner to Advanced, $12.99/\u00a311.99 at Udemy\nLearn the ropes of two of the most popular Linux distributions in the world, Red Hat Linux & CentOS, and use the in-demand skills to start a career as a Linux Server Admin or Linux Administrator. The course is presented by Jason Cannon, the author of Linux for beginners, and includes around 500 minutes of in-demand video and four downloadable resources.\nThe best Linux distros for privacy and security of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest Linux distro for privacy and security overall\n1. Kodachi\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKodachi uses a customized Xfce desktop and aims to give users access to a wide variety of security and privacy tools while still being intuitive. The distro is loaded to the brim with apps that cater to all kinds of users. Kodachi includes all the apps you\u2019ll find on a regular desktop distribution and then some.\nTo ensure privacy, Kodachi very uniquely routes all your connections to the Internet through a VPN before passing them to the Tor network. Advanced users can also connect via their own VPN.\nKodachi also takes many steps to bolster security. The distro uses AppArmor for application isolation. It also includes an entire suite of privacy-protection tools including VeraCrypt, zuluCrypt, KeePassXC, Metadata Anonymization Toolkit (MAT) for zapping metadata information from files, and more.\nThe distro also bundles a collection of tools to easily change identifying information such as the Tor exit country. Additionally, the distro encrypts the connection to the DNS resolver and includes well-known cryptographic and privacy tools to encrypt offline files, emails and instant messaging.\nThe Panic Room entry includes various privacy tools including a tool to wipe RAM, and an option to create a password that when entered will securely erase all contents of your encrypted Kodachi installation.\nBest Linux distro for extreme security\n2. Qubes OS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nQubes has established itself as arguably the most popular security-centric distro. It works on the principle of Security by Isolation and makes intelligent use of virtualization to ensure that malicious software doesn\u2019t infect other parts of the installation.\nQubes uniquely isolates several essential elements of the operating system inside different virtual machines, called qubes. An individual instance of an app is restricted within its own qube. Thanks to this arrangement you can run Firefox in one qube to visit untrusted websites and another instance of the browser in a different qube to transact online. A malware ridden website in the untrusted qube will not affect the banking session.\nThanks to its radically different approach, Qubes does have a learning curve. However it isn\u2019t abrupt enough to prevent you from using the distro like a normal Linux installation. Qubes is based on Fedora and uses the Xfce desktop environment. But instead of a list of apps, its application menu lists several qubes such as work, personal, untrusted, each of which rolls the individual apps inside them.\nBest Linux distro for privacy and security for beginners\n3. Tails\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTails (which stands for \u2018The Amnesiac Incognito Live System\u2019) is probably the most well-known privacy-focused distro. It can be run from a DVD in Live mode whereby it loads entirely into your system RAM and will leave no trace of its activity. The OS can also be used in \u2018persistent\u2019 mode where your settings can be stored on an encrypted USB stick.\nAll connections are routed through the anonymity network Tor, which conceals your location. The applications in Tails have also been carefully selected to enhance your privacy \u2013 for example, there\u2019s KeePassX - which, while not the best password manager, is still pretty good - and Paperkey, a command line tool used to export OpenPGP secret keys to print on paper. There are also a small number of productivity apps such as Mozilla Thunderbird and the powerful LibreOffice suite.\nThe distro ships with a number of desktop applications such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Pidgin, Inkscape, Audacity and Thunderbird. You can also utilize the Synaptic Package Manager to flesh out the Gnome-powered distro. Any packages you choose to install aren\u2019t made available at subsequent reboots, unless you configure persistent storage.\nBest Linux distro for privacy and security for virtualization\n4. Whonix\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBooting a Live operating system is a nuisance as you have to restart your machine, while installing it to a hard drive means there\u2019s a risk of it being compromised. Whonix offers an elegant compromise by being designed to work as a virtual machine inside the free program Virtualbox.\nWhonix is split into two parts. The first \u2018Gateway\u2019 routes all connections to the Tor network for the second \u2018Workstation\u2019 part. This hugely reduces the chance of DNS leaks which can be used to monitor what websites you visit.\nThe OS has a number of privacy-conscious features. These include bundled apps such as the Tor Browser and Tox instant messenger.\nAs it runs in a virtual machine, Whonix is compatible with all operating systems that can run Virtualbox. Virtual machines can only use a portion of your real system's resources, so Whonix will not necessarily perform as fast as an OS that has been installed to a local hard drive.\nBest Linux distro for privacy and security for tools\n5. Septor\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSeptor is produced by the Serbian Linux project, which also produces a general purpose Linux distro for Serbian language speakers. Based on Debian\u2019s Testing branch, Septor uses the KDE desktop environment and is one of the newest distros in this guide that\u2019s only had a handful of releases.\nTo earn its privacy credentials the distro routes all Internet-bound traffic through the Tor anonymous network. Earlier, the distro used a launcher script to fetch the latest Tor release from the Internet, but now bundles it by default.\nIn addition to the Tor browser, the distro also includes a couple of tools that are designed for use over the Tor network. There\u2019s the anonymous file-sharing program called OnionShare and the Ricochet instant messaging client.\nBesides the Tor tools, the distro also has a few other privacy and security enhancing programs such as the Sweeper utility to clear the cache and temporary files, VeraCrypt encryption software and the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT).\n- Here's our list of the best USB bootable distros\n- These are the best Linux repair and rescue distros\n- Extend your storage with these best NAS & media server distros\n- Experience Arch with these best Arch-based distros\n- New to Linux? Here are the best Linux distro for Windows users\nWe've also featured the best online cybersecurity courses.\nBest Linux distro for privacy and security FAQs\nHow to choose the best Linux distros for privacy and security for you?\nWhen selecting the best Linux distros for privacy and security for yourself, you\u2019ll first want to check how steep the learning curve is and whether the distro offers an easy out-of-box experience. If you\u2019re proficient with Linux, then you could opt for a highly secure but complex distro. Beginners may do better with slightly less secure but simpler distros. You\u2019ll also want to check what kind of encryption tools the distro offers, the hardware requirements to run it smoothly, and if there\u2019s sufficient documentation.\nHow we tested the best Linux distro for privacy and security\nWe\u2019ve evaluated these distros on factors relating to privacy and security. To start with, we looked at their hardware requirements, size, documentation, and ease of installation.\nWe assessed the degree of security and privacy the distros offered, the processes they employed to ensure security and privacy, and if there were additional tools to encrypt offline files, emails and instant messaging. We judged the complexity of the distros, and checked if they came with productivity apps too.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants. TechRadar's team and I have personally tested every tool in this guide. So, let\u2019s get right into it.\nBest AI website builder tools\nWhen it comes to AI website builder tools, Hostinger is a standout. Their AI-powered suite covers various functionalities, making website creation effortless. The user-friendly Hostinger website builder, backed by AI, allows anyone to design and launch stunning websites easily. Boost productivity, save time, and achieve impressive results with Hostinger's AI tools.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams. With support for 100+ languages, smart filters, and deep integrations with CRMs and project tools, it becomes more than just a transcription tool. The free plan includes unlimited transcription and limited AI summaries. You can subscribe to its paid plans starting at $10/user/month with unlimited summaries, AI apps, and integration support.\n3. Notion AI\n- What is it: An all-in-one AI assistant built into Notion for writing, research, task planning, and workspace queries.\n- Ideal for: Notion power users, content teams, students, or managers who want AI help across notes, databases, and documents.\nPart of Notion workspace, Notion\u2019s AI helps you summarize, reformat, translate, brainstorm, and get answers from your notes without switching tools.\nI used Notion to tidy up a messy project doc, pull action items from team sync notes, and turn revision material into a toggle-style quiz guide\nUnlike regular AI notetakers, Notion is context-aware. Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts. If you want more, go for Notion\u2019s paid plan at $10/user/month with full feature access and integrations.\nBest AI voice generators\n1. Murf.ai\nMurfai.ai is by far one of the most popular AI voice generators.

They also offer different accents for each language, allowing users to select the one that suits their projects.\nCustomization features include adjusting the voice speed, pitch, and volume to suit your specific needs, and the option to choose between male and female voices, which can add more versatility to your projects.\nLike most of its alternatives, Murf.ai offers a pay-per-use model, which means that you only pay for the number of characters you need to convert to speech. You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use.

Premium plans start at $39.25/ month or $29.25/ month billed yearly\nHowever, note that the service may not be suitable for users who require highly specialized voices. If you need strong regional accents or unique speech patterns this might not be your suitable option.\nWhile the voices are generally of high quality, they may sound robotic and unnatural sometimes, especially when speaking longer pieces of text.\nPlay.ht is useful, efficient, and cost-effective for users who need to convert text to audio fast and easily, but it may not be the best choice for all users. It all comes down to your specific needs and requirements.\n3. Lovo.ai\nLovo.ai is a text-to-speech (TTS) software that provides AI-generated voices in multiple languages and accents.

ElevenLabs\nEleven Labs offers solid features to transform text into natural-sounding speech and to clone voices with great accuracy. It offers a level of realism that sets it apart from other similar tools. While getting started, you can train the AI with just a few voice samples to create personalized voices for a variety of purposes. Plus, you can even earn every time someone uses your voice on their project.\nIt excels with its Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature and offers four distinct AI speech models: Eleven Turbo v2 for low latency, Eleven English v1 with plenty of voices and styles, Eleven Multilingual v1 which supports 10 languages, and Eleven Multilingual v2 supporting 29 languages. Plus, you can choose from over 40 pre-made voices or create your own custom voices. It further helps in fine-tuning of stability, clarity, and style exaggeration simply by generation speed and output quality for optimal results.\nEleven Labs offers two levels of voice cloning. Instant Voice Cloning needs just a few minutes of audio to create a high-quality clone quickly. Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.\n2. Speechify\nSpeechify also coverts text to speech, with an extensive library of over 200 unique voices that include various genders, accents, and speaking styles. With Speechify, you can fine-tune specific elements on a word-by-word basis and make precise adjustments to pitch, speed, and tone.\nIt offers a video dubbing tool that automatically translates and dubs audio for videos from YouTube or uploaded files.

These avatars can be customized for tone and emotion, which improves their lifelike appearance. Similarly, Speechify\u2019s neat user interface and drag-and-drop functionality make editing straightforward and creating content very smooth.\nMoreover, Speechify also comes with cross-platform compatibility through which it works seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, computers, and makes it accessible for you across different devices. It also integrates well with many platforms like Notion, WordPress, and HubSpot.\n3.

Still, if you're more focused on having advanced voice customization or a wider variety of AI voices, then you might want to consider using a dedicated AI voice changer instead.\nBest AI translators\n1. Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2. Microsoft translator\nGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.\nDuring our test, we used a feature called \"Live Transcribe\" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4. DeepL\nDeepL is an AI-powered translation service famous for its accurate translations and careful focus on language nuances. It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

You can use this platform to automatically onboard new employees and get them familiar with your IT setup. You\u2019ll get a full audit trail of the automated actions that you can review for compliance and security purposes.\nSysAid doesn\u2019t have standard pricing. Your bill depends on the features you want and your custom IT infrastructure, so you\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a quote. There\u2019s no free plan but there\u2019s a free trial period to test the features before making your final purchase decision.\nBest IT Automation software for endpoint management\n2. NinjaOne\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is popular remote monitoring and IT management platform. It\u2019s very good for automating endpoint management, which refers to managing and supervising devices connected to a network.\nThis platform lets you write automation scripts to handle a lot of behind-the-scenes IT tasks. For example, you can write scripts to automatically back up files at specific times for each connected computer or a script to automatically update antivirus software when required. If you\u2019re not good at programming, you can use the drag-and-drop interface to create automations.\nNinjaOne's scripting engine works in various programming languages, including Javascript, ShellScript, Powershell, etc., and you can automate almost anything on a macOS or Windows operating system. You can control what devices to deploy the automation on. For instance, you can run automation for individual devices or for entire organizations and dynamic groups.\nNinjaOne is more than just endpoint management software. It offers broad IT service management features for enterprises. The drawback is that there\u2019s a steep learning curve if you want to utilize most of the platform\u2019s features.\nBest IT Automation software for robotic process\n3. UiPath\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUiPath is the world\u2019s most popular robotic process automation (RPA) tool, enabling enterprises to automate many IT tasks and free up time and effort to put them to use elsewhere.\nUiPath offers broad automation features. You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support. You can contact a human support representative whenever you want and you also have access to a large collection of user guides, manuals, and video tutorials concerning all aspects of the platform. The drawback is that UiPath is pretty expensive, starting at $420 monthly.\nBest IT Automation software for large businesses\n4. Atera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAtera is a remote monitoring and management software. It enables IT teams to stay on top of their technical infrastructure and ensure that things are always in good shape.\nThis platform incorporates artificial intelligence to help IT personnel automate a lot of tasks. The AI system can analyze common ticket requests and craft intelligent responses (though not always accurate). This feature helps you cut down on your ticket response and management time. AI can answer simple inquiries while your IT staff focuses on the more complex ones. The AI system can even tag and prioritize tickets for the IT staff to handle.\nYou can generate automation scripts using Atera's AI system. The platform comes with over 1,000 ready-made scripts but you can generate additional ones. Atera gives you deep visibility into all devices connected to your network, and you can automate software updates and patches.\nThis tool is very user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It also has mobile apps, which makes it convenient to use on the go.\nBest IT Automation software for Azure users\n5. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service.

      "text": "Best online cybersecurity course of 2025\nFree and paid certification programs\nWe list the best online cybersecurity courses, to make it simple and easy to learn cybersecurity skills and train up to improve them.\nWe've listed both free and paid-for courses, proving that it doesn't need to be expensive to become qualified in cybersecurity.\nFor long-term career development, while you will ideally need to take a degree or other accredited course in computer science, in which you can choose networking and security topics to suit your career path, there are other options available that you can try in order to test the waters and see whether the industry really is for you.\nOne of the best ways to do this is by signing up for a free online taster course, which introduce some of the basics. These are a great way of seeing if this is the sort of career you'd like.\nEven still, some of the free providers do also provide paid courses which are often cheaper than undergraduate study, and may allow not just for suitable training but also industry connections to help on your path.\nTherefore if you really are interested in exploring cybersecurity, try some of these featured courses to get an idea of whether you might suit the industry, and vice versa, but do be aware that any free training will generally be quite limited.\nAdditionally, check our featured best free VPN.\nReader offer: Top courses from $14.99 when you first visit Udemy\nUdemy is an online learning platform where you can access over 25,000 courses all taught by professionals. Choose from a vast course catalog with topics ranging from programming to lifestyle.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best online cybersecurity courses of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online cybersecurity course overall\nReasons to buy\nLike Future Learn, Coursera offers a range of short courses for distance learning, including a number of cybersecurity ones such as \"Cybersecurity Specialization\" which was created by the University of Maryland to bring the underlying concepts of the construction of secure systems directly to your web browser.\nIt consists of five courses in total, each of which can take several weeks to complete. These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates. No prior experience is necessary, and the course is self-paced, so you can start and finish at any time.\nThe \"Cyber Security Specialization\" training course takes place over 22 weeks, covers everything you need to know to protect businesses from cyberthreats, and includes access to NexGenT\u2019s Career Services, which helps students enter the workforce upon completion.\nThe base tuition for the Cyber Security Specialization Program is costly up front at $10,500, or you can choose zero-fee tuition and pay 10% of your salary only once you have a job with a $40,000 salary. After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students. The online portal for students is excellent with information clearly laid-out, with different modules having clear timetables to work to.\nEven better is that the courses are tailored toward people of all abilities, and do a fantastic job of easing the inexperienced and unqualified into what can be quite deep and advanced topics, while actively trying to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed.\nThe OU offers a dedicated online degree in cybersecurity, as part of its wide range of flexible Computing and IT honors degree courses, where you can choose to focus in different areas, all of which will show a concern for security issues. The OU also offers a dedicated degree in Data Science.\nFor the full 3 year course, the cost is around $21,500.\nThe big advantage of the OU is that it can deliver an accredited degree in computing internationally, and aims to embrace all learners while allowing them to define their own learning path. Additionally, you can take up to 16 years to qualify for your degree through part-time learning.\nBest free online cybersecurity courses\nBest extensive online cybersecurity course\n1. Cybrary\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the name suggests, Cybrary is an online library for cybersecurity, IT and other InfoSec-related study materials. After creating a free account, you get access to almost 500 courses, each ranked by their difficulty and all of them free.\nYou can filter classes by level \u2013 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced \u2013 or by vendors like Cisco, (ISC)2 and Microsoft. Whether you want to learn the fundamentals of malware or the art of the Jedi mind trick, both of those curriculums are given equal prominence in Cybrary\u2019s extensive course catalog.\nWhat is especially good about Cybrary's courses is that they tend to focus on specific aspects of IT, which means if there are areas you'd prefer to specialize in then you can focus on that rather than have to take a larger course to access it.\nBest government online cybersecurity course\n2. CISA\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and is an obvious source of cybersecurity expertise.\nHowever, you may not have been aware that you don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the United States to benefit from the vast experience of US government security experts, or that you can do so for free.\nThe DHS has a calendar full of training events you can attend in Idaho Falls, but for everyone who doesn\u2019t live in the midwestern US there\u2019s an entire portal of online courses available to those involved in the security of industrial control systems.\nBest general online cybersecurity course\n3. Open Security Training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIts website looks like what you'd get if you took all the slideshows and teaching materials from a university cybersecurity department and uploaded them to a domain sporting the most minimalist user interface of all time, but Open Security Training is host to a range of intermediate and advanced classes, along with a swath of beginner lessons that any newbie would be a fool to pass up.\nThere\u2019s a whole rundown on the x86 and x64 architectures wielded by Intel processors, along with introductions to topics along the lines of cellular security, network forensics and vulnerability assessment.\nBest online cybersecurity course for beginners\n4. Heimdal Security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the same firm that brought you The Daily Security tip comes Heimdal Security\u2019s Cyber Security Course for Beginners. Although this, too, is email-based, its syllabus is significantly more extensive than that of The Daily Security Tip.\nThe Cyber Security Course for Beginners delivers a new lesson every two days for five weeks, and all without the need to pay back any tuition loans. In terms of content, it aims to give you step-by-step advice for keeping your personal data out of nefarious hands.\nBest basic online cybersecurity course\n5. Sans Cyber Aces Online\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt\u2019s undeniably basic, and yet SANS Cyber Aces provides a nice little introduction to online IT and cyber security that's easy to follow and understand.\nAfter reading through a series of comprehensive entries about operating systems, networking and system administration, you can register for a quiz that puts your expertise to the test.

In our first test, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard lived up to its name, as it was able to retrieve all of the files on the drive which had previously been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nThe utility also performed well on our test on a drive which had been formatted after the file had been deleted, recovering 76% of the missing files. We were particularly impressed that EaseUS was able to recover the filenames too.\nWe also ran a test simulating a damaged drive. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard immediately recognized it as a \"lost partition\", where we were able to preview all of the deleted files, complete with filenames.\nNot only is this utility one of the best we've seen for data recovery but the full package is still one of the more affordable solutions we've seen for resurrecting crashed RAID setups \u2013 certain packages hide this functionality away in their premium versions. While there are definitely more advanced recovery packages out there, and certainly some cheaper ones, this is the one we'd keep on our shelf for those not-so-special occasions.\nThere are various pricing options, from monthly to yearly, or alternatively, a Lifetime upgrades license. Costs start from around $70 a month all the way up to a one-off fee around $150 for lifetime access.\nYou can, however, get 25% off any of these prices if you enter the code AFF-TECH-RAD at checkout.\nUpgrading to a paid license is expensive on paper, but a one-off lifetime fee could represent great value for money. Plus, just generally, the app's great performance, EaseUS's responsive customer support, and a tidy user interface makes EaseUS' offering a strong contender.\nRead our full EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro review.\nBest data recovery software for advanced users\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStellar Data Recovery is one of the most popular data recovery services for businesses and for good reason. The platform comes with several scan options, meaning you can tailor the scan for the type of data loss that has occurred. This saves time if you\u2019ve deleted an important file and realized straight away, meaning there\u2019s no need for a full system scan.\nThe platform also comes with advanced search capabilities, making it easy to identify and extract the most critical data.\nAnother important feature of Stellar Data Recovery is its support for all file formats and drives. It is an adaptable provider that will recover data from hard drives (internal and external), memory cards, flash drives, and optical media like CDs and DVDs.\nDuring our tests we found that Stellar was able to recover files that had been deleted from the Recycle Bin without any issue whatsoever. It had less success with drives which had been formatted, only being able to recover around half the files. When we simulated a corrupted hard drive however, Stellar was able to recover 80% of the missing files.\nThere's a free version available which allows you to recover up to 1GB of data. There's no limit on the number of files you can 'preview' from within Stellar Data Recovery though, so you can check to see which files are recoverable.\nTo actually attempt to recover anything, however, you have to pay for a license annually rather than monthly, with pricing starting at around $60 in a three-tier annual renewal system.\nFor partition recovery, for example, you'll be shelling out around $90 for the Professional tier, while 'photo and video repair features' come with the $100 Premium tier. The $60 Standard tier simply offers unlimited data recovery - the least they could do, for that money.\nRead our full Stellar Data Recovery review.\nBest data recovery software for Mac\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOne of the most popular data recovery tools, Disk Drill, is available for both Windows and Mac.\nWith a range of features and a choice of free and premium versions, Disk Drill is designed to recover data from hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, SD/CF cards, digital cameras, and even smartphones. Disk Drill's website boasts that any lost data file type can be recovered, from almost any data loss scenario you can think of.\nBut we weren't just going to take their word for it, so we decided to put Disk Drill to the test. We were pleased to see that scans of the attached drives completed in just a few seconds.\nThe \"Preview\" feature is also essential, as it allows you to examine files in a way that's more difficult with the \"Recovery Fault\" which doesn't always assign correct filenames to data.\nIn our first test, the utility was able to find all the deleted files that we'd sent to the Recycle Bin. Our next test was on a drive which had been formatted after the files had been deleted. Disk Drill proved itself equal to the task and was able to produce all of the original files, with filenames intact.\nFor our final test, we simulated a corrupted/damage drive. Although the drive itself wasn't visible in Windows Explorer, upon launch Disk Drill proudly proclaimed \"Woohoo! Lost Partitions Found!\". It then recovered all of the files, though the filenames for two of them were missing. Passing with flying colors, then.\nDisk Drill's complete collection of features for every imaginable platform and scenario is impressive enough. Its ability to effortlessly mount and read a previously unmountable drive and recover the data from it within a comparatively small timeframe proves that Disk Drill is a recovery tool that you should be considering.\nThe free version of Disk Drill only allows you to recover up to 500MB of data, which most likely won't cut it. Pricing for the PRO version comes in the form of a one-time license fee rather than monthly or yearly cost, at around $108 for the software with lifetime upgrades which could make it most cost-effective in the long haul for a small business with thinking about costs.\nLarger businesses looking to support up to ten users with unlimited activations should note, however, that it'll cost them $598.\nRead our full Disk Drill data recovery review.\nBest data recovery software for device coverage\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile there are plenty of Data Recovery products on the market, very few are as comprehensive as AnyRecover. The utility is available not just for Windows and Mac but is also designed to recover data from iOS and Android devices.\nAnyRecover touts itself as a data recovery solution for over 500 data loss scenarios for over 2000 different types of devices. The website also claims that over 1000 file formats are supported.\nIn our first test with AnyRecover, we found it was able to recover 92% of files that had been deleted from a drive, with filenames intact.\nThe second test was performed on a drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case AnyRecover was able to successfully restore 64% of the missing files, without their filenames.\nOur final test simulated a corrupted/damaged drive. AnyRecover didn't see this at first but as soon as we clicked \"Couldn't Find Location\" from within the utility, the drive appeared and scanning began. AnyRecover was able to restore all but one of the missing files with their filenames.\nAnyRecover can be downloaded free of charge from the main website by clicking \"Try it Now\". You can use the free version to 'Preview' certain file types and recover up to 100MB of data in up to 8 files.\nIf you choose to buy in, AnyRecover can be installed on up to 3 devices and 2 PCs. It's 79.99 for a monthly subscription. However we recently found that this had been reduced to $59.99 as part of a promotion, and as of August 2025, that's still the case. Similarly, a yearly subscription is typically $99.99, but we spotted reductions to $79.99. A lifetime licence usually costs $159.99, but is $99.99 right now.\nIt seems a little bizarre to purchase a one-month plan, in our opinion, and especially at the moment when lifetime access is just $40 more.\nIf you've missed this offer, don't worry: software companies always pull flash deals and sales out of their hats, and it's always worth checking back sooner rather than later, and waiting for your time to strike. That's good advice for any product on this list, really.\nRead our full AnyRecover Review.\nBest interface\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOntrack EasyRecovery comes in a number of different options, all intended to help provide the complete recovery of data under a range of different data loss conditions.\nA free version allows you to recover up to 1GB, so isn't going to be particularly helpful except as a tester for most people. The free version also limits the size of recovered files to 25MB.\nThe Home edition allows for the recovery of files and folders that have been accidentally deleted, though it can also recover them after a virus infection.\nThe Professional edition allows you to create disk images as well as recover data from CDs and DVDs, while the Premium edition doesn't just have the ability to clone HDDs and SSDs, but can also repair corrupted photos or videos.\nThe Technician and Toolkit editions are even more powerful, allowing for lost or reformatted RAID volumes, but also come with commercial licensing for commercial use, working across Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.\nDuring our tests we found the \"deep scan\" feature to be buggy, as the utility froze each time we tried to use it. We had more joy with quick scans however.\nOur first test was on a drive where the files had been deleted from the Recycle Bin. Ontrack Easy Recovery was able to restore all of them in seconds, including the filenames. We didn't have much success with the drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted : some system files were recovered but not the ones we'd placed on there.\nOur final test was a simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. In this case Ontrack Easy Recovery's \"Can't Find Drive\" feature instantly displayed the lost partition. At this stage the utility became unresponsive. This may have been down to a defective data cluster on the drive itself though, so we'd still recommend installing the free version of the utility to try to 'Preview' files on lost partitions.\nPrices start from around $70 annually, with monthly subscription options available.\nRead our full OnTrack Data Recovery review.\nBest for enterprise\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOnce the darling of free backup solutions for the home user, CrashPlan has since shifted its focus to the SMB space, with its CrashPlan for Small Business offering.\nAnd CrashPlan is certainly a favorite around here \u2013 in fact, our official company machines here at TechRadar all run Crashplan, and it's saved our bacon on more than one occasion. It's not quite the same as the traditional file recovery apps that we've covered in this article \u2013 it's a backup service first and foremost \u2013 but it's so comprehensive, and good at what it does, that it almost counts.\nCrashplan stores absolutely everything. It chugs away in the background and makes full, detailed backups of your entire machine starting with the newest files first. It then sifts everything into virtual buckets so you can get quick access to the files that matter most.\nCritically, though, Crashplan even stores files you've deleted. You can switch this feature off, but we wouldn't: your backups are fully encrypted, so even those deleted files will be safe from prying eyes, and you never know when you might need to retrieve that long-discarded (or virus-removed) file.\nPricing starts from $10 a month per endpoint, with up to 100 endpoints covered in the small business plan. Enterprise users will need to get a custom quote direct from the company, which typically implies that you'll be paying a good deal more than that.\nRead our full CrashPlan review.\nQuick overview\nProvider: | EaseUS | Stellar | Disk Drill | AnyRecover | OnTrack | CrashPlan |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nDevices: | Windows, Mac, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS (via Mac version), Android (via Mac version), HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, Linux, more |\nQuick Scan: | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A |\nDeep Scan: | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A |\nRecovery Rate: | 99.7% | 98.6% | Not advertised | 99.7% | 85% | N/A |\nFree Recovery: | Yes (Up to 2GB) | Yes (Up to 1GB) | Yes (Up to 500MB) | Yes (Up to 100MB) | Yes (Up to 1GB) | No |\nFile Preview: | Yes (Free) | Yes (Paid) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Paid) |\nSupport options: | Phone, email, live chat, remote assistance, tutorials | Phone, email, support tickets, tutorials | Email, live chat, tutorials | Email, support tickets, tutorials | Phone, email, support tickets, tutorials | Email, support tickets, live chat, tutorials |\nLifetime price: | $149.95 | $99.99 | $89 | $99 | None ($71.99 per year) | N/A |\nBest free data recovery software\nAs you would expect, some of the best data recovery software is only accessible if you're willing to pay for it. Luckily, for those home users who only want to recover a small amount of data, there are some free options available.\nMany paid services will offer a free version with limited features to help you recoup a small amount of data and then try and convince you to pay for the full version. There are also completely free data recovery utilities which may allow you to retrieve your lost files.\nIn this guide, we'll explore some of these free options. Before getting started, remember that each time you use a drive from which data has been deleted you're risking that the system will overwrite the data.\nThis is why it's best to install data recovery utilities to a separate device to the one from which you want to recover.\nThe best free data recovery software in full\nBest free data recovery software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStellar Data Recovery is one of the best data recovery tools we\u2019ve used, with highly customizable searches, a huge file-type library, and deep scan abilities. However, while a number of paid plans are available, there is also a free tier available.\nStellar Free Data Recovery Software offers up to 1GB of free data recovery for both Windows and Mac users. This enables users to retrieve deleted, lost, and unavailable objects from a hard drive, USB stick, or almost any other storage device. All of the advanced data recovery tools are otherwise available. This includes the ability to 'preview' from within Stellar Data Recovery, so you can check to see which files are recoverable even if you're over the 1GB free limit.\nDuring our tests, we found that Stellar was able to recover files that had been deleted from the Recycle Bin without any issue whatsoever. It had less success with drives which had been formatted, however, only being able to recover around half the files. When we simulated a corrupted hard drive however, Stellar was able to recover 80% of the missing files. Scans were completed in seconds.\nOverall, Stellar Data Recovery is a great file retrieval tool with powerful advanced options for business. In its simplest form, it enables anyone to retrieve lost data from a computer or external storage device. Paid subscriptions are a little expensive, but the free program\u2019s impressive performance and user-friendly interface mean it's well worth using.\nThe only concern would be whether 1GB of free recovery is enough for your needs, or if one of the paid tiers would be worth considering instead.\nRead our full Stellar Data Recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for file size\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDMDE Free Edition \u2013 or, to give it its full title, DM Disk Editor and Data Recovery Software \u2013 helps you recover files from your hard drive that you have lost due to accidental deletion, hard drive problems, a virus attack, or some other grave misfortune.\nThis is the free edition of a program for which there are paid-for versions, so it should come as no surprise that there are a few limitations \u2013 but none that should put you off.\nThe free version of DMDE is only available for personal use, and it's only possible to recover files that are currently visible in the selected directory. You can't, for example, select a folder from the directory tree and recover it. On top of this, recovery is limited to 4,000 files at a time, but there's no limit on how many files you can recover if you break it down into batches of 4,000 or fewer.\nWhen visiting the DMDE website to download the Windows GUI version of the program, we found it was available only as a ZIP file. This triggered a Windows Defender alert, which we had to bypass. We were then able to download the archive and extract the folder.\nThese extra hoops are more hassle than a simple installer, but on the plus side, DMDE can be run directly from the folder to where it's extracted. You can run it from any location, including directly from a USB stick - vital when av risk overwriting data you're trying to get back.\nThis is especially important if you're trying to recover data from your main hard drive, as downloading any extra data to it risks overwriting existing files, making them much harder to recover.\nIf you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can even venture into disk editing mode or reconstruct RAID configurations as part of your disaster recovery program.\nDuring our tests, DMDE was able to recover all files successfully with filenames intact from a drive where they'd been deleted from the Recycle Bin. The utility was only slightly less successful with the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted, recovering 92% of the files without the filenames.\nWe were particularly impressed how DMDE handled our simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. The utility was able to recognize the lost partition immediately and recovered all of the original files including their filenames without issue.\nThe unforgiving interface has been made more helpful in recent versions through pop up hints, although these can be annoying once you've mastered the program as there's no obvious way to switch them off.\nStill if you can get past this, you'll find DMDE is an essential and powerful file recovery tool that could save you serious heartache.\nRead our full DMDE Free Edition review.\nBest free data recovery software toolkit\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRecuva is a full recovery toolkit, dealing with deep scanning, retrieval of data from damaged drives, extracting files from removable devices, and more. Although it does come with a paid-for version like the above, the free version is definitely worth checking out.\nIt's not the most comprehensive tool, but it's certainly powerful enough, particularly given that the pro version also adds disk imaging tools for taking full backups of your drives.\nPerhaps Recuva's most interesting feature is one that's contrary to its main aim: using its secure delete capability, you can completely obliterate files. This is less surprising when you discover that Recuva's developers Piriform also created the world famous file-deletion tool CCleaner.\nNote that usually files are only ever truly deleted when they're overwritten by another occupying the same space on the drive \u2013 otherwise, it's merely the reference to their data in the OS that's removed.\nBy overwriting each of their bits repeatedly with zeroes, even the most advanced data forensics tool won't be able to get them back. Perfect for those highly sensitive documents that absolutely need to stay deleted.\nMoving on from file deletion to file recovery, Recuva performed fairly well in our tests. It was able to recover all data intact with filenames from the drive whose files had been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nWe were also able to use Recuva's \"Deep Scan\" feature to restore 76% of files from a drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted, though some of the filenames were missing.\nOur final test was a simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. In this case sadly Recuva was unable to detect the drive, so no recovery could take place.\nOne of our favorite features, is that at the end of each scan Recuva will display a summary of exactly how many files have been recovered and the time it took. Scans usually completed in seconds, so this may be one to consider if the drive containing your missing files can still be mounted by your operating system.\nRead our full Recuva review.\nBest free data recovery software for partitions\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPresented as a pair of tools rather than a single integrated solution, TestDisk and PhotoRec together recover data from both lost partitions and files.\nTestDisk takes care of the partition side of things. The fact that it's a command line tool with no graphical interface might be off-putting at first. If can set this to one side though, there's help on hand to guide you through the process of working with your drives. TestDisk offers support for so many file systems, it should cater to most eventualities.\nPhotoRec is the component for recovering files. It's available with a command line interface, but unlike TestDisk there's also a GUI for less confident users. In Windows this is qphotorec.exe. This works in largely the same way as the CLI tool, with the options displayed in a single window rather than a step-by-step series of commands. Recovered partition images can be checked in TestDisk using the terminal.\nPhotoRec is cross-platform and can be run as a portable app from a USB stick, which means you don't have to install it on your PC and risk accidentally overwriting the data you want to recover.\nBoth TestDisk PhotoRec passed all our tests with flying colors. The first test was performed on a drive attached to the virtual machine where the files had simply been deleted. The utility detected all the files within seconds and listed them by type. They were all recovered intact and opened without issue.\nWe next tested QPhotoRec using a drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. Once again QPhotoRec didn't disappoint. It recovered a number of files, amongst which were the original ones which had been deleted, complete with their filenames.\nWe were eager to see if the utility could go 3/3 so, next tested QPhotoRec on a drive with a corrupted volume header. QPhotoRec displayed it as a \"missing\" partition in the drop down menu, from which once again we were able to recover all the missing files intact with their filenames.\nThis is the only data recovery utility we've reviewed to date which has been able to recover all deleted files in every one of our tests. This is all the more impressive considering this is free and open source software, so doesn't have subscription fees to pay for developers to work on it round the clock.\nRead our full TestDisk and PhotoRec review.\nBest free data recovery software for file preview\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the inclusion of the word \"pro\" in the name, this program is still free; there is, in fact, no non-pro version.\nThe look of UnDeleteMyFiles Pro may be rather dated, but don\u2019t let that put you off too much as there are multiple tools included here, not just data recovery. Recovery can be a little hit and miss as there is no indication of the quality (or recoverability) of files \u2013 you just have to hope that the files that are found are in a reasonable state.\nWe found this to be the case during our tests as when we scanned a drive where the files had been deleted it detected all but one of them including their filenames. However when we tried to restore the files, we found they wouldn't open, either being empty or corrupted.\nThe utility's \"File Recovery\" scan was unable to find any files on the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. We had the same results when using the \"Media Scan\" feature.\nWhen we tested with a simulated corrupted drive, UnDeleteMyFiles Pro wasn't able to see this at all, so no recovery could take place.\nWhen it comes to data recovery, there aren't really all that many options other than the ability to search for particular types of files to reduce the size of the list you have to sort through. There's no indication of the quality of files, as we saw when we attempted to restore deleted ones only to find they couldn't be opened.\nOne saving grace of this utility is that it contains a disk snapshot tool which can create an image of your drive as a single file. This allows you to attempt data recovery without risking making things worse. You can also send the image to professional data recovery services if necessary, which is a much better option than mailing your entire device to them.\nThere's also a secure file deletion tool, and email recovery.\nBest free data recovery software for recovery prediction\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhen it comes to ease of use, it's hard to beat Wise Data Recovery. Although this free data recovery software doesn't have a wizard-led interface, there are no complicated configuration settings to worry about either.\nTracking down recoverable data is a simple matter of selecting the drive you want to check and clicking 'Scan'. Alternatively, you can use keywords to search for recoverable files so you don\u2019t have to wade through quite so many results.\nWhichever route you choose, recoverable data is presented in an Explorer-like tree structure that makes it easy to tell where it was originally stored. Like all the best free data recovery software, Wise Data Recovery uses a traffic light system to indicate the health of files (and therefore how likely it is that you'll be able to recover them intact, and there's a file preview feature so you can identify files that have been detected.\nYou can recover individual files, or entire folders at once, but selecting numerous files in several locations means performing several operations.\nThe free version of Wise Data Recovery is one of the most generous free photo recovery options you\u2019ll find anywhere. Its 2GB recovery limit is better than most no-cost rivals, and you can use the free download on an infinite number of systems and with no time restrictions.\nOur first test was on a deleted drive whose files had been emptied from the Recycle Bin. Wise performed a scan in less than 3 seconds and was able to recover all the original files with their filenames intact.\nWise Data Recovery didn't do quite so well on the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case only around half the files were recovered. With one exception the filenames were intact.\nFinally we ran a scan on our simulated corrupted drive. The utility was able to recognize the \"Lost Drive\" almost immediately and recovered all the original files, with filenames intact.\nRead our full Wise Data Recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for user experience\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFinding recoverable data with EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free is very simple: select a drive or folder and wait for a few minutes while it completes its scan.\nYou can browse through the recoverable data using a Windows Explorer style interface and filter them by type or opt to search for specific files. Data recovery is effective, but the Deep Scan option is very slow, so you'll need to be patient.\nThe installation of this software is a mixed experience. The installer, importantly, advises not to install to the same drive that you want to recover data from because this could overwrite data and render it unrecoverable. It also, sadly, tries to enrol you in a customer experience improvement program, without explaining what this entails.\nIt's worth noting that the free version only allows for the recovery of up to 2GB of data, so it's not going to be suitable for all circumstances, but it will be enough to get you out of most sticky situations.\nWe had a hard time actually receiving this free allowance during our tests, as after attempting to recover a 100MB folder on a 512MB drive just three times, our allowance was reduced to around 200MB. It's possible the 2GB limit may apply to the size of the drive being scanned instead of the amount of data recovered.\nHowever, during all our tests EaseUS ran incredibly quickly. It detected the virtual drives and ran scans in seconds. In our first test, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard lived up to its name, as it was able to retrieve all of the files on the drive which had previously been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nThe utility also performed well on our test on a drive which had been formatted after the file had been deleted, recovering 76% of the missing files. We were particularly impressed that EaseUS was able to recover the filenames too.\nWe also ran a test simulating a damaged drive. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard immediately recognized it as a \"lost partition\", where we were able to preview all of the deleted files, complete with filenames.\nRead our full EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free review.\nBest free data recovery software for Mac\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOne of the most popular data recovery tools on macOS, Disk Drill is now available for Windows.\nDisk Drill is designed to recover data from hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, SD/CF cards, digital cameras, and even smartphones. The website boasts that any lost data file type can be recovered, from almost any data loss scenario you can think of.\nThe \"Preview\" feature is also essential, as it allows you to examine files in a way that's more difficult with the \"Recovery Fault\" which doesn't always assign correct filenames to data.\nWe were pleased to see that scans of the test drives completed in just a few seconds.\nIn our first test the utility was able to find all the deleted files that we'd sent to the Recycle Bin. Our next test was on a drive which had been formatted after the files had been deleted. Disk Drill proved itself equal to the task and was able to produce all of the original files, with filenames intact.\nFor our final test, we simulated a corrupted/damage drive. Although the drive itself wasn't visible in Windows Explorer, upon launch Disk Drill proudly proclaimed \"Woohoo! Lost Partitions Found!\". It then recovered all of the files, though the filenames for two of them were missing.\nThis means that Disk Drill is one of the very few data recovery utilities to have passed all our tests with flying colors.\nDisk Drill's complete collection of features for every imaginable platform and scenario is impressive enough. Its ability to effortlessly mount and read a previously unmountable drive and recover the data from it within a comparatively small timeframe proves that Disk Drill is a recovery tool that you should be considering.\nThe free version of Disk Drill only allows you to recover up to 500MB of data. After that you need to pay a one-time lifetime license fee. Overall, this is an excellent recovery utility for both Windows and Mac.\nRead our full Disk Drill data recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for simplicity\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOntrack EasyRecovery claims to be one of the best data recovery software applications available on the market. It was developed by a provider of file recovery services who has been in business for 35 years.\nThe program touts itself as being both simple to use as well as powerful enough to help you recover from a wide variety of data loss situations.\nThe Free plan provides up to 1GB of data recovery. There's also a size limit of 25MB on recovered files, though you can 'Preview' lost files to check if they can be recovered with the paid version.\nDuring our tests we tried to run the \"Deep Scan\" feature, only for the utility to become unresponsive each time the scan reached 99% whilst trying to read a particularly nasty data cluster.\nRegular scans on the other hand ran extremely fast. Our first test on the drive where the files had simply been deleted then emptied from the Recycle Bin Ontrack EasyRecovery recovered all the files with the filenames intact.\nIt wasn't quite so successful with the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case some system files were recovered but none of the ones we deleted.\nOur final test was on a drive with a corrupted volume header. Ontrack EasyRecovery's \"Recover From\" has a \"Can't Find Drive\" option, which we clicked and the external hard drive was displayed immediately.\nOn the first scan, the utility was able to restore the lost partition in order for it to be scanned. (We noticed that it still didn't appear in File Explorer however).\nWe then tried to run a regular scan. Unfortunately this was the point at which the utility became unresponsive, simply saying 0% scanned. We left it this way for around 15 minutes before being forced to exit via Ctrl + Alt + Del.\nWhere Onetrack EasyRecovery falls down is the rather binary options offered for data recovery. Our experience was that the utility can do a superficial scan that retrieves only a few files or a huge in-depth sector by sector scan which crashes the app.\nIdeally we'd like to see some fine-tuning options, such as searching for 'raw' data for files or the ability to stop a scan cleanly before it's complete to review what data's been recovered.\nRead our full Ontrack EasyRecovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for iOS\n10. MyRecover\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMyRecover is a comprehensive and free data recovery software from AOMEI. Previously known as AOMEI Data Recovery, the software is available for both Windows and iOS.\nWith MyRecover, users can retrieve all kinds of lost data, including those lost through the Recycle Bin, deleted files, files lost in formatting, lost in system crashes, and virus attacks.\nThere are two modes available - a quick scan and a deep scan, depending on the amount of data lost, and the method through which it was deleted.\nYou can recover lost data from almost all Windows storage media, such as HDD, SSD, external hard drive, USB drive, digital camera, SD card, and similar.\nFor Windows, there\u2019s support for NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, ReFS in Windows 11/10/8/7 and Windows Server, while for iOS there\u2019s support for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch with iOS 10 and later, including iOS 17.\nOn both platforms, you can recover various data including images, videos, emails, photos, contacts, call history, and many more.\nApart from a free option, MyRecover also has paid plans, aimed at those that want more advanced features.\nWindows users get to choose between the Pro and Technician plans. The former is more suited for individual users or home offices, and it\u2019s priced at $59.95 yearly or $99.95 for a lifetime (one-time) purchase. The Technician plan is made with enterprises in mind and is priced at $199 yearly or $399 for a lifetime purchase.\nFor iOS users the plan is priced at $29.95 yearly or $69.95 for a lifetime purchase.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best data recovery software?\nWhen deciding which data recovery software to download and use, first try to determine how difficult the data might be to recover. For example, some dual-disk RAID configurations mean that recovery isn't going to be a simple process. Additionally, free or budget software options may have built-in limitations on how much data or how many files you can actually recover.\nThe golden rule of data recovery is never to install the data recovery program onto the same drive from which you want to recover data. The reason for this is that your system will see the space occupied by deleted files as available for new data, which means they could be overwritten.\nIf your utility supports it, you should also consider creating a disk image of the drive which contains your missing data. This allows you to recover your files safely without risking overwriting the missing data on the original disk. Creating a disk image also means you can make it available for download to professional data recovery services.\nIf you do decide to go it alone, make sure to download the free version of your chosen data recovery utility first. You can usually 'preview' recovered files within the program, so you can decide if it's worth paying for a monthly or annual subscription.\nHow does data recovery software work?\nWhen it comes to a hard drive or other storage medium, data that is stored on the drive isn't physically removed from the drive. It still exists, and the delete button simply marks the space that the file is occupying as available.\nThat means that if you act fast enough, you can recover files that are deleted before the space is overwritten with new data. If, however, you have already heavily modified the drive then the chances of retrieving lost data are slim.\nThe same can be said for damaged drives. The data is still stored on the drive but your computer may not be picking up its connection due to a broken connection or faulty driver.\nOnce the data you are trying to recover has been identified, the software will mark the occupied space on the drive as 'taken', rather than free. Viola, your data will (hopefully) have been recovered.\nHow do I use data recovery software?\nFirst, find your data recovery software of choice and install it. Our top recommended pick is the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard.\nNow, use the data recovery software to find the drive you would like to recover the files from. This can be a built in drive on your Windows, Mac, phone, external storage, or other storage type such as NAS.\nClick the 'Scan' or button to launch a scan of the drive to see if there are any files that can be retrieved. These scans can take time, especially if the drive has a lot of data on it or it has been formatted.\nOnce the scan is complete, you will be able to 'Preview' the files that can be recovered from the drive. This allows you to select the files you are looking for, and specifically recover them. Alternatively, you will be able to choose to recover all of the identified files.\nClick 'Recover' and the files will be restored to their original location. Just be aware that if you have waited a while or modified the afflicted drive after losing the files, some of them may become corrupted or unrecoverable.\nHow we test\nHow we tested the best data recovery software\nTo test for the best data recovery software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for recovering data using a virtual machine running Windows 11, to which we attached three different drives. This allowed us to benchmark various data loss scenarios, such as trying to recover files from a corrupted drive.\nThe files we chose for recovery are an album of Mozart's Music available from the Internet Archive. We did this as we wanted to see how the utility performed with a wide variety of files, including both common and more obscure formats.\nThe aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nWe do not believe that running data recovery tools in a virtual environment has a significant effect on how they function. Still, if you're considering buying software we encourage you to read all reviews thoroughly and make sure that the developer offers a refund policy.\nWe've also featured the best document editing and management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Smarter than the scam: how optimized AI is reshaping fraud detection\nThe importance of optimizing AI in fraud detection\nFraud remains a persistent threat for businesses of all sizes, with the trade association UK Finance estimating that over \u00a31.1bn was lost to fraud in the UK alone in 2024. Financial services firms are a particularly attractive target, given the opportunity for significant monetary gain.\nTo put this into context, Q1 of 2024 saw 8,374 consumers lodge complaints about fraud and scams, of which over half were in relation to customer approved online bank transfers. These types of scams that often involve convincing social engineering and AI-generated content, which manipulate people into sharing confidential information, are becoming harder to spot- even for experienced professionals.\nFor financial services providers, the consequences of fraud reach far beyond lost revenue. Companies can suffer reputational damage, operational disruption and costly legal fallout, all of which can undermine long-term business resilience. Unsurprisingly, these firms take a proactive approach to fraud prevention.\nBut with fraudsters becoming more sophisticated and technologically advanced, especially with the help of AI, it can often feel like a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, with defenders constantly reacting to ever-evolving tactics.\nDirector of Analytics and Automation at Sopra Steria.\nFraud is not disappearing anytime soon\nThe National Crime Agency ranks fraud as the most common crime in the UK, accounting for 41% of all crime in England and Wales. For financial services firms, the challenge is even more acute. In 2024 there were 3.13 million confirmed cases of fraud, a 14% rise compared to 2023. This sharp increase highlights a two-fold problem, whereby fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated, whilst the overall volume of attacks is climbing.\nThere are various reasons behind the rising levels of fraud, not least the ongoing cost of living crisis. As operating costs soar and cashflow becomes tighter, financially vulnerable businesses are more likely to take risks, overlook red flags, or fall for offers that seem too good to be true.\nThis makes them an easier target for scammers. On top of this, AI is transforming how fraud is carried out. Specifically, it enables criminals to move faster and more easily deploy advanced tactics, from deepfakes and synthetic identities, to highly convincing phishing campaigns.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOptimizing automation is the remedy for success\nOne of the main reasons financial services providers remain prime targets for fraudsters is the sheer number of customer interactions across mobile apps and online banking platforms, creating multiple potential entry points that are difficult to monitor and secure simultaneously.\nThis challenge is often compounded by a lack of alignment between key teams, such as fraud prevention, customer authentication and customer service, leading to gaps in visibility across the customer journey. With high transaction volumes, countless access points, and siloed teams, it can be difficult for firms to keep false positives to a minimum and contextualize and action suspicious activity or alerts.\nFinancial services companies often turn to AI to help reduce false positives which, in principle, is the correct way to go. However, many AI tools still rely heavily on manual rule creation and editing, leaving fraud teams to handle the hardest tasks, such as deciding what patterns to target and making sense of ambiguous data.\nInstead, firms must go beyond rule-tweaking and help uncover the \u2018why\u2019 behind fraud, not just the \u2018what\u2019. To get the best value from AI, financial services providers should turn their attention to models that can enhance the decision engine, by replacing legacy rulesets in favor of a new auto-generated suite of optimized rulesets.\nIn practice, this approach starts by analyzing historical transaction data and fraud model scores to identify patterns in both legitimate and fraudulent activity. It then determines the right balance between detecting fraud and avoiding false positives.\nFrom there, a fresh set of optimized rules is automatically generated and can be refreshed daily. This keeps the fraud decision engine sharp and responsive, reducing manual effort while ensuring it stays aligned with the latest threat patterns.\nThe benefits must be balanced with human input\nOptimizing fraud detection leads to a more efficient and accurate program, enabling fraud teams to focus their attention on genuine scam activity without being distracted by false positives. More broadly, it allows firms to respond quickly and effectively to shifts in risk appetite, tightening or relaxing controls as circumstances change.\nWhile these benefits of AI and automation are undeniable, financial services firms must not become over reliant on these technologies. Human expertise remains essential, especially in scenarios that demand emotional intelligence, nuanced behavioral analysis or complex judgement.\nAI is a powerful tool, but it\u2019s the insight and oversight of skilled fraud professionals that ensures investigations are handled with the necessary sensitivity and rigor. Crucially, it\u2019s also down to fraud teams and data scientists to train and fine-tune AI models using real-world insights, ensuring they evolve in line with the shifting threat landscape.\nPlan for long-term fraud resilience\nBlending human expertise with AI isn\u2019t just a technical enhancement, it\u2019s critical for any financial services provider that is serious about safeguarding customers and staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraud. As threats evolve, particularly with the rise of agentic AI, relying solely on reactive measures won\u2019t be enough. Proactive, adaptive fraud prevention, which combines the precision of AI with the intuition of human judgement, will be key to preserving trust and resilience in the long term.\nWe've featured the best online cybersecurity course.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nSoftware for teams\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy for teams to work together.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best cloud computing provider of 2025\nVirtual IT infrastructure for Digital Transformation\nWe list the best cloud computing services, to make it simple and easy to manage your computing in the cloud to help with digital transformation.\nCloud services have revolutionized computing, not least through IaaS, PaaS, and especially SaaS, which have allowed businesses to develop virtualized IT infrastructure and deliver software through the cloud, independent of a user's operating system.\nEven better still, businesses can also mix and match cloud services from different providers to ensure maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. For larger businesses especially the economic benefits can be significant.\nBecause cloud services are run through software platforms and virtualized networks, it means that it's easy to access and analyze data for the purposes of analytics as well as for business intelligence purposes. The result is IT infrastructure management that allows for insights that would have previously been much more difficult to access.\nCloud computing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy.\nThis especially applies to when storing data, as online cloud storage can be treated as effectively limitless. Even though you might be using cloud databases for your structured data, you can also archive everything else into massive data lakes for additional processing using AI and machine learning for greater insights.\nAltogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits, and here we'll look at the best cloud computing service provider.\nKamatera cloud computing: Start free trial with $100 credit\nKamatera\u2019s cloud computing services offer scalable infrastructure, flexible pricing, and enterprise-grade reliability.

Amazon Web Services\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing provider. It kickstarted the cloud revolution and has occupied the number one spot for a long time.\nAWS has the largest data center network of all cloud providers, so it\u2019s very reliable and offers solid performance. You can host your application in the region where your customers are closest. For instance, if you\u2019re in the U.K. and observe that most of your customers come from the U.S., you can choose a U.S.-based data center to offer faster speed.\nAWS is known for being user-friendly. It's built for quick and easy access, and you can monitor or modify your data just when you want. This cloud platform offers a lot of web application services, so you have a broad choice of features to adopt. You can choose the best server operating system depending on which programming languages power your app.\nAWS is also known for being very safe and secure. The platform has had few noteworthy security incidents since its founding in 2006.\nHowever, there are some drawbacks. A common customer complaint is that AWS\u2019s billing system is confusing, leaving users prone to making mistakes that increase their costs.

CloudLinux\nReasons to buy\nCloudLinux isn't so much a cloud computing provider, but rather a cloud platform you can build across your own servers. This means that if you'd prefer to have tight control over your cloud network rather than going with third-parties, you can host it yourself. While this presents a different set of challenges, it also offers a range of benefits, especially for those companies already heavily invested in their own IT infrastructure.\nCloudLinux is a distro of specifically built for virtualized cloud operations to power shared hosting services, by allocating and limiting server resources to each tenant. Additionally, each tenant is partition from each other, in other to create a more secure environment. The result is a hosting platform that has built in redundancy, stability, and security, in order to provide a better hosting environment.\nAll cloud services require a degree of technical knowledge to work with, so for those with extensive expertise CloudLinux offers the opportunity to be far more in control of your own services and how they are configured.\nBest cloud computing provider for Europe\n7. OVHCloud\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOVHcloud is a French cloud computing provider focused on European customers. It is the largest cloud hosting provider in Europe and the third-largest globally based on physical servers.\nOVHcloud gives you access to virtual private servers or dedicated servers. You can choose the type you want and the region you want it to be in. Your choice depends on the type of online platform you're hosting, as some servers are faster than others.\nThis platform has the largest data center network in Europe, so it\u2019s an ideal choice if most of your customers are based in this region. Furthermore, OVHcloud is affordable compared to most rival platforms.\nWhen testing OVHcloud, we observed that its customer support wasn\u2019t as good as what you\u2019d get on rival platforms. You need to pay a significant sum for dedicated human support, which puts it at a disadvantage.\nBest cloud computing provider for cost-effectiveness\n8. DigitalOcean\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDigitalOcean is one of the most popular low-cost cloud providers. It doesn\u2019t offer as much sophisticated features as you\u2019d find on rival platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. It focuses more on offering simple cloud computing features for an affordable price and does its job well.\nDigitalOcean has 15 data centers worldwide, much smaller than the network of the likes of AWS and Azure. Its reliability and performance are good but not as good as what you\u2019d get on these rival platforms. The attraction of DigitalOcean is trading lower costs for fewer features and performance.\nIt's pretty easy to spin up cloud servers on DigitalOcean to host your application. The platform is easy to navigate, so you shouldn\u2019t face difficulties navigating it. You can choose different types of managed cloud databases, clusters, and APIs. You can also access complementary features such as security firewalls, load balances, and a DNS management system.\nBest cloud computing provider FAQs\nHow to choose a cloud computing provider\nCost\nCost is the number one consideration in selecting a provider. It\u2019s essential to pick something that you can afford to avoid running into trouble in the future. Cloud services are unique such that they don\u2019t usually have a straightforward pricing structure. What you\u2019ll pay depends on the features that you select. The good thing is that cloud services offer their pricing details beforehand so that you can have a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay.\nSecurity\nYou\u2019ll be storing a lot of sensitive data on your cloud provider. Thus, it must have advanced security features to prevent data leaks or theft. Losing customer data can hamper your reputation and even bring about legal lawsuits. Similarly, losing sensitive business data can harm your competitive advantage, so your cloud platform must be secure.\nFeatures\nWhat features do the platform offer? Can you choose the type of servers you want? Can you spin up GPUs? Does it offer complementary services such as domain names and DNS management? Etc.\nEase of use\nYou need a platform that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. Otherwise, you can get frustrated or make costly mistakes by choosing features you didn\u2019t intend to choose.\nWhat are the essential features of a cloud provider?\nOn-demand self-service\nYou should be able to spin up cloud instances and use them without external help. You should be able to monitor the servers you've rented and their allotted storage capacities. External help can always be a complementary feature, but the important thing is that every good cloud provider must offer a self-serve option.\nSolid uptime\nA cloud provider should have their servers up and running as faultlessly as possible. Of course, no platform is perfect, so you may experience occasional downtimes. However, every cloud provider should offer at least 99.9% uptime. Otherwise, you may lose money because of unnecessary server issues preventing your online platform from working.\nAnalytics\nAn ideal cloud computing platform should let users analyze what features they\u2019ve used and give them a breakdown of how it affects their costs. This way, a user can easily identify which features are generating high costs and which ones aren\u2019t, and use this information to optimize their spending.\nPay-As-You-Go\nPay-as-you-go is the best pricing structure because you only pay for the computing features you use. This way, you avoid paying for unnecessary things that you may not use, and you save significant sums in the long run.\nHow we tested the best cloud computing providers\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what range of business type and size the cloud computing service would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant services, such as security perimeters and user apps.

      "text": "Inside the billion-dollar identity fraud ecosystem\nFrom lone hackers to criminal startups\nIdentity theft has evolved rapidly into a high-stakes battlefield, one where criminals operate like well-funded startups with R&D budgets, strategic playbooks, and sophisticated technology. What was once dominated by lone hackers has now evolved to a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem that continues to adapt and outsmart even the most robust security systems.\nAccording to recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data, American consumers reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sobering 25% increase from the previous year. As digital transactions and AI-driven technology become more embedded in our daily lives, more entry points are created for malicious hackers.\nThese bad actors are no longer simply scammers in a basement, but employees of a structured organization with goals that extend far beyond just stealing credit card numbers.\nProduct Director at AU10TIX.\nHow Identity Fraud Organizations Operate\nToday\u2019s identity fraud groups operate with the same precision as modern tech companies. Their objectives can vary from financial gain or data exploitation to influence and control, and each member has a clearly defined role \u2013 either acquiring data, laundering stolen funds, or developing new tools to evade detection.\nTheir first step is to decide whether to steal, buy or create the identity data they need. This is usually influenced by cost, risk level, and the quality of data required. Professional fraudsters prefer to use real data, but some large-scale outfits like Nigerian fraud ring Scattered Canary also utilize sophisticated synthetic IDs created through methods like credit\u2011building or \u201cFrankenstein\u201d PII. Credit building involves gradually establishing a fake identity\u2019s legitimacy by opening and managing accounts over time, while \u201cFrankenstein\u201d PII refers to synthetic identities stitched together from pieces of real and fake PII.\nOnce they have the information they need, their targets typically fall into three categories:\n- Weak targets, including organizations and individuals with lax security and identity verification (IDV) systems. Americans 30 to 39 years old are most likely to fall victim to identity theft, with younger and older generations least likely.\n- Trending markets such as cryptocurrency, which attract many users and make it easier to remain anonymous\n- Industry insiders with inside knowledge of business operations, an approach that enables fraudsters to evade detection systems\nSome real-world case studies of successful fraud organizations include Lazarus Group, FIN7, Scattered Canary, Wizard Spider, and Evilnum. Lazarus, believed to be backed by the North Korean government, targets financial institutions and global cryptocurrency exchanges, conducting cyber espionage and financial theft to fund state objectives. Their attack on cryptocurrency firm Bybit resulted in a staggering $1.5B theft, making it the largest digital currency heist in history.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOther fraud groups, such as FIN7, operate more like a criminal conglomerate targeting enterprises in the U.S. hospitality and retail sectors. Their specialty is selling stolen payment card data on the dark web for financial gain.\nHow They Acquire Stolen Identities and Evade Detection\nCredit card fraud remains the most common type of identity theft in 2024, but professional fraud organizations have an entire toolkit for gathering personal information, relying on tactics that include:\n- Social media harvesting: Collecting information from public profiles, including names, birthdays, locations, and voice recordings\n- Data leaks and breaches: Exposing sensitive data, which is frequently traded on dark web forums and encrypted channels\n- Phishing and social engineering attacks: Using fake emails, texts, and calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information\nHowever, more advanced tactics used by professional groups have become \u201cthe norm\u201d:\n- Card skimming: Installing devices on ATMs or point-of-sale systems to steal payment card information\n- Account takeover services: Purchasing verified accounts from illegal marketplaces\n- Insider theft: Hiring or bribing employees at financial institutions and retailers to leak customer data\nProfessional fraud organizations continuously adapt their techniques and avoid detection by using VPNs, injection tools, and methods to erase file markers\u2013 such as deleting logs and altering timestamps and metadata. By understanding the mechanics of fraud detection systems, malicious actors can find ways to evade capture.\nThe Startup Model of Organized Crime\nModern fraud organizations have embraced a startup mentality. They invest in R&D, rapidly adapt their attack methods, and even offer Fraud-as-a-Service (FaaS) solutions, bundling open-source tools for criminals who want to launch automated identity scams.\nSome popular darknet fraud tools include phishing kits, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), keyloggers, identity spoofing kits, real-time injection tools for ID fraud, and deepfake databases with synthetic faces. Essentially, fraud organizations now resemble lean, agile startups capable of shifting direction quickly and scaling efforts as needed.\nDeepfakes and Generative AI: A New Era of Deception\nThe global deepfake market is expected to reach $13.89 billion by 2032, and fraudsters are already heavily using the technology to their advantage. Initially, cybercriminals used deepfake tools during onboarding processes to fool verification systems. Now, deepfakes are increasingly used at points of access\u2013 impersonating real customers using fake faces or voices, often injected in real time during video verifications. These \u201clive-session attacks\u201d are on the rise, with deepfake-driven cybercrime growing over 700% in a single year. Some organizations even create deepfake-generated identity databases full of hyper-realistic digital personas ready to be used in fraud attempts.\nGenerative AI is another modern technology that is increasingly being used by bad actors to develop fraudulent documents, scripts for bots, and fake behaviors that mimic humans, making it difficult to determine what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. Companies\u2019 use of genAI in business automation can inadvertently open pathways for fraudsters, as well.\nOrganizational Risks and Resistance\nThe implications for businesses are far-reaching; financial losses are only the beginning. Reputational damage, erosion of customer trust, and regulatory scrutiny follow closely behind.\nCurrent defenses such as real-time liveness detection, biometric verification (such as facial recognition and injection detection) and AI-powered fraud detection are generally reactive and designed to detect individual cases of fraud at the user level. But modern fraud organizations focus on creating a single, perfect fake ID -- one that will fool case-level detection -- and use it in automated mass attacks against hundreds or thousands of businesses simultaneously.\nOne proven way to detect this type of sophisticated mega-attack is through traffic-level detection, which uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to detect suspicious patterns and anomalies based on incoming and historical traffic patterns. On the individual level, these IDs are indistinguishable from the real thing, but through a macro view, the fraud can be identified and intercepted.\nOther viable detection methods include:\n- Risk Signals: Assessing the likelihood of fraud based on multiple factors, including IP geolocation, login patterns, and transaction anomalies\n- Device Reputation: Evaluating the trustworthiness of a device based on its fraud history\n- Behavioral Analytics: Tracking user behavior such as typing speed, mouse movement, and search habits to detect anomalies\n- Shared Consortium Intelligence: Pooling anonymized fraud data across organizations to identify and proactively stop attacks\nThe Evolving Battle Against Fraud: What Organizations Must Do Now\nThe fight against identity fraud is no longer about catching individuals, but staying one step ahead of enterprise-level adversaries. Raising awareness on common tactics used by cybercriminals is crucial to understanding how to strengthen identity security. As long as identity remains the key to access, cybercriminals will continue to pick the lock.\nTo keep up, businesses must shift from reactive, case-by-case detection to proactive, system-wide defense strategies. This means investing in traffic-level anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and layered identity verification methods that can spot synthetic identities, deepfakes, and other fraud attempts before they can cause damage.\nAlso, just as fraud groups exchange tools and tactics with each other, organizations must counter by sharing intelligence and gathering threat data across industries. By adopting these methods, businesses can evolve as quickly as the threat landscape and outsmart their adversaries.\nWe list the best identity theft protection for families.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.
