  "description": "Cuban-born congressman files resolution against Delia Ramirez for Homeland Security Committee removal following her controversial remarks about Guatemalan identity in Mexico",
  "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Carlos Gimenez, the lawmaker who fled the Castros' communist regime as a youth, put forward a resolution Friday to boot \"Squad\" member Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., from the Homeland Security committee for violating her Oath of Office.\n\nThe resolution cites Ramirez' comments in Spanish during an event in Mexico City earlier this week, in which she declared, \"I am a proud Guatemalan before I am an American.\"\n\n\"I was born in Cuba and exiled from my homeland shortly after the communist takeover,\" Gimenez, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital on Friday, just before he filed the bill during the House's brief pro-forma session.\n\n\"Everything I am, I owe to this exceptional country of limitless opportunities that paved the way for a Cuban refugee like me to become a firefighter, fire chief, city manager, county commissioner, county mayor, and yes, even a member of Congress.\"\n\nLONE CUBAN-BORN REP \u2018AMPED UP\u2019 TO SEE NATION LIBERATED, AFTER EMOTIONAL RETURN 64 YEARS IN THE MAKING\n\n\"Only in America,\" said Gimenez, who is the only Cuban-born member of Congress.\n\nWhile an immigrant himself, Gimenez said that when a fellow lawmaker \"openly declares allegiance to a foreign nation\" over the U.S., they lose the right to be in certain positions in the federal government.\n\n\"It is not only unacceptable, it is disqualifying for service on a committee tasked with securing our homeland,\" he said.\n\nGimenez also serves on the House Homeland Security Committee, chairing its maritime and transportation subcommittee.\n\nBlowback continued online throughout the week, with actor James Woods quipping, \"Well, okay then, Hasta La Vista.\"\n\nConservative commentator Matt Walsh added that Ramirez should be arrested.\n\nRamirez' office directed Fox News Digital to a statement on the blowback the Chicagoan received after her comments south of the border.\n\nThe statement said \"Republican commentators\" and the social media presence for the Department of Homeland Security wrongly attacked her for \"showing pride in her multi-cultural, multi-ethnic heritage.\"\n\nRamirez said she is a U.S. citizen by birth and that the attacks over the past days were \"a weak attempt to silence my dissent and invalidate my patriotic criticism of the nativist, White supremacist, authoritarians in government. It is the definition of hypocrisy that members of Congress, who betray their oath each day they enable Trump, are attacking me for celebrating my Guatemalan-American roots.\"\n\nRamirez added that \"no one questions\" her many colleagues who celebrate their Irish ancestry, or others of similar Caucasian descent.\n\n\"I am the daughter of immigrants and the daughter of America. I am both Chapina and American. I am from both Guatemala and Chicago, Illinois.\"",

      "text": "Congress\u2019 only career firefighter will introduce Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, at the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) conference in Boston Thursday in an effort to urge members to support the Trump-Vance ticket, after they were the first labor union to endorse President Biden in 2020.\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., became a City of Miami firefighter in 1975 and rose to the rank of chief by the end of his career. He said Thursday that, like his fellow first responders, former President Trump has shown he is always ready to \"answer the call.\"\nThe IAFF has not thrown their support to either current presidential candidate yet.\nGimenez said while his main role is to introduce Trump\u2019s running mate, he will make brief remarks on why his fellow firefighters should endorse the Republican nominee this time around.\n\"I felt it was important enough to get up at 3 a.m. to go to Boston and introduce Sen. Vance and talk to them about why I think President Trump and JD Vance are right for not just firefighters but for America.\"\nGimenez discussed Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 recent policy proposals in a general sense, and suggested she has been pushing fixes to problems the Biden-Harris administration themselves exacerbated.\n\"My pitch is going to be, you know, where firefighters are always willing to answer the call or they answer the bell \u2013 Right now America is, is asking for help, and we should respond,\" Gimenez said.\n\"And America is asking for help because of the disaster that's been the Biden-Harris administration and\u2026 some of the things that have happened over the last three and a half years\u2026 that Kamala Harris in particular wants us to forget that they were in charge of.\"\n\"Somehow they're now going to fix it or she's going to fix it\u2026 It\u2019s like having the arsonist tell you how to put out the fire.\"\nGimenez said that while he has held other roles throughout his life \u2013 commissioner, mayor of Miami-Dade County, congressman \u2013 when he is asked what his job was, he routinely replies, \"firefighter.\"\nCUBA'S MEDDLING IN US ELECTIONS A \u2018BADGE OF HONOR\u2019 TO SOME TARGETED CRITICS\n\"I was the youngest one and the first Hispanic chief \u2013 I was very fortunate to be a firefighter and it\u2019s also shaped the way I see things and how I deal with things.\"\nGimenez said that when \"firefighters do well, America does well,\" and that as a \"first responder,\" they understand urgency in key situations.\nAs for whether the IAFF may be primed to make a 180 and endorse Trump, Gimenez said the union tends to follow its affiliate in the AFL-CIO, which typically endorses Democrats.\n\"Ever since I\u2019ve been a firefighter, they tend to go Democrat. Hopefully, we can break the trend today.\"\nGimenez expressed hope in that regard, given they did not swiftly endorse Harris as they had for Biden in 2020.\n\"It\u2019s not a slam dunk for Democrats this time around,\" Gimenez said of some union endorsements, despite Biden self-identifying as the most \"pro-union\" president in history.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNotably, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien became the first such official to speak at the Republican National Convention, but was reportedly not invited to speak to the Democratic National Convention this year.\nUnions aside, Gimenez said firefighters don\u2019t care about political affiliation while on-the-job.\n\"Every time the bell rings, we get on the truck or we get on the rescue [vehicle] and we answer the call. We\u2019re going to help \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s great about [firefighters].\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign and IAFF for comment."

      "text": "With a presidential election drawing near, 90 miles off the U.S. mainland, the Communist Cuban government is reportedly attempting to once again influence down ballot races as it did two years ago.\nOne such target-rich area is reportedly South Florida, where a large majority of Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Cuban-Americans now live after their families escaped the regime long controlled by the Castro brothers.\nIn a Monday briefing with reporters, an ODNI official confirmed the Cuban government is attempting to counter American candidates opposed to the communist regime, according to the Miami Herald.\nDuring the 2022 election, the intelligence community discovered Cuba had attempted to \"denigrat[e]\" certain candidates there. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba and represents the Florida Keys and part of Miami-Dade, said at the time he believed he was one such target.\nLAWMAKERS TORCH FEDS' CUBA REGULATION ADJUSTMENT AS \u2018LIFELINE TO GREATEST ENEMY IN OUR HEMISPHERE\u2019\nOther lawmakers suspected of being targets of Cuban interference at the time included fellow Miamians Mario Diaz-Balart and Maria Elvira Salazar \u2014 both Republicans.\nA source told Fox News Digital that one avenue the Cubans have used to target such lawmakers is to utilize social media so-called \"bots\" that attack Republicans from the political right, to make them unpalatable to the greater electorate.\nSalazar said Tuesday she is the \"No. 1 enemy\u2026 in Congress\" of Miguel Diaz-Canel\u2019s regime in Havana.\n\"[I]t is no surprise to me that they are trying to subvert our elections,\" said Salazar, who notably represents \"Little Havana,\" just west of downtown Miami.\n\"Our American democracy is stronger than these weak attempts to silence their critics. We will be watching in 2024.\"\nTOP REPUBLICAN, 70, CALLS CHEATLE'S SLOPED ROOF DEFENSE \u2018THE FINAL STRAW\u2019\nGimenez added Tuesday that he wears \"like a badge of honor\" the target Cuba has reportedly placed on him.\nThe former Miami-Dade County mayor quipped that his goal is to remain in Congress longer than the regime remains in El Capitolio Nacional. Diaz-Canel is the first non-Castro to rule the island since Fulgencio Batista was overthrown in 1959.\n\"I would expect myself, Maria and Mario would be their main targets again \u2014 along with Sen. Rick Scott,\" Gimenez said in the interview.\n\"I guess it\u2019s something that we live with here in South Florida: the fact that the Cuban regime thinks that we are their enemies.\"\n\"We are their enemies. We want freedom for the Cuban people. And we won't stop until we get freedom for the Cuban people. So, take your best shot, what can I say?\"\nWhen asked whether Congress can or should act against Cuba\u2019s efforts, Gimenez was hesitant.\n\"I'm not sure what Congress can do about it,\" he said, adding that if they were to do anything it would very likely fall in the censorship or \"fact-checking\" realm.\nHe said he opposes censorship and has concerns that fact-checkers \"fact-check\" based inherently on their own ideological bend \u2014 suggesting such action would do more harm than good.\n\"The responsibility really lies with the people and to determine what they're reading is true or false,\" he said. \"So, I'm not concerned about it that much.\"\nAt the other end of the Tamiami Trail, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., also condemned Cuba\u2019s behavior.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The Communist Cuban regime is an oppressive dictatorship that has inflicted unimaginable horrors on the Cuban people,\" the Naples lawmaker said.\n\"In South Florida, we stand for freedom. In South Florida, we stand for human rights. And in South Florida, we will never surrender to the evils of communism,\" he said.\nDonalds said such election interference from across the Florida Straits should never be tolerated.\nFox News Digital reached out to the ODNI for comment, and was provided a copy of the agency\u2019s report on foreign election \"threats\" during the 2022 cycle \u2014 wherein Cuba was cataloged beside Iran, China and Russia.\nMuch of the report was redacted, but in unredacted pieces of the Cuba section, the agency assessed that Havana tried to undermine \"electoral prospects of specific U.S. congressional and gubernatorial politicians it perceived as hostile.\"\nThe report indicated that political parties across the board, including Republicans and Democrats, were the focal points of attention. It further highlighted that South Florida's heightened interest in the island nation made it a particularly susceptible hotspot for influence.\nAnother angle the Cuban government has sought to influence American voters has been through the media. According to the report, they have sought to build relationships with journalists who share their opposing views of Congress\u2019 Cuba critics.\nGimenez said that sounded like a good strategy for the malign regime, while quipping, \"The fact they can find useful idiots in the American media \u2014 that\u2019s a problem for the useful idiots.\""

Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who hosted the gathering at a private lounge inside Miami International Airport on Thursday.\nThere, he lambasted Nicolas Maduro and condemned the idea that the U.S. under former President Joe Biden had ever concocted a deal with the dictator in the first place.\nOn Wednesday, Trump canceled a deal that had allowed Chevron to operate inside oil-rich Venezuela, saying the U.S. would \"revers[e] concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolas Maduro\u2026 on the oil transaction agreement [from] 2022 and also having to do with electoral conditions within Venezuela which have not been met\u2026\"\nTRUMP SAYS HE'S TERMINATING CHEVRON'S VENEZUELA OIL AGREEMENT\nTrump also noted Maduro was not cooperating with U.S. immigration authorities trying to deport violent illegal aliens.\nIn Miami, Gimenez said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about Tren de Aragua members wreaking havoc in New York City that there is a major difference between Venezuelan civilians fleeing oppression and criminals illegally sneaking into the U.S. that are of a certain descent.\nGimenez noted how he and his family \"fled for freedom\" from a similar dictatorship in Cuba and that therefore any individual or group persecuted by dictatorial governments will \"always have a friend in me.\"\n\"So will [Florida Republican Rep.] Mario [Diaz-Balart], so will [Florida Republican Rep.] Maria [Salazar], and so will [Sen.] Rick Scott, and so will President Donald J. Trump,\" Gimenez said before introducing several leaders, including Guaid\u00f3.\nIn an exclusive interview afterward with Fox News Digital, Gimenez said Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua are \"all pretty much tied together\" in the fact they are dictatorial regimes repressing their own people, who yearn to be free.\n\"I expect this is just the first step in trying to liberate these countries. The people of Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua deserve freedom,\" he said.\nRUBIO: MADURO A \u2018HORRIBLE DICTATOR\u2019\nGimenez said the answer should be to convert the \"enemy states\" into friends of the U.S., noting there is national interest on multiple levels.\nCuba, for instance, is less than 90 miles off the maritime border of Gimenez's own district in Key West.\n\"I\u2019m confident that President Trump understands this, and he stands for freedom and he stands for democracy; not only in the United States, but in our hemisphere and around the world,\" he said.\nDuring the gathering, Guaid\u00f3 also offered remarks in Spanish praising Trump and slamming Central American despots.\n\"[W]e need a strong, prosperous and safe Latin America \u2013 and one that will be safe, with democracy and freedom,\" he said.\n\"I have no doubt in President Trump, and in the message that he is sending directly to the heart of those who financed the coup d'\u00e9tat perpetrated by the dictatorship on July 28, 2024 (the disputed/corrupt re-election of Maduro)\u2026,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It is accurate, correct and timely to confront that dictatorship and also [send] a message to those who today usurp [power] in Cuba and Nicaragua that they will not have impunity,\" Guaid\u00f3 added.\nIn further remarks to Fox News Digital, Gimenez said he has full faith in his fellow Miamian, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in his and Foggy Bottom\u2019s ability to confront these regimes that lie within America\u2019s own hemisphere.\n\"I don\u2019t have to speak to the secretary of state about Cuba; we both have Ph.D\u2019s in that,\" he quipped."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Carlos Gimenez returned to his homeland of Cuba over the weekend for the first time in 64 years, saying he is now \"more determined than ever\" to see the island liberated from dictatorship.\nGimenez, R-Fla., the only Cuban-born member of Congress, joined a congressional delegation (CODEL) to the U.S.-managed Guant\u00e1namo Bay military base there, and noted the rest of the nation is still run by the iron-fisted communist government that took over when President Fulgencio Batista was overthrown by Fidel Castro in 1959.\nThe Gimenez family \u2013 Carlos Sr., Mitzi, Carlos and Mitzi Ann \u2013 left the country when the future Miami fire chief, Miami-Dade County mayor and congressman was just 6 years old.\n\"Now that I visited the only free part of Cuba, I want to make sure that the rest of the island is also free from this communist tyranny,\" Gimenez said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.\n\"I was already amped up. Now I\u2019m really amped up. ... I've always wanted it (to see Cuba liberated), but now I kind of made a pledge that I'm not going to go back until the entire island is free.\"\nThe congressman said his memories of Cuba remain in \"20-second\" video snippets in his memory and that his feelings about Cuba started welling up when he first caught the outline of the island from the plane taking the lawmakers to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\"It dawned on me it was the first time I\u2019d seen it in nearly 65 years \u2013 how beautiful it is \u2013 it\u2019s just a place that is so special; and to have, really, a group of thugs and dictators and oppressors ruin it \u2013 I was somewhat emotional, but then that turned to anger.\"\nGimenez said he could envision his grandparents living in Oriente Province \u2013 which borders Guant\u00e1namo Province.\nCUBA'S MEDDLING IN US ELECTIONS A \u2018BADGE OF HONOR\u2019 TO SOME TARGETED CRITICS\nThe lawmaker was born in Havana but said he lived half of each year on a ranch in Manzanillo, Oriente \u2013 only a few dozen miles west of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and on the opposite end of the island from the capital city.\n\"There are certain memories that just pop back in my head and have for a long, long time. And so all those came back again \u2013 I was grateful to go back. And it was emotional. But it also, I guess, incentivized me more.\"\nHowever, visiting his hometown remained out of the question on the CODEL \u2013 as Gimenez described the potentially deadly security barrier between Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the rest of Cuba.\nWhile East Berlin had Checkpoint Charlie, and North and South Korea have the DMZ restricting movement, the border between Guant\u00e1namo Bay and mainland Cuba is fortified with hundreds of thousands of landmines planted by the regime.\nRepresentatives of the Cuban government tend to meet on a monthly basis with their U.S. counterparts at a bunker near Guant\u00e1namo Bay, but only for base management purposes rather than diplomacy, according to Gimenez.\nThe lawmaker learned that in the past few months, there have been no such meetings.\nThe CODEL, led by Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, followed an executive order from President Donald Trump directing illegal immigrant criminals to be detained at Gitmo under ICE supervision.\nRogers said in a statement the CODEL met with U.S. service members assigned to the base as well as the law enforcement officials in charge of \"facilitating the removal of some of the worst criminals.\"\n\"Border security is national security, and I\u2019m proud of the role the Department of Defense has played in protecting our nation and ending the invasion at our southern border,\" Rogers said.\nJust over a dozen of the 780 total non-illegal-immigrant detainees since 2002 remain at Gitmo.\nIn 1966, Cuban workers at the base were given a choice, Gimenez said: either go back to Cuba-proper, or remain working on-base for life. About 40 of those workers are still alive in Gitmo, unable to return to their homes in the rest of Cuba. Many are in their 80s, and there is an assisted living facility for those of advanced age that remain on base, he said.\nGimenez has long advocated for a peaceful yet decisive end to the seven-decade dictatorship now led by Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, the handpicked successor of the late Ra\u00fal Castro, who had previously taken over from his brother.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA democratic Cuba could be the best friend to the U.S. in the Caribbean region, Gimenez said. Having Cuba under its current constitution sitting only 90 miles off the famous Southernmost Buoy in Key West is also of national security concern, many in Florida believe.\nWith Trump at the helm and a renewed, revamped foreign policy and national security focus, Gimenez said in the interview that \"all of the pieces are in place\" to move more swiftly toward ushering-in a democratic Cuba once more.\n\"It's a question of will. I certainly have the will -- this is the time. Now is the time,\" he said Monday.\n\"I just want to make sure that whatever I can do to make it happen.\""

      "text": "A top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee dismissed suggestions from U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle that the \"sloped roof\" of attempted assassin Thomas Crooks\u2019 sniper nest precluded it from being properly secured.\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., was part of a bipartisan delegation of committee members who toured the Butler Farm Show Grounds on Monday, where members indeed scaled the same glass factory building Thomas Crooks did before he took aim at former President Trump last week.\nGimenez said he has been frustrated with the Homeland Security department for some time, including regarding the porous border and now relating to its subordinate agency, the Secret Service\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s rally.\nThis entire administration is a complete disaster.\n\"This entire administration is a complete disaster,\" he said.\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADE SECURITY\n\"And so what really bothers me, and the reason I got up on the roof -- I'm 70 -- was for the director to say, \u2018well, the steepness of the roof won't allow Secret Service agents to be up there\u2019 -- That was the final straw for me.\"\nGimenez went on to call for Cheatle\u2019s resignation.\nHe reiterated that, although he is in good shape for his age, he is still 70.\n\"I could run around on that roof all day long.\"\n\"I could run around on that roof all day long,\" he said.\n\"[Cheatle] should resign because she obviously doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.\"\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-WI, previously released a timeline of the events on July 13. The lawmaker said that preliminary findings revealed the Secret Service did not attend a security briefing given to local SWAT and sniper teams in the morning. According to the findings, local law enforcement revealed they were not in regular communication with Secret Service officers. Johnson also said that the Secret Service did not initially plan to include any snipers at the rally, before they changed plans for unclear reasons.\n\"After all the failures that I've seen just walking the scene and the cardinal sins that I'm hearing that the Secret Service committed, I would assume this is just another part of this,\" Gimenez responded.\n\"And you must have a walkthrough,\" he said. \"You must have a final reading as to who is responsible for what. And what is everybody doing.\"\n\"After all the failures that I've seen just walking the scene and the cardinal sins that I'm hearing that the Secret Service committed, I would assume this is just another part of this\"\nGimenez said he too learned local authorities did not have a presence in the Secret Service\u2019s command center, which he said creates a prime environment for disorganization and lack of communication in the case a threat does present itself.\n\"This is not rocket-science stuff. This is a simple security measure that anybody would take,\" he said.\nGimenez also echoed concerns of Rep. Elijah Crane, R-Ariz., who pointed out a very tall water tower just east of the farm show grounds.\nAs a former U.S. Navy SEAL and sniper, he immediately identified the tower as a crucial post for Secret Service countersnipers, along with other security miscues.\n\"This is not rocket-science stuff.\"\n\"From there, you could see everything,\" Gimenez said. \"You would not have any, any line-of-sight issues because you're way above the trees,\" he said, as other lawmakers noted a tree partially obscured one oblique angle to surveil Crooks\u2019 roof.\nFor his part, Crane told reporters that aspect is just more proof \"we are being gaslit and lied to.\"\nFrom the Democratic perspective, ranking member Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said some facts about the scene \"speak for themselves,\" and sets the stage for the committee\u2019s work later this week.\n\"Some of us are just members of Congress; we're not experts. But seeing what happened that day is important because we have a hearing tomorrow,\" he said.\nWATCH:\nNew York Rep. Nick LaLota told Fox News Digital that the Secret Service got it \"horribly wrong\" on July 13, saying that they were \"thwarted\" by 20-year-old Crooks.\n\"The Secret Service got it horribly wrong on July 13.\" he said. \"They were thwarted by a 20-year-old with no military or law enforcement training.\"\nSECRET SERVICE EQUITY DIRECTOR SAYS DEI AGENDA IS A \u2018MISSION IMPERATIVE,\u2019 THE \u2018ULTIMATE GOAL\u2019\n\"And yet there is an agency with a $3 billion budget and 3,000 employees,\" he said. \"It's a horrible embarrassment for the agency.\"\nLaLota said viewing the sight where Crooks' opened fire \"brought reality to the situation.\"\n\"Of course, I've seen countless clips on TV and social media, and I've seen some of the digital recaps, but being here on the ground brings some good perspective as to where the would-be assassin was and where the stage was.\"\nLaLota said that he hopes that Secret Service Director Kimblery Cheatle has the \"courage\" to \"face the music\" at the committee hearing on Tuesday in Washington D.C.\nThe Representative said that he has questions regarding the tactics of the day, strategic decision-making and questions about the Secret Service.\n\"I have questions in three main areas,\" he said. \"One, the tactics of that day, what was involved or not involved with respect to communications? Why didn't we use drones? What were the authorities and communications between state and local, departments and officials and federal ones?\"\n\"My second one is strategic, why in the days leading up to it, were decisions made to see the authorities to state and local folks inside perimeters that are usually known to be protected by the Secret Service themselves, what strategic decisions are made and why? When Trump with the agents on the Trump campaign asked the Secret Service for more resources, why did the Secret Service heads deny those requests?\"\nLaLota said that he also has questions about the Secret Service administration and the culture that Director Cheatle fostered.\n\"Are DEI priorities negatively affecting the hiring promotion, assignment processes within the department and thus making them less effective?\" he said. \"We should be a nation based upon merit, and we want our best and brightest in these, in these important jobs.\"\n\"Is DEI infecting the Secret Service to the point where we put the leading candidate for president in 2024 at risk?\" he said. \"These are the questions that we need to get to the bottom here.\"\nThe representatives' statements came after Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc, released his official 13-page preliminary findings of his office's investigation into the assassination attempt.\nThe preliminary findings determined that the Secret Service did not attend a security briefing given to local SWAT and sniper teams on the morning of July 13, that local law enforcement said communications were siloed and they were not in frequent radio contact directly with the Secret Service, that local law enforcement notified command about Crooks before the shooting and received confirmation that the Secret Service was aware of the notification and that the Secret Service was seen on the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building with local law enforcement following the shooting.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe investigation also found that photos of the shooter were sent to the ATF for facial recognition and that local law enforcement said the Secret Service was initially not planning on sending snipers to the rally.\nThe Secret Service did not return Fox News Digital's requests for comment.\nFox News' Landon Mion contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Rep. Carlos Gimenez has introduced a resolution to remove Rep. Delia Ramirez from the Homeland Security Committee, citing her comments prioritizing her Guatemalan identity over her American citizenship. Gimenez, a Cuban-born lawmaker, argues that such statements disqualify her from serving on a committee responsible for national security. Ramirez defended her remarks as an expression of pride in her heritage and criticized the backlash as an attempt to silence dissent against what she termed 'nativist' sentiments in government.",
