  "title": "September Fed Rate Cut? Goldman, JPMorgan Make The Same Call",
  "description": "Economic tremors in financial markets as global shifts lead banks to revise interest rate forecasts. JPMorgan expects Sept cut and 3 more in 2025.",
  "content": "Economic tremors ripple across financial markets as shifting global dynamics push major banks to alter their interest rate forecasts. J.P. Morgan now expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, moving up its forecast from December.\n\nThe shift reflects signs of labor market weakness and uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's latest Fed nomination.\n\nThe bank still sees three more quarter-point cuts following the September move before the Fed pauses.\n\n\"For [Fed Chair Jerome Powell], the risk management considerations at the next meeting may go beyond balancing employment and inflation risks,\" analyst Michael Feroli said.\n\nThe firm also highlighted that lower net immigration and pressure from the Trump administration for lower rates could further weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nIs The US Economy Approaching A Standstill?\n\nJ.P. Morgan joined other Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs in predicting a September cut.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius warned that job market weakness is linked to a broader slowdown, worsened by trade frictions.\n\n\"Friday's jobs numbers reinforced our view that U.S. growth is near stall speed,\" Hatzius stated.\n\nGoldman estimates real GDP grew just 1.2% annualized in the first half of 2025, nearly a full percentage point below potential.\n\nThe bank expects similar softness in the second half, citing higher tariffs as a drag on output, consumer spending, and hiring.\n\nHatzius warned that most of the pass-through from tariffs to consumer prices is still ahead, likely weighing on real disposable income.\n\nGoldman's baseline calls for three 25-basis-point cuts in September, October, and December, followed by two more in the first half of 2026. A 50-basis-point cut in September could be under consideration if unemployment rises again.\n\nMarkets currently assign an 86% probability to a quarter-point cut in September, with a 55% chance of another cut in October.\n\nLast week, Trump nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to temporarily replace outgoing Governor Adriana Kugler on the Fed board. Last month, Miran argued against the risk that tariffs would cause an inflation increase.\n\nTrump\u2019s economic team also reportedly considered current Governor Christopher Waller as Jerome Powell's potential successor when Powell's term ends next year.\n\nNotably, Waller dissented in July's meeting, favoring a rate cut while Powell and most policymakers held rates steady.",

      "text": "- July CPI expected at 2.9% annually, with tariffs driving gains in household furnishings and recreational goods.\n- Core CPI seen up 0.3%, sharpest monthly rise in six months.\n- The next 100%+ earnings move could hit this month. See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nJuly's inflation report, due Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to confirm that Donald Trump's trade tariffs are beginning to ripple across more categories in the consumer basket. That shift could create another obstacle for the Federal Reserve as it weighs the timing of interest rate cuts.\n- IWM ETF is testing a key resistance. Check the latest price here.\nJuly Inflation Preview: Tariffs Showdown Begins\nWall Street economists expect the Consumer Price Index to rise for a third straight month.\nThe consensus view is for annual CPI to print at 2.9%, above June\u2019s 2.8% and matching the highest level since February.\nOn a monthly basis, prices are projected to rise by 0.2%, which is slightly below the 0.3% increase observed in June. Much of the increase is expected to come from retailers passing along higher import duties, especially in household furnishings and recreational goods.\nExcluding food and energy, core inflation is expected to accelerate. Economists forecast a 0.3% monthly gain in core CPI, the largest in six months, up from 0.2% in June. The annual core rate is projected to tick up from 2.9% to 3%.\nCore inflation, which excludes food and energy, is projected to edge up to 3% from 2.9% in June, with the monthly core CPI expected to increase 0.3%, its sharpest rise in six months, after 0.2% previously.\nEconomists See Broader Price Pressures In July\n\"It seems likely that inflation will advance further over June's rate of 2.7% as the consequences of Trump's \u2018Liberation Day' tariffs become inescapable,\" Richard Potts, economist at Bondford, said in an emailed comment.\nHe added that a growing number of companies have \"exhausted the cheaper stockpiles of imported goods that they had built up in advance of April's tariff hikes\" and will now \"have little option but to pass on the new cost of these tariffs to consumers.\"\nStephen Juneau, economist at Bank of America, expects core goods prices to rise 0.3% month-on-month in July, faster than in June.\n\"Tariffs should continue to put upward pressure on prices,\" he said, highlighting a 1.2% surge in apparel prices as a leading driver, even as both new and used vehicle prices are projected to decline again.\nJessica Rindels at Goldman Sachs sees four key trends shaping the July data.\nShe forecasts a 0.75% rebound in used car prices due to higher auction prices, a 0.2% decline in new car prices resulting from stronger dealer incentives, a 0.1% decrease in car insurance premiums, and a 2% increase in airfares.\nRindel also expects monthly core CPI to remain between 0.3% and 0.4% in the coming months due to tariff effects, even as underlying inflation trends lower. Goldman expects the year-end core CPI to be 3.3%.\nRead now:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved."
