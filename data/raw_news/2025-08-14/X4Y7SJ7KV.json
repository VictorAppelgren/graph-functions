  "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Down? Here\u2019s What To Know.",
  "description": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency appeared to be hit by poor inflation data and cooled government interest.",
  "content": "Bitcoin declined by more than 4% to just over $117,700 as of around 2:25 p.m. EDT on Thursday, pacing what would be the crypto\u2019s largest daily decrease since April 6 (6.1%). The price of bitcoin jumped to a new all-time high of $124,436 earlier Thursday, following a 2.6% rally Wednesday, before the value dropped sharply from its peak. A report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated wholesale prices increased 0.9% in July, well above economists' forecasts of 0.2%, according to FactSet, marking a reversal in demand for risk assets like bitcoin as optimism the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September appeared to drop slightly. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Thursday the U.S. did not plan to acquire more crypto assets for its bitcoin reserve, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up.\u201d The U.S. bitcoin reserve holds between $15 billion and $20 billion in assets, Bessent said.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, earlier Thursday neared its all-time high set in November 2021 before paring back gains. Analysts appear optimistic about ether\u2019s growth prospects this year: Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick increased his year-end price target for ether from $4,000 to $7,500 and suggested the cryptocurrency could surge to $25,000 by 2028. Kendrick said ether has benefited from recent regulatory developments, specifically the GENIUS Act, which provided the first federal regulations for stablecoins. Stablecoins rely heavily on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, accounting for about 20% of all blockchain fees.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market has rallied so far this year amid regulatory optimism under the Trump administration. Bitcoin has soared to new record highs, including surpassing the $110,000 and $120,000 thresholds within a two-month period. President Donald Trump has signaled he would ease regulatory burdens facing the crypto industry, and announced the U.S. would establish a digital asset stockpile similar to its gold reserve. Several companies have said they would similarly invest in bitcoin, including Trump\u2019s Trump Media and Technology Group, which announced a $2.5 billion plan to set up a corporate bitcoin reserve.",

      "text": "Topline\nWholesale prices increased by an unexpected 0.9% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday, causing markets to shudder after reaching record highs on a much more optimistic inflation report from the consumer price index on Tuesday.\nKey Facts\nThe producer price index indicated wholesale prices rose 0.9% in July for an increase in 3.3% for the year, after remaining flat in June.\nThe jump in final demand caught economists polled by Reuters by surprise, who expected it to rise a more modest 0.2%.\nPrice increases for services drove the rise, the BLS said, with final demand rising 1.1%\u2014its largest increase since March 2022.\nPrices for goods also increased, which the BLS attributed in large part to prices for food rising 1.4%.\nMarkets slipped on the news Thursday\u2014the S&P 500 fell 0.25% as of 12:45 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq was down 0.19%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 0.45%.\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.\nWhat Goods And Services Got More Expensive For Producers?\nFood prices, which can be volatile, led the price increases among goods over the last month. The prices for fresh and dry vegetables rose a staggering 38.9%. Meat prices also rose\u2014beef and veal rose 4.6%, while pork rose 1.3%. Prices for eggs for fresh use also rose 7.3% between June and July, after declining 19.8% the previous month. Other goods with increasing prices included diesel fuel, jet fuel and nonferrous scrap, while gasoline prices fell 1.8%. Prices for services also grew\u2014portfolio management prices increased by 5.8%, while prices related to \u201csecurities brokerage, dealing, investment advice, and related services\u201d rose 3.2%. Final demand for trade services, including machinery and vehicle wholesaling, rose overall. Prices for computer hardware, software and supplies rose by 3.5%, and television, video and photographic equipment rose by 3.8%.\nWill The Fed Cut Interest Rates?\nThursday\u2019s report comes only two days after the BLS released the consumer price index for July, which showed consumer prices rising 0.2% over the last month\u2014slightly lower than what economists expected. This is driving optimism that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, although inflation remains above the central bank\u2019s goal of 2%. While markets were down Thursday afternoon, it remains unclear whether the PPI numbers will place a dent in that optimism for September. As of Thursday, CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool still puts the odds of a rate cut at 90.6%.\nKey Background\nThe mixed data for July prices comes after President Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the department published revised data that showed significantly weaker job growth in recent months. Trump claimed the jobs report was \u201crigged\u201d and \u201cphony,\u201d but provided no evidence for the claims. The BLS provides independent data important for the Fed to accurately analyze the economy, and McEntarfer\u2019s dismissal sparked concerns for the organization\u2019s independence and ability to provide neutral data in the future. Trump has since nominated E.J. Antoni, the former chief economist for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank responsible for producing Project 2025, to replace McEntarfer."

      "text": "How the Fed impacts stocks, crypto and other investments\nHigher interest rates played out on stocks, cryptocurrency and commodities such as oil over the past few years. But now that short-term rates have started declining, what can investors expect from here, and how long will the shifting rate environment impact markets?\nAfter lowering interest rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting, the Federal Reserve opted to hold rates steady at its last five meetings, including the latest on July 29-30, leaving them in a range of 4.25 to 4.50 percent. With the potential disruptions and inflation caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, the nation\u2019s central bank decided to keep rates where they are.\nBut more rate cuts may be on the way in 2025, helping buoy the U.S. economy.\nHow interest rates impact investments\nInterest rates are one of the biggest tools the Fed has for influencing the economy. By lowering rates, the Fed can stimulate economic activity, making it cheaper to borrow. On the other hand, by raising interest rates, the Fed can slow economic activity, making credit more expensive \u2014 which is a useful strategy to fight inflation.\nWhile the Fed raised rates 11 times during the last tightening cycle, it\u2019s easy to spot when markets really sat up and took notice that the central bank wasn\u2019t kidding that it was about to recalibrate monetary policy. It was November 2021 when cryptocurrency and many of the riskiest stocks peaked.\n\u201cWhen the Fed introduced restrictive monetary policies by increasing rates in 2022, this caused equity markets and cryptocurrencies to appropriately decline in valuation,\u201d says Octavio Sandoval, principal at Illumen Capital.\n\u201cThe stock market will never not worry about future interest rates,\u201d says Steve Azoury, head of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan. \u201cThe cost of borrowing impacts all areas of investing, purchasing and savings. Just the anticipation of what may happen is enough to cause a stock market reaction.\u201d\nWhile rates were moving higher, many stocks were moving lower, anticipating slower economic conditions. But when investors got a clearer picture of the end of rising rates in 2023, the outlook became more optimistic.\nMajor stock indexes such as the S&P 500 spent most of 2022 in a funk due to rising rates, but they fared well in 2023. The S&P 500 rose about 24 percent in 2023, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed around 43 percent. They followed that up strongly in 2024, and have risen to new all-time highs in 2025 after rebounding from a meltdown over Trump\u2019s tariffs in April.\nBut after an impressive run-up, there may be plenty of room for markets to fall if the economy worsens. In fact, following Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs, the S&P 500 suffered a \u201ccorrection,\u201d a decline of more than 10 percent from a recent high, while the Nasdaq entered a bear market, a decline of 20 percent or more from a recent high.\nAmid rising interest rates, many high-growth stocks had a rough 2022, and while prices firmed up in the past couple of years, that doesn\u2019t mean these stocks are still anywhere close to their prior highs.\nFor example, software stocks such as Zoom Communications and Confluent are well below the all-time highs they hit in 2020 or 2021. Nonetheless, profitable big-name stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and others in the Magnificent 7 set a series of new all-time highs year after year despite higher rates, even after a lackluster 2022.\nIn 2022, cryptocurrency prices struggled as interest rates looked to move higher, but when rates began to top, crypto prices bottomed and then rose in 2023 and throughout 2024. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has helped boost the price of Bitcoin, and the prospect of lower rates and inflows to ETFs have pushed Ethereum higher, too.\nHow do lower interest rates affect stocks?\nA lower fed funds rate makes it easier for money to flow through the economy, helping to boost markets or at least support them from declining more. As lower short-term rates help boost the economy, stocks begin rising due to the prospects for higher corporate profits. Lower short-term interest rates make stocks and other risky investments look like more attractive investments compared to alternatives such as bonds.\nIn contrast, when short-term rates are high or expected to move higher, stocks endure notable volatility as investors factor in rising rates. In other words, stocks begin pricing in a slowing economy and lower profit growth due to higher rates.\nWhile the Fed lowered short-term interest rates in late 2024, longer-term interest rates have been rising generally over this period. The bellwether 10-year Treasury, now offering a 4.38 percent yield, is above its 52-week low of 3.60 percent, which was set in September 2024.\nWith the federal government expecting to run even larger budget deficits under Trump\u2019s proposed tax plans, investors are demanding higher long-term rates to protect them against the potential for inflation. Eventually, if long-term interest rates continue to rise, it may hurt stock prices.\nHow interest rates have affected crypto and commodities markets\nSome other major asset classes have had varied responses in the face of fluctuating rates.\nWhile cryptocurrency prices plummeted along with other risky assets, many commodities spiked higher in early 2022, including oil, but many of those moves proved short-lived. With the rising fed funds rate slowing and then pausing in 2023, both oil and crypto found some support, while gold powered higher.\nGold has long been a safe haven in times of volatility. The yellow metal went on a tear in 2024, as the pending arrival of lower rates and potential market volatility helped boost its price. It\u2019s had a strong start in 2025 as well, rising to record levels as economic uncertainty rears its head.\nCryptocurrency has often been touted as a cure-all for what ails you, whether that\u2019s inflation, low interest rates, lack of purchasing power, devaluation of the dollar and so on. Those positives were easy to believe in as long as crypto was rising, seemingly regardless of other assets.\n\u201cThe truth is that crypto prices have proven to be impacted by the same directional sentiment that impacts retail stock investors,\u201d says Dan Raju, CEO of Tradier, a brokerage platform. \u201cIn general, high interest rates scare investors away from riskier investments like crypto, and the lowering of rates will be seen as a positive by the crypto investor community.\u201d\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies responded to reduced liquidity, as did other risky assets, by falling when the Fed announced in November 2021 its intention to raise rates and then throughout 2022 as the Fed aggressively followed through. On top of that, the blowups of cryptocurrencies and exchanges such as FTX hammered traders\u2019 confidence in these virtual assets.\nBut instability in the banking sector in 2023 led many traders to bid up cryptocurrency, in the belief that the future path of rate increases would be less severe. And as 10-year Treasury rates peaked in October 2023 and then fell, riskier assets rose, as the path to a lower fed funds rate appeared clear and then actually did appear in September 2024.\nHowever, other factors are also at play in the rise of cryptocurrency. One of the most notable is the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which has driven a lot of money to this cryptocurrency. The election of Trump, perceived as the crypto-friendly presidential candidate, also had traders betting strongly on an expected rise in cryptocurrency.\nAs for commodities, many have been well off their recent highs, as fewer supply constraints and higher interest rates work to take them down a few notches. But the expectation of lower rates helped keep oil from falling substantially below $70 a barrel in 2023 and 2024. Oil bounced around between $70 and $85 for much of 2024, though in early 2025 it fell under $60 on fears about a slowing economy.\nHow should interest rates impact your investing strategy?\nInterest rates, inflation and uncertainty \u2014 all create a stew of volatility for investors. With so much volatility, investors may want to tread cautiously.\nHowever, the best way for most investors to approach this type of market is to stick to the long-term game plan. For many, the long-term plan means continuing to invest regularly in a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds and mostly disregarding the noise around the world. For others, the game plan may involve buying and holding well-diversified index funds. Either way, don\u2019t let emotions get in the way of an effective long-term investing plan.\nWhile short-term traders may be sweating rate movements, it\u2019s vital to keep things in perspective. Instead of trying to find the right time to sell, buy-and-hold investors can use the market\u2019s volatility to their advantage and then try to find the right time to add more.\n\u201cFor long-term investors, the pullbacks represent attractive buying opportunities,\u201d says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst.\nDownturns can be an appealing time to add to your portfolio at discounted prices. As investing legend Warren Buffett once said, \u201cYou pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\u201d That is, stocks are cheaper when few agree that they\u2019re an attractive investment.\nBottom line\nInterest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, and since September, the Fed has begun lowering rates and may eventually do so in 2025, despite a pause in the first half of the year. Those investors with a long-term investing horizon may view any downturn as an ideal time to pick up some quality investments at bargain prices.\nAnd if stock valuations plummet? Buffett has some wisdom for that situation, too: \u201cOpportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.\u201d\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.
