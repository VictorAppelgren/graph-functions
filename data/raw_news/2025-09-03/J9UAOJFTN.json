  "content": "New Capabilities Enable Drones to Autonomously Search, Identify, and Deliver Actionable Intelligence in Real-Time\n\nLAS VEGAS, Sept. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centinus, the AI-powered drone software company, today announced a suite of new features at the Commercial UAV Expo. Engineered to shift drones from passive surveillance tools into proactive investigative resources, these new capabilities demonstrate how Centinus strengthens agency operations through the dual power of artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nAI That Goes Beyond Object Detection\n\nThe pioneering BOLO AI for Vehicles and People feature elevates real-time situational awareness by enabling operators to simply describe what they're looking for: a \"white SUV\" or a \"man wearing a red hat.\" As the drone carries out a piloted or autonomous mission, its AI-driven object detection scans live video feeds in real time. By combining advanced computer vision with a large language model (LLM), the system automatically searches for and alerts the operator when matches are found, tracking the exact location of both the drone and subject.\n\nOnce identified, the pilot on the ground or in a remote location can investigate further using the new Zoom to ID feature. The system highlights the subject, zooms in for confirmation, and captures high-resolution photos that can be shared instantly. For vehicles, this includes the ability to automatically focus on a license plate, record a clear image, and extract it via OCR for rapid identification.\n\nThese breakthrough features build on Centinus's industry-leading, ultra-low-latency drone software, adding a proactive, intent-driven search layer to its remote piloting and livestreaming platform. AI capabilities instantly relay actionable intelligence back to the operator, accelerating response times and strengthening security.\n\n\"BOLO is more than an upgrade to drone surveillance; it's a shift in how agencies think about drones as a tool to support operations,\" said Jonathan Duff, CEO of Centinus. \"By combining AI and real-time aerial intelligence, we're moving from observing environments to proactively identifying and responding to threats. This capability positions Centinus and our partners at the forefront of how public safety, critical infrastructure, and national security will evolve over the next decade.\"\n\nCentinus' AI-powered features are complemented by Single Pane of Glass, a unified operating environment where video feeds from multiple drones can be viewed and analyzed from a single screen. This enables users to pin and monitor simultaneous feeds and delve in for closer analysis. AI can be applied across feeds from multiple sources in real-time, extending its utility beyond aerial surveillance to provide situational awareness across entire security ecosystems.",
