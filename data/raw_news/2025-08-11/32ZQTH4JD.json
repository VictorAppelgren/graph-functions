  "content": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand parliamentarian Chloe Swarbrick was ordered to leave parliament on Tuesday during a heated debate over the government's response to Palestine.\n\nAn urgent debate was called after the centre-right government said on Monday it was weighing up its position on whether to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nClose ally Australia on Monday joined Canada, the UK and France in announcing it would recognise a Palestinian state at a U.N. conference in September.\n\nSwarbrick, who is co-leader of the Green Party, said New Zealand was a \u201claggard\u201d and an \u201coutlier\u201d and the lack of decision was appalling before calling on some government members to support a bill to \u201csanction Israel for its war crimes.\" The bill was proposed by her party in March and is supported by all opposition parties.\n\n\u201cIf we find six of 68 Government MPs with a spine, we can stand on the right side of history,\" said Swarbrick.\n\nSpeaker Gerry Brownlee said that statement was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and she had to withdraw it and apologise. When she refused, Swarbrick was ordered to leave parliament.\n\nBrownlee later clarified Swarbrick could return on Wednesday but if she still refused to apologise she would again be removed from parliament.\n\nNew Zealand has said it will make a decision in September about whether it would recognise Palestine as a state.\n\nForeign Minister Winston Peters told parliament that over the next month the government would gather information and talk to partners, which would inform cabinet\u2019s decision.\n\nLabour parliamentarian Peeni Henare said New Zealand had a history of standing strong on its principles and values and in this case \u201cwas being left behind.\u201d",

This debate was prompted by the government's consideration of recognition, following similar announcements from allies like Australia, Canada, the UK, and France. Swarbrick criticized the government for its inaction, calling it a 'laggard' and urging support for a bill to sanction Israel for alleged war crimes, which led to her removal when she refused to apologize for her remarks.
