We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best business computer overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApple's newest iMac, with the zippy M4 chip, is the best overall business desktop PC and all-in-one device on the market. There are countless improvements on the original M1 machine, and this reasonably priced desktop PC benefits from the latest hardware and a RAM boost, with the base model starting with a healthy 16 GB unified memory. While there are no major design changes to report, this machine also comes in plenty of fun colors \u2013 giving you a bit of flair to your home office setup.\nThis model features the same stunning 4.5K panel that was fitted into its predecessor, but the downside once again is that you can only opt for a 24-inch size, rather than the 21.5-inch and 27-inch models that were previously available when Intel supplied Apple with processors. That said, it's fantastic and razor sharp at a 4,480 x 5,250 resolution (218 pixels per inch). It's great for general day-to-day usage, as well as streaming movies or TV shows, or working with media files. The iMac is also complemented with a crisp built-in webcam that's got a higher megapixel count and Center Stage functionality to keep you in the shot at all times.\nElsewhere, there are a few more quality of life improvements like the Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard finally getting USB-C (although the port still lives at the bottom of the mouse), while there are also four USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 in the higher-end edition. We'd love to have seen a bit more, including HDMI, but you could always buy expansion hardware to accommodate any additional requirements. Overall, it's the best business computer on the market, offering a near-perfect blend of performance, aesthetics, and user-friendly design.\nRead our full Apple iMac 24-inch (M4) review.\nThe best budget business computer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor such a small form factor, the Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 offers an impressive desktop option for businesses and professionals who are short on space. The optional mounting brackets make it very suitable for a variety of spaces, including under desks and on the back of rolling carts, and it can be barely noticeable, under the right circumstances. This machine, ultimately, offers a great basic experience for most people hoping to work efficiently and quickly on simple office tasks.\nThe cheapest version is available for under $700, but you can easily spec it up and get some of the best hardware in a configuration in excess of $1,500 \u2013 but it depends on your specific needs. Using the machine is simple and you barely run into any problems if you're working in basic office applications like word processing or spreadsheets, and can handle a fair few browser tabs as well. What we'd recommend against is heavy video playback or any high-intensity graphics work, like video editing or advanced photo editing.\nWe also lamented the lack of HDMI and minimal USB-C, which means it limits you if you need to work with multiple peripherals at once. But that's the drawback in picking such a light and compact mini PC. Overall, this is a fantastic proposition for business users who only want a simple machine to perform day-to-day tasks and one that can be fitted subtly in an otherwise busy environment.\nRead our full Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 mini PC review\nThe best desktop tower PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLike the Millennium Falcon and your very first car, the Dell Tower Plus Desktop might not look like much \u2013 and it might have a clunky name \u2013 but it's what you find under the hood that counts, and what it can unlock for you in your office.\nWe previously highlighted the Dell XPS Desktop as the best desktop tower PC for businesses, and this new machine replaces it in Dell's lineup. We wrote in our Dell XPS Desktop review that it offer's a huge amount of power and plenty of ports \u2013 as well as a great cooling system that keeps it quiet. The Dell Tower Plus Desktop picks up where the XPS Desktop left off \u2013 with a similar design as well as more ports than you can count on both your hands.\nThe best part is you benefit from the latest hardware in the form of an Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPU and a whopping 32GB RAM, which will be enough to handle almost everything you throw at it. The base configuration also represents fantastic value for money, provided that you aren't looking to spin up and graphics-heavy tasks or engage in visuals primarily (you can upgrade the unit to one that includes a dedicated GPU, but you'll bump the cost up significantly).\nUltimately, with a clean and professional design, as well as plenty of firepower under the hood at an affordable price, the Dell Tower Plus Desktop can fit into any office or home office.\nThe best Windows all-in-one business computer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApple has stepped away from big-screen desktop all-in-ones in recent years, offering just a 24-inch iMac in its lineup. That's where manufacturers like HP have stepped in to fill the gap with the likes of the excellent HP OmniStudio X 31.5.\nThis all-in-one PC is a capable machine that comes with a stunning 32-inch 4K IPS display and an array of great components, including a dedicated Nvidia graphics chip. That's why the OmniStudio X 31.5 is a decent iMac replacement for those who need to work with a much larger screen in their all-in-one.\nThere's so much to love about this PC's design, with its Meteor Silver colorway blending an aluminum material for the base and neck with hard plastic on the actual all-in-one itself. The display also boasts incredibly thin bezels on the top, left and right, with a bigger one below to show the HP logo.\nIt looks exceptionally sleek, overall, but it also performs fantastically. The PC can handle pretty much anything you throw at it in terms of creative software and day-to-day performance. Its webcam capabilities are also great \u2013 and video playback is an absolute charm.\nRead our full HP OmniStudio X 31.5 review\nThe best mini PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGood things come in small packages \u2013 and in Apple's case, the best Mac is its smallest. This compact and lightweight mini PC packs a major punch thanks to the new M4 chip, which now features across Apple's entire computing lineup.\nWith this Mac Mini, you also get a healthy 16GB unified memory as well as a 256GB SSD in the base configuration, which is available for an audaciously low price when you look at the wider market. Not only is this the best mini PC, but it could also be the one that represents the best value for money on the market.\nOne of the best things about the newer Mac Mini is its redesign. It's sleek, beautifully designed, and much smaller than it ever has been. This makes placing it in any room in your home or in the office as simple as ever.\nThis machine also runs quietly while guaranteeing excellent performance thanks to the internal components, which are as good as you'll find in a MacBook Air or base MacBook Pro. The Mac Mini is highly functional, too, with two front-facing USB-C ports alongside an array of ports on the rear, including HDMI, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt 4 ports. This is in addition to a small power supply port.\nUltimately, it's an incredibly well-made and wel-priced Mac that benefits from being small enough to move around at your discretion, or hide away subtly in your home office. Although given how good it looks \u2013 you'd want to display it with pride.\nRead our full Apple Mac Mini (M4) review\nThe best business computer for creatives\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe HP Envy 34 all-in-one computer is undeniably powerful, offering an excellent iMac alternative to Windows users who want outstanding design, fantastic features, and great performance for a relatively affordable price. Our coveted five-star rating is rarely given, which should speak volumes about how impressive it is. That's despite the fact that it runs a last-gen Intel processor and a mobile GPU.\nAmong the many things we appreciate here are its movable 16MP webcam and excellent selection of ports. On test, however, it's its stunner of a display that hogs the spotlight. This height-adjustable, 34-inch, 5K 21:9 screen isn't just gorgeous; it's also bright with 500 nits of brightness and 98% coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut, which makes it ideal for video editors that work in that color space.\nDon't like upgrading to a new computer every couple of years? It's also expandable up to 4TB M.2 storage and 128GB DDR4 RAM so there's room to grow here.\nRead our in-depth HP Envy 34 All-in-One review\nFind the best deals on HP products with our HP coupon codes.\nThe best business computer: FAQs\nWhat computer is best for business?\nA recent development in the desktop PC world has been a modest diversification of the system case. The typical business PC comes in a mini-tower box, probably best suited under or beside your desk.\nBut a smaller case would be a better choice if space is at a premium. Dell, for example, delivers its Optiplex models in the mini tower, 'thin' desktop, and 'compact' small form factor sizes, each offering the same computing power but in a different case.\nThree other formats that have grown in popularity are:\n1. All-in-one, or AIO, combines the monitor with the base unit. The move to power-efficient components, the falling price of LCD panels, and the ubiquity of touch functionality make AIO an increasingly popular choice for businesses. The all-in-one PC resembles a slightly larger than normal LCD display containing the processor, hard drive, and memory built into the screen casing. The end result is a very elegant, clutter-free desktop PC.\n2. Ultra-small form factors, known as nettops or mini PCs, borrow many of their designs (and components) from laptops. They are laptops without a screen, input peripherals, and battery.\n3. HDMI dongles inspired by tablets and smartphones often share parts with the latter. These are usually used for display signage or in niche markets. They are usually not powerful enough for most tasks, but things will likely improve with the expansion of Thunderbolt technology.\nWhat is the difference between workstation vs desktop PC?\n\u2022 TechRadarPro Q&A with Anu Herranen, Director of New Product Introduction, Advanced Compute and Solutions at HP Inc.\nThe main thing here is that you must ignore the form factors. In this case, the question would be, what is the difference between a (regular) desktop PC and a desktop workstation? The answer is that the workstation has been developed for a specific professional workflow.\nIt is not just about the raw performance of a device's processor or other components. It is about how well they perform in specific tasks relevant to the work they are designed to do. Do they make that system easier and faster and remove unnecessary complexity so you can focus on the task and be more productive and creative?\nUsually, data scientists will not emphasize the color accuracy of a display. Still, they will care about having a device that can process huge data sets for hours without crashing mid-way. A graphic designer or VR developer, on the other hand, will care about processing jobs quicker by managing how power is split between the CPU and GPU, depending on the task.\nYou also need to get beyond the box. What software stack or operating system does the workstation need to run? Does the workstation need to run the full Adobe creative suite? Are the keyboard and other input devices optimized for the user's needs? Examples might include a VR headset or a set of separate programmable keys.\nSecurity and manageability in workstations are also designed to work seamlessly across the whole stack and conform to specific requirements defined by role and managed by IT departments. Devices are often configured to get the best out of a given software. They may even carry certifications that guarantee performance for certain software, such as those from Autodesk.\nAll of this adds up to a curated experience \u2013 a device dedicated in every way to a workflow and ready to go out of the box, saving days of configuration time.\nThe final key difference is that workstations are very expandable \u2013 designed with upgrading in mind. Whilst that is true of many PCs, workstations are engineered with this capability in mind. A workstation is designed to be a device that can expand with your needs over a long period of time.\nHow much RAM do I need for a business computer?\nYou can pick up plenty of desktop PCs and business computers with 8GB RAM \u2013 this will have once been enough, but you really need a minimum of 16GB RAM to work efficiently and effectively without any delays and bottlenecks.\nApplications are more demanding now than they've ever been, and even web browsing with multiple tabs consumes a significant amount of RAM, meaning if you're runnning with only 8GB, you might not be able to do much else without some major lag or hitting a performance wall. Ultimately, 16GB is enough for most day-to-day uses and, in Apple's case, its 16GB unified memory is plenty to even handle moderately intense tasks.\nIn Windows PCs, you ideally want 32GB if you're using intensive applications like Adobe software (Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro) or plan on doing multiple high-intensity tasks at once. Obviously, 32GB might set you back more in terms of cost, depending on the model and configuration, but you should target no less if you have more intensive needs.\nHow to choose the best business computer for you\nWhen choosing the best business computers for yourself, start by assessing the nature of your business, the number of computers you need, and the operating system.\nIf your work primarily involves using office apps, emails, web browsing, or data entry, an entry-level business PC should work perfectly well. If you're in architecture, graphic design, or any other field that demands the use of resource-intensive apps, then you'll want to opt for powerful computers with impressive graphic capabilities. We've reviewed the best photo editing PCs and best video editing PCs for professional content creation.\nHow much RAM you need will depend on how resource-heavy the apps you use are and whether you do a lot of multitasking. The more apps you run simultaneously, the more RAM you'll want for a smoother experience.\nYou'll want to evaluate what operating system works best for you. If your employees are used to working on Windows, sticking to that is more efficient than switching to a new system.\nConsider the size of the machines if you don't have a lot of desk space or want a neat workplace setup. You'll also want to consider the pricing of the computers and whether the seller offers discounts on bulk purchases.\nHow we test the best business computers\nOur team has gone hands-on with everything from the best business tablets and best business monitors to the best mini PCs to find out which business devices offer a genuine productivity boost. To test the best business computers, we first looked at their specifications, like the CPU, graphics, RAM, storage, connectivity, and dimensions. We considered the types and sizes of businesses they'd be suitable for and whether the tech configurations were expendable.\nWe assessed how well they handled multiple apps simultaneously, how smoothly they ran resource-heavy apps, and how easy the setup process was.\nWe evaluated the dimensions and weight of the computers to check whether they take up a lot of desk space and are light enough to be moved around easily. We also considered whether the computers had dual monitor capabilities, ports for external displays and swift wireless connectivity.\nWe tested out the best MacBook Pro laptops for when you need to get work done\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Bryce HylandContributor\n- Collin Probst\n- Desire AthowManaging Editor, TechRadar Pro"

      "text": "Nvidia\u2019s DGX Station brings 800Gbps LAN, the most powerful chip ever launched in a desktop workstation PC\nNvidia is enlisting the help of major PC manufacturers to roll out its new DGX station\nA surprising announcement at Nvidia GTC 2025 was the launch of the DGX station, a powerful supercomputer-class workstation PC that looks a lot like a traditional tower computer but with an Arm-based CPU inside.\nThis is not the first workstation Nvidia launched; it famously partnered with AMD to launch the precursor to the 2025 DGX Station called the DGX Station A100.\nThat one didn't have a Nvidia Arm CPU and needed separate PCIe AI accelerators (A100); the 2025 iteration doesn't. It also carried a price of more than $100,000 at launch.\nNvidia DGX Station\nNvidia confirmed that Asus, Boxx, Dell, HP, Lambda and Supermicro will sell their own versions of the DGX Station: the big name missing out is Lenovo.\nThe GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Desktop Superchip that powers it delivers up to \u201c20 PFlops of AI performance\u201d which is likely to be measured using FP4 with sparsity.\nThat would also infer that it is half the performance of GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, so something\u2019s not clear here and I wonder whether there\u2019s more than one version of the GB300.\nNvidia hasn\u2019t said how many or what type of (Arm) CPU cores the GB300 uses; ditto for the GPU subsystem.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nIts predecessor, GH200, had 72 Arm Neoverse 2 CPU cores clocked at 3.1GHz, up to 144GB HBMe memory and 480GB LPDDR5x memory.\nWhat we do know is that it has 784GB of unified system memory, which one can assume means HBM (288GB HBM3e) plus what Nvidia calls Fast Memory (496GB LPDDR5x most probably).\nFastest NIC in a computer\nNvidia also disclosed the DGX Station will use its proprietary ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, a network technology that can deliver up to a staggering data center-class 800Gb/s connectivity.\nA close-up of the opened chassis shows the workstation has three forward-facing 120mm fans, a motherboard with three PCIe slots, an Nvidia-branded soldered chip (perhaps the SuperNic), and two large uncovered dies.\nOne of which is the Grace GPU and the other with eight distinct tiles, the Blackwell GPU.\nNo details about expansion or storage capabilities, the PSU capacity, the cooling solution used or the price have been revealed.\nAdditionally, we do not know whether you will be able to plug in accelerator cards like the H200 NVL (or a theoretical B300 NVL) to significantly improve the performance of the DGX Station.\nThe DGX station is expected to compete with the likes of the Camino Grando, an EPYC-powered tower workstation that packs two AMD CPUs and up to eight GPUs.\nWe\u2019ll strive to update this article when further details of this workstation PC (including pricing and availability) are published.\nNvidia\u2019s GTC Keynote also saw the formal launch of DGX Spark, formerly known as Project Digits, 12 new professional GPUs and Blackwell Ultra (or GB300), Nvidia\u2019s most powerful GPU ever.\nYou might also like\n- These are the best business laptops on the market\n- Check out our list of the best rugged laptops\n- We curated the best mobile workstations right now\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 has been musing and writing about technology during a career spanning four decades.

Its high memory bandwidth and AI-focused compute also suggest it could be a top-tier PC for coding, especially for machine learning or large-scale simulation tasks.\nHowever, the real value of this product depends less on its raw specs and more on how grounded MSI\u2019s claims about its purpose truly are.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe phrase \u201cdesktop AI supercomputer\u201d continues to be used liberally, and MSI\u2019s adoption of it raises similar concerns to those previously leveled at Asus and Dell.\nA supercomputer, by definition, implies massive parallel processing power, usually deployed across large-scale server racks. Shrinking that concept down to a single desktop machine, even with cutting-edge components, feels more like branding than technical accuracy.\nMSI isn\u2019t alone in this; Nvidia\u2019s DGX Spark framework itself seems at least partially designed to enable this kind of positioning.\nFor all the talk of supporting top-tier AI tools and delivering enterprise-grade performance at the edge, there\u2019s currently little evidence that these systems approach the breadth or scalability of true supercomputing infrastructure.\nEven 1,000 TOPS, while impressive, must be understood in the context of what modern AI teams actually require to train or run LLMs.\nWhile MSI may succeed in delivering a dense, high-performance system for localized inferencing and AI prototyping, the real-world utility of the MS-C931 is likely narrower than the \u201csupercomputer\u201d label implies.\nUntil these machines prove their value in practice, calling them desktop supercomputers feels more like aspirational branding than a reflection of what they truly deliver.\nVia TechPowerUp\nYou might also like\n- Take a look at our roundup of the best business VPNs available now\n- These are the best cloud document storage solutions to choose from\n- Meta says no evidence it monopolized social media market, asks Judge to throw out antitrust case\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "Best mini PC of 2025: our top mini computers benchmarked for work and play\nWe put the best mini PCs, thin clients, and NUC boxes to the test\nMy team and I have tested over 100 of the best mini PC units - and I've selected my top picks for business, gaming, content creations, and everything in between.\nFor most people, the Apple Mac mini (M4) is a stellar mini computer that's well-priced, beautifully designed, and incredibly powerful, making it suitable for a range of tasks.\nFor a similarly mighty Windows mini PC, I really like what the Geekom AX8 Pro offers, while the Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT stands out as the best mini PC for gaming that the team has reviewed. And for those looking for a cheap mini PC, the GMKtec NucBox M5 Plus neatly balanced price and performance.\nBut there are plenty more featured in this round-up - each one benchmarked using industry-standard tools to explore performance across basic productivity like running office software through to heavy creative workloads to see where they shine (and why).\nUpdate: Since my last update, we've reviewed a string of new mini computers, with highlights including the GMKtec NucBox K10, the Bosgame M4, and the business-focused NiPoGi E3B 2025 Edition.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nBest mini PC overall\nSmall and stylish, our top-rated mini PC with its M4 processor is perfect for everyday office tasks, streaming movies, and even 4K video editing.\nBest on a budget\nBest budget mini PC\nWell-priced for the specs, this cheap mini PC proved to be an excellent performer with plenty of flexibility for most tasks and most people.\nBest for Windows\nBest mini PC for Windows\nA stylish machine that offered superb performance during our tests, and one of the best you can find running Windows OS.\nBest for gaming\nBest mini PC for gaming\nDesigned as a gaming mini PC, we loved how well this model handled AAA titles, alongside other graphically intense workloads.\nBest for video editing\nBest mini PC for video editing\nThe Minisforum UM790 Pro is a powerful small form-factor PC that impressed us with solid performance from office tasks to 4K video editing.\nBest for business\nBest mini PC for business\nFor a reliable, professional-grade device for a range of business uses, this model from Dell offers some great extras, including robust security features.\nLoad more products\nBest for creators\nBest mini PC for creators\nIf you're running creative tasks on your mini, we found this unit excelled at the task, particularly when using the full Adobe Creative Suite - a solid alternative to Apple.\nBest mini workstation\nBest mini PC workstation\nOnce we paired this device with Beelink's external GPU dock, we saw an astounding boost to performance, besting some mobile workstations.\nBest for small spaces\nBest mini PC for small spaces\nIt might not be the smallest mini PC we've reviewed, but this MSI NUC proved its worth and we really like the smooth performance and compact design.\nBest mini PC overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a mini PC that just works: This machine is ideal for anyone who wants to plug, play, create, and work.\n\u2705 You create content: We highly rate the Mac mini for anyone editing photos and videos, alongside running the usual office apps.\n\u274c You want a Windows machine: The Apple ecosystem isn\u2019t for everyone - especially in the NUC community.\n\u274c You want a mini PC you can upgrade: Unlike most Windows mini PCs, you don\u2019t have the luxury of upgrading this system at will.\nThe Apple Mac mini is our top choice for users who want a smooth and powerful computing experience that won\u2019t break the bank.\nSince first getting an M-series chip, the Mac mini has been the best mini PC around, and equipped with the latest M4 chipset only makes it even better. This is a device that\u2019s more than capable of everything from productivity tasks to photo and video editing. All on 16GB RAM, amazingly optimized by Apple.\nOur expert reviewer used the M4 Mac mini for general office tasks, admin, browsing the web - what I\u2019d call the essentials - and found the device worked perfectly. For 4K video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro and other intensive workloads, the machine still brilliantly kept pace, and remained virtually silent (perfect for shared workspaces). Playing games was fair, too, although you\u2019d never mistake the device for a gaming mini PC. And what about Apple Intelligence? It\u2019s been hyped to the Nth degree, but we found it\u2026fine. It was good, capable, but evidently still in its infancy. One to watch.\nBut overall, powered by the M4, the Apple Mac mini retains its lead above rivals. For performance, price, and size, there\u2019s just no beating it.\nRead our full Apple Mac mini (M4) review\nBest mini PC on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap mini PC with good specs: This model comes with either an AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9 processor and 16GB RAM.\n\u2705 You want to upgrade: We found the M5 Plus was great for those who want flexibility from their mini PC.\n\u274c You need a super-cheap mini PC: Depending on your configuration, it\u2019s not the cheapest around, but for the specs, it\u2019s a very reasonably priced performer.\n\u274c You need USB 4.0 or Thunderbolt: They\u2019re completely absent here, although general port selection remains good.\nAfter an extensive review, we found the M5 Plus from GMKtec to be an affordable mini PC with plenty of positives and relatively few negatives considering the cost.\nAvailable in a range of configurations, from the cheap barebones options to a fully fledged mini desktop running Windows 11 Pro and sporting the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U, 32GB, and 1TB storage. At its cheapest, it retails for around $230 / \u00a3190, up to around $400 for the higher-end model - although I\u2019ve seen it regularly discounted.\nSpeaking of barebones, we were pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to open up the device and get inside - the top of the case can be easily prised away, and the four screws holding everything in place are clearly visible, unlike some we\u2019ve reviewed. For anyone familiar with building PCs, it won\u2019t take more than ten minutes to upgrade the RAM, storage, and reboot the system. For IT professionals, one of the best features here is the dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, making it a great pick for those creating a custom firewall with a suitable Linux distro.\nPerformance was good overall - in balanced mode, the unit was effectively silent, while the fans did start kicking in when we switched over to performance mode. As a budget mini PC, some corners have been cut. There\u2019s no metal enclosure here (although the plastic casing did a good job of keeping components safe and fans kept everything cool during use). Nor does it feature the latest Ryzen 7 processor, and still has a Radeon Vega 8 GPU. Not one for gamers and power users, then, but for general office and server duties, presentations, and running firewalls, most boxes are ticked here.\nFor a cheap mini PC, also consider the Beelink U59 (see our Beelink U59 review), which is half the price, but only has an Intel Celeron processor.\nRead our full GMKtec NucBox M5 Plus mini PC review\nBest mini PC for Windows\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a stylish mini PC with great performance: With an all-metal build, this model feels like true quality compared to others.\n\u2705 You want desktop-like specs: The AX8 Pro comes equipped with AMD Ryzen 9 chip and AMD Radeon Graphics 780M graphics for excellent performance.\n\u274c You need a mini PC on a budget: With a retail price of around $800, it\u2019s not a cheap device.\n\u274c You need a dedicated unit for video editing: We noticed a slight lag when editing high bitrate footage in Premiere Pro.\nWith its all-metal casing, stylish design, and high performance in our tests, the Geekom AX8 Pro is one of the best mini PCs running Windows, and a good pick for those that need a device for all-round use.\nPerformance across a host of software was impressive, even with apps that usually require extra compute like Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere Pro. Check out the full review for our benchmark results, but needless to say, with the specs of this unit, it scored well across the board. It even proved solid for gaming - Fire Strike and Time Spy scores, especially for graphics and physics, prove that in medium settings, the AX8 Pro is well-equipped to tackle graphically intensive modern gaming titles.\nThe inclusion of USB 4.0 and 3.2 ports for connecting external monitors, external GPU, and storage for ultra-fast data transfers makes it suitable for photographers and video editors working with large data files. Having said that, we clocked some slowdown when we attempted to edit 4K video footage with a high bitrate, but nothing that interrupted our general workflow. In general, performance remained smooth and responsive whether conducting creative tasks or running basic office apps.\nUnder complex workloads, the fans did kick in, but the system remained cool and in any case, we didn\u2019t find them especially loud. Overall, a great all-rounder, ideal for demanding office work and medium creative applications.\nRead our full Geekom AX8 Pro mini PC review\nBest mini PC for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a mini PC for gaming: Looking like a small-form version of a traditional gaming PC, we found the design well-suited for those looking for the gamer aesthetic.\n\u2705 You want a mini PC that will tackle office and content creation: This machine easily powered through office tasks and photo and video editing.\n\u274c You prefer a subtle design: With its red and black motif emblazoned on the side, it\u2019s anything but subtle.\n\u274c You need a basic mini PC: Thanks to some high specs and expandability, this is better suited to those that want a performance boost.\nNot all mini PCs are capable of handling modern games - but the Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT doesn\u2019t have that problem. We ran the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Tekken 8 without any problems at all, and overall we found gaming performance was excellent.\nThat\u2019s not all it can do, of course - this isn\u2019t a one-trick pony, after all - and the machine also tackled the Microsoft Office suite well, too. Web browsing, word processing, and spreadsheet editing felt smooth. And when we turned our attention to content creation, Photoshop and Premiere Pro both performed well. However, we recommend taking advantage of the USB-C port to attach an external SSD, because there are storage limitations.\nSpecs-wise, the AtomMan G7 PT features an AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX chip, AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT GPU, and 32GB DDR5 dual-channel memory, which is expandable up to 96GB. You\u2019ll also find a 1TB M.2 2280 PCIe 5.0 SSD slot, with an extra M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 slot for expanding storage, too.\nThe design may be more gamer-oriented than a lot of other, subtler mini PCs, but beyond that, we don\u2019t have any real issues with the machine. Alternatively, the Asus ROG NUC 970 is a good 1440p gaming mini PC (see our Asus ROG NUC 970 review) - but it does have a higher price-tag.\nRead our full Minisforum AtomMan G7 PT mini PC review\nBest mini PC for video editing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to edit videos: In our tests, we found the Minisforum UM790 Pro tackled 4K editing with ease.\n\u2705 You want a well-specced machine at a reasonable price: Not the cheapest, but for the specifications on offer, it compares well against others on our list.\n\u274c You just want to run office apps: Although this mini PC will excel at general office usage, it might be overkill for some.\n\u274c You want a stunner of a device: Frankly, the design here is slightly plain - it won\u2019t be turning heads any time soon.\nImpressed by its size and strength, we found the Minisforum UM790 Pro is one of the best mini computers for video editing. Equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU and AMD Radeon 780M GPU, in our tests it excelled in processor and graphics-intensive tasks, including gaming and 4K video editing. A number of our recommended mini PCs are up to the task, but compared to the likes of the Apple Mac mini and the AX8 Pro, this model is comparatively well-priced and well-specced, making it a good pick.\nFor creatives dealing with large files, the machine\u2019s 32GB DDR5 dual-channel RAM (expandable to 64GB) and dual M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots (1TB installed) are well up to the task. Elsewhere, we were pleased with the port selection here, which includes USB 4.0 and HDMI 2.1 for connecting high-res displays. And yes, there\u2019s VESA mounting for those looking to tuck this mini PC away.\nDuring benchmark tests, the UM790 Pro proved to be a solid performer - and those high scores (see full review for more) translated into outstanding real-world performance when we ran Photoshop and Premiere Pro. We could even run games in a medium setting on this mini-beast without any issues.\nThe design might be plain, but it's practical, emphasizing functionality. While priced in the mid-range for a high-end mini PC, its strong performance and features justify the cost, appealing to those seeking powerful performance in a compact form. Alternatively, we\u2019d recommend the Apple Mac Studio for professional video editors.\nRead our full Minisforum UM790 Pro review\nBest mini PC for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an office-friendly device: Dell bills this as a \u201chigh-performance commercial desktop\u201d, and that bears out after our testing.\n\u2705 You want a reliable PC brand: As a recognisable brand, in general, you can\u2019t go wrong with modern Dell products.\n\u274c You want a cheap mini PC: No matter what way you slice it, this isn\u2019t a budget mini PC by any stretch of the imagination (or wallet).\n\u274c You need a content creation station: Like many Dell machines, this is better suited to business use than creating professional-grade content.\nWell-suited to office environments, the Dell Optiplex Micro Plus 7020 boasts a compact size that belies its power and abilities. It\u2019s worth noting that, after testing, we found this desktop to be designed - almost tailored - to the business use case. It\u2019s not a mini PC for graphics-based projects or heavy workloads and processing.\nWith that in mind, it performed remarkably well. It capably tackled multi-tasking and ran business apps with absolute ease. We tried it out by opening a multitude of spreadsheets and multiple windows while browsing the web, and saw no noticeable performance issues. Charts, graphs, images were all handled well. While lightweight, build quality feels robust enough to endure life in a busy office, or carried on the commute.\nPort selection is where we felt this mini PC was lacking. Yes, there\u2019s the usual array of USB-C ports, three DisplayPorts, but HDMI is an optional extra (we didn\u2019t have one on our review unit). If that\u2019s a deal-breaker, I strongly recommend checking out our Minisforum Venus NAB9 mini PC review, which we found also well-suited to the office environment and has two HDMI ports. We were also disappointed with the built-in 512GB storage, which is far from generous these days, and will likely require an external SSD or cloud storage back-up.\nStill, for business-grade performance, the Dell OptiPlex Micro Plus 7020 does everything you\u2019d need it to do, with a couple of configurations bumping the base unit\u2019s Intel Core i5 to Core i7 and switching 16GB RAM to 32GB, for those who need more power.\nSave on high-performance laptops and accessories with our latest Dell discounts. Find great deals on tech for work and play.\nRead our full Dell OptiPlex Micro Plus 7020 mini PC review\nBest mini PC for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to create all kinds of content: This is a great mini PC for photo editing, video editing in high resolutions.\n\u2705 You want a mini PC that can handle AI: We were particularly impressed with the AI-enhanced CPU when using AI tools in Adobe apps.\n\u274c You need a silent mini PC: While the fans nicely cooled the system, we did notice some sound when under load.\n\u274c You only need to run office apps: With these specs, it\u2019s easy to run office software, but honestly, it might be overkill if that\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re doing.\nAssuming you\u2019re a content creator avoiding the usual Apple suggestions of the Mac mini and Mac Studio, we really liked what\u2019s on offer from the Geekom A8 Max. In appearance, the Geekom A8 Max is fairly similar to the Mac mini, with its sleek, silver, matte aluminum casing (imitation being the highest form of flattery). But it\u2019s got the specs most creatives will need, even at pro-level.\nThis mini PC comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 chip with AMD Radeon 780M graphics (A Ryzen 7 variant is available). Rounding out the core specs is a 2TB SDD and 32GB DDR5-5600 MT/s RAM, expandable up to 64GB.\nIn our benchmark and real-world tests, performance was good. It\u2019s more than capable of running office apps, browsing the web, checking emails - as you\u2019d expect. But it\u2019s also perfectly equipped for editing photos or video editing up to 8K. Overall, we were impressed with the overall performance of the A8 Max - particularly how the AMD AI-enhanced processor handled the AI tasks accessible through the Adobe Creative Suite.\nHaving said that, with its integrated GPU, it\u2019s still going to struggle to power through any pro-grade 3D modeling or for playing games at max settings. And of course, while it will effortlessly run all your basic office apps and media streaming, if that\u2019s all you\u2019re intending to do, you\u2019ll find cheaper mini PCs capable of doing that.\nOverall, though, this one ticks the boxes most general content creators are going to need. Check out our Geekom AE8 mini PC review for a good alternative that\u2019s not dissimilar in specs or design.\nRead our full Geekom A8 Max mini PC review\nBest mini PC workstation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want extra power: Combining this mini PC with Beelink\u2019s external dock really gives this device a performance boost.\n\u2705 You want to future-proof the device: With the ability to swap out GPUs in the dock, you can upgrade this mini PC with the latest supported cards.\n\u274c You need a mini that\u2019s ready to go: If you want to take advantage of the full power of this machine, you\u2019ll need to get the external dock for supported GPUs.\n\u274c You need a cheap machine for video work: Costs add up here with the device, dock, and separate graphics card - and for that reason, a Mac mini or Mac Studio may be the better option.\nLet\u2019s get this straight - if you want the power of a true workstation, you\u2019ll absolutely want to opt for a traditional desktop or even a mobile workstation laptop. But if you\u2019re looking for a compact alternative, then the Beelink GTi12 Ultra with the company's external GPU dock is a good option.\nAs a standalone device, there\u2019s much to like about this large mini PC, which comes equipped with a Intel Core i9-12900H processor with double the power limit found on most laptops featuring the chip, 1TB SSD, and 32GB RAM expandable to 96GB. And for standard mini PC usage - running servers, office software, streaming media - it proved more than capable in our tests. Build construction also impressed us, the design and engineering perhaps matching the likes of Apple devices (well, almost). Port selection is also good, and includes one Thunderbolt 4 port, five USB-A, and one USB-C.\nBut this Nuc comes into its own when paired with the optional Beelink Multi-Functional EX Docking Station, letting you connect and power an external GPU. This ability to hook up PCI cards is, at present, the most unique approach we\u2019ve seen to beefing up the specs of a mini PC. We paired the device and dock with a Sapphire RX 7900 graphics card and benchmark testing showed it had about twice the speed of a mobile workstation like the Dell Precision 7780 with an Nvidia RTX 3500.\nCosts will begin to stack up here, as you\u2019ll need to buy the mini PC, the dock, and an external graphics card. So, for those on a budget, it\u2019s not going to be suitable. Nor can it really compete with the latest workstations with the highest-spec components. We should also note the dock only supports dual-slot video cards, so not every card will fit. But if you want a well-constructed mini PC with a graphics boost, it\u2019s worth exploring.\nRead our full Beelink GTi12 Ultra mini PC review\nBest mini PC for small spaces\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a serious space-saver: With an 0.8L chassis, this is a pleasingly compact mini PC suitable for areas where space is at a premium - and yes, it\u2019s VESA mountable, too.\n\u2705 You want a reliable day-to-day device: We used this as a general office mini PC and experienced no problems at all throughout testing.\n\u274c You need the smallest mini PC around: While it\u2019s one of the tiniest devices we\u2019ve reviewed, and deliciously handheld, it\u2019s not the smallest mini PC we\u2019ve ever reviewed.\n\u274c You need a creative workstation: With these specs, the MSI Cubi NUC 1M isn\u2019t designed for video editing, gaming, photo editing, or more strenuous graphical workloads.\nLooking for one of the smallest mini PCs around? Then you\u2019ll want to see the MSI Cubi NUC 1M. Measuring 135.6 x 132.5 x 50.10mm, it\u2019s one of the most compact devices we\u2019ve tested - although it\u2019s not technically the smallest mini PC on our books (for that, check out our Minisforum Mercury EM780 review).\nStill, as far as a saving on space goes, there\u2019s plenty to recommend here, with the device boasting up to an Intel Core 7 chip, a maximum of 64GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD. A barebones model is also available for those who want more freedom to build and upgrade their own unit.\nIn our tests, we found this machine effortlessly ran as a media server, streaming videos, supported multiple displays, and all the usual office software most people will need. With a raft of features, we\u2019d also suggest this mini PC would work for digital displays and as a data back-up device. During the two days of dedicated use, we experienced no problems at all.\nPossibly the best part about this mini PC, beyond its small size, is the port selection, where you\u2019ll find dual HDMI ports, two Thunderbolt ports, two 2.5G ethernet lines, four USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD Card reader.\nIt\u2019s not really designed for creative use, so don\u2019t go expecting it to be a space-saving mini PC for high-resolution photo and video editing. For everything else, we found performance was excellent.\nRead our full MSI Cubi NUC 1M mini PC review\nBest mini PCs compared\nModel | CPU | GPU | RAM | Storage | Dimensions | Barebones model available |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nApple M4 | Integrated GPU (up to 16-core) | Up to 32GB | Up to 2TB | 5 x 5 x 2in / 12.7 x 12.7 x 5cm | No | |\nAMD Ryzen 7 5825U | AMD Radeon Vega 8 | Up to 64GB | Up to 1TB | 5.07 x 5 x 1.88in / 12.3 x 11.1 x 4.3cm | Yes | |\nAMD Ryzen 9 8945HS | AMD Radeon Graphics 780M | Up to 64GB | Up to 2TB | 4.61 x 4.37 x 1.51in / 11.7 x 11.1 x 3.8cm | No | |\nAMD Ryzen 9 | AMD Radeon 780M | Up to 64GB | Up to 1TB | 5.12 x 4.96 x 2.06in / 13.0 x 12.6 x 5.23cm | Yes | |\nUp to Intel Core i9 14th Gen | Integrated graphics | Up to 32GB | Up to 512GB | 7.17 x 1.42 x 7.01in / 18.2 x 3.6 x 17.8cm | No | |\nAMD Ryzen 9 | AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT | Up to 96GB | 1TB (expandable) | 11.2 x 6 x 2.4in / 28.5 x 15.3 x 6.1cm | Yes | |\nAMD Ryzen 9 | AMD Radeon 780M | 32GB | Up to 2TB | 5.31 x 5.20 x 1.81in / 13.5 x 13.2 x 4.6cm | No | |\nIntel Core i9-12900H | Intel Iris Xe Graphics | Up to 64GB | Up to 8TB | 6.22 x 6.22 x 2.2in / 15.8 x 15.8 x 5.58cm | No | |\nUp to Intel Core 7 150U | Integrated graphics | Up to 64GB | Up to 1TB | 5.34 x 5.22 x 1.97in / 13.56 x 13.25 x 5.01cm | Yes |\nBest mini PC: Frequently asked questions\nAre there different types of mini PC?\nThere is a lot of variety when it comes to mini PCs: various sizes are available and they are designed for various use cases.\nSome mini PCs are designed to lay flat under a desk while others have a unique vertical design that allows them to be placed on top of your desk next to your monitor and within arm's reach. You can also completely conceal them behind your monitor if they come with VESA mounting holes.\nToday's best mini PCs are a great alternative to bulky full-size desktops and all-in-one systems for all kinds of uses: from administrative workers doing data entry, to customer service specialists and call center offices, to creative professionals and students learning at home.\nWhat is the best use of a mini PC?\nMini PCs excel at everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, video streaming, and light gaming. You can easily connect them to your TV to play games and watch movies either via a platform like Netflix or through your own media server, with the effectively set acting as a monitor. With specs comparable to mid-range laptops, they don\u2019t have the necessary CPU and GPU to run more resource-intensive apps and games. In those circumstances, it may be worth investing in high-spec devices like the best video editing laptops, which are built for heavy workloads.\nWhat are the disadvantages of a mini computer?\nWhile the best mini PCs absolutely shine, they\u2019re not without a few downsides. When it comes to specs, mini PCs pale in comparison to modern desktop computers and the very best laptops. While you shouldn't have trouble using most as a space-saving alternative to the best laptops for graphic design or the best laptops for photo editing, it can make it difficult to use hardware-intensive apps and processes, like any of the best video editing software.\nUpgrading those lower-specced internals is usually out of the question. Even some of the best mini PCs can't be expanded with better components (at least, not without some technical knowledge and skill).\nThey also need to be run from the mains, so while they\u2019re an excellent portable option, you lack the built-in batteries found in laptops. Due to their form, some users may also experience issues with overheating. Mini PCs also lack peripherals, from screens to optical drives.\nHow much RAM do you need for a mini PC?\nAs with desktop computers and laptops, the best RAM is the most amount of RAM you can get within budget. It will make performance much more fluid, especially if you\u2019re using the mini PC for a lot of tasks. We recommend a bare minimum of 8GB memory, although 16GB and above is preferred.\nAre mini PCs good for gaming?\nIt all depends on which games you want to play. The very best mini PCs can ably run lightweight or older games - in fact, many use them as emulators. However, they will typically struggle with newer games, like the triple-A offerings from the likes of Rockstar. They simply don\u2019t have the required CPU and GPU to handle them.\nCan you connect a mini PC to a laptop?\nYes, you can connect your mini PC to a laptop and use it as a monitor - but it\u2019s also easy, as many mini PCs lack the required HDMI ports to output to the laptop screen. One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by using remote desktop software.\nAre the best mini PCs better than laptops?\nIt depends how you intend to use your mini computer. While both are highly portable, mini PCs are more so, with a far smaller surface area. If you\u2019re working on the go, be aware of the sometimes limited battery life on laptops - if you\u2019re usually running off the mains, a mini PC may be the better choice.\nLaptops serve as a great all-in-one solution with everything you need to work and play. Accessories like the best office keyboards and the best monitors for a dual set-up are optional. They also come with a range of tech specs, with options for everyday computing tasks right up to the best gaming laptops.\nLike a traditional desktop computer, a mini PC is best when used in spaces with easy access to monitors (or TV), keyboards, and other peripherals on hand. For this reason, mini PCs are great for office use, allowing multiple users to access the device in a variety of locations. Cost is also a factor, as mini PCs tend to be cheaper than laptops.\nHow to choose the best mini PC for you\nWhen choosing which mini PC is best for you, there are several factors to consider - but first, it's important to be sure a mini PC is right for your needs.\nMini PCs, sometimes known as think clients or NUCs, are ideal for light use, such as web browsing and video streaming. Some can even handle casual gaming sessions. But you won't find the raw power offered by the likes of the best mobile workstations.\nDespite their name, mini PCs come in a range of sizes, from tiny machines like the Acemagician T8 Plus to the Apple Mac mini, which on the larger size. But they're all considerably smaller than a desktop, so if you're looking for a space-saver, they're ideal. You'll find plenty that even include a VESA mount for attaching the device to monitors to de-clutter the desk.\nIf a mini PC is best, consider how you'll be using your machine. In addition to general computer usage, mini PCs have been used as media servers, games emulators, and much more.\nFor smooth performance. a good CPU, GPU, and RAM are essential. We've included a selection of AMD- and Intel-powered thin clients here, all capable of delivering speed and performance for a range of uses.\nHowever, be sure to check your device's ports and connectivity. Some of the best mini PCs pack in plenty of Thunderbolt and USB ports, memory card slots, and HDMI connections, but some are less generous. If portability is a consideration, remember to check dimensions and weight. You'll find these details in our full mini PC reviews.\nWhen it comes to budget, mini PCs tend to retail for around $100 and up, although we recommend checking out our round-up of the best Prime Day PC deals and Black Friday mini PC deals, as you can make big savings when the sales are on.\nHow we test the best mini PCs\nWe've tested thousands of devices, from the best photo editing PCs to best video editing Mac and MacBook laptops and best business monitors. And we have extensive experience with small-form NUCs and thin clients.\nA lot of time and care goes into selecting the best mini PCs. Appliance-type mini-PCs often have a metal enclosure to help with passive cooling and more than one wired Gigabit Ethernet port. The best mini PCs are perfect for leaving unattended in a small network cabinet, rack, or locker, where they can be used as fixed-function mini-servers, such as a firewall for an office network or file storage for a small shop.\nThere's also a class of mini PCs that are small. These range from palm-sized to slightly more significant than a thumb drive, often with an HDMI male connector and built to be attached to the back of a TV or monitor for entertainment or web browsing on a big screen.\nAs such, selecting a mini PC is no easy task. First, we had to filter them based on size. We started from the tiniest ones, the thumb drive-sized PCs, up to the palm-sized devices, then moving to the TV-box-sized machines. In each size jump, we looked for the usage scenarios for each based on the capabilities of the CPU and amount of RAM and included ports, then we weeded out the ones with sub-par specs; this removed several dozen entries with the same Celeron CPUs and low RAM.\nOnce we got to the higher-spec entries, the winners started to show up either by expansion capabilities, unique features, or suitability for the purpose. Final filtering by brand name and support considerations is how we ended up with our selection of picks for the best mini PC for home and office.\nAs such, when testing which mini PC is best, we study several key areas. This includes build quality and form-factor - we want to see a robust machine, and the best materials available for the cost. This is especially true with mini PCs, as they're designed to be easily carried and used in multiple locations.\nWe explore the internal specs of each device, and how they compare with some of the other best mini PCs on the market. As part of this process, we also assess the upgradability of the device - from the options on offer to the ease of creating your perfect mini PC. This includes benchmarking performance of the CPU, GPU, and RAM. We're not necessarily looking for the most powerful mini PC. But we want to see suitable performance relative to a range of uses and budgets.\nPorts and connectivity are another area where we look at what's on offer - and how it compares with rival devices. Not everyone will need Thunderbolt 4, but we expect to see adequate slots on a mini PC to increase functionality and flexibility.\nPrice is always a consideration. Depending on how you use it, the most expensive mini PC you can buy may not offer genuine value for money. We've curated a selection of mini PCs here, from premium machines to the cheapest mini PC with great performance.\nYou can read more about our comprehensive testing methods in our guide How we test laptops and desktops: Our review process explained.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.
