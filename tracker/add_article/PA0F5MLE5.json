      "summary": "Avolta AG's estimated fair value is CHF 72.06, indicating it is currently trading at a 36% discount with a share price of CHF 46.04. The company's intrinsic value is significantly higher than the analyst price target of CHF 49.23. Avolta's future earnings are forecasted to grow faster than the Swiss market, although its Price-To-Earnings ratio is high compared to industry averages, suggesting it may be overvalued despite its growth potential.",
