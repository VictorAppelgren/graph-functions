  "description": "Plus, some developers really want to get out of the way of Hollow Knight: Silksong.",
  "content": "Welcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. It's been a very busy week in that realm, thanks to Gamescom. Before we jam through a few of this week's new releases and some of the many, many Gamescom reveals, there's one game that has risen high above the din to the point where it's drowning out many of the smaller announcements.\n\nYes, Hollow Knight: Silksong has a release date, and it's very, very soon. September 4, in fact. I feel for all the developers who have games coming out around the same time, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, Hell is Us, Baby Steps and even NBA 2K26. Sure, Silksong may primarily be for a different audience than the latest edition of a massive basketball franchise, but it's going to take up much of the oxygen in the gaming space for a while. As such, some developers are delaying their games to give Silksong a wide berth.\n\nCloverPit was scheduled to drop on September 3, but it's getting the hell out of Silksong's way. The grimy, slot machine-based roguelike is now going to arrive on September 26. \"We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol,\" developer Panik Arcade said. \"We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we\u2019re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further.\" Meanwhile, Talegames is pushing back the 1.0 release of its adventure RPG Faeland and Aeternum Game Studios is delaying a Metroidvania called Aeterna Lucis from September into 2026.\n\nThere's no doubt that Silksong's arrival is a big deal. It's been the most wishlisted game on Steam for yonks, was a focus of Microsoft's Xbox Ally handheld reveal and is a sequel to an indie blockbuster that has now sold more than 15 million copies. In any case, we'll soon find out if that very, very long wait was worthwhile. Years of Silksong memes sure were. I\u2019m going to need some other long-awaited game to joke about before every showcase now.\n\nI have no earthly idea why it took me so long to try this, but I tested my PlayStation Portal by my building's pool for the first time this week and it turned out that the Wi-Fi was, in fact, strong enough there for me to use the handheld. It was a fitting place to check out Sword of the Sea, which hit PS5 (including on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium) and PC this week.\n\nI'm only an hour or so into this $30 game from Giant Squid, but I'm enjoying the relaxed approach to exploration here. As you'd might expect from developers who have worked on The Pathless, Abzu and Journey, the movement in Sword of the Sea is delightful. You'll take off from wavy dunes and pull off tricks like you're in an SSX game as you surf across sand and water on a sword in the aim of restoring life to the barren landscape. Sword of the Sea is a looker, and I'll surely be getting lost in it some more over the coming days.\n\nSpeaking of games that have an eye-catching aesthetic, Herdling is another exploration and adventure title that dropped this week. This one's from Okomotive (Far: Changing Tides, Far: Lone Sails) and publisher Panic.\n\nHere, you'll be guiding a ragtag herd of beasts across hilly terrain toward the summit of a mountain. You'll have to solve some \"light\" environmental puzzles and even endure some stampedes along the way. Herdling typically costs $25, but there's a 25 percent launch discount. It's available on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass too.\n\nWith Ball x Pit on the horizon, I figured we were all taken care of for the foreseeable future as far as Breakout-esque roguelites go. Not so fast, said the team behind Vampire Survivors.\n\nPoncle has spun up its own publishing arm and the second game it's releasing (after Berserk or Die) is Kill the Brickman from Doonutsaur. Poncle released the game on Steam and Xbox without prior warning this week, and it costs five bucks.\n\nYou'll collect and augment various bullets that you use to destroy bricks from outer space. There's a lot going on in the minute-long trailer, but I particularly love how some of the bricks \"cry\" when a bullet smacks into them.\n\nDiscounty is a life sim about managing a supermarket in a small town. Hopefully, you'll be a more magnanimous proprietor than the operators of the JoJa Mart in Stardew Valley, but you'll still have to deal with some folks who are none too pleased about the effect of the business on their town.\n\nDeveloper Crinkle Cut Games and publisher PQube suggest there are some secrets to discover in Discounty, which is out now on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store. It's coming to GOG as well at a later date. The game typically costs $20, though there's a 20 percent launch discount on PC.\n\nEngadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent a few hours with Absolum, a fantasy beat-'em-up with a roguelite spin from co-developers Guard Crush Games and Supamonk and publisher Dotemu (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4). I highly recommend reading his write up for the full lowdown as Absolum sounds like a real treat.\n\nThe demo for this slipped through the cracks for me during the early June chaos of Summer Game Fest and Steam Next Fest, but it's still available and I'll absolutely be checking it out to get a taste of Absolum before it arrives on October 4. It's coming to Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5.\n\nAs I mentioned in our liveblog for Gamescom Opening Night Live this week, any new Ron Gilbert game is worth getting excited about. He's the director of the first two Monkey Island games and Return to Monkey Island, as well as a developer and producer of so many other projects over the years. Death by Scrolling. is something completely different for Gilbert.\n\nIt's a vertical-scrolling, action-heavy roguelite in which you need to stay alive and earn enough gold to pay a toll to a ferryman to escape from the afterlife. The look is very heavily reminiscent of Stardew, so if plundering the mines in that game was more your jam than farming and fishing, this might be up your alley.\n\nThere's no release date as yet for Death by Scrolling, which Gilbert started working on back in 2019, but it's said to be coming this year. In the meantime, you can read updates about the game's development on Gilbert's terrific blog.\n\nIt's fun that we had mentions of two John Carpenter-related projects at Gamescom this week. Not only was there another look at John Carpenter's Toxic Commando during Opening Night Live, there was the reveal of Halloween the Game from IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive.\n\nSet to arrive in 2026, Halloween the Game follows the likes of Friday the 13th: The Game (from the same teams) and the Gun-published The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It has a 1 vs. 4 asynchronous multiplayer mode in which the quartet will have to use anything at their disposal \u2014 from wielding weapons to calling the cops \u2014 to survive the threat of the unkillable Michael Myers. There's going to be a single-player aspect to this game as well, as you'll be able to control the legendary mass killer in an adaptation of the original film's story. Halloween the Game is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Steam and Epic Games Store.\n\nA game about a guy with a brown backpack who scours ruined, overgrown suburban homes in search of valuable resources that can help him survive a bunch of zombies in the post-apocalypse? It has to be Long Gone, of course! What other game could you possibly be thinking of?\n\nThis is a linear pixel-art narrative adventure from Hillfort Games and co-publisher Outersloth (Among Us studio Innersloth's publishing wing). The developers seem to have been influenced by a little game you might have heard of called... Gone Home, as you'll look through the belongings of people who used to live in this world and learn the truth about what happened. There's no combat here. Instead, zombie encounters require puzzle solving. There's no release window as yet for this point-and-click game, which is coming to Steam.\n\nFittingly enough, I've had my eye on Militsoner for some time, so I was delighted to hear that there's a two-week playtest on Steam that's open to everyone. This is an immersive sim in which you'll try to escape a town, but that may not be too easy as there's an enormous policeman watching your every move. The playtest is limited to a slice of the town, but I'm really looking forward to getting in there and finding out what this is all about.\n\nI have to hold my hands up here and admit I'm not familiar with puzzle game maker Rusty Lake. But when the trailer for their next game popped up this week, it had me utterly captivated, because Servant of the Lake looks very, very pretty.\n\nThis is a point-and-click puzzle adventure that will see you carrying out tasks as seemingly innocuous as straightening picture frames to helping with experiments and cleaning up afterward. You'll play as a housekeeper of an estate, but it's not entirely clear whether you'll be able to survive the weekend... Servant of the Lake is coming to Steam, Itch.io, iOS and Android in Spring 2026.\n\nBPM: Bullets Per Minute developer Awe Interactive is back with another rhythm-based shooter, albeit one that has a top-down perspective instead of a first-person one. BPM Bitcrushed (which is being published by Kwalee) is a roguelite, pixel art dungeon crawler that syncs shooting, jumping and dodging to the beat. The dungeons are procedurally generated and there's a \"wide variety of powerful weapons, unique items and rhythm-based abilities\" to discover.\n\nWhat's most interesting to me here though is that, along with the game's own soundtrack, you can load in your own tunes via the custom music feature. Perhaps setting the action to some slow-tempo sludge metal will make things a bit easier.\n\nCouch Planes is an arcade plane racer from Skylab Interactive that's coming to Steam, Epic Games Store and consoles next year. There are a few different modes, 15 maps with environmental hazards and collectable power ups including homing rockets, mines and speed boosts. There's support for four-person local multiplayer and 12-player online action.\n\nFrom Starfox and Grand Theft Auto V to The Falconeer and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, I've never been much good at flying in games. But hey, Couch Planes looks like it could be a fun time with friends.\n\nLet's close out this bumper post-Gamescom edition of our indie games roundup with something that might not be for me, but could be for you. Canvas City is the first project from Disc 2 Games, which is self-publishing the game with help from Dredge studio Black Salt Games.\n\nTurn-based tactics games aren't typically my jam, but I'm always going to have at least some interest in one that's about a group of upstarts rebelling against an oppressive force. In this case, you'll take charge of skaters and street artists who are fighting back in a \"vibrant yet suppressed urban world\" (which sounds a little similar to Unbeatable, which this week got a November 6 release date).\n\nWhat caught my attention here is that fluid movement is a key part of the game. When it's your turn, you can use rails, ramps and other parts of the environment to pull off combinations of tricks and attacks. These chained actions can also earn you Style Points that can enhance your abilities.\n\nDisc 2 hasn't revealed a release window for Canvas City as yet. It's in development for Steam and Nintendo Switch.",

      "text": "Cronos: The New Dawn seems to smush Dead Space and Control together (in a good way)\nBloober Team released the first gameplay trailer for the third-person survival horror title.\nBloober Team has provided a first proper look at gameplay for its latest project, Cronos: The New Dawn, after a brief tease at the end of the initial reveal in October. The trailer has a very Dead Space-like feel, which shouldn't be too surprising given that this is a third-person survival horror game, but that's hardly a bad thing. There appear to be some other influences at play here, and there's one particular feature that seems quite terrifying.\nThe game takes place across two time periods, a decayed post-apocalyptic future and 1980s-era Poland. As a Traveller, you're sent back in time to rescue certain people before they die in an apocalypse. To do that, you'll need to battle creatures known as Orphans, which Bloober describes as \"twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity\u2019s darkest nightmares.\" But you'll need to be sure to burn the bodies of fallen monsters. If you don't, that can spell a whole heap of trouble.\nLiving Orphans can absorb the bodies of their fallen ilk. This so-called Merging evolves the creatures. They become fast, stronger and tougher to take down, and they gain new abilities to boot. So yeah, you'll want to torch any Orphans that you take out.\nThere's a lot going on elsewhere in the trailer. Along with Dead Space, the action and visuals evoke games like The Last of Us Part 2 (if you know, you know), Returnal, Bioshock and Control \u2014 not least because of the shifting, fractured Brutalist architecture. The creature designs are reminiscent of those in last year's Silent Hill 2 remake, a game that Bloober Team just happens to be behind.\nThose aren't criticisms in any way. There's nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from others and fashioning them into something new. Cronos: The New Dawn is looking pretty compelling, and it's already got a spot on my wishlist.\nCronos: The New Dawn is slated to arrive later this year. It's coming to Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S."

      "text": "A brilliant puzzle-platformer, Enter the Gungeon on mobile and other new indie games worth checking out\nPlus, slot-machine-based horror.\nWelcome to our latest recap of what's going on in the indie game space. Quite a few intriguing games dropped this week and some high-profile ones have been ported to more platforms. Before we get to those, though, I'd like to tell you about one of my favorite games of the year so far.\nI struggle to fully engage with many RPGs. By and large, I'm not interested in spending lots of time optimizing my character, speccing out a skill tree or scouring for the very best equipment to match my playstyle. I find it far more interesting when a game offers a limited toolset and a huge variety of ways to use those mechanics, typically by providing a small number of abilities and powerups as well as really clever level design.\nSuch is the case with \u00d6oo, which arrived on Steam last week and is the latest game from Elechead developer Nama Takahashi. This is a puzzle-platformer that you can complete in one sitting and it's utterly captivating.\nYou play as a caterpillar that uses a bomb \u2014 and later a second one \u2014 to blow stuff up and move around. If you want to reach a higher platform, you'll need to detonate a bomb you're sitting on. The controls are simple too, as you only need to move, and drop and blow up bombs.\nThe design of this game, though, is anything but simple. There's almost no text here, even in the menus. You learn by experimenting and figuring out how to navigate what's in front of you. You'll have to backtrack a bit to solve certain puzzles. It's so mechanically tight that a 15-second trailer is all you need to understand what \u00d6oo is about:\nI smiled the entire way through this one \u2014 even when I got momentarily stumped \u2014 and I let out a satisfied chuckle or two when I figured out solutions to problems. It helps that the visuals (by artist Hachinos) and audio are charming as hell. The title of the game is absolutely terrific, too. The umlaut is important because it makes the lettering look like your character with a pair of bombs trailing behind it. This is emblematic of the level of thought, care and detail that Takahashi and co. have put into \u00d6oo. That extends to the end credits, which lists several games that inspired this one. Such a beautiful touch.\n\u00d6oo reminds me a bit of Animal Well. It doesn't have nearly the same level of depth as one of our favorites of 2024, but it doesn't need to. It's perfect the way it is.\nIt also brings to mind another perfect game, Poinpy, with even composer Tsuyomi's work reminding me of that game's fantastic music. I'm still sad that it's impossible for me to play Poinpy right now, as it vanished from Netflix's catalog a while back. But \u00d6oo did a bang up job of filling that hole in my heart. I can't recommend it highly enough.\nElsewhere, there's a lovely little indie you can pick up for free on the Epic Games Store right now for PC, Android and (in the EU) iOS. Hidden Folks is a relaxing hidden object game by Adriaan de Jongh that features hand-drawn environments and funny, voice-generated sound effects. I'm only a little ways into this but I'm enjoying it so far. This week's other Epic Games freebie on PC is ragdoll physics sim Totally Reliable Delivery Service.\nAlso, as a quick reminder, there will be a ton of video game news dropping over the next week as the world's biggest gaming event, Gamescom, is taking place. Check out our Gamescom preview for details on what to expect and how to watch the various showcases and streams, and maybe keep your fingers crossed for a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date, if you're so inclined. Join us on Tuesday as we liveblog our way through Opening Night Live. We'll be bringing you the tastiest news from the event throughout the week too.\nNew releases\nA bonafide indie classic hit mobile devices this week. Bullet hell dungeon crawler Enter the Gungeon (iOS, Android) and its sequel, former Apple Arcade exclusive Exit the Gungeon (iOS, Android), are both free to try and you can keep playing them after making an in-app purchase.\nThese versions include touch controls, with publisher Devolver Digital pointing out that you can \"swipe, tap and poke your screen to conquer the depths of the Gungeon.\" The developers have, at long last, added online co-op so you can play with your friends without having to be in the same room. There's also a crossover here, as the Lamb from Cult of the Lamb becomes the latest playable character.\nThe games' arrival on mobile could also give veteran Gungeon players a decent reason to revisit Dodge Roll's series. The iOS and Android ports could also help them pass the time until Enter the Gungeon 2 arrives on Steam next year.\nAnother popular indie expanded to more platforms this week as Dorfromantik (previously only available on PC and Nintendo Switch) arrived on PlayStation and Xbox, thanks to the help of Headup. This strategy puzzle game from Toukana Interactive is all about building out a world using hex tiles, which makes my Takenoko-loving self happy. It's a chill, beautiful game that'll still get your cognitive gears turning a bit.\nA mobile version is also in development, but it won't be a straight port of the PC and console game. Instead, Toukana is working with ClockStone on a reimagining of Dorfromantik that's built from the ground up for touchscreen devices.\nTMNT went turn-based for the first time in series history with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, which debuted on PC back in May. Strange Scaffold has now brought the game to Nintendo Switch (only in North America for now) and Xbox Series X/S. It's coming to Switch in European regions at a later date.\nPC players might have a reason to return to the game, as Strange Scaffold has updated it with a Remix Mode. This adds many more enemy types with new moves and attack patterns, as well as tougher challenges.\nRa Ra Boom is a co-op, side-scrolling beat-'em-up from Gylee Games that landed on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), Xbox Series X/S and PS5 this week. I love the premise, which sees ninja cheerleaders from outer space descending to Earth to free the planet from a climate change-battling AI that perhaps did its job too well by ridding it of humans. Each of the four characters has their own abilities, including a ranged weapon.\nI've played Ra Ra Boom for about 30 minutes and, unfortunately, it hasn't clicked for me so far. I might give it another shot, but there are just too many other games out there waiting to be played.\nI do appreciate games that are about more than giving players something fun to do. There have been quite a few over the years that aim to help people learn a language. Another arrived on Steam this week in the form of Wagotabi: A Japanese Journey, which debuted on mobile last year.\nIn this slice-of-life RPG from Wagotabi Limited, you'll explore Japan and its culture. It's designed to help players start learning Japanese and it was made with beginners in mind. It features mini games, tests and is fully voiced in Japanese. The developers say that more than 300 teachers spanning more than 60 countries have been reviewing the game, presumably to make sure its lessons are accurate.\nThe Dark Queen of Mortholme has been available on Itch.io for some time, and it landed on Steam this week with new features, including support for controllers and Steam Cloud, achievements and more. In this short experience from Mosu and publisher Monster Theater, you play as the final boss of a video game who has to keep fending off a pesky hero. There are multiple endings and the one that you see is determined by your dialogue choices. The Dark Queen of Mortholme seems pretty interesting, and I'm looking forward to checking it out.\nUpcoming\nCrisisX is an ambitious-sounding survival crafting project from Hero Games. It features an 1,200 km\u00b2 open-world map with 12 terrains and biomes, including snowy mountains and hidden labs. You can forge teams, groups and communes to help you fend off dangers such as infected and other players. What's really wild is that CrisisX will seemingly be able to support up to 5,000 players on a single server.\nIt's coming to PC, iOS and Android in the second quarter of 2026. Those who are attending Gamescom next week will be able to play it at the show, while a beta test is scheduled for later this year. I'm intrigued, not least because CrisisX might be the closest we ever get to The Last of Us Online.\nI feel like I first heard about Henry Halfhead forever ago, so I'm glad that this sandbox adventure finally has a release date. It's coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and PC on September 16.\nHenry is, surprisingly enough, a character that is half of a head. They're able to turn into any nearby object, and you can play as more than 250 different items. There's local co-op support too. It seems cute! Henry Halfhead is coming your way courtesy of Lululu Entertainment and co-publisher Popagenda.\nIf not for \u00d6oo, The Way of the Tray might have been my favorite game in a hot minute. You'll play as a waiter in a Japanese spirit world, where you'll serve orders to various spirits after catching and balancing them on your tray. Seems like one for fans of the restaurant side of Dave the Diver. The Way of the Tray, which is from Who is Terry and publisher Targem Games, hits Steam on August 25.\nCloverPit is a grungy, slot machine-based horror game that looks right up my alley. After all, it's billed as a \"demonic lovechild of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette.\" Sold. You have to accumulate a certain amount of cash each round to help pay off your debt, or it's off to the pit with you. It's not about gambling so much as it is finding ways to break the rules of a slot machine to help you reach your objectives.\nThere's quite a bit of buzz behind this one from Panik Arcade and publisher Future Friends Games. It's had more than 700,000 demo downloads and is among the top wishlisted games on Steam. CloverPit is coming to said platform on September 3.\nLet's wrap things up for this week with a game that has a very cool aesthetic. Zoe Begone! is a bullet hell shooter with hand-drawn visuals. The idea here is that the action plays out on a film strip, with a devilish animator drawing and painting more enemies for our heroine, Zoe, to overcome. As you might imagine, solo developer Retchy took inspiration from drawn-on-film animation from the 1930s, particularly the work of Norman McLaren. As an admirer of Stan Brakhage's work, this speaks to me.\nZoe Begone! is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch on September 17. A demo is available on Steam now.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "The rhythm-infused adventure Unbeatable has a new demo for PC and PS5\n'A game where music is illegal and you do crimes.'\nIn the latest evidence that indie games are often where you find the boldest creative choices, look no further than Unbeatable. The hand\u2011drawn rhythm adventure title \u2014 announced in 2020 and crowdfunded the following year \u2014 oozes style and attitude. For example, look no further than its tagline: \"a game where music is illegal and you do crimes.\" (Nice.) Developer D\u2011Cell Games launched a new trailer and a much more robust demo on Thursday, letting you sample a slice of the full game.\nOne part of the \"anime\u2011juiced\" Unbeatable follows the protagonist, Beat, and her \"band on the run.\" (Nice to see that a Wings reference can still fly in 2025.) The game's narrative\u2011driven segment includes dialogue around town with various people, baseball (played \"the wrong way\" with sledgehammers and katanas), graffiti tagging and bare\u2011knuckle brawls with the cops who enforce the draconian anti\u2011music laws. (Dicks!) And don't forget some alone time to \"think and write new songs.\"\nAnother part of Unbeatable's gameplay involves rhythm mini\u2011games that only require two buttons: up and down. Although that mode is woven into the story, old\u2011school rhythm game fans can enjoy a separate arcade mode that stands as a \"complete game experience,\" including challenges and modifiers. (PaRappa the Rapper fans, rejoice.)\nThere's no release date yet, but the trailer below shows that D\u2011Cell has put those five years of development time to good use. If it looks like your jam, you can take the demo for a spin on Steam and PS5. (The final version will also be available on Xbox.)"

It'll also appear on PlayStation Plus from day one for Extra and Premium Subscribers. The fantasy adventure game marries surfing mechanics with the atmospherics of the developer's previous games like Abz\u00fb and Journey.\nGiant Squid showed off more gameplay in a new trailer as part of PlayStation's June 4 State of Play. \"At its core, Sword of the Sea is all about surfing,\" the developer wrote. \"You\u2019ll be carving your way across mysterious moving waves of sand on the ancient and powerful hoversword.\" Other scenarios include dreamy ice-scapes and oceans full of flying dolphins.\nGiant Squid again teamed with creative director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, who also worked on Abz\u00fb and Pathless. \"As a surfer and snowboarder myself, I have felt the rush of movement and seen the beauty of nature in a way that only these extreme sports can deliver,\" Nava wrote about Sword of the Sea."

Once clarified, I think we saw eye-to-eye on it, but I do hear about it a lot, mostly from programmers that don\u2019t live in game dev.\nTesting games is hard. So much of what fails during testing is due to random behavior by the player. Them doing something you didn\u2019t anticipate.\nI break testing down to three groups.\n1 - Unit testing\nThis is what I hear about the most and how this would be a good way to test games. It is not. Unit testing will test code components of your game, but not the game. If you have a sorting routine, this will test that, but it has little effect on testing your game.\nI do unit testing, mostly on the engine commands. This get run once a week or when I add a new feature. It\u2019s testing that all the command or functions return correct values, but has little to do with \u201ctesting the game\u201d.\nIt\u2019s also something that would be very hard to run from the build process since the entire engine needs to start up. This is why I run it by hand every so often. If it\u2019s not being run in a real engine environment, it\u2019s not accurate.\n2 - Automation\nI\u2019ve been using automation since Thimbleweed Park.\nI called it TesterTron 3000 it ran through the game and randomly simulated clicks and tried to follow some logic. It found a few things, mostly bugs that would only happen if you clicked very fast.\nIt was fun to watch and gave mostly peace of mind testing. It often broke because we changed the games logic and it could no longer follow along. If I had a team that did nothing but keep TesterTron 3000 working, it would be more useful but given the limited resources of an indie team, I\u2019m not sure it would have been worth it.\nI have something similar in Death By Scrolling, it runs through the levels and randomly picks up things and try to attack enemies.\nI could have it follow a set sequence of key strokes, but then it\u2019s only testing what you know works, not the goofy stuff that real bugs are make of. I\u2019ve run into programmers that build something like this and at first it feels good but as the game changes it falls apart and doesn\u2019t get used much after that.\nMaybe if you had a simple puzzle game, this might be useful.\nTesterTron 3000 a good stress tester and it needs to run overnight to be truly useful.\n3 - Human Tester\nThe most important testing we do is with testers who play the game all day long. They look at the Git history and see what has changed and beat on that. 99% of our bugs are found this way and I can\u2019t emphasis enough how important it is.\nPlayers do odd things that automation never will.\nWhile it is important to test your own code, you will never find the \u201cgood\u201d bugs. Programmers are lousy testers because they test what they know, you need to be testing what you don\u2019t know. Be afraid if management that says they don\u2019t need testers because the programmer should test their own code.\nI grew up in a world where a bug meant you have to remake a million floppy disks and it would take months to get the change out to players, if they ever got it.\nWe just got Death By Scrolling running on the Switch. We had to do some optimization because we were doing stupid stuff with rendering the tile map. Modern PC machines are so fast these days that you can do a lot of stupid stuff and it doesn\u2019t matter. Back in the day (queue angry old man) I had to count cpu cycles and every byte of memory was precious. Nowadays memory is basically infinite.\nBut it\u2019s different for consoles, they do have a limited amount of memory and you do have to pay attention to performance.\nOne thing that really bothers me when I play Switch games ported from PC or other consoles is the lack of care over font size. Things that look good on a big monitor or TV are unreadable on the Switch (and the Steamdeck).\nWe\u2019ve taken great care to make everything big enough to be readable on handhelds, but it\u2019s a real pain. As a designer you want to cram enough information on each screen, especially for RPG-ish games.\nPeople get used to html/css rendering and how good it is at flowing to fill space and around images. Games often don\u2019t have text rendering engines that are that complex (using a html/css engine internally is overkill).\nOne of the big upgrades I want to do to my engine is better text flow rendering, it will never be as good as html/css in the browser, but it could be a lot better/easier. It\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m envious of Godot.\nIf you haven\u2019t read my previous post about Death By Scrolling way back in February, I suggest you do.\nOf course this is my lazy way of doing the 2nd promised blog post for Death By Scrolling.\nIn all fairness, I started to write it and it seem awfully familiar so I went back and checked and sure enough I had already written about it.\nBut, I\u2019ll do another real post\u2026\nI asked for beta testers on Mastodon and got close to 300 sign-ups. I didn\u2019t want to invite everyone all at once. There is an old saying that you can only make a first impression once.\nEvery time I make a new beta version I invite 25 more people.\nCouple of stats:\nAbout 25% of the people never redeem the steam key. Or they redeem it weeks later. This is a little surprising, but maybe it shouldn\u2019t be. People are busy.\nOf the people who did redeem the key a third play the game once or twice and never again. This is not surprising. Death By Scrolling is a rogue-like and you die a lot. I do mean a lot, it\u2019s right in the title. Some people do not like this type of game, and I\u2019m OK with that.\nMaybe half the people who play the game never visit the Discord. We can get only so much info from analytics. Having a conversation about what you like and don\u2019t like is very helpful. Again, this isn\u2019t too unexpected.\nThe players that do play more than a few times play a lot and that is good to see. It\u2019s nice to see strategies emerge that we, as the designers, didn\u2019t think of. That is always a good sign.\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve done large-ish beta test for one of my games and it\u2019s been fascinating and very insightful.\nI\u2019m about to invite the next group of 25 testers. If you\u2019re among this group, please visit the Discord.\n\u2013 Ron\nI miss the Kickstarter days of Thimbleweed Park where each week I would write a blog post about how things were going and we\u2019d to a podcast. If we were doing Thimbleweed Park today we\u2019d have a video podcast on YouTube.\nI watch a lot of YouTube videos from indie game devs where they document everything they are doing on their game with a fancy video and my first thought is: \u201cWhere do you find the time to make this\u201d. I barely have enough time to work on my game.\nNow that Death By Scrolling is getting close to releasing, I really should start blogging again about the game. There are a lot of interesting things happening and there is no reason I should keep those to myself.\nI have found that as I get older I enjoy pontificating less and less. I\u2019ve stopped doing talks, doing interviews and podcasts. I really enjoy Tim Cain YouTube channel but I could never do that. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have anything to say, it\u2019s that I have become self-conscious that I\u2019m just pontificating for no reason and don\u2019t have anything deep and interesting to say.\nNow that I\u2019ve got you all primed and ready, starting next week you can plan your day around the Death By Scrolling blog update.\nOr maybe I\u2019ll delete this post like it never happened.\n^^^ this\nWhen I build my game for testing, it\u2019s a completely automated process from the command line.\nI type pub.sh --test\non the command line and a long chain of events is started.\nThe script pushes to git, which starts the cloud based CI machine (Azure) building the Mac, Windows and Linux executables.\nWhen they are done, my local script is notified and they are download locally.\nGame files are added and they are signed and packaged up.\nThe script then logs into Steam and uploads the game.\nA change list is built from the git log and uploaded to a private website.\nWhen that is complete, a message is sent to Discord to notify testers that the build is done.\nThis is all done with no interaction on my part.\nIt makes doing test builds quick, easy, and painless. But more important is there is no human interaction, so there is less chance of a mistake being made.\nTo upload to Steam you need to authenticate, which usually involves getting an email and typing in a code or doing the same with their authentication app. It\u2019s not very conducive to automated builds.\nFortunately Steam has an process where you authenticate once and then pass a token from the command line and that logs you in without a password. Wonderful.\nThis worked fine for what seem like years, then on Jan 1, 2025 I got a error saying my token was expired. OK, makes some sense.\nI re-ran the process to get a new token and everything was fine for a day or so, then it failed again saying the token was expired. Then it happened again. And again.\nFrustrated, I reached out to the friend who works at Valve and was put in contact with a programmer there. He watched the back-end and said everything was fine for the first few auths and then the old expired token as submitted. Rebuilding the token worked for a while and then the old token was submitted again.\nWe began to suspect the token file on my machine was being overwritten but I couldn\u2019t see it happening and didn\u2019t know how it was happening. It not like the whole directory was being restored from a backup, it was just that one file sitting in an obscure Steam folder.\nWe tried everything and never solved the problem.\nThe solution I finally arrive at \u2013 and has worked fine for the past three months \u2013 was to get an auth token and then save that file away. Just before my script uploads to Steam it copies that good file over the current one and uploads. This is what Steam recommends for full CI builds, but until Jan 1, I never had to do this locally.\nI\u2019m still mystified who is overwriting that file but I guess it\u2019s moot now.\nGoing on n+1 years, I proclaim grumpygamer.com to be 100% April Fools\u2019 Day joke free.\nI realized that I lost a large chunk of the early April Fools\u2019 posts due to moving content from one back-end to another over time. It pains me as I\u2019m sure they are seen as culturally significant and worth preserving for future generations.\n\u201cGrandpa! Tell us the story of when the web used be be April Fools\u2019 joke free!\u201d\nI might have to go track them down on the Wayback Machine and pretend it all never happened and I have perfect back-up and archiving practices.\nFirst screen shot from my new game called Death by Scrolling.\nI started working on this game back in 2019. It started out great and everybody I showed it to loved it, but it was simple. Everyone asked for progression and \u201cgame\u201d stuff and over the next six months I proceeded to ruin it.\nThen a little game called Return to Monkeys island came along and I took the next two years to build that with Dave Grossman and a wonderful team.\nMonkey Island ended and I started working on a new game I dubbed \u201cRPGTBD\u201d. It was a classic Zelda-like pixel art RPG and was a lot of fun. I brought on an artist (Craig) and a designer (Elissa) to help.\nWhen I first started RPGTBD everyone told me that it\u2019s unrealistic to do a open world RPG with a small team. Morons. What do they know?\nWell, a lot actually.\nIt became obvious that my vision for the game was never going to get done and on top of that I was spending a lot of money so something had to give. I could pay off the contracts for Craig and Elissa and call it a day.\nBut I had all this wonderful art and a nice quest and exploration system from RPGTBD it felt odd to let them go to waste.\nThen I remembered Death By Scrolling. I shared the prototype with Elissa and she really liked it. There is something about the game that I could never let go of.\nI rebuilt the whole project, stripping out all the stupid stuff and returned it to the core of the game back when it was fun.\nOver the next 3 months Elissa and I added back pieces bit-by-bit with a nice progression system, story, quests and challenges.\nIt\u2019s not going to be everybody\u2019s cup of tea, but Elissa and I get lost in playing it when we should be testing a new feature, so I guess that\u2019s good.\nELissa and Craig leave the project on March 1 then it\u2019s just me for a few months and then release it in 2025.\nThis time for sure.\nI recently asked on Mastodon how a player would expect damage to be computed in an RPG.\n(base_damage + extra_damage) * damage_buff\nor\n(base_damage * damage_buff) + extra_damage\nGeneral consensus is there was no consensus.\nThe one thing people did agree on was that the skill/weapon description should say what the order of operation is.\nFair enough.\nI am worried about the amount of information that needs to be conveyed to players. The game needs to work well on the Switch and the Steam Deck with limited screen size. I play a lot of games where the 20-something devs with perfect eyesight spent too much time looking at the game on a large monitor. I\u2019ve purposely kept the text large enough to read on a small screen. It means I need to be succinct.\nSome people suggested that players should be able to order the weapons/skills as they wanted. This is problematic since weapons/skills come in a very random order and a UI to reorder them seems like a lot of work and not really what the game is about.\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter what order the weapons/skills are evaluated. I compute damage_buff then compute damage_extra when the weapon/skill is acquired. Later on those are used to compute damage and that is where the order matters.\nIt\u2019s also basically an action game and players shouldn\u2019t get too deep into stat management for a character that is going to last a few minutes.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong about that.\nI think I will opt for the 1st method since it allows for bigger numbers and that is something players do want."

      "text": "A Monkey Island sequel from creator Ron Gilbert is coming this year\n'Return to Monkey Island' is the first new entry in the series since 2009.\nOne of the best video game series of all time is making a return in 2022 with some of its key original creatives on board. Return to Monkey Island is \"a game by Ron Gilbert,\" who conceived the point-and-click comedy-adventure saga in the late '80s.\nGilbert wrote and directed the original game, The Secret of Monkey Island. He was director, programmer and designer on the sequel, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. He left Lucasfilm Games soon after the latter was released, but he was credited on 2009's Tales of Monkey Island. Gilbert is now back at work on arguably the series he's best known for as a co-designer and co-writer alongside fellow Monkey Island veteran Dave Grossman.\nReturn to Monkey Island is in development at Gilbert's Terrible Toybox. The studio's working alongside Devolver Digital and Lucasfilm Games on the latest entry. According to the description on a teaser video Devolver posted, it's a \"long-awaited follow-up\" to the first two games.\nThe clip also notes that Michael Land, Peter McConnell and Clint Bajakian \u2014 all of whom have previously worked on the series \u2014 are handling the music, while Dominic Armato is reprising his role as Guybrush Threepwood. So, it'll certainly sound like a proper Monkey Island game.\nGilbert tried for years to get back the rights to Monkey Island (and Maniac Mansion) from the Disney-owned Lucasfilm Games to no avail. Still, it's great to see him and so many other Monkey Island veterans returning to the series.\nThis just shot to the top of the list of my most-anticipated games in 2022. Sorry about all the game of the year awards you just lost, Elden Ring."

      "text": "Video Games Weekly: Silksong and Gamescom\nThe gaming news you need, August 12-20.\nWelcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday (or Wednesday, whatever), broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy \u2014 and I'll see you next week.\nOn a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they\u2019ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile.\nFor six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025.\nSkong. Skong. Skong.\nIt\u2019s a special time in the Silksong subreddit. After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a \u201cspecial announcement\u201d about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it\u2019s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It\u2019s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It\u2019s a place that\u2019s consistently made me laugh every time it\u2019s appeared in my feed over the past year or so.\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible.\nAnd then it\u2019ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday\u2019s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good.\nUpdate August 21, 11:30AM ET: It happened. Hollow Knight: Silksong is due out on September 4.\nThe news\nNews from ONL 2025\nGamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith is on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, to play upcoming titles and talk to developers, but for now, here are our headlines straight out of ONL 2025:\nAnd our headlines from Gamescom 2025 so far:\nGamescom 2025 runs through August 24.\nROG Xbox Ally lands in October\nMicrosoft is slowly establishing its handheld era with news that the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available on October 16. There\u2019s still no official word on how much they\u2019ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64, Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It\u2019s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it\u2019s yet another sign that Microsoft\u2019s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer.\nThe PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today\nFirst Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it\u2019s Sony\u2019s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family:\nStandard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500\nPS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450\nPS5 Pro: $750, up from $700\nSony blames the increases on a \u201cchallenging economic environment,\u201d echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we\u2019re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating.\nRod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes\nThere have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we\u2019re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second \u2014 he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012.\nThe race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues.\nBlizzard\u2019s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing\nMicrosoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft, voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft\u2019s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision, ZeniMax and Raven Software.\nSteam censorship is breaking PayPal\nPayPal isn\u2019t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards\u201d of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io. Now, it\u2019s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination \u201cother than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\u201d\nValve says it\u2019s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform. That game, VILE: Exhumed, is now available as shareware.\nRoblox is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits\nRoblox is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following a wave of lawsuits accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks \"violative scenes\" on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months.\nAnalogue delayed its N64 remake again\nIt\u2019s now due out in Q4 2025. :(\nAdditional reading\nMore action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play by Robert Purchese at Eurogamer"

      "text": "Hollow Knight: Silksong will be out on September 4\nPlease oh please let there not be any more delays\u2026\nHollow Knight: Silksong has a release date of September 4. You heard right, people. This is not a drill. One more time for those in the back, Hollow Knight: Silksong is now scheduled to be available in just a few weeks. The news dropped as part of a \"special announcement\" YouTube stream, and it'll be playable at Gamescom. For those of you at the event in Cologne, the game will be availabe at both Nintendo and Xbox's booths. Expect very, very long lines.\nThe original Hollow Knight game was a huge debut hit for indie studio Team Cherry in 2017, and the popularity of the moody metroidvania has created quite the fervor around the DLC-turned-full-sequel. The project was delayed in 2023 and fans have been hoping for a Silksong launch announcement at just about every major gaming event since.\nThe development process has taken a long enough time for Silksong's existence to become a bit of a gaming meme. There were trustworthy-sounding claims from a Nintendo Direct in April that the title would launch this year, which gave fresh hope (and fresh patience) to the punishing platformer's players. Even with a launch date now provided, though, there's always the chance for it to be postponed again. So let's keep the mood at \"cautiously optimistic.\" Just in case."

      "text": "'Abzu': a scuba diving game that's part Zen, part 'Journey'\nAbz\u00fb, the debut game from game development house Giant Squid, may as well have the subtitle Journey 2 or maybe even Flower 3. Studio founder Matt Nava, the former thatgamecompany art director of those aforementioned art house gaming touchstones, is making yet another emotionally bald, deeply pretty game about communing with nature through fluid controls here. In playing Abz\u00fb, though, any cynicism born out of its similarity to Nava's past work floats away like so much foam on a wave.\nThis undersea adventure is immediately familiar, clearly of a piece with Journey's nomadic wandering and Flower's breezy environmentalism. Even in just a brief demo session, though, Abz\u00fb is equally transcendent. Of all the games from E3 2015 I got to play at early events, Abz\u00fb is the one I didn't want to stop playing. Even in a pre-alpha state, Giant Squid's game makes you feel like you're somewhere else.\nRather than Journey's desert or Flower's verdant pastures, Abz\u00fb drops you into the middle of the ocean as a young woman sporting a black-and-yellow wetsuit as well as some miraculous scuba gear. During a brief introduction at a pre-E3 event, Nava explained that he and his team want your time as a submariner to be totally uninterrupted by onscreen displays or a pressing need to fill up on oxygen. Abz\u00fb's heroine can stay underwater indefinitely, peering into submerged caves and kelp fields as she moves forward. Rather than break the illusion of exploring the ocean floor, the unreality of your scuba gear is freeing, letting you come to terms with the diver's initially tricky, but ultimately silky swimming controls.\nWhat Abz\u00fb lacks in terms of technological realism, it makes up for with ichthyology accuracy. The elegant icy caverns and sun-dappled reefs you swim through are heavily populated, with what Nava describes as \"tens of thousands\" of fish. Not only are they modeled to look like their real-world selves, but also they behave like actual fish, flowing in tight schools. The effect of swimming smoothly into an open, shallow area after sneaking through a cave only to find it teeming with fish ranging from teensy to enormous is mesmerizing. The fish can also lead you farther into the sea you're exploring.\nHolding the PlayStation 4 controller's trigger -- the pre-alpha build on hand was running on Sony's machines -- the diver automatically schools with whatever creature's closest. In a large horde of silvery fish, she'll merge into the center and follow along as they loop and pirouette in the current. When I caught up with a sea turtle lackadaisically tooling around a giant rock, the schooling button made the diver do a little flip before she lightly clung to the amphibian's shell. While I didn't catch up to any in the demo, Nava told me that I could even meet up with whale pods later on.\nThe effect of swimming smoothly into an open, shallow area after sneaking through a cave only to find it teeming with fish ranging from teensy to enormous is mesmerizing.\nSchooling with the fish is an odd gaming reward. More often than not, video games reward action with more action. Shoot a red drum; it explodes. Complete a row of Tetris blocks; the blocks disappear and a bright noise sounds. In Abz\u00fb, merging with a school following its movements is a passive act, but deeply affecting. You give yourself over to the simulation of nature and seeing your almost abstract, minimally detailed diver merge with the hyper-detailed fish elicits a catharsis startlingly similar to actually exploring the natural world. Like all moving art, it exaggerates and imitates the real world to evoke something fundamental. Sitting in the basement of a hotel surrounded by humming computers, I couldn't help but get swept away by Abz\u00fb.\nIt's not all reenacting the final scene of Tom Hanks blissfully swimming off with Daryl Hannah in Splash in Giant Squid's game; there is a steady sweep forward. Unfolding in a similarly linear fashion to Journey, the demo did indeed have goals, even if they were simplistic. In exploring the caves, I ran into passages blocked by sand or frigid water that I couldn't get past. While a solution to the cold wasn't on hand in this version, there was an answer to the sand. Periodically you'll find small, yellow submersible drones that can be reactivated.\nAs long as you have at least one with you -- Nava said that there's currently no limit on how many you can have with you, but there will be a cap in the final version -- it will vacuum up any sand blocking passages into new areas. Being tiny, the drones can be easy to miss, and they're vulnerable to the ocean's less friendly elements. A nosy great white shark destroyed one of my companions after I cleared the way into the final area of the demo. (I asked if you'd even have a chance to make friends with the shark later in the game. Nava, answering me very specifically, did confirm that the shark will be \"less of a dick\" later on.)\nAfter the shark messed up my drone, the demo took control of the diver as well. She swam out and out into the open sea as the camera pulled back revealing an even wider swath of creatures than I'd seen to that point. Manta rays, whales, giant schools of luminescent fish in a panoply of colors. While Abz\u00fb won't be released until 2016, its fundamentals are already well in place. Nava has made yet another game about peaceful exploration and observation that conjures up intense emotion. Whether it feels as complete as Journey and Flower will depend entirely on how it comes together over the next year. With this demo, though, his studio has produced something that made me all too reluctant to get out of the water."

      "text": "Absolum is awesome and I can't wait to play it on October 9\nGive it a chance, even if you're not a fan of beat-'em-ups.\nAbsolum, the fantasy beat-'em-up from the team behind Streets of Rage 4, will arrive on October 9, Dotemu shared today. Ahead of the announcement, the publisher hosted a new preview of the game, giving the gaming press a chance to check out a new playable character and zone (more on those in a moment).\nI didn't get a chance to play Absolum when it was first announced back in March, so going into this latest demo I didn't know what to expect. Now, after playing Absolum through most of the weekend, I can't wait for the final version in October. In fact, I think it might end up being a surprise game of the year contender for a lot of people. I've never been a fan of beat-'em-ups; most haven't had enough depth to keep me interested. Absolum solves that issue by smartly borrowing from modern roguelikes, with Supergiant's Hades standing as an obvious influence.\nEach run in Absolum starts with you selecting a \"Ritual\" for your character. Like Boons in Hades, these modify your character's abilities with special properties. For example, one Ritual I encountered in my second playthrough caused throwable rose daggers to spawn whenever I timed a dodge perfectly. In turn, these allowed me to quickly dispatch dangerous enemies at a distance. The further into a run you get, the more likely you are to encounter additional Rituals. And, once again borrowing from Hades and its idea of Duo Boons, some Rituals are designed to synergize with one another. Combined with the game's Arcana system, which allows you to select up to two special attacks for your character, there's great combat variety in Absolum.\nIn fact, it never feels like you're simply button mashing. Combat is very Souls-like in that there are many different enemies for the player to take on, and each one requires its own approach. What's more, dodging attacks is often more important than dishing out damage. Healing items in Absolum are few and far between, but to balance this, the game gives you a few different ways to avoid getting hurt. You can either side step away from an attack, dash directly into an enemy to block them or use your character's Skill attack to perform what the game calls a \"Clash.\" If timed correctly, all three options allow you to punish an enemy for trying to get the jump on you. Of the three, however, Clashes \u2014 acting as Absolum's version of a parry \u2014 are the hardest to pull off, but can turn a boss fight in your favor, allowing you to deflect an attack that would have otherwise been devastating.\nWith this preview, Dotemu let everyone try the game's full roster of four characters. Over the five hours I played the demo, I had the most fun with Galandra, a necromantic warrior with a sword on her back that would be big enough even for Guts. Each character feels distinct from their counterparts. Brome, for instance, who wasn't in the recent Steam Next Fest demo Dotemu released, is the game's only mage-like character. His playstyle centers around zoning your enemies with beams of power. Oh, and did I mention that he's a frog? Meanwhile, the new zone, Jaroba, did a great job of mixing things up just as I was getting used to ebb and flow of Absolum's combat. Enemies here employ much more devious attacks that are harder to dodge and counter.\nIf rougelike fans didn't have Hades 2 to look forward to this year, I think Absolum would easily be in the running for one of the best indie releases of 2025. As it stands, the game has tough competition, but if you're a fan of challenging and mechanically complex but fun combat systems, I think you owe it to yourself to check out Absolum come October when it arrives on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PS5."

      "text": "ROG Xbox Ally handheld gaming devices are real and will be released during the 2025 holiday season\nThe portable PCs will run on Windows 11 and offer access to Steam, GOG and Ubisoft Connect.\nWe've been hearing rumors for what feels like an eternity about Microsoft working with ASUS' ROG division on a gaming handheld device, and we got confirmation during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest. There are two variants of the handheld: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X.\nMicrosoft hasn't reveal pricing for the devices as yet. It stands to reason that they'll be in the same ballpark as the currently ROG Ally systems, which cost up to $800 for the ROG Ally X. Details on how much the systems cost, pre-orders, accessories and more are coming soon, the company said.\nThe exact release date is not yet known but the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are coming this holiday season. The handhelds will initially be available in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and, shockingly enough, the US.\nXbox head Sarah Bond says that every game included in the showcase will be playable on the Xbox Ally, but didn't make clear whether all of those would run natively on the devices. The reveal trailer also included a notable focus on Hollow Knight: Silksong, for what it's worth (and it was reaffirmed that the game is still set to come out this year).\nCritically, Microsoft and ROG aren't locking the devices to only playing Xbox games (though you can play those natively, via the cloud or by accessing an Xbox console remotely). You'll be able to play games from Battle.net and \"other leading PC storefronts\" too \u2014 those include Steam, GOG and Ubisoft Connect. Obviously, there's Game Pass integration here, as well as support for the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which enables you to play games with synced progress across a swathe of devices after buying them once.\nMicrosoft says it has teamed up with Roblox to make that game natively playable on a gaming handheld for the first time. It's working with third-party developers on a Steam Deck-style program to make it clear which games have been optimized for handhelds, including the Xbox Ally systems. Expect more details on that down the line. In addition, it seems that those who snap up an Xbox Ally or Ally X and haven't yet tried out Game Pass will get a free trial.\nMicrosoft has designed a full-screen Xbox user interface for the handhelds. There's a dedicated physical Xbox button that can bring up a Game Bar overlay, which seemingly makes it easy to switch between apps and games, tweak settings, start chatting with friends and more. Accessibility features from Xbox consoles and PCs will be available too, along with the Gaming Copilot.\nNaturally, the systems run on Windows 11. Microsoft says it has optimized the operating system for the devices, with easy access to device and input controls via ASUS' Armoury Crate. The company added that \"the lock screen and task switcher have also been adjusted for easy navigation with a controller.\" You'll be able to mod games on either system as well.\nThe Xbox Ally is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, and has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X is the more powerful model. It has a AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. They each have a microSD card reader, so you won't need to worry about shelling out for proprietary storage to have extra space for your games.\nThe two models seem to have the same screen, a seven-inch 1080p, 16:9 display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of brightness. The anti-reflection displays will feature Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and support FreeSync Premium.\nBoth systems boast \"HD haptics.\" The Xbox Ally has hall effect analog triggers, while the Xbox Ally X has \"impulse triggers for enhanced control.\" It sounds a little like Microsoft and ASUS are taking a page out of the PlayStation DualSense playbook there. Anyway, both of the Xbox Ally systems have two assignable back buttons and 6-axis IMU \u2014 a fancy way of saying that they'll probably have gyro controls. Blessedly, both of the handhelds have a 3.5mm combo audio jack, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4.\nThe Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are exactly the same size at 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7mm . They each weigh more than the Nintendo Switch 2 (534g or 1.18lbs with Joy-Con 2 attached) and PlayStation Portal (520g or 1.15 lbs). The Xbox Ally is marginally heavier than the Steam Deck (669g or 1.47lbs) at 670g. The Xbox Ally X is even beefier at 715g (1.58lbs). For the record, the ROG Ally is 608g (1.34 lbs) and the Ally X is 678 grams (1.5 lbs).\nSo, they're both chonksters, but at least those grips look more ergonomic than those on the Nintendo Switch 2 (which is already cramping my hands) or even the Steam Deck. Microsoft says the design principles of Xbox Wireless Controller was adopted for the Xbox Ally handgrips.\nBoth systems will be capable of outputting video to a TV or monitor, as they have two USB-C ports with support for DisplayPort 2.1 and Power Delivery 3.0. One of the Xbox Ally X's USB-C ports is compatible with ThunderBolt 4. It also has a larger battery, with a capacity of 80Wh compared with the Xbox Ally's 60Wh battery. Both models come with a charging stand.\nMicrosoft has spent the last few years expanding the Xbox ecosystem beyond consoles and PC through efforts like Xbox Cloud Gaming. Its first official move into gaming handhelds is a big step as it tries to play catch up to PlayStation and Nintendo."

Now, the team is paying that forward by helping to fund a bunch of other indie games under its new label Outersloth (perfect name, zero notes).\nAmong the projects that Outersloth has backed so far are Mars First Logistics (a Mars rover building sim that went into early access last year), card battler RPG Battle Suit Aces, exploration game Mossfield Archives, single-button boss rush title One Btn Bosses and space dog fighting roguelike Rogue Eclipse. Strange Scaffold (An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs) and Visai Games (the fantastic Venba) are getting a hand from Outersloth too.\nOutersloth is also funding the next project from Outerloop Games, the team behind the acclaimed Thirsty Suitors. It's in the very early stages of development and it's called Project Dosa. It will see you exploring the world in an upgradable mech, cooking for a community, fending off bad guys and much more.\nIt's very cool to see Outersloth giving indie developers another way to finance their games beyond the traditional publisher approach, relying on crowdfunding or going into early access. Meanwhile, Summer Game Fest Live included the first peek at the Among Us animated TV show.\nCatch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest 2024 right here!"

      "text": "Sword of the Sea is what happens when Matt Nava strides back into Journey's shadow\nAfter oceans and forests, Nava is ready to make an orange game again.\nSword of the Sea is a game about letting go. Its main mechanic involves surfing across vast desert dunes on a thin blade, slicing through glittering sands and scaling ancient towers on a quest to unearth the secrets of civilizations past. It plays best when you forget about the controls entirely, and just surrender to the slick physics and let your little character flow. With enough exploration, you\u2019ll naturally discover glowing orbs and shining gold gems, and the sands will transform into deep, crystal clear seas with fish swimming through the air, carving wet paths through the dirt. Your character, dressed in flowing robes and a gold mask, rides the orange hills and the blue waves with the same easy athleticism, reacting instantly to every input on the controller.\nCharge up a jump and then complete sick tricks with a few quick inputs, or unleash a bubble of sonic energy to smash nearby vases, uncovering bits of currency in the shattered pieces. The protagonist moves in whatever direction you push, stopping immediately when you let go of the analog stick. There are giant chains to grind, a hover ability in some areas, and half pipes generously positioned around the environments. Control prompts pop up when you\u2019re first introduced to an ability, but the text fades quickly and you\u2019re left alone in the desert. There are no waypoints in Sword of the Sea, but the environment tells a clear story, inviting you to solve puzzles in the mysterious temples dotting the landscape. Find glowing orbs on the rooftops and hidden down secret passageways to unlock the buildings\u2019 secrets, opening up new areas.\nI played about 20 minutes of Sword of the Sea at Summer Game Fest, but I wanted to surf its dunes for a lot longer. It\u2019s the kind of game that makes the real world fade away, no matter how chaotic or intrusive your immediate surroundings are. It\u2019s built on rhythm and vibes, and it encourages a meditative flow state from its first frames. Learn the controls and then forget them; play with pure intuition and it\u2019ll most likely be the right move.\n\u201cThe game is about surfing, and it's really about the process of learning to surf and getting comfortable with surfing, and then trying things that are a little bit beyond your abilities, failing, and then figuring it out and actually accomplishing them,\u201d Sword of the Sea creator Matt Nava told Engadget on the SGF show floor. \u201cAnd in the process, you kind of realize that surfing is all about harnessing the power of something greater than yourself. You\u2019re not paddling \u2014 the waves carry you. The zoomed out camera, the little character; in a lot of games, they're right on the character, because the character is the focus. But in this game, it's about how the character is a part of the environment, that is the focus. And I think that's a constant in a lot of the games that we've made.\u201d\nNava is the creative director and co-founder of Giant Squid, the studio behind Abz\u00fb and The Pathless. Even with these two successful games under his belt, Nava is still best known as the art director of Journey, thatgamecompany\u2019s pivotal multiplayer experience that hit PlayStation 3 in 2012. Nava has spent the past decade attempting to build explicitly non-Journey-like games with Giant Squid, and while Abz\u00fb and The Pathless both have his distinctive visual stamp, they\u2019re the opposite of Journey in many ways. Where Journey was set in a dry, desert landscape, Nava\u2019s follow-up, Abz\u00fb, took place in an underwater world. After that, The Pathless was mostly green, rather than dusty orange.\nWith Sword of the Sea, Nava let go. He dropped all preconceptions of what he should be making and mentally said fuck it. He finally allowed himself to manifest the game that came naturally to him.\n\u201cIn this game, it's very much taking on, accepting and proclaiming that this is me,\u201d Nava said. \u201cI did Journey. I'm doing orange again. And I'm going back to the desert because I have way more ideas that we couldn't do in that game \u2026 It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been living in my own shadow for a long time in a weird way. It's like, why am I doing that? I should just be who I am and continue to explore the art that is my art.\u201d\nSword of the Sea is a specific and special game, and even though it\u2019s set in an orange desert, it doesn't feel like Journey. The game also includes music by Austin Wintory, the Grammy-nominated composer behind Journey, Abz\u00fb and The Pathless. Together, Nava and Wintory form a formidable foundation.\n\u201cA lot of video game scores, they just make a music track for the area,\u201d Nava said. \u201cIf you're in the town, you hear town music, and then it just repeats. But that's not how it works here. The music advances as your story advances, it reflects where you are on your surfing adventure, what you're learning how, how far your character has gone on this character arc. And so that's where the music of a video game like ours should be.\u201d\nAs Nava and I chatted, someone sat down to play Sword of the Sea on a nearby screen, and when I glanced up, I saw that they were gliding through an area I didn't find in my runthrough. A giant animal skeleton was half-buried in the sand, bright white vertebrae dotted with gold gems for the player to collect. There are a lot of secrets in Sword of the Sea, Nava assured me. The best way to find them is to just let go and play.\nSword of the Sea is due to hit PlayStation 5, Steam and the Epic Games Store on August 19."

      "text": "'Friday the 13th: The Game' will get one last update before its servers shut down\nYou'll still be able to play the game after that point, however.\nAfter a three year run, the latest chapter in the Jason Voorhees story is coming to something of an end (via IGN). Publisher Gun Media says it will release one final update for Friday the 13th: The Game before shutting the multiplayer slasher fest\u2019s dedicated servers down. The good news is you\u2019ll still be able to play online through peer-to-peer and private matchmaking, and you won\u2019t lose any progression you\u2019ve made due to the server shutdown.\nGun Media promised to share more details on the update one week before it lands in November. In the meantime, it said it will fix \u201ca long list of player issues.\u201d Those who need to get technical support will be able to do so through JasonKillsBugs.com and the game will continue to be sold. However, outside of important announcements, you won\u2019t see much activity from the title\u2019s official social media channels, and while you\u2019ll still be able to visit the official community forums, you won\u2019t be able to post on them.\nIn a way, it\u2019s surprising Friday the 13th: The Game got as much support as it did. After a lawsuit over who owns the rights to the franchise\u2019s characters derailed Gun Media\u2019s DLC plans, it seemed like the game\u2019s days were numbered, but the company went on to port the title to Nintendo Switch. Meanwhile, developer Illfonic went on to find success with Predator: Hunting Grounds, and avoided the copyright issues that plagued its earlier effort."

      "text": "The spellbinding Ball x Pit will hit PC and consoles on October 15\nA Switch 2 version will arrive later this year, but this game might have already ruined your life by then.\nBack in June, publisher Devolver Digital decided to switch up its usual Summer Game Fest showcase format and dedicate it to a single game, Ball x Pit by indie developer Kenny Sun and a few collaborators. The demo sunk its claws into me, and I've been looking forward to the full game ever since. During Nintendo's Indie World stream on Thursday, it emerged that Ball x Pit is coming to Switch, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on October 15. A Switch 2 version will arrive later this year.\nBall x Pit is a bit like if Breakout, Vampire Survivors and Space Invaders were blended together with a pinch of base building thrown in for good measure. Your character will (manually or automatically, it's up to you) fire destructive balls at waves of enemies that approach from the top of the screen, trying to destroy them before they reach the bottom and cause more damage. You'll collect more types of balls and augmentations throughout each run and upgrade both.\nThe action really kicks up a notch when you're able to fuse two balls and combine their effects. A fusion might grant you a ghost ball that passes through enemies but sticks a lightning rod into each one it makes contact with, dealing recurring damage to both that particular bad guy and others nearby. There are more than 60 different balls to play around with and combining a pair frees up a slot for another one, so you can end up with truly wild builds. You'll also unlock more characters with unique skills that you'll want to experiment with too.\nAlong with the brick-breaking action, there's a base-building element to Ball x Pit. You can help expand the settlement of New Ballbylon (chef's kiss on that name) with dozens of different buildings that can help you unlock more power-ups, characters and so on. The two sides of the game feed into each other and make for a very sticky, satisfying loop.\nAccording to Devolver, Ball x Pit had the 12th most-played demo during the most recent Steam Next Fest. More than 270,000 people have tried it out on Steam (demo progress carries over to the full game). Ball x Pit is easily one of my most anticipated games for the rest of the year. My only dilemma now is to figure out which platform to play it on."

Gamescom 2025 officially kicked off on Tuesday, August 19 at 2PM ET with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by the folks behind The Game Awards and Summer Game Fest, and you can watch it alongside the Engadget crew right here. The stream promises to feature the worldwide reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, plus fresh details on Ghost of Yotei, The Outer Worlds 2, Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f and Ninja Gaiden 4, and a live performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.\nA few of those reveals have already happened. We now know that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be out on November 14, and you can see its trailer here. We also have a few previews of games including Denshattack!, which we're expecting in early 2026, and Absolum, which is out in a few short months.\nThere's also a good chance \u2014 seriously, for real, no joke \u2014 that ONL 2025 will include a release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong. I already feel like a clown for typing that sentence, but I stand by it, considering the evidence: Silksong will be playable on the Gamescom show floor and, as far as we know, it's coming out this year. Editor's note: Team Cherry has announced a special announcement on Thursday, which will probably be the Silksong release date... right?\n... OK, that's less convincing than I thought it'd be. Regardless, Engadget contributing reporter Kris Holt and myself (senior editor Jess Conditt) will be here with a liveblog of Opening Night Live. Join us, watch along and feel free to mock us relentlessly if the whole Silksong thing doesn't pan out. We're used to it.\nWhile you wait, check out the full Gamescom 2025 streaming schedule, which runs from August 19-25.\n- Kris Holt\nLikewise!\nThere's lots more to come from Gamescom, including two day-long Xbox streams, an indie showcase and that special announcement for a little game called Hollow Knight: Silksong on Thursday. You can check out our Gamescom guide for more details.\n- Jessica Conditt\nThank you to everyone for joining us! I had fun hanging out with you, Kris. And we'll see you all for the next big video game stream, likely The Game Awards on December 11. Peace!\n- Jessica Conditt\nWhew, that was more packed than I expected! I thought it was a lovely little summer showcase, especially if we include all those cool games in the pre-show reel.\nAdvertisementAdvertisement - Kris Holt\nThat's our show! What did you make of it, Jess?\nONL typically isn't as splashy as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards, but I thought it was pretty solid overall.\n- Kris Holt\nAnd hey, that's one more action RPG. I think that puts the tally at seven, but I'll admit I lost count. There's a reason I do words for a living.\n- Jessica Conditt\nHowever, there is a massive tiger, which is pretty neat in its own right. Black Myth: Zhong Kui is coming.\nAdvertisementAdvertisement - Jessica Conditt\nOur one more thing comes from the Black Myth: Wukong folks! No skating or stories here, sadly.\n- Jessica Conditt\nFor what it's worth, I just said, \"oh shit\" at the end of that Resident Evil: Requiem trailer. Delicious!\n- Jessica Conditt\nYou're doing great, Kris.\n- Kris Holt\n*squeaks in mild terror* Evil!\nAdvertisementAdvertisement - Jessica Conditt\nWhen I say Resident, you say Evil!\nResident!\nResident!\n...That doesn't really work in a one-way communication format, does it?\n- Kris Holt\nI don't really need to see more Ghost of Y\u014dtei, if I'm honest. I was sold on that game as soon as it was announced. But! The Legends co-op mode coming next year is definitely good news.\n- AdvertisementAdvertisement\n- Jessica Conditt\nGhost of Y\u014dtei will be gorgeous, guaranteed. I haven't been disappointed by a trailer yet.\n- Jessica Conditt\nProject Spectrum has my attention.\n- Jessica Conditt\nWe've moved on to a PvPvE FPS from the team behind Delta Force, and I gotta say, this trailer looks rad.\n- Kris Holt\nHere's hoping!!"

      "text": "Baby Steps finally has a release date, two years after it was originally slated to arrive\nYou can pick up the absurdist walking simulator on September 8.\nBaby Steps, a absurdist walking simulator, has been under construction for a long while now. But at today's PlayStation State of Play event, the game finally got a release date: September 8, 2025. The game stars the hapless, chubby, bodysuit-wearing Nate (sigh), who, judging from the release date trailer, appears to be perpetually in search of a toilet? At one point, he knocks a porta-potty off the edge of a cliff. Tragedy abounds.\nWe checked out Baby Steps a few years ago, and a big part of the fun is in figuring out how to control Nate \u2014 each controller trigger moves one of his limbs, and keeping him upright is apparently quite the challenge. That's part of the fun, I presume; watching your baby-man flop around the screen and fall over while doing the seemingly simple task of walking sounds a lot more amusing than I think.\nThe game was originally supposed to come out for PS5 and PC in 2023, followed by a delay to 2024 that the team obviously didn't hit. But now, we've got a real release date for this exceedingly goofy-looking game."
