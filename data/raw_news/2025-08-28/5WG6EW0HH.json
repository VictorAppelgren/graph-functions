  "description": "McLaren has announced that Mastercard will become the official naming partner of the F1 team from 2026 in a lucrative deal reportedly worth around $100 million per season.",
  "content": "McLaren has announced that Mastercard will become the official naming partner of the Formula 1 team starting from the 2026 season.\n\nThe American banking giant already has an existing partnership with McLaren after it was named a primary partner of the team ahead of last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix.\n\nNow the new title partnership will see the team rebranded as the \u201cMcLaren Mastercard Formula 1 Team\u201d next year in a lucrative deal reportedly valued at around $100 million per season - the biggest in McLaren\u2019s history - and is due to run until the mid-2030s.\n\nThe new agreement also means that McLaren will feature a title sponsor for the first time in over a decade, as it last had one back in 2013 with Vodafone - a partnership that began in 2007.\n\nPrior to that, the Woking squad had tobacco brands West (1997-2005) and Marlboro (from 1974-1996) as title sponsors.\n\nThe new title partnership deal couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for the financial services giant Mastercard as McLaren is currently in formidable form and is on course to secure its second constructors\u2019 title in a row this season, having won it last year for the first time since 1998.\n\nMcLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris also find themselves in an intense title battle which could see either of them claiming their maiden drivers\u2019 title and the team\u2019s first since 2008.\n\nWhat the McLaren-Mastercard Deal Means for F1 Fans\n\nThe extended collaboration promises to unlock opportunities for fans to enjoy exclusive, behind-the-scenes access and unique experiences. Mastercard has introduced a fan-focused initiative called \u2018Team Priceless\u2019 designed to bring fans closer to the team through a curated program of activities - including hot laps on the track and meet-and-greet sessions with drivers.\n\nMcLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown promised to continue putting the papaya fans first and bringing them closer to the team through the new partnership with Mastercard.\n\n\u201cThere is no one more important to us than our awesome fans, so I could not be more delighted to enter this next chapter in our partnership with Mastercard with a promise to our Papaya Family around the world: that we will continue to put our fans first, bring them even closer to the team, and offer incredible experiences,\" said Brown.\n\n\u201cMastercard is a fantastic partner who shares our passion and values, so to have them on board as naming partner will offer us the perfect launch pad to keep pushing on and off track - and I cannot wait to see Team Priceless come to life in 2026.\u201d\n\nMastercard hosted a live fan event in Amsterdam on Wednesday, August 27, ahead of this weekend\u2019s Dutch Grand Prix to celebrate the new partnership. The event featured appearances by McLaren duo Norris and Piastri along with live music performances.\n\nRaja Rajamannar, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer for Mastercard, commented, \u201cOur partnership has been grounded in putting fans in pole position since day one, and becoming the Official Naming Partner of the McLaren Formula 1 Team takes that commitment to the next level.\n\n\"McLaren Racing represents the pinnacle of innovation, precision, and performance, values that mirror our own as we push boundaries and deliver winning experiences. Collaborations like Team Priceless reflect those values and give fans plenty to look forward to for this season and many more.\u201d\n\nMcLaren is on the brink of winning the constructors\u2019 title in Azerbaijan in three rounds\u2019 time, now leading the pack with 559 points - 299 ahead of Ferrari and 323 past Mercedes.",

      "text": "A year has passed since former Brazilian Formula 1 driver Felipe Massa filed a lawsuit in London against the FIA, Formula One Management (FOM), and Bernie Ecclestone over his 2008 title loss.\nMassa finished as the championship runner-up to Lewis Hamilton that year after the Brit overtook Timo Glock in the final corner of the final lap of the season finale in Brazil, winning the first of his seven world titles by just one point over Massa.\nIn March 2024, over a decade later, the Brazilian decided to take legal action against the F1 bosses in light of recent developments. He is seeking declarations that the FIA \u201cviolated its regulations\u201d by overlooking the \u2018crashgate\u2019 incident that occurred earlier in the 2008 season in Singapore, which he claims cost him his sole world title.\nHe is also seeking compensation for lost prize money and other potential bonuses that could have come his way had he emerged victorious.\nThe first hearings for this case are set to take place between October 28-31 of this year at the High Court of Justice in London, according to multiple reports.\nFelipe Massa\u2019s F1 Title Case Explained\nMassa\u2019s grievance stems from the scandal-tainted 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, during which he was leading the race until the infamous \u2018Crashgate\u2019 incident happened.\n2008 \u2018Crashgate\u2019 Scandal\nIn round 15 of the season at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed his Renault into the wall at turn 17 on the 14th lap of the race, triggering the safety car that played into his teammate Fernando Alonso\u2019s strategy and positioned the Spaniard for a victory. Hamilton finished the race in third, while Massa fell all the way to 13th, finishing outside the points.\nWhile the Brazilian could have won if not for the crash, one might argue that the way the team handled the situation afterward pretty much ended any chance they had to save their race. During the safety car period, the team performed a botched pit stop that saw Massa leave the pits with the fuel hose still attached to his Ferrari.\nBy the time he was pushed back and had the hose removed, he found himself in last place and subsequently faced a drive-through penalty for an unsafe release. Had the situation been handled better and the pit stop gone smoothly, he likely would have finished in the top three.\nA year after the crash and following his dismissal from the Renault outfit during the 2009 season, Piquet revealed that he had been instructed by team principal Flavio Briatore and executive director of engineering Pat Symonds to deliberately crash his car during the Singapore race to help out Alonso.\nHe said that he was asked if he would be willing to \u201csacrifice his race for the team by causing a safety car\u201d at a specific area on the track where \u201cit did not have any cranes that would allow a damaged car to be swiftly lifted off the track, nor did it have any side entrances to the track.\u201d\nRenault then responded by accusing Nelson and his father of false allegations, claiming that it was a blackmail attempt in order to secure his seat for the remainder of 2009. But following weeks of speculation, Renault faced charges of conspiracy on September 4, 2009.\nWhile Renault pledged to fight the allegations that were set to be heard later that month on September 21, the situation took a turn on September 16 when the outfit said that it would not contest the allegations.\nBriatore and Symonds both resigned, with the team\u2019s chief operating officer, Patrick Pelata, saying, \u201cThe team believes that a mistake has been made, and punishment must follow. Flavio Briatore considered himself to be morally responsible and resigned.\u201d\nFollowing an investigation, Renault was found guilty of race-fixing and was hit with a suspended disqualification from F1. Briatore faced an indefinite ban from all F1 events and any FIA-sanctioned activities, while Symonds received a five-year ban. However, in 2010, a French court overturned both suspensions.\nFelipe Massa\u2019s F1 Title Lawsuit: Why Now?\nIn 2023, Ecclestone, who managed F1 for four decades before being ousted in 2017, revealed in an interview that he and then FIA president Max Mosley were aware of Piquet\u2019s deliberate accident before the conclusion of the 2008 season.\nHe said they did not immediately take action on the matter, as they \u201cdid not want to damage the image of F1,\u201d although the 94-year-old later told Reuters that he doesn\u2019t recall making such comments.\n\u201cWe wanted to protect the sport and save it from a huge scandal,\" Ecclestone told F1-Insider. \u201cThat\u2019s why I used angelic tongues to persuade my former driver Nelson Piquet to keep calm for the time being.\n\u201cBack then, there was a rule that a world championship classification after the FIA awards ceremony at the end of the year was untouchable. So, [Lewis] Hamilton was presented with the trophy and everything was fine.\n\u201cWe had enough information in time to investigate the matter. According to the statutes, we should have cancelled the race in Singapore under these conditions.\u201d\nThis revelation had Massa considering legal options to contest the season\u2019s outcome, more than 15 years after Hamilton was declared world champion in Brazil.\nIn August 2023, Massa\u2019s lawyers sent an eight-page \u2018Letter Before Claim\u2019 to F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, arguing that Massa was a \u201cvictim of a conspiracy.\u201d\nThey contended that he has suffered losses amounting to tens of millions of euros in earnings and bonuses due to being deprived of the 2008 title.\n\u201cSimply put, Mr Massa is the rightful 2008 Driver\u2019s Champion, and F1 and FIA deliberately ignored the misconduct that cheated him out of that title.\n\u201cMr Massa is unable to fully quantify his losses at this stage but estimates that they are likely to exceed tens of millions of Euros.\n\u201cThis amount does not cover the serious moral and reputational losses suffered by Mr Massa.\u201d\nKey Arguments In Felipe Massa\u2019s Case\nMassa\u2019s case revolves around the notion that the FIA could have \u201cpromptly investigated\u201d Piquet\u2019s crash before the end-of-year prize-giving ceremony, as both Ecclestone and Mosley were aware of it.\nAccording to the FIA statutes, once the awards ceremony for a given year concludes, it becomes impossible to overturn the classification from that season.\nHad the Singapore GP race been declared null and void following an investigation, it would have meant that Massa would be crowned champion, as Hamilton would have lost the six points he earned for finishing in third place.\nThis is the only scenario in which Massa could have secured the title. If Alonso had simply been disqualified from the Singapore race but the remaining results had stood, Hamilton would have moved up to second place, ultimately securing the championship over Massa by an additional two points.\nNow Massa is pursuing damages and seeking declarations that the FIA breached its own regulations by the alleged cover-up.\nBrazilian law firm Vieira Rezende Advogados said, \u201cOn March 11, 2024, Felipe Massa filed a lawsuit in the High Court in London, England against Formula One Management Limited (FOM), Bernard Charles Ecclestone and the Federation Internationale de L\u2019Automobile (FIA).\n\u201cMr Massa is seeking declarations that the FIA breached its regulations by failing to promptly investigate Nelson Piquet Junior\u2019s crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, and that had it acted properly, Mr Massa would have won the drivers\u2019 championship that year.\n\u201cMr Massa also seeks damages for the significant financial loss he has suffered due to the FIA\u2019s failure, in which Mr Ecclestone and FOM were also complicit.\n\u201cAs Mr. Ecclestone has admitted, there was 'enough information in time to investigate the matter' in 2008 and 'cancel the race in Singapore'.\n\u201cMr. Ecclestone further affirmed that, had the results of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix been cancelled, 'Felipe Massa would have become world champion' and that Mr. Massa 'was cheated out of the title he deserved'.\n\u201cAttempts to find an amicable resolution have been unsuccessful, leaving Mr Massa with no choice but to initiate legal proceedings.\u201d\nMassa estimates his losses to be around \u00a364 million\u2014equivalent to R$ 435 million or $81 million\u2014for missing out on the 2008 championship.\nThis figure could escalate to \u00a3150 million\u2014R$ 1.085 billion, $190 million\u2014should it be proven that the FIA \u201cmanipulated the result in Singapore,\u201d according to a report.\nHow F1 And FIA May Respond to Massa\u2019s Challenge\nThe defendants are likely to contend that Massa\u2019s claim is legally unsound, as the FIA\u2019s statutes at the time did not allow for revising race results after the season had ended, which means his request could be deemed inadmissible.\nLegal precedent also indicates that sporting results are considered final unless a challenge is brought within a specific timeframe, which Massa did not do, failing to file a protest within the 14-day window following the race.\nFurther, since the lawsuit focuses on proving a conspiracy\u2014not regarding Piquet\u2019s crash itself but rather an alleged cover-up by the FIA and F1\u2014establishing this in court after more than a decade could prove to be very difficult.\nWhile Motorsport has reported that the case could be thrown out before it even begins, Felipe Massa remains determined to pursue his claim, with the first hearings taking place over the last four days in October 2025."

      "text": "Formula 1 resumes action this weekend following its annual summer break, with the penultimate Dutch Grand Prix taking place from August 29 to 31.\nThe title battle between McLaren duo Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris is becoming increasingly intense after the latter managed to score victories over his teammate in three of the last four rounds - the latest being in Hungary right before the summer pause. Now the Briton sits at 275 points in the standings, just nine points shy of Piastri as both chase their maiden drivers\u2019 title and the team\u2019s first since 2008.\nOn the constructors\u2019 front, McLaren is currently on a run of four consecutive 1-2 race finishes, and a fifth 1-2 finish would equal the F1 record shared by Mercedes and Ferrari.\nThe Woking squad are also well on their way to winning their second constructors\u2019 title in a row, now leading the pack with 559 points - 299 ahead of Ferrari and 323 past Mercedes.\nAs the series returns to racing this weekend, Piastri faces the pressure to hold off the momentum of his teammate and defend his lead in the standings, while Norris will be pushing hard to replicate his stunning performance in Zandvoort a year ago and chip away at the gap.\nIn 2024, Norris celebrated his second career victory in the Netherlands, winning by a staggering margin of 22.896 seconds over home hero Max Verstappen of Red Bull.\nAnd while McLaren appears to be the team to beat again this weekend at a circuit that plays to the strengths of the MCL39, Verstappen will be looking to disrupt the Woking squad\u2019s momentum and score a home victory in the penultimate race in Zandvoort, which would see him equal James Clark\u2019s record of four wins at the circuit - but of course it all hinges on whether his RB21 will have the pace needed to challenge the frontrunners.\nLast December, F1 announced that the Dutch Grand Prix will drop off the calendar after its final running in 2026, which will feature a sprint event for the first time.\nF1 Circuit Zandvoort Stats\n- First Grand Prix: 1952\n- Circuit Length: 4.259km (2.646 miles)\n- Race Distance: 306.587km (190.504 miles)\n- Number of Laps: 72\n- Number of Turns: 14\n- Lap Record: 1:11.097 -

      "text": "Fans to be given unparalleled access as McLAREN Racing announces Mastercard as Official Naming Partner of the McLAREN Formula 1 Team from 2026\n\"There is no one more important to us than our awesome fans\"\nMcLaren Racing has today announced that Mastercard is set to become the Official Naming Partner of the McLaren Formula 1 Team from 2026 onwards.\nStarting next season, the team will be known as the McLaren Mastercard Formula 1 Team, with the move representing an exciting new era not only for the partnership, but for fans of the team around the world. This expanded collaboration will unlock more opportunities for fans to enjoy exclusive, behind-the-scenes access and one-of-a-kind experiences.\nDelivering on its fan-first promise, Mastercard is set to debut 'Team Priceless' - a global initiative that will allow papaya fans to get closer to the team and action throughout the race calendar and experience a curated programme of activities. On select race days, chosen fans will enjoy incredible experiences, from hot laps on track to meeting drivers and Priceless Experiences that spotlight the host city\u2019s local culture. More details on Team Priceless and the recruitment process will be announced soon.\nTo launch this new chapter of the partnership, Mastercard is hosting a spectacular live fan event in Amsterdam on the evening of Wednesday, 27 August, ahead of this weekend\u2019s Dutch Grand Prix. The event is bringing fans a mix of appearances from McLaren Formula 1 Team drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri as well as live music performances and more.\nPapaya family\nZak Brown, CEO, McLaren Racing, said:\n\u201cThere is no one more important to us than our awesome fans, so I could not be more delighted to enter this next chapter in our partnership with Mastercard with a promise to our Papaya Family around the world: that we will continue to put our fans first, bring them even closer to the team, and offer incredible experiences. Mastercard is a fantastic partner who shares our passion and values, so to have them on board as naming partner will offer us the perfect launch pad to keep pushing on and off track - and I cannot wait to see Team Priceless come to life in 2026.\u201d\nRaja Rajamannar, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer for Mastercard, said:\n\u201cOur partnership has been grounded in putting fans in pole position since day one, and becoming the Official Naming Partner of the McLaren Formula 1 Team takes that commitment to the next level. McLaren Racing represents the pinnacle of innovation, precision, and performance, values that mirror our own as we push boundaries and deliver winning experiences. Collaborations like Team Priceless reflect those values and give fans plenty to look forward to for this season and many more.\u201d"

      "text": "Mastercard will become the naming partner of McLaren\u2019s Formula One team from 2026, The Athletic can reveal.\nIn an announcement set to be made public imminently, McLaren has struck a deal to expand its existing sponsorship agreement with Mastercard, with the global payments giant becoming its named partner.\nAdvertisement\nThe team\u2019s official name will become \u2018McLaren Mastercard Formula 1 Team\u2019 from next season.\nThe Mastercard deal is estimated to be in the region of $100 million per season, sources with knowledge of the matter disclosed to The Athletic on condition of anonymity. It is a long-term agreement that is understood to run through to the mid-2030s.\nIt is also believed to stand as the biggest title sponsorship agreement on the F1 grid, and is the largest commercial deal in McLaren\u2019s history.\nIt will be the first time since the end of 2013 that McLaren has raced with a title sponsor. Back then, its high-profile agreement with Vodafone ended and was followed by a long period of decline for the team overall.\n\u201cWe wanted it to be the right partner, with the right long-term commitment, with the same values as McLaren, and a brand that we felt could add value off the track,\u201d Brown told reporters at an event in Amsterdam announcing the partnership. \u201cIf you look at Mastercard, what they\u2019ve historically done in other sports, the amount of reach they have, how global they are, it\u2019s a perfect fit for us.\n\u201cFor us, it was all about finding the right partner. We had plenty of opportunities, as you can imagine, over the past nine years, but this is one that was a no-brainer for us.\u201d\nBrown did suggest there would be no significant changes to McLaren\u2019s papaya livery despite the expanded agreement, with many teams often giving over large chunks of their paint scheme to their major partners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect radical change, as far as what our racecar looks like today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re quite happy. We think (the design) is very distinctive, so of course, you\u2019ll see some enhancements and some modifications, especially as the car will look different in how it\u2019s developed (for 2026), as far as the race car itself. But it will be very recognizable next year from what you see this year.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMcLaren announced in July 2024 that Mastercard would be joining as a new primary partner, with the deal being fully launched at the Las Vegas Grand Prix last November.\nThe McLaren cars have raced with Mastercard branding since the Las Vegas race, while this season a large Mastercard logo has also been present on the side of McLaren\u2019s motorhome hospitality unit that houses the team at race weekends during European rounds.\nBut the expansion of the partnership into a title agreement is a big step for McLaren, which was previously the only team left on the F1 grid that did not race with a title sponsorship. This was even after it successfully ended its run of poor results with a resurgence in 2023 and then F1 constructors\u2019 championship in 2024.\nUnder the leadership of Zak Brown, McLaren Racing\u2019s CEO who took charge at the end of 2016, the team has overhauled its commercial portfolio.\nBesides Mastercard, it has significant partnerships with technology giant Google and crypto exchange OKX. A further 50 sponsors are listed on the team\u2019s website, including brands such as Dell, Android, Allwyn and Hilton.\nSpeaking in February, Brown estimated that McLaren had the greatest commercial revenue for any team in F1 history through 2024, when Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri helped secure its first constructors\u2019 championship in 26 years.\nBrown always claimed to be cautious about bringing a title sponsor back to McLaren, as he prioritized protecting the team name and brand from market fluctuations. But when the possibility of Mastercard eventually becoming a title sponsor was put to Brown in Las Vegas last year, he did acknowledge that a name combining the two brands had \u201ca nice ring to it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very long-term partnership,\u201d Brown added in November. \u201cWe\u2019re having all sorts of discussions as to what the partnership looks like today, and what it could potentially become.\u201d\nWhy now for McLaren?\nAs varied as McLaren\u2019s sponsorship portfolio may have been, the absence of a title sponsor made it stand out from the rest of the F1 grid. Other teams have moved to cash in on the sport\u2019s boom in popularity in recent years, bringing with it an array of new brands wanting to adorn cars with their logos.\nAdvertisement\nFerrari announced technology company HP as its new title sponsor in May 2024. Red Bull brought Oracle on board ahead of the 2022 season. Mercedes has a long-term partnership with Petronas, while Aston Martin has Aramco as its title partner. In the case of Racing Bulls, it has two title partners in Visa (a Mastercard rival) and Cash App, its official name being \u2018Visa Cash App Racing Bulls.\u2019\nMcLaren is now making the same choice at a time when its own on-track success and off-track popularity is reaching a new peak.\nThe team is poised to comfortably win its second straight constructors\u2019 title, likely with a handful of races to spare before F1 returns to North America in October. Piastri and Norris are also clear of the rest of the pack in the fight for the drivers\u2019 crown \u2014 Max Verstappen in third is 97 points behind Piastri \u2014 to set up an intra-team title fight through the remainder of the season.\nMcLaren therefore has the chance to clinch a first title double since 1998, when Mika H\u00e4kkinen won the drivers\u2019 championship. It has pulled clear of rivals including Ferrari and Red Bull going into the final season of the current F1 technical regulations.\nSpeaking in November, Brown was eager to emphasize the importance of the McLaren brand regardless of its on-track fortunes, and how that would continue to appeal to sponsors and partners.\n\u201cOne of the things when I got started at McLaren was being able to lean into the power of the McLaren brand coming back,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s very important. Given (Mastercard\u2019s) portfolio in sports (including sponsoring the UEFA Champions League), they will be well aware that you have good years, bad years. But you\u2019re always going to have the McLaren fans. And we\u2019re here to win.\u201d\nRegardless, the profile boost offered by a team at the very top of F1 would have made the prospect of a title partnership increasingly appealing to Mastercard, ensuring its name and logo would accompany much success for at least F1\u2019s short-term future. McLaren\u2019s rise would also have made any potential deal more lucrative for the team, making this an ideal time to strike an agreement.\nAdvertisement\nF1 team naming rights have proven increasingly attractive to companies involved in finance and banking. Revolut will also be a title sponsor in F1 next year with Audi, which is taking over the Sauber team.\nMastercard does have history in F1 prior to its latest foray in the sport with McLaren. The short-lived Mastercard Lola team planned to race in 1997, only to fail to qualify for the season-opening round in Australia. When it then collapsed financially, Mastercard spent four seasons sponsoring the Jordan team, which these days races as Aston.\n(Top image: Clive Rose/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Cadillac has officially announced that Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas will make up its driver lineup for the team\u2019s Formula 1 debut season in 2026.\nEntering as the 11th team on the grid, the American squad has opted for experience over youth, with 527 grand prix starts, 16 grand prix wins and 106 podiums between the two 35-year-olds.\nBoth Bottas and Perez - who signed multi-year contracts with the General Motors-backed outfit - have also claimed second-place finishes in the F1 championship at some points during their careers.\n\u201cSigning two very experienced racers like Bottas and Checo is a bold signal of intent,\u201d said team principal Graeme Lowdon.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve seen it all and they know what it takes to succeed in Formula 1. But more importantly, they understand what it means to help build a team. Their leadership, feedback, race-hardened instincts and of course their speed will be invaluable as we bring this team to life. A big thank you to the team at Mercedes for their co-operation and understanding.\u201d\nSergio Perez hopes to shape Cadillac into \u2018the team of the Americas\u2019\nPerez has had a diverse F1 career, having previously raced for Sauber, McLaren, Force India and Racing Point. In 2021, he made his move to Red Bull Racing where he secured his first victory for the team in Azerbaijan, ending the season in fourth place in the standings. The following year, he secured third place in the championship, winning two races in Monaco and Singapore.\nIn 2023, he added two more wins to his tally in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan, ultimately securing a career-best second-place finish behind teammate Max Verstappen in the championship.\nPerez and Verstappen also helped the team secure their first constructors\u2019 championship since 2013 in 2022 and break Mercedes\u2019 eight-year reign, and they repeated this feat once again in 2023 with a total of 860 points.\nAt the end of 2024 however, Red Bull decided to drop Perez in favor of Liam Lawson - who was later replaced by Yuki Tsunoda - following a disappointing campaign and despite having a year left on his contract.\nBut now, returning to the grid with the TWG Motorsports-owned squad, the 35-year-old is eager to put his past behind him and is determined to fight with the team \u201cat the very front\u201d, believing that both he and Bottas can help shape Cadillac into \u201ca real contender, the team of the Americas.\u201d\n\u201cJoining the Cadillac Formula 1 Team is an incredibly exciting new chapter in my\ncareer,\u201d said Perez. \u201cFrom our first conversations, I could sense the passion and determination behind this project. It\u2019s an honor to be part of a building a team that can develop together so that, in time, we will fight at the very front.\n\u201cCadillac is a legendary name in American motorsport, and to help bring such a fantastic company to Formula 1 is a huge responsibility, one I'm confident of taking on.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be part of such an ambitious and meaningful project from the very beginning. I'm really pleased to be part of such a dynamic line-up, and together I believe we can help shape this team into a real contender, the team of the Americas. We're counting on support from across the continent - and we want to make everyone proud.\u201d\nValtteri Bottas: Cadillac felt like \u201csomething different\u201d\nBottas kicked off his career in F1 with Williams in 2013, later teaming up with Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes in 2017.\nDuring his stint at the Silver Arrows, the Finn secured second place in the drivers\u2019 championship behind Hamilton in 2019 and 2020. He then spent three seasons driving for Sauber after being replaced by George Russell at Mercedes.\nIn 2025, Bottas returned to Mercedes as a reserve driver after Sauber opted not to renew his contract at the end of 2024, filling his spot with Argentinian driver Gabriel Bortoleto.\nNow he is set to make a comeback behind the wheel next year, representing the \u201cAmerican spirit of racing\u201d and bringing a wealth of experience with 246 race starts, 10 wins, 20 pole positions and 67 podiums under his belt.\n\u201cFrom the moment I began speaking with the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, I felt something different \u2013 something ambitious but also grounded,\u201d said Bottas. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a racing project; it\u2019s a long-term vision. It\u2019s not every day that you get a chance to be part of something being built from the ground up and helping shape it into something that truly belongs on the F1 grid.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the honour of working with some of the best teams in the world, and I can already see the same professionalism and hunger here. This is an iconic brand with a big legacy in American motorsport, and to be a part of the story as it enters the world stage of F1 is incredibly special for me.\u201d"
