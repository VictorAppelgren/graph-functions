  "content": "5 Cool Milwaukee Gadgets You Might Not Know Existed\n\nWhen it comes to tools, brand loyalty runs deep. Depending on your needs, you might already have a go-to drill, blower, and saw, and you certainly have at least one of those. You might even have them all in a single brand's name, especially if you use battery-powered tools. If that brand is Milwaukee, you probably think you have a good idea of everything the toolmaker has to offer. After all, there is a lot to consider before deciding to go with Milwaukee's lineup of tools. Still, sometimes brands will drop a surprise you never could have seen coming, often in the form of a weird but handy gadget. Milwaukee Tools has a long history of developing durable, quality tech that gets the job done. It's a popular name on job sites all around the world, found at the side of factotums and full-scale construction crews alike. However, the company makes a fair share of everyday gadgets that the average DIYer and homemaker will appreciate, too, and most of them are quite affordable. Here are five of those cool Milwaukee gadgets you might not know exist.\n\nCraftspeople work in all kinds of weather, so it's no surprise Milwaukee has created a line of heated clothing, including jackets and vests. The M12 Heated Tough Shell Jacket uses Milwaukee's line of M12 interchangeable rechargeable batteries to increase the temperature inside its heated clothing. You can customize the level of heat depending on your comfort and the surrounding conditions, getting up to 12 hours of continuous battery life on lower strength levels. The jacket features three heat zones: the chest, the back, and the pockets. You can set each zone to a specific level of heat (low, medium, or high) or even turn off a zone altogether. The battery pack stays in its own zippered compartment so it doesn't interfere with your movement or take up space. The jacket is wind and water-resistant, which helps it retain heat and is invaluable when in less-than-ideal conditions, from working during a rainstorm to shoveling snowy walkways in the evening so you can get to work the next day. Adjustable waist and arm cuff draw cords further help to seal in the heat. And despite all the embedded electronics, the jacket is machine washable and dryer-safe. The M12 line of heated gear comes in several styles and colors, including the thicker Tough Shell line, lightweight Axis models, and a line of heated hoodies.\n\nA portable radio with Bluetooth connectivity that doubles as a charger is hardly a Milwaukee invention, but if you've already bought into the system, it might make sense to go with the brand's version. The typical Milwaukee users, from DIYers to professionals, spend long enough out in the open that a portable speaker and charger could be considered a necessity. You can sync the radio to your phone to broadcast your favorite playlists, or tune into a local FM station and let the radio host be your company. Unlike most Bluetooth speakers, this one has a self-centering keyhole and hollow handle that lets you hang it from various positions. It's also made to be durable (in case your hanging job fails you) and resists water, dust, and debris. Outside of work, the M12 Radio and Charger gadget makes a sound go-to when you're camping, hanging out on the lake, tailgating, playing on the beach, or just relaxing in the backyard. It keeps the music going, and your phone charged without needing to be tied to a wall outlet. You can get up to 10 hours of continuous runtime using the M12 rechargeable battery system, or use the DC port for uninterrupted fun.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many or how few home projects you do; There's always a need for a level. This basic tool has come a long way over the years, moving from ruler-like devices with leveling bubbles to electronic tools. Milwaukee's Green Cross Line Laser is a great tool for anyone who values precision. Unlike the bubble levels, a laser level projects a perfectly straight line on walls, floors, or ceilings, even if it's over a long distance. Tasks like hanging shelves and pictures, installing cabinets, or laying floor tile are much more accurate. Whether you require that extra accuracy depends on the job, but it's always nice to have the option. Workers in construction swear by them, while for homeowners and casual DIYers a laser level might be that tool you rarely use but are always glad to have when you need it. They're easy to use and line up, especially with Milwaukee's mounting options: The magnets naturally attach themselves onto metal surfaces, but you can use the screw and nail hang holes to bind it to whatever surface you want.\n\nThe more we stay glued to our devices, the more a portable power source makes sense, especially if it gives you hours of charging power for multiple devices at once. Milwaukee's powerbank is one of the brand's most practical \"tools\" you can own, if you can even call it that. Whether you're on a job, traveling, or just getting through a busy day, the Milwaukee USB Power Source will keep your essential devices like phones, tablets, and headphones charged without needing a wall outlet. And while it's great to have when on the go, it's also one of Milwaukee's best tools for power outages. This portable charger uses the Milwaukee RedLithium USB battery pack, which is easy to replace and is used by other Milwaukee tools as well. The device has USB-A and Micro USB connectors, the first for input and the second for output. Other than that, well, it's a cheap way to turn an existing battery into a powerbank, and can do anything other device of this kind can do. Just make sure you wouldn't be better off with a simple powerbank.\n\nEveryone needs a good vacuum, but what happens when you make a mess far away from a power outlet? Milwaukee's M18 Fuel Compact Vacuum is the answer, or at least it's a great choice if you already have a few compatible batteries. It's cordless, running on Milwaukee's M18 batteries, so you can use it anywhere there's something to clean. This means no more dragging out the bulky vacuum or fighting with tangled cords. And since it's compact, it can go where most regular vacuums can't. It could even serve as a compact vacuum cleaner for your car. It might not be one of the most powerful cordless vacuum ever made, but Milwaukee's M18 Fuel Compact Vacuum is still a boon for busy households and workplaces, as it's handy for quick clean-ups. It comes with multiple attachments, too, including a crevice tool, floor head, flexible hose, brush, powered floor tool, and an extension wand. If that sounds like a lot, don't worry. There's also an on-board accessory holder for when you need to switch between tools quickly.",

      "text": "A Closer Look At The History Of Milwaukee Tools\nMilwaukee is one of the most popular tool brands available, and there's a good chance you've come across the name before while browsing Home Depot due to an exclusivity deal. The brand targets a nice mix of affordability and reliability, making it a fine choice to build a collection with.\n2024 represents Milwaukee's 100th anniversary, and a lot of advancements have been made in that century. The manufacturer got its start in Wisconsin, hence the name, but it wasn't always known as Milwaukee. The company was originally known as A.H. Petersen Company \u2014 a joint partnership between Albert F. Siebert and A.H. Petersen. In 1923, a fire destroyed the manufacturing facility, and financial turmoil led to the company closing its doors for good. Siebert bought the company's assets at auction and rebranded it as the Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation. From there, the company went on to develop various power tools such as the electric hammer drill, hole-shooter, and right-angle drill.\nBirth to the '50s\nMilwaukee became a rapidly growing name upon its rebranding. To start, the company was able to stay in business by repairing tools instead of making them, but that's what eventually led to innovation. Employees analyzed the competitors and sought to make tools that would stand out from the rest. A big part of this was increased durability and a customized motor that increased performance while also prolonging the life of tools. The Milwaukee hole-shooter ended up being a big hit in the automotive and metalworking industry.\nThe company was permitted by the U.S. government to make its tools Navy-grade, so the product line had an early edge over its rivals. The onset of World War II also required Milwaukee to up its game. The company's hole shooter was an essential tool used to help create aircraft during the duration of the war. The U.S. Navy became a big fan of the brand and began ordering from Milwaukee.\nMilwaukee in the '50s to the new millenium\nIn 1951, Milwaukee created perhaps its most famous tool \u2014 the Sawzall. Also known as the reciprocating saw, the Sawzall is a staple of Milwaukee's power tool arsenal to this day, and many other companies have since come out with similar versions. Milwaukee eventually expanded production to other parts of the United States, opening a new manufacturing plant in Mississippi in 1974. In the '70s, Milwaukee became the first American power tool company to create a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder. In 1991, Milwaukee unveiled the Super Sawzall, representing a big upgrade over their previous invention 40 years earlier.\nAt the start of the 2000s, Milwaukee was known for a variety of tools, but the company admitted it had lost focus on what made it a popular brand in the first place. In 2005, Milwaukee was acquired by Techtronic Industries Co., and the company went back to its roots. This meant more of a focus on electrical, mechanical, and plumbing trades. A big part of doing this was the introduction of the M12 and M18 cordless lines. Simply put, these allowed the consumer to stay on a platform without worrying about being left behind by future tools. The same 18V battery you buy with a power drill works with another M18 product, so you are rewarded for staying in the ecosystem.\n2010 to now\nModern-day Milwaukee is largely defined by the REDLITHIUM batteries used in the M12 and M18 lines. Milwaukee sought to create the best performance possible for users, and the goal was arguably completed with cordless options that could rival corded counterparts. Making advancements like that would ultimately lead to more stress on the tool, so Milwaukee has been working on ways to alleviate those concerns. This has been addressed with the M18 Force Logic series, which adds productivity to areas that haven't been addressed in years. Examples of this include the M12 Press Tool, which is lightweight, easy to use one-handed, and has an auto-cycle that ensures a full press each time.\nMilwaukee's One-Key system is one of the company's latest innovations. With the world becoming increasingly more digital, it's easier for many people to keep track of things on their phones. The One-Key system lets you keep track of inventory, create custom settings for your tools, and assign tools to specific people if you're lending your collection out. It allows you to ditch the manual pen and paper style and make everything a lot simpler. It's a good tool for work crews, but it can also be beneficial for a simple DIYer just to keep track of things."

      "text": "Every Tool In Milwaukee's M12 Portable Productivity System\nMilwaukee power tools form the basis of productivity for many in the professional trades, and the iconic red and black body stylings have come to dominate DIYers' peg boards and tool boxes as well. Perhaps none are more crucial to great home improvement and maintenance capability than the M12 system. It's built on the same premise as the full-size M18 cordless battery platform but M12 tools are far more compact. The batteries themselves can fit almost completely into the housing on the tool in some instances, and weight loads from these smaller power tools are minimized to a level that might not seem possible. It's important to note that Milwaukee's M12 range covers both the standard brushless model and the enhanced performance Fuel lineup. Milwaukee tools labeled with the Fuel moniker provide more power output and enjoy heat protection and reduced vibration. Both are great tool lines, but the Fuel range offers Milwaukee's best offerings (This is true for the M18 Fuel system and the M12 range).\nWhat's so incredible about the M12 system is the lack of power loss. M12 system power tools perform with the same immense output that users would expect from any other cordless drill, saw, or nailer. The result is a revolutionized productivity system built from the ground up with eight battery options (a 2.0 and 3.0 model, High Output CP 1.5 and 2.5, and XC 3.0, XC 4.0, XC 5.0, and XC 6.0 batteries). These power packs can charge through the standard fast charger from Milwaukee, which pairs an M18 and M12 connection together, or users can purchase the four-port M12 charger instead to support their growing tool collection. From power to tool, this is the complete lineup of Milwaukee M12 offerings.\nDrilling and driving tools\nFirst and foremost, Milwaukee is a major brand for impact drivers and drills, offering some of the finest on the market. This record of excellence continues in the M12 range, launched alongside its big brother (the M18 lineup) in 2008. The compact drilling range is anchored by the M12 Fuel \u00bd-inch Hammer Drill/Driver, one of Milwaukee's newest tools. It's a combi-drill unit measuring just 6 inches in length and weighing 2.6 pounds. A brushless motor system delivers 400 inch-pounds of torque and claims the \"fastest drilling and driving applications under load,\" according to the brand's own testing.\nIn addition to this flagship drilling tool, the M12 lineup in this category is completed by a right angle drill/driver, four other Fuel options (including an installation drill/driver featuring multiple chuck types), and a standard M12 drill/driver. Impact drivers bring a little expansion to the range. 10 driving tools round out the category, ranging from the newest M12 Fuel \u00bc-inch Hex Impact Driver to a Fuel 2-Speed Screwdriver and No-Hub Driver. The impact drivers also include a right angle driver, like the drills. Five of these units are part of the Fuel range, including one Surge option, and five drivers are standard M12 builds. There's also an SDS hammer drill included in the M12 range with integrated dust extraction. This combination tool makes drilling through masonry and concrete a breeze and reduces the impact on your sight and breathing that often accompanies this kind of work.\nImpact wrenches and ratchets\nThere are 23 tools in this category of the M12 catalog. Fuel and One-Key options feature prominently here, and buyers can select from a range of \"stubby,\" extended reach, and right angle ratchets for a plethora of jobs. 19 of the 23 tools are included as part of the Fuel lineup, giving you a wealth of options when brushless motor power is required or preferred.\nFive Fuel extended reach options are available in both \u215c-inch and \u00bc-inch variants, as well as an M12 Fuel Insider Extended Reach Box Ratchet with two anvil adapters (\u00bc-inch and \u215c-inch) and a \u00bc-inch hex adapter. All five are right angle instruments that physically resemble a standard hand ratchet handle. Eight tools offer the friction ring fitting. Two right angle units and six drill/driver-style alternatives. Two of the trigger-action tool are standard M12 units while the rest are part of the Fuel range. Two more of the right angle ratchets are High Speed variants, in \u215c-inch and \u00bc-inch builds.\nSawing tools\nSaws in the M12 range come in a wide array of builds, as well. Among the M12 options, users can choose from one circular saw, two jigsaw models, two Hackzalls, and two multitool units. These seven saws run the gamut of cutting tasks and cover virtually any kind of sawing you might need to accomplish \u2014 a great help to the DIYer looking for a lighter alternative to the classic worm drive Skilsaw!\nThe Hackzalls \u2014 a development from an earlier Milwaukee invention, the Sawzall \u2014 come in a Fuel and standard build. Both offer the brand's potent reciprocating saw functionality in a slimmed down package. They're great for chopping branches outside or reaching into recesses to make cuts that wouldn't otherwise be possible with a more standard cutting tool. The circular saw, on the other hand, provides exactly what you'd expect of a routine cutter. It's built with nearly the same overall layout as the much larger M18 model but operates on the smaller battery platform and weighs far less. The 5 \u215c-inch saw weighs just 5.35 pounds but can handle a workload rivaling that of much heavier full-sized units. For jigsaws, Milwaukee's M12 range features a Fuel and standard build option, each delivering swerving cut capacity in a slimmed down profile. Finally, the multitools round out the offerings here. The plunge cut ability is an underrated functionality and anyone who has used one often wouldn't give it up for anything. These too come in a Fuel and standard model.\nMetalworking tools\nEven though the M12 lineup is focused on delivering great power output in a shrunken down silhouette there are some heavy jobsite applications to be found within its confines. The M12 offerings don't just focus on a sort of small arms approach to carpentry, home repair, or construction. This is perhaps best exemplified in the tools that fit within the metalworks context. The M12 range features two band saws, ideal for slicing through pipe and bar stock for all manner of metal material use from forging to plumbing. The M12 Fuel Compact Band Saw is small enough (and light enough with a battery-included weight of 6.69 pounds) to hold in one hand while shearing through metal stock pieces. In addition to the Fuel option, there's a standard M12 band saw to consider.\nIn other metalwork applications, users can take advantage of a polisher, two band files (\u00bd-inch-by-18-inch and \u215c-inch-by-13-inch models), a variable speed nibbler, and a low speed tire buffer (perhaps a tool that might be a quality add-on for home mechanics, as well). There are also three grinders to consider (all of which bear the Fuel moniker): A cutoff tool, right angle grinder, and straight shank grinder. The M12 line also features a standard rivet tool for joining metal sheeting.\nFraming and woodworking essentials\nIn another specific working arena, the M12 range delivers in framing and woodworking circles, too. Five nailers make their way into the catalog, delivering some great options for framers of all varieties. The Fuel 18 Gauge Compact Brad Nailer is a solid first fix option for construction needs, while the 23 Gauge Pin Nailer can be leveraged for fixing delicate trim work and other finishing touches. The range is completed by a Cable Stapler, \u215c-inch Crown Stapler, and a Palm Nailer.\nWoodworking enthusiasts can also get their needs fulfilled via the M12 pipeline. The catalog includes an electric planer for fine tuning the faces of wood stock to create precision fits and flush surfaces that meet whatever specification you may have in mind. The lineup is also graced with a Fuel Orbital Detail Sander for precision sanding to create silky smooth wood surfaces, even far into tricky corners that might demand a hand sanding or otherwise get overlooked.\nSite gear\nA set of tools that are often overlooked fall into the category of site gear. From specialized clothing options to shop vacs, the M12 range has it all. Both a compact vacuum and wet/dry vacuum (1.6 gallon capacity) feature in the M12 lineup, as well as an Air-Tip Utility Nozzle. The range includes a job site radio and speaker that each feature robust build quality for solid performance in any working conditions. This might be sitting on a shelf in your home workshop or getting carted around from worksite to worksite and being subjected to dust and debris constantly.\nUsers can also get their hands on a grease gun as well as two caulking guns that make application of adhesives and other tubed products far less tiresome. The applicators come in a roughly standard skeleton gun type frame and a \"sausage style\" featuring an aluminum barrel. There are 11 site lighting options to peruse as well, from handheld to tower and moveable arm lighting solutions. This category also features a handheld blower and a mounting fan that can attach to components on the worksite or stand on its own base. Clothing options in the M12 range include 14 heated jackets and vests to protect you from the elements when working outside in the cold.\nPlumbing solutions\nHome maintainers, plumbing enthusiasts, and professionals in the trade also have quite a few resources at their disposal when considering the M12 tool family. There are three drain snakes and a standalone Trapsnake Driver Kit. The range features a 6-inch toilet auger and a 4-inch urinal auger, as well as a drain snake with a 25-foot bulb cable (and an included storage bucket emblazoned with the Milwaukee logo). The plumbing tools also include a pipeline locator kit that, according to Milwaukee, \"provides the most intuitive plumbing locating experience\" when tracing underground sewer lines and following camera sondes.\nThere's also a range of pipework tools to consider. An expander, stick transfer pump (for efficiently draining standing water from a work area), and pipe shears (both for plastic pipe and copper tubing). The plumber's toolkit is completed by a compact inflator and a Force Logic press tool kit with additional jaw attachments.\nElectrical installation\nSome of the M12 range's finest inclusions are electrical installation tools. Specifically, these additions stand out as unique because of the soldering iron inclusion. It's a rarity to find a cordless soldering iron from a major tool brand, and Milwaukee's M12 Soldering Iron delivers appropriate operational temperature within 18 seconds of powering up. The tool is built in a miniscule package that makes soldering in tight spaces \u2014 like within an electronic device's housing or under the hood of a car \u2014 far more accessible and less precarious for the operator. Rather than bringing along wiring and worrying about getting tangled up on the way out of a recess, the cordless iron simplifies the entire process for fast results and reliable solutions.\nThe electrical installation category includes a cable stripper and cable cutter, as well. Power tool variants of these core tool functions make a range of electrical work far less physically demanding and can improve the workflow of a professional installer or crafty home DIYer from the jump.\nLandscaping gear\nHome maintainers can also get the gear they need to take care of the lawn from Milwaukee's M12 lineup. A pruning saw that resembles a kind of miniaturized chain saw can be a valuable addition to a homeowner's tool chest when dealing with overgrown tree branches, and bushes that have taken over parts of the lawn. The M12 range's pruning shears are also a quality option for lawncare and plant maintenance. They deliver a firm and even pressure across the cutting blade for a clean slice that will leave plants with as little damage as possible.\nThere's also a Fuel 8-inch hedge trimmer offered in the range that brings great maintenance versatility to bear. Finally, the 1-Gallon Handheld Sprayer Kit can make fertilizing a lawn or laying down pesticide easy. It's a pumpless system that provides up to 80 PSI and can reach a distance of 17 feet in a vertical spray. A quick adjusting pressure nozzle dials in the desired spray pressure, ranging in three modes between 20 PSI and a max of 80. When paired with a CP 2.0 battery pack, the sprayer can deliver 80 gallons of liquid solution on a single charge.\nDiagnostic equipment\nDiagnosing issues in systems and tight recesses is another task that the M12 range can accomplish. With four diagnostic camera tools offered and a temperature gun, the Milwaukee lineup is well prepared to help you identify system troubles and look for intelligent solutions.\nPerhaps the most impressive of the range is the M12 M-Spector Flex Inspection Camera. It features a 3-foot cable with a pivoting head that can roam around a problem site to provide a full view of trouble spots. The M12 family also includes an inspection camera with a 9-foot cable as well as a traditional, 3-foot diagnostic inspection camera and an Auto Technician Borescope with a 5mm cable width for impossibly tight gap penetration. The infrared temperature gun rounds out the diagnostic tools and can be a great help for a diverse set of workshop or household repair needs (identifying window leaks, inspecting forge temperature, or diagnosing engine compartment issues).\nLaser levels\nFour laser levels complete the M12 tree. They range in sophistication from single plane leveling to fully functional three-plan lasers. Middle ground options feature a crossline and plumb point laser, and a four-point and crossline laser. Any of these tools would instantly revolutionize your home renovation capacity and immensely enhance productivity. A laser level is one of the necessities on a jobsite, and when it makes its way into the workflow of a DIYer looking to improve upon their own precision workmanship it transforms the landscape of a task.\nAll four laser levels make for a great addition that will repeatedly make for much more fluid work and an improved end product. The three-plane laser absolutely takes the cake, though. It features over 15 hours of continuous runtime when powered by a 4.0 XC battery in the M12 system. The high-intensity lasers offer visibility of up to 250 feet, as well, for remarkable scope when laying out widespread features like fencing. Indoors, the laser level's three planes make for excellent accuracy when addressing a wall's squareness or a feature's plumbness (contributing to alignment of a new wall or angular correctness in a corner space). The laser also comes with rare earth magnets in the base to offer a magnetic hold when placed on studs or other metal surfaces."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Consider Before Buying Milwaukee Tools\nMilwaukee is one of the top names when it comes to power tool brands. The company is immensely popular with tradespeople like mechanics, electricians, and plumbers, and some of Milwaukee's top-rated tools in 2024 include things like leaf blowers, chainsaws, and power grinders. Milwaukee supplies everything from tools for new homeowners to high-quality tool sets for casual DIYers, and the company even sells apparel to keep you safe and comfortable on the jobsite. Milwaukee products aren't typically the cheapest on the market, but they're also not the most expensive, and you can find various Milwaukee tools under $100.\nIf you're in the market for some new tools and are considering Milwaukee, you probably already know a thing or two about tools and how to use them. Even if that's the case, you may not be 100% familiar with the Milwaukee brand. It's important to research a company's history, products, warranty information, and more before investing in it. Doing so can help you avoid making unnecessary purchases and ensure that you get the tools needed without any extra hassles. Don't worry, though \u2014 you don't need to go scour the internet yourself. We'll break down everything you need to know about Milwaukee products, so you can save your hard-earned money and get the right tools for all your projects.\nMilwaukee offers various different levels of gear\nOne of the first and most important things to consider before buying Milwaukee tools is what tool line you want to buy into. If all you're planning to do is buy some new hand tools, you can basically disregard this information. However, if you're in the market for power tools, you'll need to familiarize yourself with Milwaukee's primary tool lines: M12, M18, and, to a lesser extent, MX FUEL.\nThe good thing about Milwaukee's power tool lines is that the names are relatively self-explanatory. M12 refers to the company's cordless 12-volt power tools, while M18 is the name of Milwaukee's cordless 18-volt power tool roster. MX FUEL, on the other hand, refers to specific brushless versions of both 12-volt and 18-volt tools. For example, an 18-volt drill in the MX FUEL line is referred to as an M18 FUEL drill, while a regular 18-volt drill is simply called an M18 drill. It gets a bit more confusing, though, as there are brushless M18 and M12 tools that are not members of the FUEL line. You'll need to pay close attention to these labels when shopping for Milwaukee tools to ensure that you get the device you want and need.\nThe M12 line is Milwaukee's entry-level collection. The 12-volt batteries are less powerful than their 18-volt siblings, but they also weigh less and are easier to maneuver. Brushless motors tend to be more efficient, powerful, and longer-lasting than brushed motors, but they're also usually more expensive. If you're a professional tradesperson or a hardcore DIYer, you'll probably want to get as close to the top-of-the-line as possible. Casual homeowners and hobbyists, on the other hand, may be better off saving their money and opting for a 12-volt product.\nMilwaukee tools are made both domestically and abroad\nAnother factor worth considering before buying Milwaukee tools is where they're built. Though the company was founded in the United States, it is now owned by the Hong Kong-based manufacturing company, Techtronic Industries. That means that Milwaukee is now an international business that sells its products across the globe. It also means that Milwaukee's manufacturing centers are much more spread out than they were in the company's earliest years.\nThese days, Milwaukee builds its tools all over the world. While it's still possible to get your hands on U.S.-made Milwaukee devices, the company maintains manufacturing plants across the globe, including in the United States, China, Germany, Vietnam, and Mexico. If you're someone who exclusively buys products made in the U.S., not every Milwaukee tool is for you. Today, only a handful of Milwaukee devices are built in the States, including products like Sawzall blades, hole saws, step drill bits, and some hand tools. Many of the company's most popular products, like its power tool lines, are manufactured elsewhere.\nThat said, and contrary to popular belief, the country of origin plays little-to-no role in a product's quality. The materials used and manufacturing process play a much larger role in tool quality, and those factors don't really have much to do with borders. In reality, many of today's most popular tool brands are built overseas.\nMilwaukee offers a warranty on most of its devices\nWhen shopping for any product \u2014 not just tools \u2014 it's vital that you check the warranty information. Failing to understand the type of warranty that comes with your products, if it comes with one at all, can have expensive consequences. Even when buying items from the most reputable store, there's always a chance of buying a dud or something with some kind of flaw. A warranty can protect you from those issues by providing you with a window during which the company will replace or repair your product free of charge if you encounter any defects.\nMilwaukee provides a warranty on all of its tools \u2014 provided that you buy the product from an authorized retailer, that is. However, different Milwaukee tools come with different types of warranties. Depending on the product, your Milwaukee device may come with a limited warranty that lasts for anywhere from one to three years, a lifetime guarantee, a limited lifetime warranty, or various other forms of temporary and permanent coverage. It's critical that you check this information when buying a Milwaukee tool. Because warranties differ from device to device, the only way to truly understand the warranty for your product is to read the information yourself.\nFortunately, Milwaukee makes warranty info easy to find. Not only is the warranty information included in the product description for most Milwaukee items, but you can also visit the Milwaukee warranty page for a more detailed breakdown of the various warranty types offered by the company.\nYou can buy Milwaukee tools at various places\nWhen it comes to buying Milwaukee tools, you have quite a few options. You cannot buy products directly from the Milwaukee website. However, you can find links to all of the available authorized retailers for every tool on the site by clicking the \"where to buy\" button on the product page. The menu will display a list of stores, both web-based and brick-and-mortar, that sell the item. Some of the more well-known retailers include Home Depot, Grainger, and Acme Tools, but you can also find Milwaukee products at stores like Summit Racing, Platt, Factory Authorized Outlet, and various others. When you click the button to view these options, you'll also be able to see local stores that carry Milwaukee tools in your area. Note that, even though each of the stores that appears on the list is an authorized Milwaukee retailer, the prices may vary. So, you should check a few places to find the best price before making your purchase.\nBut what about unauthorized dealers, and can you buy Milwaukee tools from places that aren't included on the site? You technically can buy Milwaukee tools from various other stores and sellers, including places like Amazon and even garage sales or pawn shops. However, doing so comes with a few risks. Buying from these places means you may not be able to take advantage of a warranty. Furthermore, not all sellers are honest, and when you purchase from a non-authorized retailer, there's no way to ensure that you'll receive a genuine Milwaukee product. Shopping on Amazon or looking for used tools can be a good way to save money, but you should do your research and think twice before buying Milwaukee power tools on Amazon or from another unauthorized seller.\nWhat customers have to say about Milwaukee tools\nWhen shopping for tools, it's important to consider what other owners and customers have to say about the products' quality and features. Milwaukee tools are consistently cited as some of the best on the market today, and the company's fans range from professional tradespeople like mechanics, plumbers, and electricians to casual DIYers, homeowners, and hobbyists.\nOf course, Milwaukee has its detractors, too. But even then, it's often more about brand loyalty than product quality, meaning some people dislike Milwaukee simply because they prefer other companies like Ryobi or DeWalt. Overall, Milwaukee tools are routinely well-rated, and it's highly uncommon to encounter a Milwaukee device with fewer than 4 out of 5 stars based on customer reviews. Comment and review sections for these tools tend to be full of praise, and customers frequently reference the power, wealth of features, and high quality when describing their purchases and explaining why they're happy with their Milwaukee products.\nRemember that using tools can be a subjective experience. It's important that you consider all of the factors covered here and do your own research to determine whether Milwaukee is the right brand for you. There are a lot of power tool brands out there, and comparing various devices and companies can go a long way toward protecting your wallet and helping ensure that you get the tool you need without any extra hassle."
