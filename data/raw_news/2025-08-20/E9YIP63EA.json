  "description": "Minutes Show Several Fed Members Flagged Inflation Risk",
  "content": "Mike, I want to bring you in. Just on the latest that we heard from Stuart and from the Federal Reserve with regards to these minutes. The Treasury two year yield pairs declined after the FOMC minutes came out. The majority saw inflation risk outweighing employment risk. Several members flagged the risk of inflation expectations on anchoring. Several said current rate may not be far above neutral and several expected companies would pass tariffs to consumers. What is your instant reaction to these minutes? Well, it was very interesting because what we had seen is a fairly strong employment report for June, in July, and then we got the CPI and pie numbers that were more worrisome in terms of inflation going up. And the Fed met at the end of July. So they were already looking under the hood and seeing some issues with inflation growing. And that sort of mitigates, as Stuart said, against perhaps a cut in September if we get the same kind of numbers again. The question is, what are we going to get? Are we going to see more inflation? And if that's the case, the minutes offer support for the idea that the majority on the Fed isn't going to move if we get a weak employment report unless it's very weak. Mike, when you look at some of these heads and just I know we still have to kind of parse through where tariffs come up in the minutes. Many noted the full effect of tariffs could take some time. What's your understanding right now of just what that length of time means? What do most Fed economists think about just kind of how long it takes for us to really see the pass through effects of tariffs? In general. They were looking for about six months, say the end of the third quarter, the beginning of the fourth quarter this year. But it's been complicated by the fact that the Trump administration has been on and off about the tariffs. First, they put them on and they pause them, then they bring them back. And now some more have gone on and there are more to come. So this could stretch out over a period of time. And the other thing is a lot of companies brought in imports from overseas early to try to build their inventories so they could sell things to people without raising prices. Those inventories are getting run down and prices are going to have to start going up. We've seen in earnings reports some companies, Home Depot yesterday saying they were going to have to start raising prices. So we should start seeing it as the months go on. But the question is, does it happen all at once or does it happen over months and months and months and take away people's belief that inflation is anchored? We saw Friday, the University of Michigan numbers suggest that people are getting a little worried about inflation. All of this going to be top of mind for policymakers and officials gathering in Jackson for the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium officially kicks off tomorrow, as I mentioned. So, too, I think will be among the things people talk about is what's happening with allegations that the president is leveling and others in the administration are leveling against members of the Federal Reserve this time. Bill Pulte added again, it's a most read story on the Bloomberg. It's about the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency urging AG Pam Bondi to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over a pair of mortgages. President Trump posted our Bloomberg News story to social media and said Cook, quote, must resign. Now, Mike, is this all about remaking the Fed? Partly about remaking the Fed and partly about the efforts the Trump administration has had to weaponize the government against Democrats. The thing about the Fed aspect of it is Lisa Cook is not a decisive policymaker. She's not a swing vote. She'll generally vote with a majority, generally vote with the chair in terms of leaving interest rates unchanged in recent months. Removing her wouldn't make a big difference in the president's goal of driving down interest rates, but it would give him the opportunity to name another person to the Fed and they could name somebody who is much more sympathetic to low interest rates, and that's going to have people's backs up. A lot of economists already reacting negatively to this news. But we don't know what the bottom line is in terms of what Lisa Cook may or may not have done and the Fed doesn't know. And so at this point, I wouldn't expect Cook or the Fed to comment on it. And we're going to have to see where the attorney general takes this, if she takes it at all. Mike, you're not a politics reporter, but you were for many years. So I think it's fair to ask about this pattern of alleged wrongdoing that seems to be coming from the Trump administration pursuing mortgage fraud allegations against other high profile Democrats. California Senator Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James. There's also the alleged impropriety that you've covered a lot at the Fed with Powell in regard to the remodel. How do you look at that? Well, I think a lot of it is basically just an attempt to influence public opinion. You throw the charges out there and the public remembers that because they get big headlines. And then if somebody is cleared or if the attorney general and the Justice Department don't even take up the case, you don't hear much about that. And the idea is to build some skepticism in about these various people so that when they take on the Trump administration or they do something the administration doesn't like, like voting to keep interest rates steady, the president can blame them instead of himself or his own policies. We want to get to Jackson Hole, because I can at least say I'm very envious of the background that you're sitting in front of right now. It looks beautiful. Can you talk about the tone, the mood? What are I guess how much of the discussions at this meeting are actually going to be about Fed independence and who the next chair is? There's been so much talk, at least headlines about Trump weighing in on who is pick is going to be who's going to be the next pick. Is that really going to take up a lot of the conversations or is it going to be more an economic symposium? Well, I suspect it'll be a dinner party conversation. It's not parties, but dinner conversations and maybe on the sidelines. But the official subject here is labour markets in transition, which is a very timely topic, given the fact that the labor market seems to be in transition, at least with the July jobs report. The only thing is these are academic papers looking forward into the future and they don't have a lot of bearing on what is going to be happening in terms of policy in the near term. So I think it's going to be a bifurcated session where people are talking on the sidelines about what's going to happen next at the Fed. But the main program is going to be about what could happen down the road six months, a year or so from now. Talk a little bit more about labor, this topic here, because it was interesting in the minutes and although these are back dated that the Fed officials seem to be more concerned about inflation and they're saying that outweighs concerns over the labor market. But what's the, I guess, tone going to be on that Powell speech on Friday about the labor market? Well, I would imagine that he's going to say we need more information. The Fed looks at the unemployment rate as sort of a proxy for U.S. growth. And in this case, the unemployment rate really hasn't moved. We saw weak hiring, but not a lot of firing. And so the Fed is probably going to be looking to see what happens with the August payrolls report and if anything bleeds over into the unemployment rate. That's maybe the point that Powell would make in a perhaps less direct way. The papers that are going to be presented here and the talk that we're going to have here is going to be more about things like what's I going to do the workforce to the workforce in the future and what's happening with the retirement of the baby boomers and the inability we've seen so far of recent college graduates to get jobs. So it's more about the structure of the labor market than about what's happening because of tariffs or fiscal policy. Yeah, you add immigration to that mix. Something we've spoken quite a bit about Mike this week when it comes to how that changes and potentially changes the Labor picture moving forward. Hey, before we let you go, one more on the next potential Fed chair. David's service over at Jeffries, formerly of the Fed, that's where he began his career. Then he went to Wall Street. He was on CNBC earlier today. He said the Fed has never been independent. The political pressures on the Fed have always been growing and continue to grow. He highlighted pressure from Democratic lawmakers in recent years on monetary policymakers to lower interest rates. Is the Fed independent? The Fed is independent, at least in terms of the way it acts. Republicans are pulling out old or trying to make coincidences into causation. The fact that the Fed lowered interest rates in the past was not because they were trying to necessarily help a politician, but because the economy called for it. Remember last summer we saw the unemployment rate rise significantly and that's just before the Fed cut rates 50 basis points, which is why they did that. That was the reason they cited it. It makes sense. It wasn't an attempt to help Joe Biden, but because the two things happened at once. People like David Zervos are trying to make the case that the Fed is biased, but the Fed is is not biased. They're biased only towards what the economy is telling them to do. You can argue about whether it's the right move to raise or lower interest rates at this point for what will happen down the road. But it's not a political decision.",

  "argos_summary": "The conversation discusses how recent Fed minutes signal that inflation concerns outweigh employment risks, suggesting limited rate cuts unless employment weakens sharply. It highlights the delayed pass\u2011through of tariffs, the potential impact on consumer prices, and the political pressure on the Fed, including Trump\u2011era allegations against Governor Lisa Cook. The speakers anticipate that the Jackson Hole symposium will focus mainly on labor market transitions and structural issues rather than immediate policy moves, while noting that the Fed remains largely independent despite political rhetoric. Overall, the dialogue underscores the complex interplay between monetary policy, inflation expectations, tariff effects, and political dynamics.",
