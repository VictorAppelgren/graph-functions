      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade to world‑class quality: restructure the piece as a tight 3–6 month scenario map with a clear causal chain from macro/policy to consumer and private‑market flows, anchoring every claim to a listed source ID (e.g., Big Beautiful Bill and Medicaid reform as in EPJYXB7DX; RNC/trump‑era dynamics as in EPJYXB7DX; Walmart private‑label dynamics and BetterGoods/Great Value as in YQOMV2HAJ; private‑market bets in Pacaso/Mogul/Range as in UPV3X2MQ6; AI/healthcare and FDA/Medicare signals in ILYC1M41F; auto/retail price dynamics in V8TEZOR8R). Specify timing windows (0–2 weeks; 1–3 months; 3–6 months); for each catalyst list triggers, plausible invalidations, and conditional paths (e.g., Medicaid work requirements enacted vs blocked; FMAP/ACA expansion status; HeartSciences FDA filing progress and Medicare reimbursement cadence; Pacaso/Mogul expansion milestones; Range AI engine rollout and 0% AUM fees). Quantify with explicit ranges drawn from sources (e.g., debt impact: roughly a $3.4–4.0 trillion tilt from the “Big Beautiful Bill” and CBO/CRFB estimates; ECG market ~$32B by 2034 with Medicare reimbursement starting 2025; Pacaso US co‑ownership growth ~21% YoY; mogul cash‑on‑cash ~10–12% with ~18.8% equity upside; private tires at 50k‑mile warranty but mixed durability; 40% of Americans seeking a vacation home; Walmart private‑label price discipline via Great Value/BetterGoods); present base case with two explicit alts and their probabilistic weight; finish with watch‑list signals (Medicaid eligibility, FMAP rules, private‑market funding, FDA/CDC milestones, private‑label pricing shifts) and a concise confidence rating. Reconcile conflicts by stating where sources diverge (e.g., debt/debt‑service trajectory vs growth offset from AI productivity and private‑market liquidity) and present a single integrated mechanism: policy debt dynamics drive rate/yield sensitivity; AI/productivity and private assets provide possible disinflationary/alpha channels when liquidity remains supportive (cite EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R). Ensure every factual claim is tied to an ID, prune generic statements, and tighten the prose to a single, coherent causal narrative that ends with: base case, 1–2 alts, risks, watch signals, and a stacked confidence verdict.",
