  "description": "The robotaxi space is getting more competitive with Waymo, Tesla and Uber making major investments. But Lyft seems to be going another route.",
  "content": "\u2022 Lyft is taking things to a new level by developing one of the largest passenger autonomous vehicles on American roads.\n\u2022 The upcoming Lyft shuttle could change the way many Americans choose to travel and commute.\n\nThe next frontier in the history of automobiles is the age of AVs (autonomous vehicles).\n\nCompanies like Tesla have ushered in the age of semi-autonomous driving. Today, many major automakers offer some sort of advanced cruise control feature that allows drives to accelerate, brake and steer with little input.\n\nAVs are vehicles that can perform all operational functions of the driving experience without any input from a human driver. They use cameras, navigation systems and advanced sensors to drive with the flow of traffic, steer and self-park.\n\nUber recently announced a partnership with Lucid Motors and Nuro, an autonomous vehicle company, to develop an autonomous taxi service. While rideshare rival Lyft is going in another direction entirely.\n\nThe robotaxi space is getting more competitive with Waymo, Tesla and Uber making major investments into the space. Lyft, on the other hand, seems to be going another route with autonomous vehicle technology. The company is partnering with BENTELER Mobility (a transportation-as-a-service platform) to develop autonomous shuttles.\n\nLyft and BENTELR Mobility's shuttles will be large autonomous vehicles capable of transporting multiple passengers to specific locations. These AVs will be larger than current robotaxi models in Waymo and Tesla's fleet. And will also be larger than the Lucid Gravity SUV, which seats up to seven adults, used for the upcoming Uber autonomous taxi service.\n\nThe company plans to deploy autonomous shuttles on its platform in the U.S. in late 2026, according to a blog post from Lyft announcing this new development.\n\nWhat Lyft's autonomous vehicle means for the future of transportation\n\nWhen the Lyft autonomous shuttle is officially deployed, it will be the largest autonomous vehicle (for passengers) on American roads. Lyft's new service will be the first of its kind, building off of established robotaxi services like Waymo and the emerging Tesla Robotaxi service. Between companies like Lyft, Waymo, Tesla and Uber, millions of dollars are being invested in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology is changing the way passengers approach transportation. Lyft's new AV could be a new form of mass transportation that's more tailored to users than typical public transit.\n\nThe rideshare company may not beat Waymo, Tesla and Uber to the punch with autonomous SUVs, but it can dominate a new niche with large shuttles capable of transporting more passengers than any production SUV.\n\nSafety is a \"top priority\" to Lyft and it's holding its AV partners to the same standards, according to the company's announcement. It will test the AVs with the help of local communities and policymakers. Autonomous vehicle technology has evolved greatly over recent years, but it isn't infallible.\n\nWaymo and Tesla Robotaxi have both experienced hiccups on the path to autonomy that have disturbed many potential passengers. While both autonomous vehicle systems can operate safely, they lack situational reasoning that can avoid some mishaps.\n\nThe AV space is still in its early stages, and like EVs, the technology could evolve greatly over time. Lyft's autonomous shuttle is slated to launch in late 2026.",

      "text": "NHTSA investigating why Tesla self-driving vehicle crashes were reported late\nOnce again, Tesla is in hot water over its self-driving technology.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is opening an investigation into Tesla, alleging the company has delayed and withheld crash reports regarding its self-driving vehicles.\nIn the investigation, opened on Aug. 20, the vehicle safety watchdogs allege that Tesla crashes were reported by the company weeks or months after they happened, which is a violation of internal policy. Usually, crash reports related to self-driving vehicles should be submitted within five days of the accident.\nTesla, however, submitted reports months after the crashes took place.\nAccording to the preliminary NHTSA report, Tesla has said that the reports came late because of \"an issue with Tesla\u2019s data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed.\"\nAs the investigation proceeds, NHTSA said it seeks to determine if the data collection claim is accurate. If it's true, NHTSA said they hope to prove that the system has been fixed so reports come in a timely fashion.\nThe specific Tesla vehicles NHTSA is looking into include the Model 3, Model X, Model S and Model Y.\nDan O'Dowd, the founder of the technology safety group The Dawn Project, called Tesla's failure to report accidents \"appalling.\"\nO'Dowd is a vocal online critic of Tesla's autonomous driving software and claims the technology is not safe.\n\"Tesla goes to great lengths to conceal the truth about crashes involving Full Self-Driving and Autopilot because it knows its self-driving software is dangerous,\" O'Dowd wrote in a statement.\nTesla has often battled NHTSA regarding investigations related to its self-driving technology.\nIn October, the agency opened a probe involving 2.5 million Teslas, seeking to determine if the company's technology can adequately perform in low-visibility conditions, like fog and rain.\nTesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has also faced scrutiny and criticism from federal agencies over its deployment of robo-taxis in Austin. In June, videos of the self-driving cars speeding, driving illegally and in the wrong lanes went viral on social media, prompting an informal inquiry from the traffic safety agency."

      "text": "Uber in talks to raise capital for major robotaxi expansion\nUber UBER.N is in talks with private equity firms and banks to secure funds to build its robotaxi business, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, as the ride-hailing giant bets on a mass roll-out of the nascent and much-scrutinized technology.\nUber, which offers robotaxis from Alphabet GOOGL.O-owned Waymo, has been strengthening its foothold in the self-driving taxi industry through partnerships with automakers such as Volkswagen VOWG.DE and Lucid LCID.O, just as Tesla TSLA.O seeks to expand its fledgling robotaxi business.\nKhosrowshahi on Wednesday pitched the tie-ups as part of a larger plan that involves three robotaxi business models: paying partners that own such vehicles a fixed rate, sharing revenue with fleet operators and owning vehicles while licensing software for self-driving technology.\n\"We are talking to private equity players, we have talked to banks,\" the CEO said. \"Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around.\"\nFor now, Uber said it was planning on using a \"modest\" portion of its around $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund deployments. It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.\nAnalysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.\nThe company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.\nIt also struck a $300 million partnership in July that will allow it to deploy more than 20,000 autonomous taxis, made by EV startup Lucid and powered by self-driving tech from Nuro, over six years.\nDespite strong regulatory scrutiny, doubts about wider adoption, and high costs forcing many firms to shut down, Tesla and Waymo have been pushing to expand robotaxi services, a business Elon Musk has said could be worth trillions of dollars.\nWaymo is present in five U.S. cities, including San Francisco, while Tesla launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin in June and started ride-hailing operations in the Bay Area last month.\nUber said it has not yet seen any changes in demand trends in Austin or San Francisco since Tesla's services were launched in the cities.\n\"To a lot of these companies, it does seem this will be a worthwhile endeavor ... as there are lofty predictions about the robotaxi industry's total addressable market,\" said Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.\nReporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni, Shinjini Ganguli and Lincoln Feast."

      "text": "Tesla Robotaxis are already speeding, swerving lanes following late June launch, videos show\nTesla launched its Robotaxi service less than two weeks ago on June 22.\n- Tesla premiered its Robotaxi self-driving taxi service in Austin, Texas.\n- While many social media influencers and journalists have praised the tech, there are some clear issues depicted in videos.\n- Self-driving vehicles will disrupt American taxi business and could cause unforeseen damages.\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is having a roller coaster of a year. The clean energy and electric vehicle company's share price plummeted by over 41% from January to April. It has since rebounded by over 42% from its yearly low of $221.86 a share to $315.65 a share as of July 2.\nOne of the company's latest innovations is the Robotaxi, a fully autonomous Tesla electric vehicle that's able to transport passengers without any interactions or guidance from a driver. The Robotaxi is already under investigation by the United States for breaking the rules of the road, according to The Guardian.\nTesla Robotaxis are already breaking rules after June launch\nTesla has been able to accomplish amazing feats in terms of production, sales, and technological innovations over the years. That said, its CEO Elon Musk has developed a habit of making grandiose claims regarding the true capabilities of products and services. One example is the company's full-self driving software.\nThe software was involved in at least one fatal crash, as reported by Bloomberg in June. Robotaxis are a much newer product than Tesla's full-self driving system. Since they operate without drivers, it's much easier to assign blame to the technology rather than the driver in instances of accidents or infractions.\nSo far, Robotaxis have been seen violating traffic laws by crossing yellow lines and exceeding posted speed limits, according to a June 23 video description from Yahoo Finance. This is especially worrisome since the Tesla launched its Robotaxi service less than two weeks ago on June 22.\nHow safe is a Robotaxi?\nIt's too early to definitely answer whether or not Tesla's Robotaxi service is safe, but it's clear that riders have experienced some mishaps first-hand. These mishaps range from awkward driving style to clear infractions. So far, the Robotaxi service hasn't been involved in any serious or fatal accidents, but Americans have been compiling different incidents on Reddit.\nRobotaxi incidents listed on Reddit thread\n- Robotaxi goes 26 MPH in a 15 MPH zone\n- Robotaxi cuts off driver and abruptly brakes in front of vehicle\n- Tire of Robotaxi touches parked car\nWhile the Robotaxi doesn't appear to be deadly (within the first few weeks of rollout) it's evident that the technology isn't infallible. Additionally, there are instances of the Robotaxi potentially damaging property including stopping so close to a parked vehicle that its tire directly contacted its body.\nThe future of self-driving cars\nCompanies like Tesla and Waymo (a subsidiary of Google's Alphabet Inc.) have invested big bucks into self-driving technology. Tesla was early to the semi-autonomous driving game and several automakers have since followed suit. That said, Tesla and Waymo are competing to make driverless vehicles ubiquitous, which could have serious repercussions for the jobs and safety of Americans.\nSelf-driving taxi services pose a significant threat to traditional taxi services, according to the Brookings Institution, a research foundation in Washington D.C. Based on recent Robotaxi videos, the technology has a long way to go before becoming safe enough to deploy in more major cities."

      "text": "Lucid lands $300 million investment from Uber to launch autonomous EVs\nUber UBER.N will invest $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid LCID.O in a robotaxi deal that aims to start with one major U.S. city late next year, the companies said on Thursday.\nOver six years starting in 2026, Uber will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology from startup Nuro, the three companies said in a statement.\nThe agreement illustrates the renewed plans and push for financing for self-driving cabs years after a first wave of autonomous driving investment produced only a limited number of vehicles. Tesla has recently launched a robotaxi trial in Austin and Alphabet's GOOGL.O driverless taxi unit Waymo is speeding up its expansion.\nAs part of their announced deal, Uber will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Lucid and Nuro, which supplies self-driving technology to automakers, the joint statement said. Of that, $300 million will go to Lucid, the EV maker said in a separate filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.\nLucid shares surged more than 26% to $2.95. They have fallen about 24% this year.\nUber's latest move underscores its renewed push into the robotaxi space after exiting in 2020. Since then, Uber has pivoted to partnerships with several technology developers, including Waymo and Aurora AUR.O.\nThe deal with Lucid follows Uber's robotaxi agreement in April with Volkswagen that will supply its ID.Buzz vans for commercial service planned for Los Angeles next year.\nBut commercializing AV tech has been much harder than anticipated with high costs, tight regulations and federal investigations forcing many, including General Motors' GM.N Cruise, to shut down.\nSome still in the race include Amazon.com's AMZN.O Zoox, which is testing a robotaxi without manual controls and plans to launch commercial services in Las Vegas this year.\nAfter years of missed promises, Tesla TSLA.O started a restricted trial with about a dozen of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, last month. CEO Elon Musk has said it will expand the service rapidly to other U.S. cities this year.\nWaymo has been growing cautiously for years and operates in several U.S. cities with about 1,500 vehicles. It crossed 100 million miles of autonomous driving this month.\nA prototype of the Lucid-Nuro robotaxi is already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's testing facility in Las Vegas, the companies said.\n\"We are expanding beyond our traditional EV technology leadership and working on partnerships and going now into areas that in the past we have not really focused on,\" Lucid's interim CEO Marc Winterhoff told Reuters.\nNuro, co-founded and led by former Waymo engineers, has expanded from making last-mile delivery vehicles to providing its self-driving technology for commercial and passenger vehicles.\n\"We have other very active conversations going on the personal vehicle side ... where we would integrate Nuro driver into vehicles that will get sold to end consumers,\" Dave Ferguson, Nuro's co-founder and president, said.\nNuro will still need to apply for state-level operating licenses though it holds some licenses from their previous delivery operations, he said.\nSeparately, Lucid said it had proposed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its class A common stock.\nReporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Jaspreet Singh; Editing by Christian Schmollinger"

      "text": "Tesla\u2019s robotaxi rollout hits bumps: Lane mistakes, sudden stops caught on video\nA first public test of robotaxis by Tesla in Austin led to multiple traffic problems and driving issues, videos from company-selected riders showed over the first few days.\nChief Executive Elon Musk has tied Tesla's financial future to self-driving technology, and with Tesla sales down, the stakes are high. He said Tesla would roll out the service to other U.S. cities later this year and predicted \"millions of Teslas\" operating \"fully autonomously\" by the second half of next year.\nThe Tesla fans invited to the trial were strongly supportive and posted videos of hours of trouble-free driving, but issues drew questions from federal road safety regulators and auto safety experts.\nIssues included Tesla robotaxis entering the wrong lane, dropping passengers off in the middle of multiple-lane roads or at intersections, sudden braking, speeding and driving over a curb.\nIn one instance, a robotaxi drove into a lane meant for oncoming traffic for about 6 seconds. It had pulled into an intersection in its left-turn lane with its turn blinker on. Then the steering wheel wobbled momentarily, and instead of turning it proceeded straight into the lane meant for oncoming traffic, prompting a honk from a car behind it.\nIn another incident, the car suddenly braked with no obstruction apparent in the video. The passenger jerked forward and their belongings were thrown to the floor. In a third video, taken from another vehicle, a robotaxi abruptly stopped twice in the middle of the road while passing police vehicles with flashing lights.\nTesla is conducting the test with human safety monitors in the front passenger seat. A fourth video showed the safety monitor hitting a button to stop the robotaxi when a delivery truck in front of it started backing up.\n\"This is awfully early to have a bunch of videos of erratic and poor driving,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert. \"I was not expecting as many videos of problematic driving on the very first day,\" he said. Tesla is testing about 10 to 20 robotaxis, which are standard Model Ys with advanced software, and has been giving rides since Sunday afternoon.\nReuters was able to independently verify the locations of at least 11 videos showing issues. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nA City of Austin spokesperson said officials are aware of the Tesla issues documented on social media and that \"when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company.\" The spokesperson added that the police department is \"actively collaborating with Tesla\" to ensure officers can safely interact with the robotaxis.\n'Caught on camera'\nThe incidents caught on camera did not involve accidents, and one expert said some reflected a decision to focus on safety.\n\"So far so good. It handled the situations very well and likely better than even good drivers,\" Alain Kornhauser, Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering, said by email. He added that it would be more dangerous to drive at less than the speed of prevailing traffic, for instance.\nTesla's experiment is unusually public. Other companies faced similar issues: Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise had their own share of traffic mishaps after showing up on Austin streets. City officials logged dozens of instances over the past two years where residents and authorities reported that robotaxis blocked traffic by stopping in the middle of roads, failed to respond to police directions and could not deal with emergency vehicles and road closures.\nA serious accident involving a pedestrian in 2023 led Cruise to shut down last year. Waymo is the only robotaxi service in the United States to ferry paying customers without a human backup driver or in-car safety monitor. It started offering rides to the general public through Uber in Austin earlier this year.\nMusk for years has failed to deliver on promises that self-driving Teslas are just around the corner. Tesla rolled out the service for a flat fee of $4.20 to a limited number of handpicked riders. The service is not available to the broader public and the robotaxis operate in a limited area, and avoid difficult intersections and bad weather.\nRiders were rarely bothered much by driving issues. Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla program manager, and his co-passenger hit the \"drop off early\" option during a ride. The vehicle stopped in an intersection with a stoplight, his video showed. They exit quickly and walk to the sidewalk. \"The car should have known to not stop there,\" Mesbahi is heard saying after the ride. \"Opportunities for improvement,\" the co-passenger says.\nThat is an example \"most companies would not be comfortable with,\" said Kara Kockelman, a professor of transportation engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, adding that she was surprised by the traffic mistakes.\n\"Dropping off people in the middle of a six-lane road or edge of a busy intersection when the traffic is going in the opposite direction is pretty dangerous. They definitely did not want to do this or be caught on camera,\" she said.\nAbhirup Roy reported from San Francisco, Rachael Levy from Washington and Chris Kirkham from Los Angeles.\nContributing: Inaki Malvido, Fernando Robles and Richa Singh"

      "text": "Tesla says semi-autonomous driving is safer than human drivers for these 3 reasons. What to know\nIs the future of driving semi-autonomous?\n- Tesla's FSD (Supervised) feature is one of the most advanced semi-autonomous driving features available.\n- FSD (Supervised) is trained on the cumulative driving experience of all Tesla EVs that use the feature, according to the company.\n- Tesla says its EVs are safer than human drivers for a number of reasons.\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\nAre cars that can (mostly) drive themselves actually safer than human drivers?\nTesla is one of the automakers leading the charge to a semi-autonomous and fully-autonomous future for drivers. The clean energy and electric vehicle company isn't alone in this endeavor. Chevrolet (Super Cruise), Ford (BlueCruise), and Volkswagen (IQ Drive) are some of the many automotive powerhouses getting in on the semi-autonomous action.\nSo, are cars that do most of the driving safer than actual human drivers? Here's what Tesla thinks and why the company may actually be on to something despite a clear bias.\nWhy Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) could be safer than human drivers\nCan machine outdrive man? Tesla says that FSD Supervised, its semi-autonomous driving feature, \"makes traffic much safer for you and other road users\".\nAccording to Tesla, three key reasons why FSD (Supervised) is safer than the average driver are that the system doesn\u2019t drive under the influence, never gets tired, and doesn\u2019t experience road rage.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that \"every day, about 34 people in the United States die in drunk-driving crashes\". That works out to a person every 42 minutes dying in a completely preventable car crash. So, Tesla makes a valid point regarding FSD (Supervised) being safer than drivers because of drunk-driving.\nDrowsy-driving-related crashes resulted in 633 preventable deaths in 2023, according to NHTSA. Unlike a human driver, the FSD (Supervised) system does not get fatigued over time. As for Tesla's point about road rage, the software cannot have emotional reactions to driving situations like a human. The debate is much more nuanced than Tesla's simplified case for FSD (Supervised) vs. average human drivers, but the system does have some advantages.\nHow does Tesla FSD (Supervised) work?\nTesla's advanced driver-assistance technology uses an intelligent onboard computer, cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to accelerate, decelerate, and follow navigation-provided routes. It requires the full attention of a driver but does not need physical stimulus to drive or steer.\nSemi-autonomous driving technology has been advancing for years through features like advanced cruise control. Tesla's FSD (Supervised) is one of the most advanced and commonly used semi-autonomous systems to date.\nThe feature is subscription-based and costs $99.00 per month. It may seem like an expensive add-on, but the feature can completely transform a user's driving experience.\nAutonomous driving is the next frontier\nSemi-autonomous driving may seem futuristic, but automakers and companies are already investing millions of dollars into fully-autonomous vehicles and technology. Tesla Robotaxi, Waymo, and China's Apollo Go are ushering in the era of the self-driving car.\nThese vehicles are capable of transporting passengers to their destinations without having a driver in the driver's seat. It's important to note that many robotaxi services still require an attendant to monitor the vehicle in early stages.\nDriver assistance and safety technology has come a long way in the past few decades. Features like backup camera are now standard on all new vehicles. Automatic emergency braking is much more common on new vehicles. In a few years, semi-autonomous driving features could be normalized to the point that they are standard and integrated into the way modern Americans drive.\nNot everyone thinks autonomous vehicles are safe\nThere are several cases for why semi-autonomous driving features could enhance the abilities of a driver, but fully-autonomous vehicles are a different story. Some Americans are amazed by the technology and others find it untrustworthy and frightening.\nThere have been multiple instances of autonomous vehicle crashes and dangerous driving behavior posted to X. Drivers have witnessed everything from collisions to a Waymo attempting to reverse near busy intersection traffic.\nThe technology may be impressive, but it certainly isn't infallible (thus far). Semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles have a long way to go before they are universally recognized as safe transportation options in America."

      "url": "https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-and-benteler-mobility-to-introduce-next-generation-autonomous-shuttles-across-lyft-network",
      "text": "Autonomous shuttles are planned for the Lyft platform in 2026.\nToday, we're excited to announce our plans to partner with leading mobility-as-a-service provider BENTELER Mobility to significantly expand Lyft's autonomous footprint. Through this partnership, we will connect more of Lyft\u2019s network of over 44 million annual riders with autonomous options, planning to start next year with an initial U.S. deployment of HOLON GmbH's autonomous shuttles on the Lyft platform.\nBacked by nearly 150 years of automotive expertise, BENTELER Mobility is related to the wider BENTELER Group, a multinational pioneer in the automotive and steel sectors. They offer a comprehensive, turnkey solution that manages the entire lifecycle of autonomous vehicle fleets \u2014 from deployment to operation \u2014 prioritizing safety, scalability, and cost-efficiency.\nAs a strategic partner, Lyft will benefit from a range of capabilities powered by BENTELER Mobility's strong ecosystem of best-in-class partners and strategic collaborations, enabling faster, more streamlined autonomous vehicle (AV) implementations while significantly reducing time and cost to market. This represents a major step forward in Lyft\u2019s human-centered AV strategy to continue to build the world's leading hybrid rideshare network, where AVs and drivers work together to serve our growing community.\n\"BENTELER Mobility is exactly the kind of partner we need to accelerate our AV ambitions,\" said Jeremy Bird, Lyft\u2019s Executive Vice President of Driver Experience. \"They're not just a tech company \u2014 they're closely linked to a massive automotive supplier with deep manufacturing expertise and global reach. Plus, their fleet ownership and financing capabilities mean they have ambitions to own and operate vehicles at scale, not just build them \u2014 a rarity in this industry. All this means we can more quickly deploy AVs at the speed and scale our riders deserve.\"\nTogether, the companies will focus on four key areas that will accelerate autonomous vehicle adoption:\nAV Technology Integration: We intend to deploy HOLON urban autonomous shuttles on the Lyft platform with the goal of starting in the U.S. in late 2026. We initially plan to deploy these shuttles in partnership with airports and cities, with the opportunity to expand to thousands of vehicles as we bring this service to more geographies around the globe. Riders will be able to book a ride on one of these autonomous shuttles directly through the Lyft platform. These vehicles will be equipped with Mobileye autonomous technology, furthering our relationship and demonstrating additional potential applications of their technology on the Lyft platform.\nFleet Financing: Lyft will partner with BENTELER Mobility\u2019s sister company BENTELER Trading International, which will provide vehicle ownership and financing, with tens of millions of dollars intended for future autonomous fleet expansion. As Lyft's autonomous network and capabilities continue to grow, both parties plan for potentially thousands of BENTELER Mobility-owned AVs to be operated on the Lyft platform serving riders. This builds on Lyft\u2019s strategy to be the platform of choice as more and more fleet owners, OEMs, and tech developers enter into the AV space.\nManufacturing & Integration Services: Today, most AV companies take existing cars and retrofit them with sensors, computers, and autonomous driving systems \u2014 in small batches \u2014 a complex and expensive process that prevents scale. The BENTELER Group's deep automotive manufacturing expertise and network solve for this piece of the value chain by integrating AV technologies into existing platforms at scale and with automotive-grade quality, streamlining complexities and lowering costs.\nExpansion Opportunities: The BENTELER Group\u2019s deep industry relationships and extensive production capabilities give them the flexibility to support Lyft's AV strategy with multiple vehicle types beyond just the HOLON urban shuttle. With HOLON's new +$100M production facility in Jacksonville, Florida, and their global manufacturing capabilities, BENTELER Mobility is building infrastructure for large-scale AV deployment. By leveraging these capabilities, the companies can both deploy and operate various AV technologies customized for different markets and regulations.\n\"We are delighted to be teaming up with Lyft,\" said Tobias Liebelt, CEO of BENTELER Mobility. \"Lyft's innovative and ambitious culture matches our own. Lyft brings excellent expertise in ride-hailing, deep market penetration, and a strong commitment to making autonomous mobility a reality. Together, we combine their technology excellence and user-first approach with our automotive-grade AV platforms, operational excellence, and scalable fleet capabilities. This partnership will allow us to turn ambition into deployment \u2014 bringing safety-focused, efficient, and accessible mobility to the streets faster than ever before \u2014 let's make it happen.\"\nWhat's Next\nWe plan to begin testing these vehicles on the Lyft network next year, working closely with local communities and policymakers to ensure these new services benefit our entire community. As always, safety is our top priority, and we're holding our AV partners to the highest standards.\nThis partnership will build on the momentum we\u2019ve created around AVs, including our collaboration with May Mobility, as well as our planned partnerships with Mobileye, Marubeni, Nexar, and more. Together, these partnerships represent our comprehensive approach to AVs \u2014 from technology integration and data collection to fleet management and manufacturing. And with May Mobility bringing AVs to Atlanta this summer, plans for Mobileye to enable \"Lyft-ready\" vehicles across our network, and now BENTELER Mobility\u2019s plans to expand our ecosystem with purpose-built shuttles and international capabilities, we'll be creating even more pathways to serve our customers and build a more connected world, with transportation for everyone.\nThe future of mobility isn't just closer than you think \u2014 it's already taking shape.\nForward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this announcement are \"forward-looking statements\" about Lyft within the meaning of the securities laws, including statements about Lyft's autonomous vehicle strategy and partnerships and related plans, expectations, technologies, benefits for drivers and riders, and deployment timelines. Such statements, which are not of historical fact, involve estimates, assumptions, judgments and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements. Such factors are detailed in Lyft's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
