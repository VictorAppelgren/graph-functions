  "title": "Trump Administration Blocks Ukraine From Using US-Provided Long-Range Missiles on Strikes in Russian Territory: REPORT",
  "description": "Did the US pull the plug on Ukrainian strikes in Russian territory using the US-provided missiles?",
  "content": "Did the US pull the plug on Ukrainian strikes in Russian territory using the US-provided missiles?\n\nAfter the historic summit between Donald J. Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, it was stipulated that Russia and Ukraine would negotiate the next meeting of Putin with Kiev leader Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, Zelensky and his Euro-Globalist mentors have muddied the waters considerably \u2013 while Russia is putting its foot down and insisting on their long-known demands.\n\nFrom a distance, Trump has decried the lack of progress, and said that in two weeks he may impose sanctions and tariffs (on Russia), or else he may pull back from the peace process and let it play out.\n\nThen, yesterday, the Kiev regime attacked the Druzhba pipeline for the third time, cutting the flow of Russian crude oil to Hungary and Slovakia, endangering their energy security.\n\nTrump responded to a complaint by his long-time ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n saying that he was \u2018very angry about it\u2019.\n\nCoincidence or not, here\u2019s what was reported today, initially by the WSJ (behind a paywall):\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon has been quietly blocking Ukraine from using U.S.-made long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike targets inside Russia, limiting Kyiv\u2019s ability to employ these weapons in its defense against Moscow\u2019s invasion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing U.S. officials.\n\nThe news came as U.S. President Donald Trump has grown more frustrated publicly over the three-year-old war and his inability to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has final say over use of the long-range weapons, the Journal said.\n\nNeither Ukraine\u2019s presidential office nor the defense ministry immediately responded to Reuters\u2019 request for a comment outside business hours. The White House and the Pentagon also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u201d",

      "text": "Ukraine bites the hands that feed it.\nAs we reported three days ago, the Ukrainians have started attacking the Druzhba pipeline that transports Russian crude oil to Hungary and Slovakia.\nWhile strikes on energy infrastructure have become commonplace, this specific pipeline is the lifeline for the Hungarian and Slovak economies.\nHungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 took to X, and sais that the \u2018strike against our energy security is outrageous and unacceptable!\u2019\nThe Ukrainian FM Andrii Sybiha was ironic, and told his counterpart \u2018You can now send your complaints\u2014and threats\u2014to your friends in Moscow\u2019.\nSzijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 responded with fire, saying:\n\u201cFact 1: Russia has supplied oil to Hungary for decades via the Druzhba pipeline. This is in Hungary\u2019s interest.\nFact 2: Ukraine attacks this pipeline, and because of these Ukrainian strikes, oil supplies to Hungary are repeatedly cut off. This is against Hungary\u2019s interest.\nAs Hungary\u2019s Foreign Minister my mandate is clear: Hungary\u2019s interest comes first. Period.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget: a significant part of Ukraine\u2019s electricity comes from Hungary\u2026\u201d\nYes, you read it right: Ukraine disrupts the energy security of a country who sends electricity to make up for its destroyed infrastructure!\nSo, today, Kiev unleashed a third strike on the Druzhba pipeline \u2013 and again the flow of Russian crude oil to Budapest and Bratislava has been interrupted.\nThis time, Prime Minister Victor Orb\u00e1n took to social media to protest.\n\u201cFive days ago, just before the historic meeting between President Trump and Putin in Alaska, Ukraine carried out drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia. This pipeline supplies Hungary and Slovakia, two countries that have no other means of importing crude oil. Hungary supports Ukraine with electricity and petrol; in return they bomb pipeline that supply us. Very unfriendly move! We wish President Trump every success in his pursuit for peace!\u201d\nHis complaint was heard (read) by US President Donald J. Trump, who posted a handwritten response.\n\u2018Viktor, I do not like hearing this \u2013 I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia. You are my great friend\u2019, Trump wrote.\u2019\nIt\u2019s unclear what can Trump do about at this juncture, but he is at least exposed to a window on the behavior by the Kiev regime.\nRead more:"
