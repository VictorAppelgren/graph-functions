  "description": "Doctors may soon have a new way to treat high blood pressure, even among people for whom medicines haven\u2019t worked well in the past.",
  "content": "Doctors may soon have a new way to treat high blood pressure, even among people for whom medicines haven\u2019t worked well in the past.\n\nBaxdrostat, an experimental medicine made by AstraZeneca, showed promise in treating people with uncontrolled or resistant high blood pressure in a recent trial. If the medicine gets approved by regulatory authorities, it will be one of the first new approaches to treating high blood pressure in decades, researchers say.\n\nScientists presented the trial results Saturday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025 in Madrid and simultaneously published them in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, researchers enrolled 800 adults who still had high blood pressure after taking two or more medications for at least four weeks. To qualify for the study, patients\u2019 systolic blood pressure had to be between 140 and 170.\n\nBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading. Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries; diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.\n\nNormal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, and elevated blood pressure is considered to be from 120 to 129/80 mm Hg. At 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to new US guidelines, a person\u2019s medical provider will want them to take a blood pressure medication if lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating healthier, reducing salt in the diet and exercising more \u2014 don\u2019t work first.\n\nThe researchers on the new trial placed the participants into three groups. One received 1 milligram of baxdrostat, another got 2 mg, and another got a placebo, which does nothing. Participants took their dose in addition to medicines they were already taking.\n\nAt 12 weeks, about 4 in 10 patients taking baxdrostat reached healthy blood pressure levels, compared with less than 2 in 10 who got a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, participants who got 1 or 2 mg of baxdrostat daily saw their systolic blood pressure \u2013 the upper number in the reading \u2013 fall around 9 to 10 mm Hg more than those taking a placebo. This reduction, studies show, is large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.\n\nWhen blood pressure is high, the force of the blood pushes against the walls of their blood vessels, making the heart less efficient: Both the vessels and the heart must work harder, and it\u2019s more difficult to get blood to essential organs and cells. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage the arteries, raising the risk of conditions like a heart attack, stroke, coronary disease, vascular dementia and cognitive problems.\n\nHeart disease is the No. 1 killer in the world. Lowering blood pressure is the most modifiable way to avoid such a death.\n\nNearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure, and 1 in 10 people have what doctors call resistant hypertension: Despite being on three or more medications, they are not meeting the goal for blood pressure control.\n\nWhen a patient has high blood pressure, doctors may need to try a variety of medications to see what works best.\n\nAdding baxdrostat to the list of options could be a big help for patients, according to Dr. Stacey E. Rosen, volunteer president of the American Heart Association, who was not involved with the new research.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this medication is that they can really be a wonderful partner, so to speak, with some of the more classically recommended anti-hypertensive medications,\u201d said Rosen, who is also a senior vice president of women\u2019s health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women\u2019s Health of Northwell Health in New York City.\n\nMedication options now on the market control blood pressure in a variety of ways. Some, such as vasodilators, relax and widen arteries and veins to allow blood to get through easier and increase flow. Diuretics primarily work by removing excess fluid and salt from the body by increasing urine production. Centrally acting alpha agonists help prevent the nervous system from responding to stress. ACE inhibitors keep the body from producing angiotensin II, a hormone that makes blood vessels constrict. ARBs, or angiotensin II receptor blockers, help reduce the production of aldosterone, a hormone that promotes salt and water retention. Calcium channel blockers can keep calcium away from the cells of the heart and arteries so they don\u2019t have to work as hard.\n\nEach can have different side effects, including dizziness, rapid or slower heart rate, exhaustion, upset stomach and swelling in the legs.\n\nBaxdrostat\u2019s side effects, the study showed, were mild overall. The most common problem was abnormalities in potassium and sodium levels, but this was rare.\n\nBaxdrostat takes a new approach to managing high blood pressure. It focuses on blocking aldosterone, a hormone created by the adrenal glands that helps kidneys regulate salt and maintain the body\u2019s water balance. Some people produce too much aldosterone, leading their body to retain too much water and salt, pushing up blood pressure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also known for a while now that most of us eat too much salt and in doing that, it raises blood pressure. But we\u2019re also increasingly recognizing that aldosterone may have a direct impact on causing damage to the blood vessels, to the heart, to the kidneys,\u201d said Dr. Jenifer Brown, one of the lead investigators and co-author of the published study.\n\nBrown said she often sees cardiology patients at Bringham and Women\u2019s Faulkner Hospital who may have had a heart event, so she needs to be aggressive in getting their blood pressure under control to prevent another. Some patients may have trouble tolerating other blood pressure medications. For others, the standard medicines just don\u2019t work well. Baxdrostat could be a good complement, she said.\n\n\u201cWe really have had the same tools as clinicians for many years,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI would be excited to have an option like this,\u201d\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the publication, Dr. Tomasz Guzik, a cardiovascular scientist at the University of Edinburgh, and Dr. Maciej Tomaszewski, a cardiovascular expert at the University of Manchester, write that next steps should be to figure out which patients would best respond to this new medicine and provide longer-term data. If the medication works long-term, they wrote, it could become a \u201ccentral piller of therapy for difficult-to-control hypertension.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca said it plans to submit its data to regulatory agencies before the end of 2025.",

      "text": "Step aside, MAHA. The country\u2019s largest heart-health organization has just released its long-awaited guidelines for the consumption of ultraprocessed foods, or UPFs.\nThe new scientific advisory statement from the American Heart Association comes just days before the arrival of the second \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d or MAHA Commission report, spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe first MAHA report, released in May, described how ultraprocessed foods were contributing to chronic illnesses in children. The second installment, due by Tuesday, is expected to lay out proposed policy changes.\nThe American Heart Association\u2019s key message is not surprising: Most ultraprocessed foods are terrible for health, including heart health, and it is high time the food industry stopped producing them and regulators stopped letting them, the nonprofit says.\nBut surprisingly, the AHA also dives nose first into the hotly debated question: Are all ultraprocessed foods unhealthy?\nMaybe not, according to the new guidelines released Friday in the journal Circulation. In reality, however, it\u2019s just a few categories, like \u201ccertain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads,\u201d the report states. Even those \u201chealthy\u201d options, the report adds, should be monitored to ensure they remain that way.\nThat\u2019s no reason to celebrate, says Christopher Gardner, who is vice chair of the AHA report\u2019s writing group. \u201cLet\u2019s not give the industry a write-off just because there\u2019s a few things that are a bit healthier than the vast majority of ultraprocessed foods full of sugar, salt and fat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have tons of evidence that too much salt, sugar and fat are harmful \u2014 we\u2019ve known that since the days of junk food,\u201d said Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center\u2019s Nutrition Studies Research Group.\n\u201cBut today\u2019s junk food is ultraprocessed with cosmetic additives that lead to overeating and tons of health issues,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Can we please double down on those?\u201d\nA growing problem\nGuidance from the AHA is highly regarded by medical professionals and policy makers, and experts say tackling the issue of ultraprocessed food couldn\u2019t come at a better time. New data released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found Americans over the age of 1 get 55% of their daily calories from ultraprocessed food. That number jumped to 62% for children between 1 and 18 years old.\nThat\u2019s concerning, the AHA report said, because research has found a dose-response relationship between ultraprocessed foods and heart attacks and stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality.\nJust one extra serving a day of ultraprocessed food led to some 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death, according to a February 2024 review of 45 meta-analyses on almost 10 million people. Eating more ultraprocessed foods may also increase the risk of obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression by 20%, according to the review.\nTo counter these potential health harms, the AHA says Americans should stop eating as many of the most harmful UPFs as possible \u2014 especially those high in unhealthy fats, added sugars and salt \u2014 while allowing \u201ca small number of select, affordable UPFs of better diet quality\u201d to be eaten as part of a healthy diet.\nMarion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, was disappointed with the guidance.\n\u201cThe emphasis on \u2018healthy\u2019 UPFs is not helpful for two reasons,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThe small number of foods in that category (of healthy UPFs), and the recent research demonstrating that even \u2018healthy\u2019 UPFs induce people to eat more calories than they would if they were eating minimally processed foods.\u201d\nNestle, who was not involved with the report, is referencing an August 4 study in which people in the United Kingdom lost twice as much weight eating meals typically made at home than they did when eating store-bought ultraprocessed food considered healthy.\nThe research, which was one of the largest and longest randomized controlled clinical trials of UPFs to date, tried to create a healthy ultraprocessed diet. Ultraprocessed foods in the study included a recommended number of fruits, veggies and fiber as well as lower levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats. Yet, the study found, whole foods cooked at home still won the day when it came to weight loss.\nCategories of healthy to unhealthy foods\nWhile science attempts to find out just what it is about UPF additives or processing that contributes to such findings, the AHA has provided some basic advice by assigning ultraprocessed foods into one of three categories: least healthy, moderately healthy and healthy.\nHealthier choices included fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables without added sugar or salt; whole grains such as oats and brown rice; unsalted seeds and nuts; dried beans and legumes; plant oils; low-fat plain milk or yogurt; lean, unprocessed meat; and dairy, unsweetened beverages and water. Plant-based meat and dairy that was low in added sugar, salt and fats were also considered healthy.\nModerately healthy foods included white rice and pasta; full fat dairy; freshly made refined grain bread; salted nuts; canned fruits in light syrup; canned beans with salt; hard cheeses; egg replacements; and low sodium, low fat soups. Store-bought meals made with choices from the healthy group above were also in the category.\nThe unhealthy group contained the usual culprits \u2014 high fat red meat, pork, processed meats (chicken nuggets, hot dogs, sausage), butter, lard and tropical oils such as coconut. Sour cream and 100% fruit juice made the list, as did sugar, honey, maple syrup, crackers, sweetened dried and canned fruit, tortilla or potato-based chips and French fries.\nRefined grain breads, rolls and tortillas were included as unhealthy, as were sugar-sweetened beverages (which included energy drinks), liquid cheese products, cookies, crackers, candies, gummy fruit snacks, ice cream, boxed macaroni, instant noodles, pizza, some canned or instant soups and canned fruits in syrup.\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

      "text": "Highlights:\n- According to the American Heart Association\u2019s 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n- While medical advances have helped more people live longer with cardiovascular diseases, many of the risk factors which lead to these diseases, including high blood pressure and obesity, continue to grow at alarming rates.\n- Cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke, claim more lives in the U.S. than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths \u2013 the #2 and #3 causes of death \u2013 combined.\nEmbargoed until 4 a.m. CT / 5 a.m. ET Monday, Jan. 27, 2025\nDALLAS, Jan. 27, 2025 \u2014 Heart disease kills more people than any other cause as many of the risks factors that contribute to it remain on the rise, according the data reported in the 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of U.S. and Global Data From the American Heart Association. The annual update published today in Circulation, the peer-reviewed, flagship journal of the American Heart Association, the leading global voluntary health organization devoted to changing the future of health care for a world of healthier lives for all.\n\u201cDid you know that in the U.S., someone dies of cardiovascular disease every 34 seconds? Nearly 2,500 people in the U.S. die from cardiovascular disease every day. Those are alarming statistics to me \u2013 and they should be alarming for all of us, because it\u2019s likely many among those whom we lose will be our friends and loved ones,\u201d said Keith Churchwell, M.D., FAHA, the volunteer president of the American Heart Association. \u201cToo many people are dying from heart disease and from stroke which remains the 5th leading cause of death. Together, they kill more people than all cancers and accidental deaths - the #2 and #3 causes of death \u2013 combined.\u201d\nAccording to the Association\u2019s 2025 statistical report, in 2022 (the most recent year for which final data is available), the overall number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related deaths in the U.S. was 941,652, an increase of more than 10,000 from the 931,578 CVD deaths in 2021. The age-adjusted death rate attributable to CVD was 224.3 per 100 000 people, a slight decrease from 233.3 per 100,000 reported in 2021.\nThe report indicates the overall number of cardiovascular-related deaths appears to be leveling out after a major uptick during the COVID pandemic. In fact, the age-adjusted death rates dropped for all but one of the ten leading causes of death. The kidney disease age-adjusted death rates increased 1.5%.\n\u201cKidney disease has actually been on the rise over the past decade. In our report, we noted a significant increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease among Medicare beneficiaries from 9.2% in 2011 to 14.2% in 2021. Additionally, the global prevalence of kidney disease has increased more than 27% in relative terms since 2010,\u201d said American Heart Association volunteer and chair of the Association\u2019s statistical update writing committee Seth S. Martin, M.D., M.H.S., FAHA, a professor of medicine and cardiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. \u201cThe reason this is important is that, first, cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to kidney disease. Second, the risk factors of these diseases are closely interrelated. These include high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes \u2013 all health conditions that are rising substantially across the U.S. and the world.\u201d\nAccording to the Association\u2019s 2025 Statistics Update:\n- Nearly 47% of U.S. adults have high blood pressure.\n- More than 72% of U.S. adults have unhealthy weight (currently defined as body mass index \u226525, with nearly 42% having obesity (currently defined as body mass index \u226530).\n- More than half of U.S. adults (57%) have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.\nIn a 2023 presidential advisory and scientific statement, the American Heart Association recognized cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome as a health disorder due to the risk factor connections among heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity leading to poor health outcomes.\nIn the editorial accompanying the 2025 Statistics Update, American Heart Association volunteer Dhruv S. Kazi, M.D., M.Sc., M.S., FAHA, who is head of health economics and associate director of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, noted the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors is projected to worsen over the coming decades.\n\u201cAlthough we have made a lot of progress against cardiovascular disease in the past few decades, there is a lot more work that remains to be done. If recent trends continue, hypertension and obesity will each affect more than 180 million U.S. adults by 2050, whereas the prevalence of diabetes will climb to more than 80 million. And over the same time period, we expect to see a 300% increase health care costs related to cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Kazi, who was the volunteer vice-chair of the advisory writing group of the American Heart Association\u2019s 2024 presidential advisories: Forecasting the Burden of Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke in the United States Through 2050: Prevalence of Risk Factors and Disease and Forecasting the Economic Burden of Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke in the United States through 2050. \u201cAnd it is important to acknowledge that, although cardiovascular disease affects us all, it doesn\u2019t affect us all equally. For instance, there is wide variation in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure by sex and race/ethnicity.\u201d\nPrevalence rates for major risk factors vary widely across specific sex and race/ethnicity populations. Below are comparisons of the highest rates to the lowest rates of key risk factors among all of the population groups. Rates for each individual population group can be found in the report:\n- For overall prevalence of obesity, Black women had the highest rate of obesity at 57.9%, compared to the lowest rate of 14.5% which was among Asian women.\n- For overall prevalence of diabetes, Hispanic men had the highest rate of diabetes at 14.5% compared to the lowest rate of 7.7% which was among white women.\n- For the overall prevalence of high blood pressure, Black women had the highest rate of high blood pressure at 58.4% compared to the lowest rate of 35.3% which was among Hispanic women.\nThe prevalence of these risk factors \u2013 obesity in particular \u2013 is also growing among young people and globally:\n- As many as 40% of U.S. children have an unhealthy weight (currently defined as body mass index \u226585th percentile), with 20% having obesity (currently defined as \u226595th percentile).\n- Nearly 60% of adults globally have an unhealthy weight.\n\u201cIn the update, we noted calculations that found excess weight contributes to as many as 1,300 additional deaths per day in the U.S., nearly 500,000 per year. It lowers life expectancy by as much as 2.4 years compared to a healthy weight,\u201d said American Heart Association volunteer and vice-chair of the Association\u2019s statistical update writing committee Latha P. Palaniappan, M.D., M.S., FAHA, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. \u201cThe impact on lives lost is twice as high for women, and higher for Black adults than for white adults. It\u2019s alarming to note that excess weight now costs us even more lives than smoking \u2013 as smoking rates have actually fallen in recent years. Being overweight is the new smoking when it comes to health threats.\u201d\nTobacco use has long been considered one of the leading preventable causes of death in the U.S. and worldwide. However, smoking rates have been on a steady decline among both adults and youth:\n- Since the U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s first report on the health dangers of smoking, age-adjusted prevalence of smoking among adults has declined, from 51% of men smoking in 1965 to 15.6% in 2018 and from 34% of women in 1965 to 12.0% in 2018.\n- Current cigarette use among all U.S. adults is 11.5%.\n- About 28% of high school students reported ever using any tobacco product in 2023, compared to about 34% in 2022.\n- In 2023, 12.6% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product, compared to 16.5% in 2022.\n- E-cigarette use has also seen a recent downward trend among youth: 10% of high school students reported current use of e-cigarettes in 2023, compared to 14.1% in 2022.\n\u201cAnother positive trend over the years has been a reduction in the rates of high cholesterol. That\u2019s likely thanks, in part, to increased awareness about the dietary and lifestyle factors that impact cholesterol levels, along with the availability of medications and better clinical control,\u201d Churchwell said. \u201cRecent clinical research has identified a number of new medication therapies to address the growing burden of obesity, as well, and we look forward to learning more about those advances as the body of science builds.\u201d\nHowever, Kazi and Churchwell both warn that the solution to saving lives will need to be much broader than medical intervention.\n\u201cThe disparities in risk and outcomes call for tailored interventions among high-risk populations,\u201d Kazi said. \u201cSimply discovering breakthrough therapies isn\u2019t going to be enough \u2013 we have to ensure that these therapies are accessible and affordable to people who need them most.\u201d\n\u201cHeart disease was once considered a death sentence, but thanks to the many advances in clinical diagnosis and treatment, people are able to live longer, healthier lives even after a cardiovascular event,\u201d said Churchwell, who is an associate clinical Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut and adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cCertainly, any medical or clinical therapy that can treat the risk factors that contribute to CVD are essential. More importantly, I would say that we need to stop these risk factors in their tracks, keep people healthy throughout their lifespan. That will only be possible with a strong emphasis on early prevention and equitable health access for all.\u201d\nThis statistics update was prepared by a volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Committee.\nAdditional author names and authors\u2019 disclosures are listed in the manuscript.\nAdditional Resources:\n- Available multimedia is on right column of release link https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise?preview=f824068b85ceb351c50a286f9756433f\n- Spanish news release | Traditional Chinese news release | Simplified Chinese news release\n- After 4 a.m. CT/5 a.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, view the manuscript online.\n- View 2025 fact sheets on specific populations at heart.org/statistics.\n- American Heart Association\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8\u2122\n- Follow news from Circulation on X @CircAHA.\n- Follow AHA/ASA news on X @HeartNews\n###\nThe Association receives funding primarily from individuals.

      "text": "The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released Thursday suggest you abstain.\nCommittees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to high blood pressure, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.\nNearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven\u2019t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.\nBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.\nHigh blood pressure doesn\u2019t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\nHow high blood pressure is treated\nThe new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don\u2019t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That\u2019s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.\n\u201cSo just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that\u2019s really big news out of this guideline,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.\nLifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.\nThere\u2019s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.\nThe guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there\u2019s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.\n\u201cA lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,\u201d said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.\u201d\nBased on a growing body of evidence, there\u2019s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.\nWith more studies about women having trouble with high blood pressure during pregnancy, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person\u2019s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.\nDietary recommendations still include the DASH diet which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.\n\u201cWe also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,\u201d Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.\nFor people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications including GLP-1s. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.\nJones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person\u2019s health significantly.\n\u201cThe reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It\u2019s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It\u2019s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It\u2019s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you\u2019re willing to do it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but it works.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Doctors may soon have a new treatment for resistant hypertension: AstraZeneca\u2019s experimental drug baxdrostat, which in a 12\u2011week trial lowered systolic blood pressure by 9\u201310\u202fmm\u202fHg in 40\u202f% of participants versus <20\u202f% on placebo, potentially adding a new mechanism to the hypertension armamentarium. The study, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress and published in NEJM, targets patients who remain uncontrolled on at least two medications. Meanwhile, the American Heart Association released updated guidelines stressing aggressive lifestyle changes, stricter sodium limits, and a shift toward abstinence from alcohol, while also warning that ultraprocessed foods contribute to cardiovascular risk. These combined developments underscore a broader push to curb hypertension and diet\u2011related risk factors through both pharmacologic innovation and public\u2011health policy.",
