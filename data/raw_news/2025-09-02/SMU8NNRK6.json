  "content": "They\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll shop even as the price tags drop.\n\nShoppers at both Walmart and Target are noticing prices missing from items\u2019 tags \u2014 and a wave of viral social media posts from employees of these stores are proving customers\u2019 speculations to be true.\n\nReportedly, employees at these retail giants are removing price tags so they can nonchalantly reprice items as both stores prepare for widespread price hikes in response to looming tariffs.\n\nPeople claiming to be employees from both companies have taken to social media to show themselves strategically tearing off tags from items such as underwear, jeans and children\u2019s apparel.\n\n\u201cSpent almost a whole 8-hour shift just doing this,\u201d TikTokker Mykala Montalbano captioned a video of herself in a Target uniform ripping off price tags.\n\nA TikTokker named Amanda shared a video of herself doing the same during her shift at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWALMART IS Deceiving PEOPLE. ALSO MAKING WORKERS DO THEIR DISHONEST WORK\u2026\u201d angrily expressed someone else.\n\n\u201cLeave the prices on so America can see what they would\u2019ve been without these Traiffs,\u201d another frustrated commenter wrote.\n\nThe practice is said to allow retailers to quickly reprice items without drawing attention from shoppers \u2014 yet wise shoppers have been quick to notice this sneaky change.\n\nAt one Walmart, identical children\u2019s outfits were seen with differing prices \u2014 some with labeled tags, others priced higher on shelf signs, Retail Brew reported.\n\nIn a statement to The U.S. Sun, Walmart explained that prices for some items are now shown on shelves or pegs instead of hang tags. Some items may be re-stickered, while others may have no visible price at all.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to provide the best value for our customers while remaining flexible and competitive, earlier this year we implemented a change to our labeling process for some items,\u201d the chain said in a statement.\n\nWalmart did not confirm whether this change was directly linked to tariffs. However, CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged on the company\u2019s latest earnings call that price increases are on the horizon: \u201cAs we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we\u2019ve continued to see our costs increase each week.\u201d\n\nTarget has not responded publicly to the mounting reports, though employees and shoppers alike have documented similar activity in its stores.\n\nThe Post has reached out to both Walmart and Target for comment.\n\nAnd this mishandling of price tags isn\u2019t the only thing getting Target customers up in arms.\n\nIt was announced in July that after a decade, the store dropped its price-matching policy with Walmart and Amazon.\n\n\u201cTarget\u2019s Price Match Guarantee, paired with our commitment to being priced right daily, ensures guests get great prices when shopping Target,\u201d the company said.",

Only when she returned, she found a heartbreaking opposite.\n\u201cI literally feel like the worst mom ever,\u201d she shared.\n\u201cI took my daughter to a birthday party, and I asked them, \u2018Is it okay if I do a drop off and run an errand and I\u2019ll be back?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Absolutely, you can definitely leave them here.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMy daughter was alone\u201d\nThe mother checked the end time of the party. The party parent said they would be finished at 5 pm.\nSo Lauren left her daughter to enjoy the party at the roller rink and returned at 4:30 pm to pick her up.\n\u201cNobody was there. My daughter was alone,\u201d Lauren revealed on TikTok.\nThe party room had been locked, the lights turned off, and the party mother had vanished. She asked her daughter where everybody was.\n\u201cShe said everybody had left. I was like \u2018What do you mean everybody had left?\u2019 She said \u2018they\u2019re gone\u2019 and my baby was there alone,\u201d the mother explained.\n\u201cI trusted this other mom\u201d\nThe young girl was lucky enough that there had been a friend there who wasn\u2019t associated with the party. It just so happened that she\u2019d been there at the right place, at the right time.\nLauren decided to try and find some answers.\n\u201cI called this mom eight times and she did not answer my phone call. She didn\u2019t answer my text messages or anything so I talked to the manager and I said \u2018what time did they leave?\u2019 and they said they left an hour before that,\u201d she recounted.\nThe party parent had left an hour and a half earlier than she had told Lauren.\nMatters only got worse.\n\u201cI asked Ashton, I said \u2018did you eat?\u2019 She said no. Because they didn\u2019t announce for food, they didn\u2019t announce for cake and they did not announce for presents,\u201d she explained.\nIt\u2019s left Lauren feeling shocked and betrayed.\n\u201cNow I feel like the worst mom ever, because I trusted this other mom,\u201d she shared.\nThe comment section of her video was mixed, but many backed Lauren.\n\u201cDropping off kids at a birthday party is COMPLETELY NORMAL. Leaving before all the kids at the birthday party have been picked up is INSANE!\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\u201cOh party mom KNEW what she did. It wasn\u2019t an accident,\u201d a second said.\nA third pointed out: \u201cRed flag for her to be dodging your calls.\u201d\nOthers were keen to hear if there was another perspective.\n\u201cI hope my algorithm takes me to the other mom\u2019s story time so I can hear the complete story lol,\u201d wrote one person.\nAnother argued: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the parents well enough, you don\u2019t leave your kid.\u201d\n\u201cThere has to be more to this story\u2026 something is not adding up,\u201d a third said.\nAt the end of the day, Lauren\u2019s story is a reminder that as parents, we trust others with our children\u2019s care and when that trust is broken, it cuts deep."

      "text": "\u2018Flight from hell\u2019 sees six passengers sickened with mystery illness, ground crews enter in hazmat suits: \u2018Pure panic mode\u2019\nCabin fever?\nA British Airways flight devolved into pure \u201cpandemonium\u201d after passengers and crew fell ill, prompting hazmat-suited workers to swarm the plane after an emergency landing.\n\u201cIt was definitely a flight from hell,\u201d Melanie Wells, 61, told Kennedy News while recounting the ill-fated trip, which occurred during a flight from London, UK, to Egypt.\nThe East Sussex native and her 19-year-old daughter had planned to embark on a $10,000 all-inclusive vacation to Sharm El Sheikh \u2014 a scenic city on the Red Sea \u2014 to help boost her spirits as she hadn\u2019t been feeling well.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been away for ages, it was definitely much-needed,\u201d Wells recalled.\nUnfortunately, the Brit\u2019s dreams of a relaxing trip fizzled after she became violently sick on the plane.\n\u201cWhen we boarded, the temperature was so extreme that I started to feel unwell,\u201d the vacationer alleged. \u201cIt was supersonically hot. I ended up getting a really bad headache.\u201d\nWells initially attributed her symptoms to the heat until she noticed she wasn\u2019t the only one feeling green around the gills.\n\u201cAbout an hour and a half in the air, crew members suddenly began running down the aisle backward and forward. I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was one mom whose eyes rolled into the back of her head. The crew looking after them had actually collapsed.\u201d\nAccording to Wells, a total of six people fell ill aboard the aircraft. Wells, who felt \u201cnauseous\u201d with a headache, said she believes her symptoms were caused by noxious fumes on board.\nFollowing an emergency landing in Venice, Italy, ambulances and fire engines surrounded the plane. Then, emergency crews wearing hazmat suits and breathing apparatuses scrambled aboard and began administering tests to afflicted passengers and crew.\n\u201cI was absolutely terrified,\u201d recounted Wells. \u201cI was thinking, have we all been inhaling toxic fumes?\u201d\nShe added that the usually stalwart airline staff was in \u201cpure panic mode\u201d as well.\nUnfortunately, she claims that the flyers were kept in the dark. \u201cAt no point did the captain give us any information,\u201d the petrified passenger lamented.\nAfter an eight-hour delay in Italy, the plane returned to London. It then landed in Egypt the next morning.\nWells dubbed the experience \u201chorrific,\u201d venting \u201cwe were traveling for 40 hours. We were utterly exhausted.\u201d\nThe bedraggled traveler reportedly submitted a complaint to British Airways, which reportedly offered her nearly $3,000 in compensation for the cancelled flight, meal expenses and other hardships.\nBut Wells claimed that the carrier refused to refund her the $667 for their first night that they missed in Egypt due to the delays.\n\u201cBA have performed in the most cavalier manner,\u201d she declared. \u201cThe distress and trauma we went through, it was utterly traumatic. It ruined the start of our holiday.\u201d\nReps for the airline have yet to specify the source of the inflight illness, instead claiming the aircraft was diverted \u201cas a precaution because of a technical issue.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve apologized to our customers for their experience and have offered compensation accordingly,\u201d said the spokesperson.\nThey added that there was no evidence of fumes on board and that the plane was inspected and put back in service the next day.\nThe Post has reached out to BA for comment."

      "text": "Indiana Walmart employee is beaten by mob of women in disturbing viral video\nA shocking viral video shows a group of irate women beating up an Indiana Walmart employee as her co-workers desperately try to break up the mayhem.\nThe disturbing footage, filmed on Friday at an Indianapolis Walmart and posted to Facebook by witness Kind Butler, shows a woman in black restraining the female employee as two other women attack her at the checkout aisle.\nAs the employee is being held down, a woman in a pink shirt is seen savagely raining punches down on the victim, as another suspect starts to viciously stomp on her.\nThe mayhem escalates as a blood-curdling scream rings out in the background: \u201cWhere he at, bitch?!\u201d\nTwo bystanders then rush to the employee\u2019s aid and struggle to pry the woman in pink off.\nHowever, as they attempt to break up the violence, a male suspect jumps in and kicks the downed employee while another woman in a blue-and-white shirt continues to wail on the victim with punches.\nA co-worker eventually is able to help the victim to their feet, but as they begin to separate, the woman in pink hurls an object, then yanks the employee by the hair and keeps swinging.\nThe male suspect then attempts to re-enter the chaos, but is stopped by Walmart staff.\nFinally, workers are able to pull the employee away from the violent mob, while two good Samaritans step in to hold back her attackers as they hurl insults at the victim before the video comes to an end.\n\u201cIt was instantly on site,\u201d Butler, who shops at the Walmart almost daily, told Fox 59.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any questioning, no anything. Just as soon as they saw the girl, the whole family came over and started beating her up.\u201d\nButler, however, shared that before the brawl broke out, he overheard relatives of an alleged rape victim searching for someone they believed was connected to the assault.\nThe victim of the attack, Tikerra Hicks, said that prior to being attacked at work, she had been getting calls about how her friend allegedly raped another friend.\nHicks then shared that she was ambushed by the mob moments after coming out of the bathroom.\n\u201cI just hear, \u2018There she go\u2019 and then boom on the side of my head I feel somebody hitting me,\u201d Hicks told Fox 59.\nHicks claimed to have known the woman accusing her friend of rape for years, but was left puzzled as to why the mob targeted her, since she was not involved in the incident.\n\u201c(The alleged rape) have nothing to do with me,\u201d Hicks shared.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t there, even if it did happen, to protect he. And I wasn\u2019t there to defend him either.\u201d\nA Beech Grove police report for a rape investigation obtained by Fox 59 allegedly named Hicks as an \u201cother person\u201d in the document.\nHowever, Hicks said those allegations have been fabricated and she hasn\u2019t \u201ctalked to any officers besides after the fight.\u201d\nThe beaten employee told the outlet that she was suspended by Walmart after the brawl.\nThe Post has reached out to Walmart for comment."

      "text": "Target drops popular perk for shoppers after more than a decade\nTarget is dropping its price-matching policy with rivals Walmart and Amazon after more than a decade as the company aims to reposition itself amid slowing sales and competitive pressure.\nUnder its new Price Match Guarantee policy, taking effect July 28, customers of the Minneapolis-based retail giant will be able to price match other Target products in the store or online within 14-days of a purchase, but the policy will no longer apply to its rivals.\nThe company said the decision was driven by the fact that its \u201cguests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\u201d\n\u201cTarget\u2019s Price Match Guarantee, paired with our commitment to being priced right daily, ensures guests get great prices when shopping Target,\u201d the company said.\nTarget rolled out its very first price match policy, called the Low Price Promise, in 2009.\nIf a customer found a lower price at another brick-and-mortar store, the company matched it.\nEventually, the company expanded this policy, matching prices from certain online retailers including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, BestBuy.com and ToysRUs.com during the holiday season.\nIn 2013, the company began price matching top online retailers year-round, which then-CEO Gregg Steinhafel said that the move effectively made the company an \u201cunbeatable value\u201d compared to its competitors in the highly competitive sector.\nThe recent change, however, comes as CEO Brian Cornell works to turn around the company, which has been trying to drum up traffic and return to growth in back-to-back quarters. However, Cornell characterized the environment over the past few months in particular as \u201chighly challenging.\u201d\nTarget missed Wall Street expectations and cut its guidance for the year during its latest earnings call in May as it contends with tariff uncertainty, declining consumer confidence and backlash over its rollback of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.\nTo try and get back to long-term profitable growth, the company developed a new multi-year growth initiative, called Enterprise Acceleration Office, and made changes to its executive suite.\nThe Enterprise Acceleration Office initiative, led by Target Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, will specifically help the company operate more nimbly, \u201ccreating conditions for speed, adaptability, innovation and resilience,\u201d Cornell said.\nTarget said in its latest earnings that it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for fiscal 2025, down from its previous forecast of net sales growth of about 1%."

      "text": "Here\u2019s another unappreciated benefit of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs: They\u2019re now projected to slice the federal deficit by a whopping $4 trillion over the next decade.\nThat\u2019s the latest estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which projects new tariff revenue will fuel a $3.3 trillion drop in federal red ink through 2035, plus another $700 billion in interest-cost savings.\nThe new figures are based, in part, on the new revenue now streaming in to Uncle Sam\u2019s coffers: CBO now sees tariff proceeds totaling $200 billion this year, up from the $80 billion it projected as recently as January.\nJuly revenues alone were stunning, setting a record at nearly $30 billion \u2014 242% more than the tariff take in July 2024.\nAll told, the $4 trillion slashed from the deficit eclipses the CBO\u2019s official projection that One Big Beautiful Bill Act meant a $3.4 trillion bump \u2014 an estimate grounded in the fact that OBBBA prevented a enormous tax hike.\nThat\u2019s good news: Not only does a lower deficit reduce the pressure on future budgets, it can also juice up the economy, pushing down interest rates and freeing money for the private sector.\nAnd all that would be on top of all the other economic benefits of Trump\u2019s program, like boosting US-based supply-chain sources, creating jobs and sparking investment in American businesses.\nTrump\u2019s deals \u2014 with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam, the United Kingdom and, in part, China \u2014 have also gotten countries to lower their tariffs and open their markets to US goods and to commit to funneling trillions into America via purchases and investments.\nThe prez has also used the threat of tariffs to press for more cooperation on non-economic issues, from border control to undermining Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine.\nMeanwhile, the economy is humming along, with low inflation and healthy growth.\nYes, tariffs are a form of taxation, though there\u2019s considerable debate on who exactly pays how much of this tax \u2014 and at current levels are likely to mean less overall economic pain than, say, the income-tax hikes that OBBBA aborted.\nThe final verdict on Trump\u2019s tariffs and the rest of his program is far from in.\nBut so far the results are pretty good.\nJust don\u2019t expect his critics to admit any part of it."

      "text": "NYC Target bars kids under age 18 without adult after rash of delinquent fights\nA Brooklyn Target has banned kids under 18 from shopping at the store without adult supervision \u2014 just the latest business in the area using drastic measures to curb delinquent behavior.\nThe Target \u2014 located in the Triangle Junction mall on the corner of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue H \u2014 recently began posting security guards at its front doors and carding anybody who doesn\u2019t look of age, a store worker told The Post.\n\u201cAll guests under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult at this Target store,\u201d a sign stationed inside the door reads.\nAnybody who doesn\u2019t meet the age requirement and is without an adult is banned, and those who sneak in and get caught are escorted out.\nThe measure was reportedly put in place to cut down on recent fights and other rowdy behavior among groups of teens who have been loitering in the store and around the mall, said a 25-year-old security guard working the Target\u2019s door Monday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just regular. They play around. They come in groups, you know, and a lot of kids \u2014 and they\u2019re not really friends,\u201d the guard told The Post.\nThe teen problem has less to do with shoplifting \u2014 a rampant problem for Target and other stores that has grabbed headlines in recent years \u2014 and more to do with general delinquent behavior and loitering, he explained.\n\u201cWe try to make sure everybody doesn\u2019t have a hangout spot after school,\u201d the guard said.\nHe said that just the other day, he had to intervene in a fight that began on the store\u2019s second floor and eventually spilled down into its basement lobby.\nThe dispute only heated up when he and colleagues stepped in to throw the rowdy kids out, he said.\n\u201cThey started cursing at each other. We sent them back down the stairs. One of them threw a punch. Stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the reason why this [age policy] happened in the first place. Because it makes guests uncomfortable.\n\u201cWe try our best,\u201d he said.\nSome customers are fully onboard with the new rules.\n\u201cI kind of think it\u2019s a good idea because you can\u2019t predict what these kids are going to do, especially after school,\u201d said 20-year-old Kaela Ramsey, who was shopping at the Target with her three teenage nieces.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to no activities. They aren\u2019t going to no programs or nothing. I see a lot of kids come in here and do a lot of nonsense,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people get jumped. I\u2019ve seen kids get milked \u2014 they throw milk on the kids, fighting with milk.\u201d\nBut her 15-year-old niece, Kayla, called the age restriction \u201cstupid.\n\u201cNot every kid comes in here and destroys Target and stuff,\u201d the teen said, explaining she was even thrown out recently with an underage friend who was trying to buy \u201cemergency\u201d medication for her mother.\n\u201cI feel like they need to give everybody a fair opportunity to shop,\u201d Kayla said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s very dumb.\u201d\nCustomer Festus Adogu, 80, who was in the Starbucks cafe at the Target, said that if the kids \u201csit down, do their work, alright.\nBut when they \u201cplay and shout, [workers] call police all the time.\u201d\nThe Target is just down the street from a McDonald\u2019s which last month barred anybody under 20 from entering without a parent \u2014 and hired a bouncer to work the door and card everyone passing through.\nThe fast-food location rolled out the drastic measures after enduring more than a year of harassment from groups of kids \u2014 upwards of 20 at a time \u2014 who would roll in after school to trash the place and snatch food from customers.\nThe final straw came after one group charged in wearing ski masks and broke a glass door.\nRetail crime has been on the decline in the neighborhood in recent years, NYPD data shows, but some businesses still remain a notorious hotspot for bad behavior.\nMore than 100 911 calls were made from that McDonald\u2019s in each of the past three years, and so far this year, there have been 29.\nThe Target guard said while he didn\u2019t like that businesses have to card kids, he knows managers have little choice \u2014 but that it was a shame well-behaved kids now have to miss out.\n\u201cI know when I was in high school, I was interested in getting some fast food after school,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI get it, I understand it,\u201d he said of the restrictions. \u201cBut the kids who actually took $10 from their mom in the morning time to look forward to get something to eat after school, after a long day. So I feel bad for those kids.\u201d\nTarget did not respond to a Post request for comment Monday."

      "text": "Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs.\nThe big-box retailer topped Wall Street's quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.\nWalmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% and 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low \u2013 including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores.\n\"This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,\" he said. \"There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along.\"\nBut he added \"tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.\"\nEven so, Rainey said Walmart hasn't seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private-label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.\n\"Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that's happening with the consumer, but it's been very consistent,\" he said. \"They continue to be very resilient.\"\nYet on the company's earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.\n\"We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,\" he said.\nHere's what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected\n- Revenue: $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion\nWalmart shares fell 4% in morning trading Thursday.\nWalmart's net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including legal charges, Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents.\nRevenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nComparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.\nAt Sam's Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.\nE-commerce sales jumped 25% globally and 26% in the U.S., as both online purchases and advertising grew. In the U.S., Walmart said sales through store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items grew nearly 50% year over year, with one-third of those orders expedited. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.\nIts global advertising business grew 46% year over year, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired for $2.3 billion last year. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew by 31%.\nAs Walmart's online business drums up more revenue from home deliveries, advertising and commissions from sellers on its third-party marketplace, e-commerce has become a profitable business. The company marked a milestone in May \u2014 posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.\nRainey said Thursday that Walmart doubled its e-commerce profitability in the fiscal second quarter from the prior quarter.\nIn the U.S., shoppers both visited Walmart more and spent more on those trips during the quarter. Customer transactions rose 1.5% year over year and the average ticket increased 3.1% for Walmart's U.S. business.\nAs the largest U.S. retailer, Walmart offers a unique window into the financial health of American households. As higher duties have come in fits and starts \u2014 with some getting delayed and others going into effect earlier this month \u2014 Wall Street has tried to understand how those costs will ripple through the U.S. economy.\nWalmart warned in May that it would have to raise some prices due to higher levies on imports, even with its size and scale. The company's comments drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a social media post that Walmart should \"EAT THE TARIFFS.\"\nAbout a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey said in May.\nAccording to an analysis by CNBC of about 50 items sold by the retailer, some of those price changes have already hit shelves. Items that rose in price at Walmart over the summer included a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat.\nRainey on Thursday declined to specify items or categories where Walmart had increased prices, saying the company is \"trying to keep prices as low as we can.\"\nHe said one of the company's strategies has been bringing in inventory early, particularly for Sam's Club as it gets ready for the second half of the fiscal year and its crucial holiday season. At the end of the quarter, inventory was up about 3.5% at Sam's Club, Rainey said. It was up 2.2% for Walmart U.S.\nOn the company's earnings call, McMillon said the impact of tariffs has been \"gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.\"\n\"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,\" he said.\nYet even with higher costs from tariffs, Walmart has fared better than its retail competitors as it has leaned into its reputation for value, competed on faster deliveries to customers' homes and attracted more business from higher-income households.\nThe Arkansas-based retailer's performance has diverged sharply from rival Target, which posted another quarter of sales declines on Wednesday and named the new CEO who will be tasked with trying to turn around the company.\nWalmart has gained from Target's struggles. It has followed the Target playbook by launching more exclusive and trend-driven brands, including grocery brand BetterGoods and activewear brand Love & Sports. It has also expanded its third-party marketplace to include prestige beauty brands and more.\nSales of general merchandise, items outside of the grocery department, were a bright spot for Walmart in the fiscal second quarter, Rainey said. That category struggled during peak inflation in recent years, as consumers spent less on discretionary items because of rising grocery bills.\nComparable sales for general merchandise rose by a low single-digit percentage and accelerated throughout the quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He added clothing and fashion sales \"really shined for us.\""

      "text": "Target drops popular perk for shoppers after more than a decade\nTarget is dropping its price-matching policy with rivals Walmart and Amazon after more than a decade as the company aims to reposition itself amid slowing sales and competitive pressure.\nUnder its new Price Match Guarantee policy, taking effect July 28, customers of the Minneapolis-based retail giant will be able to price match other Target products in the store or online within 14-days of a purchase, but the policy will no longer apply to its rivals.\nThe company said the decision was driven by the fact that its \u201cguests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\u201d\n\u201cTarget\u2019s Price Match Guarantee, paired with our commitment to being priced right daily, ensures guests get great prices when shopping Target,\u201d the company said.\nTarget rolled out its very first price match policy, called the Low Price Promise, in 2009.\nIf a customer found a lower price at another brick-and-mortar store, the company matched it.\nEventually, the company expanded this policy, matching prices from certain online retailers including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, BestBuy.com and ToysRUs.com during the holiday season.\nIn 2013, the company began price matching top online retailers year-round, which then-CEO Gregg Steinhafel said that the move effectively made the company an \u201cunbeatable value\u201d compared to its competitors in the highly competitive sector.\nThe recent change, however, comes as CEO Brian Cornell works to turn around the company, which has been trying to drum up traffic and return to growth in back-to-back quarters. However, Cornell characterized the environment over the past few months in particular as \u201chighly challenging.\u201d\nTarget missed Wall Street expectations and cut its guidance for the year during its latest earnings call in May as it contends with tariff uncertainty, declining consumer confidence and backlash over its rollback of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.\nTo try and get back to long-term profitable growth, the company developed a new multi-year growth initiative, called Enterprise Acceleration Office, and made changes to its executive suite.\nThe Enterprise Acceleration Office initiative, led by Target Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, will specifically help the company operate more nimbly, \u201ccreating conditions for speed, adaptability, innovation and resilience,\u201d Cornell said.\nTarget said in its latest earnings that it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for fiscal 2025, down from its previous forecast of net sales growth of about 1%."
