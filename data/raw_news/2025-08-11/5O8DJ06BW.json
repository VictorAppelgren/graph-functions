  "content": "A stray cat with the worst case of fleas vets said they had seen \"in years\" is recovering after more than a month of treatment.\n\nNamed Firefly by staff, the male was brought into Woodgreen Pets Charity in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, by a member of the public who saw the cat struggling on one of the hottest days of the year last month.\n\nWoodgreen said he was \"dangerously\" dehydrated, \"ravenously\" hungry and much of his fur was missing because the flea infestation was so severe.\n\nThe charity urged people to be aware of the dangers that extreme heat poses to pets - and particularly to stray or abandoned animals.\n\nThe long-haired black and white cat is about four years old and was not neutered or microchipped, so Woodgreen staff ha no idea if he ever belonged to anyone or how long he had been fending for himself.\n\nThe charity said when Firefly was brought in he was so underweight that vets had to put him on fluids immediately.\n\nVets described it as one of the worst cases of fleas they had seen in years.\n\nThey said he was \"slowly gaining strength\" although remained underweight and \"constantly hungry\".\n\nBeverley Street, senior operations manager at Woodgreen, said: \"If Firefly hadn't come to us when he did, he wouldn't have survived. He was in a terrible state, and it was obvious he hadn't eaten for a while.\n\n\"If you find an unwell or injured stray cat during hot weather, try to move them to a shaded, well-ventilated area and offer them cool, fresh water.\n\n\"Contact a local vet or rescue charity as soon as possible - it may save their life.\n\n\"Always avoid leaving animals in confined spaces for long periods during high temperatures - even with the best intentions, the heat can quickly become deadly.\"\n\nMore on this story\n\u2022 None Is summer over or is another heatwave on the way?",

      "text": "Hot dogs and cool cats \u2013 advice for pet owners\n- Published\nA charity made famous by Channel 4's series The Dog House has been sharing tips on keeping pets cool during the hot weather.\nWoodgreen Pets Charity, based in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, hosts the popular rehoming show.\nWith temperatures set to reach more than 30C and England under an amber heat warning, Jody Geary, the charity's senior operations manager, said keeping animals cool was \"a top priority\".\nShe said all their enclosures had air conditioning and dogs were walked only in the early mornings or evenings, when it was cooler.\n\"To beat the heat, we take dogs for walks early in the morning when temperatures are at their lowest,\" Ms Geary said.\n\"Throughout the day, activities are kept low-impact and take place either indoors in air-conditioned rooms or in well-shaded outdoor areas.\n\"Many of our dogs also enjoy splashing in cool water paddling pools, and we treat our pets to frozen, edible snacks to help them stay refreshed.\"\nPeople could use similar methods to keep their own pets cool at home, she said.\n\"This includes simple measures such as walking your dog between 05:00 and 07:00 or in the late evening; moving outdoor small pet enclosures to a shaded part of your garden; and placing extra plant pots and cat-friendly plants around your garden for additional shade for cats.\"\nShe said homes could be kept cooler by keeping curtains closed during the day.\n\"Glass acts as a radiator and the sunshine bursting through your house can quickly heat up a room. Switch on a fan to circulate as much cool air as possible and keep the hot air out,\" she said.\nThe RSPCA has also issued advice, saying \"the soaring temperatures can pose huge risks to pets, wildlife and farm animals\".\nCarrie Stones, the charity's campaign manager, said: \"It's important we do everything we can to keep them cool and comfortable while the heat is here.\"\nSome of its tips include filling a paddling pool or spraying a hose for your dog to play in \u2013 although you should always supervise them around water.\nFish tanks should be kept out of direct sunlight and outdoor animals should be provided with shade and plenty of fresh water.\n\"It's also a really helpful idea to support local wildlife, too, by popping out some bowls of water to help birds, foxes and other wildlife,\" said Ms Stones.\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Cambridgeshire?\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\nRelated topics\n- Published21 June\n- Published19 June"

      "text": "Animal owners warned of 'huge risks' of heatwave\n- Published\nAnimal welfare experts have reminded pet owners and farmers about the \"huge risks\" high temperatures pose to animals.\nThe RSPCA said owners should learn how to keep their four-legged friends safe during the ongoing heatwave across Devon and Cornwall.\nThe charity reminded farmers pigs are susceptible to heat stress as they cannot easily cool down on their own, as are newly shorn sheep as they do not have fleeces to insulate them against the heat.\nLauren Bennett, RSPCA scientific and policy officer, said all animals needed shade and clean water in high temperatures and \"taking the time now to identify how you can reduce your animal's risk, could just save their life\".\nMs Bennett said: \"Sadly, while vets are seeing a surge in cases, some police forces have also reported an increase in officers attending calls about dogs in hot cars.\n\"This can't continue.\"\nMs Bennett said dog owners should check the \"feels like\" temperature forecast each day, add more water bowls around homes and walk their pets earlier and later in the day when temperatures were lower.\nShe also reminded dog owners \"if the ground is too hot to touch with your hand for five seconds, it's too hot for paws\".\nShe warned owners heatstroke could affect dogs which were older, larger, overweight, double-coated and those with potential breathing issues such as flat-faced breeds.\nThe RSPCA reminded farmers livestock needed plenty of air in high temperatures, so ventilation was key and ideally they would reduce the number of animals in each building.\nThe charity suggested dairy farmers give their cows unlimited amounts of clean drinking water and milk them later in the day when it would be cooler.\nThe RSPCA said handling and transport put extra stress on animals which made it more difficult for them to cope with the heat.\nThe charity advised farmers to avoid moving livestock in hot weather and at night if it was \"absolutely necessary\".\nMs Bennett said owners who suspected their animals were suffering from heat stroke should get them cool as quickly as possible and contact their vet.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.
