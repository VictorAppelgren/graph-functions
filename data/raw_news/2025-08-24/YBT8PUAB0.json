  "content": "CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen \u2019s capital on Sunday, days after the Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel that its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had launched at it since 2023. The Iranian-backed Houthis said multiple areas across Sanaa were hit while the Houthi-run health ministry said at least two people were killed and 35 others were wounded. The rebels' Al-Masirah satellite television reported a strike on an oil company, and video on social media showed a fireball erupting there. Israel\u2019s military said it struck the Asar and Hizaz power plants, calling them \u201ca significant electricity supply facility for military activities,\u201d along with a military site where the presidential palace is located.\n\n4 Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces while seeking aid near Gaza City, witnesses say\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Israeli forces shot dead four Palestinian aid-seekers traveling Sunday through a military zone south of Gaza City that is regularly used to reach a food distribution point, a hospital and witnesses said. Gaza City is in famine after 22 months of war, while Israel\u2019s military moves ahead with a planned offensive to seize the city, perhaps within days. Israel's defense minister has warned that the city of hundreds of thousands of people could be destroyed. Al-Awda Hospital and two witnesses told The Associated Press the Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed U.S.\n\nMoscow says Kyiv has struck a nuclear power plant as Ukraine marks Independence Day\n\nRussia accused Ukraine on Sunday of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight, as Ukraine celebrated 34 years since its independence. Russian officials said several power and energy facilities were targeted in the overnight strikes. The fire at the nuclear facility was quickly extinguished with no injuries reported, according to the plant\u2019s press service on Telegram. While the attack damaged a transformer, radiation levels remained within normal ranges. The United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog said it was aware of media reports that a transformer at the plants had caught fire \u201cdue to military activity,\u201d but hadn\u2019t received independent confirmation.\n\nTrump expands cities targeted for possible military deployment to Baltimore in a spat with governor\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to expand his military deployments to more Democratic-led cities, responding to an offer by Maryland's governor to join him in a tour of Baltimore by saying he might instead \u201csend in the \u2018troops.\u2019\u201d Last week, Trump said he was considering Chicago and New York for troop deployments similar to what he has unleashed on the nation's capital, where thousands of National Guard and federal law enforcement officers are patrolling the streets. Trump made the threat to Baltimore in a spat with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who has criticized Trump's unprecedented flex of federal power aimed at combatting crime and homelessness in Washington.\n\nEpstein accuser Virginia Giuffre wrote a memoir. Months after her death, it's coming out\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A posthumous and \u201cunsparing\u201d memoir by one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, will be published this fall, publishing house Alfred A. Knopf said Sunday. \u201cNobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice\u201d is scheduled for release Oct. 21, the publisher confirmed to The Associated Press. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, had been working on \u201cNobody's Girl\u201d with author-journalist Amy Wallace and had completed the manuscript for the 400-page book, according to Knopf. The publisher's statement includes an email from Giuffre to Wallace a few weeks before her death, saying that it was her \u201cheartfelt wish\u201d the memoir be released \u201cregardless\u201d of her circumstances.\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Three young sisters have died after an overcrowded rubber dinghy took on water in bad weather while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy, a German nonprofit organization reported Sunday. The sisters from war-torn Sudan, who were 9, 11 and 17 years old, are the latest known victims of a Mediterranean migration route that has claimed more than 30,000 lives since the International Organization for Migration started counting in 2014. Volunteers with the German group RESQSHIP found their bodies after rescuing some 65 people from the unseaworthy boat in international waters north off Libya on the night of Friday to Saturday.\n\nWhat to know: Four ways ICE is training new agents and scaling up\n\nBRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump\u2019s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren\u2019t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country. Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they\u2019ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa.\n\nSCARBOROUGH, Maine (AP) \u2014 Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark. The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.\n\nUS Open tennis players don't necessarily think more is better when it comes to starting on Sunday\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova made clear they didn't love the idea of starting a Grand Slam tournament on a Sunday instead of a Monday when the French Open was the first to do it nearly 20 years ago and they were on the schedule for the new, earlier Day 1. Now that the trend has reached the U.S. Open this year, not every current player is exactly a proponent of the switch, either \u2014 even if the crowds were gathering on-site Sunday morning before the start of competition. \u201cI hate the Sunday start,\u201d said Jordan Thompson, an Australian who's been ranked as high as No.\n\nTrump says he'll be at Ryder Cup and he thinks captain Keegan Bradley should play\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump says he will be at the opening round of the high-charged Ryder Cup next month in New York, and he thinks U.S. captain Keegan Bradley should be playing. Trump posted Saturday night on his social media site that he would be there on Friday, Sept. 26, for the start of three-day matches between the United States and Europe. He said he was invited by the PGA Tour, making a common mistake distinguishing between the tour and the PGA of America, which runs the Ryder Cup in America. A PGA of America spokesman said the organization and Bradley invited Trump.",
