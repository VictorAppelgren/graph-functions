  "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry sign new Netflix deal after repeated flops \u2014 but it comes with restrictions",
  "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a first-look deal, which means Netflix gets first dibs but no obligation to bankroll every semi-royal whim,\u201d a source said.",
  "content": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nThe deal is looser than before and gives the streamer first-dibs to say yes or no to projects, but is also worth far less for the royals than their previous agreement, sources told The Times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As ever brand,\u201d Markle, 44, said in a statement obtained by The Post.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision,\u201d she added.\n\nArchewell Productions also announced that the second season of Markle\u2019s lifestyle show, \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d will premiere on Netflix later this month, while a new holiday special, \u201cWith Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration,\u201d will air in December.\n\n\u201cThis December, join Meghan in Montecito for a magical holiday celebration,\u201d the press release read. \u201cTogether, friends and family deck the halls, create holiday feasts, craft heartfelt gifts, and share lots of laughs \u2013 with simple how-tos to follow at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a holiday wonder with warmth, tradition, and a generous dose of joy,\u201d it added.\n\nThere were two additional projects announced, too, including a documentary about orphaned children in Uganda called \u201cMasaka Kids, A Rhythm Within.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the heart of Uganda\u2019s Masaka region, where the shadows of the HIV/AIDS crisis linger, a small orphanage becomes a beacon of hope,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cMasaka Kids, A Rhythm Within\u2019 goes beyond the viral videos to reveal a vibrant, one-of-a-kind community where orphaned children transform hardship into joy, dancing their way toward healing, belonging, and the promise of a brighter future.\u201d\n\nThe royal couple\u2019s adaptation of Carley Fortune\u2019s bestselling novel, \u201cMeet Me At The Lake,\u201d is also still in the works at Netflix.\n\n\u201cArchewell Productions is in active development on additional projects with Netflix that span a variety of content genres, including the feature adaptation of the bestselling novel by Carley Fortune, \u2018Meet Me At The Lake,'\u201d the release confirmed.\n\n\u201cThis romantic drama follows a decade-spanning love story that begins with a chance encounter and a broken promise,\u201d it said.\n\nBela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s Chief Content Officer, added that the streaming giant was \u201cexcited\u201d to continue its partnership with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and \u201centertain our members together.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere,\u201d she began. \u201cThe response to their work speaks for itself \u2014 \u2018Harry & Meghan\u2019 gave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of our most-watched documentary series.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore recently, fans have been inspired by \u2018With Love, Meghan,\u2019 with products from the new As ever line consistently selling out in record time,\u201d Bajaria added.\n\nAfter Markle and Prince Harry, 40, signed their initial, massive $100 million deal with Netflix in September 2020, they went on to release \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d in 2022.\n\nAlthough \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d remains Netflix\u2019s most-watched documentary debut to date with 23.4 million views, their following projects, including \u201cLive to Lead\u201d (2022) and \u201cHeart of Invictus\u201d (2023), failed to garner anywhere near the same viewership numbers.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s \u201cPolo\u201d doc, which also received an awful reception from critics when it dropped in December 2024, was also thought to be so underwhelming that it jeopardized the royal couple\u2019s chances of having Netflix renew their lucrative contract.\n\nEarlier this year, Markle hosted and executive-produced the first season of her \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d lifestyle show.\n\nThe series, which was filmed in Montecito, California, and featured several celebrity guests like Mindy Kaling, also flopped.\n\n\u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d failed to rank among the platform\u2019s top 300 most-watched titles between January and June, and it garnered only 5.3 million views in the first half of 2025.\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry\u2019s newly extended partnership with Netflix is reportedly worth significantly less than their original $100 million deal with the streamer following their last few projects\u2019 disappointing numbers.\n\n\u201cThey have shot the golden goose of 2020 \u2013 more of a \u2018we\u2019ll call you\u2019 than \u2018here\u2019s the chequebook,'\u201d an insider familiar with the new deal told Daily Mail. \u201cIt\u2019s a first-look deal, which means Netflix gets first dibs but no obligation to bankroll every semi-royal whim.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon Netflix is trimming fat industry-wide, so this is less carte blanche, more curated cameo,\u201d the source added.",

      "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis gives blunt response to Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson\u2019s romance\nJamie Lee Curtis is defending Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson\u2019s love story.\nThe \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d star, 66, shared a blunt message to the public about the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d actors\u2019 rumored romance in a new interview with \u201cVT.\u201d\n\u201cWith all due respect to pop culture, if love has found its way into that relationship, God bless them both,\u201d Curtis said, adding, \u201cLeave them the f\u2013k alone. And let them like each other.\u201d\n\u201cBoth of them have had hardship, and they\u2019re both beautiful human beings,\u201d Curtis continued of the stars as she got choked up. \u201cIf they actually have found an intimate love with each other, we should all go to bed tonight feeling better.\u201d\nCurtis also called Anderson, 58, \u201ca beautiful person\u201d and noted that the \u201cBaywatch\u201d alum \u201cwas fantastic\u201d in their 2024 film \u201cThe Last Showgirl.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he also suffered an unimaginable loss so young, and has had a really hard go of it,\u201d Curtis added of Neeson, 73, who became a widower in 2009 after his wife Natasha Richardson died in a ski accident.\n\u201cSo if, in fact, these people have hard launched, then wish them the best and leave them alone,\u201d Curtis concluded.\nNeeson and Anderson struck up chemistry while filming \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d reboot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a budding romance in the early stages,\u201d a source told People last week. \u201cIt\u2019s sincere, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re smitten with each other.\u201d\nWhile Neeson and Anderson haven\u2019t outright confirmed they\u2019re dating, they have gushed over each other during the film\u2019s press tour.\n\u201cI think I have a friend forever in Liam. And we definitely have a connection that is very sincere, very loving and he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Anderson told Entertainment Weekly earlier this month.\nNeeson told People in October that he was \u201cmadly in love\u201d with Anderson.\n\u201cI can\u2019t compliment her enough, I\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d the \u201cTaken\u201d actor said. \u201cNo huge ego. She just comes in to do the work. She\u2019s funny and so easy to work with.\u201d\nThe stars have also packed on the PDA in recent weeks.\nAnderson planted a kiss on Neeson\u2019s cheek at the London premiere of \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d last month, and then they pretended to make out during an appearance on \u201cToday\u201d later in July.\nNeeson was previously married to Richardson from 1994 until her death in 2009. They welcomed two sons together, Miche\u00e1l, 30, and Daniel, 28, the latter of whom showed approval of his dad\u2019s new romance on a recent episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\u201d\nAnderson, for her part, has had five marriages with four different men, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce rocker Tommy Lee, who is the father of her sons Brandon Thomas Lee, 29, and Dylan Jagger Lee, 27."

And rightly so,\u201d critic Stuart Heritage wrote.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clattering and niche, and feels like a spoof documentary designed to play on screens in the background of episodes of \u2018Succession.'\u201d\n\u201cThe end of the final season goes out of its way to tee up a sequel, but I really don\u2019t think any of us deserve that,\u201d Heritage quipped.\nMeanwhile, The Telegraph wrote that there was \u201cnot enough of the Sussexes to make this anything other than a dull indulgence about a rich person\u2019s pursuit.\u201d\nIn his two-star review, critic Ed Power said there was \u201cbafflingly little\u201d of Prince Harry in the project.\n\u201cNetflix and Archewell team up for a tedious inside-look at posh polo \u2014 and for once, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex don\u2019t hog the limelight,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of blood, sweat, and tears in the series \u2014 but not enough of the Sussexes to make this anything other than a dull indulgence about a rich person\u2019s pursuit.\u201d\nThe negative reviews come just months after a report claimed that Netflix bosses were left \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the documentary, specifically about the fact that the exiled royal hardly appears in the project.\nSources claimed that the streaming giant\u2019s execs expected to get \u201cmore bang for its buck.\u201d"

It will premiere in the fall.\nThe Post can also exclusively reveal that filming on the second season of \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d had begun by January.

That same year, they signed a $100 million deal with Netflix. They released a docuseries, \u201cHarry & Meghan,\u201d in 2022, and Harry\u2019s \u201cPolo\u201d doc in December 2024."

      "text": "Here\u2019s how much Netflix paid Prince Harry, Meghan Markle for documentary\nThey\u2019re getting the royal treatment.\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle signed an estimated $100 million deal with Netflix for their bombshell docuseries \u201cHarry and Meghan,\u201d according to reports by Forbes. Per the alleged agreement, the duke and duchess are expected to produce an array of content for the streaming giant, including documentaries, films, children\u2019s shows, docuseries and more.\nThe multi-million dollar deal with the platform has contributed to their amassing wealth, which they\u2019ve rebuilt since stepping away from the British monarchy in 2020. The rift between the defiant couple and the rest of the royals began when Meghan claimed she was not only treated differently for being American, but also for being half-black.\n\u201cJust by existing, we were upsetting the dynamic of the hierarchy. So we go, \u2018Okay, fine, let\u2019s get out of here. Happy to,\u2019\u201d Meghan said in a bombshell interview with New York Magazine\u2019s t he Cut earlier this year.\nIn their highly anticipated new docuseries on Netflix, which dropped Thursday, Harry and Meghan took viewers through their unbreakable love and tumultuous relationship with the royal family. The \u201cexplosive\u201d six-part series was teased to give an inside peek at the alleged racism Meghan faced, coupled with the difficult decision to step away from the monarchy.\n\u201cThe piece of my life I haven\u2019t been able to share, that people haven\u2019t been able to see, is our love story,\u201d Meghan told the Cut, reiterating that the pair are thrilled to finally tell their own story in full.\nThe first installment begins just as the last of their royal engagements wrap up, continuing on to show intimate scenes that even include Harry\u2019s proposal. Critics were quick to bash the docuseries, slamming the ex-royals for \u201c[breaching] their own privacy.\u201d\nWhile stepping away from royal duties allowed Harry and Meghan more freedom to do and create as they please, the price of liberation was costly. Not only did it obviously strain Harry\u2019s relationship with his family, but it also cost the couple a mint.\nHundreds of thousands of dollars, which covered staff, travels and living expenses, were suddenly gone, they said. With the crown\u2019s financial support gone, the pair jetted to California with $10 million from the late Princess Diana\u2019s estate and $2 million from Meghan\u2019s earnings in her past life as an actress.\nAs the couple fell from their former wealth status, the Netflix and Spotify deals certainly cushioned the blow.\nAt the time of their royal departure, they were jobless and certainly couldn\u2019t afford the luxury they were accustomed to. At the time, they couldn\u2019t even afford their $14.7 million home in Montecito, thinking that owning such an estate was a pipe dream, Markle revealed.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have jobs, so we just were not going to come and see this house. It wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d Meghan told the Cut. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I was younger and you\u2019re window shopping \u2014 it\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go and look at all the things that I can\u2019t afford. That doesn\u2019t feel good.\u2019\u201d\nThen along came the multi-million dollar contracts and suddenly, they could afford the sprawling property which now brings \u201cjoy\u201d and \u201ccalm\u201d to their family. But the Netflix and Spotify deals have prompted people to question their intentions.\nTwo days before the series was set to be released, Harry and Meghan appeared at a gala in the Big Apple to receive a racial justice award. Bombarded with paparazzi \u2014 just like old times \u2014 the couple was the focus of a slew of questions from eager reporters.\nOne journalist asked if Harry was \u201cputting money before family,\u201d perhaps a nod to the multi-million dollar deals the ex-royals agreed to follow their prompt exit from the monarchy.\nIn addition to their Netflix deal, Harry and Meghan also signed a $25 million contract with Spotify \u2014 to produce content like Meghan\u2019s \u201cArchetypes\u201d podcast \u2014 prompting backlash from musicians who receive mere pennies per stream from the audio-based site.\nTheir three-year deal with the music streaming giant is just one of their many endeavors, which include speaking engagements and other content productions.\nHarry and Oprah Winfrey announced back in 2019 that they would be producing a mental health show on AppleTV+, although it was delayed due to the pandemic and released in 2021.\nOther projects Harry and Meghan are working on include an animated series for Netflix about a young girl on a journey of self-discovery, as well as a show centered around Invictus Games, which allows adaptive athletes who once were service members to compete in sports."

      "text": "Netflix back away from Harry and Meghan with new deal, on worse terms: Sussexes sign 'first-look' agreement after shows flopped - with cooking Christmas special and another documentary\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a new 'multi-year, first look deal for film and television projects' with Netflix - a downgrade on their previous contract.\nThe couple's new output will include a second season of the Duchess's 'With Love, Meghan' lifestyle show later this month, as well as a Christmas special in December.\nThe new arrangement is a first-look deal, meaning Netflix can say yes or no to new film or TV projects before anyone else.\nThe Sussexes are also working on 'Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within' - a documentary about orphaned children in Uganda, where the 'shadows of the HIV/Aids crisis linger'.\nThere is also 'active development' on other projects with Netflix which 'span a variety of content genres', including an adaptation of romantic novel Meet Me At The Lake.\nNetflix has already released the first series of With Love, Meghan as well as Polo, Heart of Invictus, Live to Lead and the couple's bombshell documentary Harry & Meghan as well as being a business partner on Meghan's lifestyle brand, As Ever.\nFive years ago, Harry and Meghan secured a lucrative contract thought to be worth $100million (\u00a374million) with Netflix after quitting as senior working royals in 2020.\nPrince Harry and Meghan at the ESPY Awards at Dolby Theatre in Hollywood in July 2024\nThe Duchess of Sussex in her Netflix series With Love, Meghan which came out in March\nThe renewed deal was described by the Sussexes - who made the announcement with Netflix - as 'extending their creative partnership' through Archewell Productions.\nBut the new terms are understood to be worth less for Harry and Meghan than their previous contract, according to a person familiar with the deal, and represent Netflix loosening its ties with the couple.\nLeading publicist Mark Borkowski told the Daily Mail: 'They have shot the golden goose of 2020 - more of a 'we'll call you' than 'here's the chequebook'. It's a first-look deal, which means Netflix gets first dibs but no obligation to bankroll every semi-royal whim.\n'I reckon Netflix is trimming fat industry-wide, so this is less carte blanche, more curated cameo.\n'They're still in business together - Meghan's. As ever brand and seasonal specials keep them in the Netflix shop window but make no mistake, this is a slimmed-down sequel to the blockbuster original. So Harry and Meghan's new Netflix chapter [is] less champagne budget, more Prosecco by the glass.'\nNetflix said Harry & Meghan, which came out in December 2022, was a huge success with a total of 23.4million views, making it the most viewed documentary ever through its first four days and reaching the English Top 10 TV list in 85 countries.\nBut With Love, Meghan failed to break into Netflix's top ten programmes - or even the top 300, as it ranked at number 383 in 2025 so far for the streaming giant with just 5.3million viewers across the globe since it was first broadcast in March.\nHowever, the Duchess said today: 'We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As ever brand.\nThe Netflix series With Love, Meghan is the most recent television release by the Sussexes\nNetflix said Harry & Meghan, which came out in 2022, was a huge success with a total of 23.4million views, making it the most viewed documentary ever through its first four days\n'My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.'\nBela Bajaria, Netflix's chief content officer, said: 'Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere.\n'The response to their work speaks for itself - Harry & Meghan gave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of our most-watched documentary series.\n'More recently, fans have been inspired by With Love, Meghan, with products from the new As ever line consistently selling out in record time.\n'We're excited to continue our partnership with Archewell Productions and to entertain our members together.'\nBrand and culture expert Nick Ede said: '[Netflix] know that with Meghan and Harry there will always be interest and they won't want to lose them to a rival streamer so this is a good way of keeping them as part of the Netflix family but not spending as much as they did previously, when only two of the content that was created were real winners for the streamer.'\nMr Ede added: 'I think that Polo and Heart of Invictus were pretty niche shows and didn't rate well. They have probably seen the slate that archewell has created for their future productions and pitches are interesting and may be developed more for the streaming service.'\nAs Ever is Meghan's lifestyle brand which also sells cookie mix, herb tea, flower sprinkles and jams \u2013 and launched a new Napa Valley ros\u00e9 wine last Friday.\nIn March the Duchess launched her new podcast series 'Confessions Of A Female Founder' with Lemonada Media, which included an interview with Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles.\nMeghan's Archetypes series about female stereotypes in 2022 ran for just one series, and was part of the Sussexes' previous multi-million-pound deal with Spotify, which ended the year after.\nLast month a Netflix source claimed Harry and Meghan's hopes of a new Netflix deal were 'dead' after Polo and With Love, Meghan both flopped in the ratings.\nThe insider was quoted as saying: 'This deal is dead. She had everything going for her - name, platform, press - and the numbers were dismal.\n'They're just waiting for the credits to roll. They're letting it expire without drama. There's no appetite for anything new.'"

It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d\nMaluma, who has a 1-year-old daughter, Paris, doubled down by saying he would never do that as a father.\n\u201cYou\u2019re waving them around like they\u2019re a toy,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat baby doesn\u2019t want to be there, for real. I\u2019m telling you with all love and respect, now that I\u2019m a father\u2026 would never bring them to a concert. For the next time, be a bit more aware.\u201d\nWhile the crowd cheered in support of Maluma\u2019s remarks, some critics rushed to social media to slam the singer for making the ordeal a public spectacle.\n\u201cEvery mother knows what she has to do with her child. If not, they should limit the capacity to a certain age. What\u2019s the point in putting her through that in front of so many people?\u201d one person wrote on TikTok.\nAnother added, \u201cWas it necessary to embarrass her while he was receiving applause?\u201d\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re right about what you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to shame a parent in front of thousands of people,\u201d a third wrote.\nHowever, other fans applauded the singer, whose real name is Juan Luis Londo\u00f1o Arias, for voicing his concerns mid-show.\n\u201cWho would even think of taking a baby? If you have a baby and no one to leave it with, then you don\u2019t go. I totally agree with him,\u201d one fan wrote.\nAnother added, \u201cMaluma is right, it\u2019s not a place for a baby. The organizers and security are the ones really responsible. They shouldn\u2019t have let a baby in.\u201d\nThe singer is currently on his \u201c+Pretty +Dirty World Tour,\u201d which continues on across Latin America, the US and Europe.\nMaluma became a dad in March 2024 after welcoming a daughter with his girlfriend, Susana G\u00f3mez.\nSpeaking to Allure about fatherhood, the \u201cBorr\u00f3 Cassette\u201d hitmaker admitted that \u201ceverything changed\u201d once he became a dad.\n\u201cI love it. Now, I wake up every day with the desire to conquer the world. I know I have to f\u2013king kill it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor Paris, nothing is impossible. You have to lead by example. I go to bed every night that I can at 9 and wake up at 5:30 to hit the gym because I want to be healthy. You want to live forever for your kids. I want to make her proud.\u201d"

They came out with their five-part \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d docuseries in 2022, while Harry\u2019s \u201cPolo\u201d doc \u2014 which also got a scathing reception from critics \u2014 dropped in December 2024.\nHeritage said Markle\u2019s new show \u201cprobably won\u2019t turn things around, unless the broader public suddenly develops a hankering for long-form television programmes about a woman filling children\u2019s party bags with seeds and manuka honey.\u201d\nHe also called the former actress \u201cthirsty\u201d and her show \u201cjoyless.\u201d\nHeritage added, \u201cNobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling.\u201d\nRadio Times columnist Caroline Frost wrote that Markle failed to \u201creimagine the genre of lifestyle programming\u201d with her new series, while the Telegraph editor Anita Singh said the show is \u201can exercise in narcissism, filled with extravagant brunches, celebrity pals and business plugs.\u201d\nThe Independent writer Katie Rosseinsky gave \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d a one-star review and called the series \u201cqueasy and exhausting.\u201d\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of the British talk show \u201cLoose Women,\u201d panelist Jane Moore called Markle\u2019s show \u201cboring\u201d and said she \u201cfound my attention drifting\u201d when she tuned in.\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re not interested in homemaking stuff, you\u2019d watch it to learn more about their house. You don\u2019t see their house, it\u2019s a rented house down the road,\u201d Moore explained, noting that Markle didn\u2019t film the show inside her and Harry\u2019s $14 million Montecito mansion.\nThe show isn\u2019t being received well on social media, either.\n\u201cBailed after the first 15 minutes of With Love Meghan. Empty, vein, fake. Vomit inducing,\u201d one person wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\u201cThe new Meghan show is boring! The desperation is palpable. I am not a Meghan fan but it\u2019s sad,\u201d another fan said.\nA third critical tweet read, \u201c\u2018With Love, Meghan\u2019 is a masterclass in how to waste Netflix money. What do we get? Her pretending to be relatable, and trades banalities with B-list guests like Mindy Kaling. This isn\u2019t a lifestyle show, it\u2019s a 40 minute infomercial for her ego!\u201d\nIn the first episode of \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d Markle preps her guest room (not in her real home) for her friend, makeup artist Daniel Martin. They make pasta together and Markle strangely calls spaghetti \u201cnoodles.\u201d Martin also brings up Markle and Harry\u2019s lemon cake he got to taste test before their 2018 wedding.\nThe pair also reflect on Markle\u2019s \u201cSuits\u201d days and how she only had an agent, and no publicist, at the time.\nIn Episode 2, Kaling, 45, joins Markle in the kitchen. The comedian jokes that she thought she was ranked alongside other celebs because the jam that Markle sent out in the mail was numbered from 1 to 50.\n\u201cShe just taught me it\u2019s Le Cree-say and not Le Crew-set,\u201d Kaling says about Markle\u2019s Le Creuset dish at one point. \u201cSome of us have been to Europe!\u201d\nThe former actress chimes in: \u201cI could be wrong!\u201d\nThe next two episodes feature Markle making donuts and enjoying beer in a glass with one guest, and making sun tea and going on a hike with her friend Delfi.\n\u201cSun tea\u2019s something I\u2019ve been making for a very long time. I made it as a kid and now I make it with my own kids. It\u2019s really easy. It\u2019s just tea,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you can use nice silk bags. Get lots of loose tea bags, whichever ones you prefer. And you let it steep with the warmth of the sun.\u201d\n\u201cI have to impress this man. Not just with my donuts, with my tidiness, with my kitchen savvy, my cleanliness,\u201d she adds at one point about her friend.\nIn Episode 5, Markle writes \u201cbready or not \u2026 here I crumb\u201d on a chalkboard \u2014 but it appears she had to write over the board after seemingly making a mistake.\nIn Episode 6, Markle makes a veggie platter and says, \u201cWhen things are presented in a nice way, I often find people smile and they feel happy. It\u2019s not that deep, but it is thoughtful. Even for our kids, I think what\u2019s been so nice and why they love eating vegetables it because it looks colorful and fun.\u201d\nIn the eighth and final episode, Markle gives a speech to a group of loved ones including Harry and her mother, Doria Ragland, and says, \u201cI just want to raise a glass to you guys.\u201d\nThe mom of two also appears to make a subtle dig at the royal family in front of Harry.\n\u201cThis feels like a new chapter that I\u2019m so excited that I\u2019m able to share and I\u2019ve been able to learn from all of you,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of that is part of that creativity that I\u2019ve missed so much, so thank you for loving me so much and celebrating with me.\u201d\nMarkle delayed the release of \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d by several weeks due to the LA wildfires. The night before the show dropped, she surprised fans at a screening in NYC \u2014 and a few of them showed off their \u201cAs Ever\u201d tattoos in honor of Markle\u2019s new lifestyle brand.\n\u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d is streaming now on Netflix."

They have a movie in development; a [scripted] series that they\u2019re working on. So all very early development, with a movie, a TV show and a couple of unscripted shows. But yeah, the movie\u2019s great.\u201d\nThe couple\u2019s previous collaboration with Netflix \u2014 a docuseries titled \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d \u2014 proved to be a massive hit after its release in Dec. 2022.\nThey also executive-produced Netflix\u2019s docuseries \u201cLive to Lead,\u201d as well as \u201cHeart of Invictus,\u201d a documentary following athletes preparing for the Harry-founded Invictus Games, which hit the streamer in August 2023.\nAlso that month, author Carley Fortune confirmed Archewell is adapting her romance novel \u201cMeet Me at the Lake\u201d for Netflix."

She filed for divorce in 2020, with the exes fighting over custody of their two children, daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9.\nThe divorce was settled in 2022, with Clarkson getting primary custody of their kids and Blackstock walking away with $115,000 per month in spousal support until January 2024 and a monthly amount of $45,600 in child support.\nBlackstock, who was Reba McEntire\u2019s former stepson, was also dad to daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, from his marriage to his first wife, Melissa Ashworth. He became a grandpa in 2022 when Savannah welcomed her son, Lake.\nFollowing Blackstock\u2019s death, a source told People that Clarkson is \u201cdevastated\u201d for her children.\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d the insider said. \u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy. It became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well. She\u2019s been devastated for the kids.\u201d\nClarkson missed 10 episodes of her NBC talk show earlier this year while Blackstock\u2019s health was worsening.\n\u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d is set to return for its seventh season this fall, while Clarkson\u2019s residency is slated to resume in November."
