  "title": "US government reportedly in talks to take stake in Intel",
  "description": "Following Trump\u2019s meeting with Intel's CEO, the administration is now in talks to take a stake the company.",
  "content": "Intel\u2019s stock spiked late in trading today after reports that the Trump administration is in talks to take a stake in the company. The news follows Trump\u2019s recent call for the ouster of CEO Lip-Bu Tan and a subsequent meeting between the two.\n\nFollowing deals with Nvidia and AMD, Trump now eyes Intel\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, the Trump administration is in discussions to take a stake in Intel, in a bid to \u201chelp shore up Intel\u2019s planned factory hub in Ohio,\u201d which was once billed as the future largest chipmaking facility in the world, but has suffered multiple setbacks and has now been pushed into the 2030s.\n\nIntel\u2019s stock, which had gained 7.38% during the day, is currently climbing another 3.2% in after-hours trading.\n\nBloomberg says that the deal, still in the early stages, would see the US government pay for the stake, with details still being worked out. Here are Ryan Gould, Josh Wingrove, and Liana Baker, who broke the story:\n\nThe deal would help shore up Intel\u2019s planned factory hub in Ohio, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The company had once promised to turn that site into the world\u2019s largest chipmaking facility, though it\u2019s been repeatedly delayed. The size of the potential stake isn\u2019t clear.\n\nThe talks seem to be a direct result of a meeting earlier this week between President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, which came after Trump publicly called for Tan\u2019s ouster.\n\nAt the time, he said the executive was \u201chighly CONFLICTED,\u201d which was attributed to the fact that before joining Intel, Tan used to lead Cadence Design, a firm which just pleaded guilty in an investigation by the Justice Department over charges of \u201cselling its chip-design products to a Chinese military university,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal\u2019s description.\n\nBloomberg also says that Intel declined to comment on the potential deal, but said in a statement that it\u2019s \u201cdeeply committed to supporting President Trump\u2019s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership.\u201d The White House hasn\u2019t commented at all, but if history is anything to go by, that may change sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat do you think of this potential deal? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Last week, President Trump called for the dismissal of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan over \u201chighly CONFLICTED\u201d ties to China, further escalating an already difficult situation for the executive.\nToday, following a meeting, Trump appeared to soften his stance, even if partially.\nA quick recap\nBefore joining Intel, Tan worked as CEO for Cadence Design Systems, a firm that just pleaded guilty to an investigation by the Justice Department over charges of \u201cselling its chip-design products to a Chinese military university,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal\u2019s description.\nTo make matters worse, Tan was also the subject of a Reuters investigation, which found that he had \u201cinvested in hundreds of Chinese tech firms, including at least eight with links to the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u201d.\nMeanwhile, inside Intel, Tan\u2019s relationship with the board had grown increasingly strained, given his sweeping cuts to projects, personnel, and long-term plans since taking over as CEO.\nWhen President Trump called for his dismissal last week, many assumed it would push Intel to a new breaking point. Yet despite internal tensions, the company publicly stood by its CEO.\nTan also sent a letter to employees reaffirming his commitment to the U.S. and Intel and pledged to work with the administration to clear the air. That\u2019s what today\u2019s meeting was about.\nTan appears to have won this round, but the hard part may not be over\nAs noted by Bloomberg, Trump appears to have come out of the meeting with a much more optimistic view of the executive, according to a post he made on Truth Social:\n\u201dI met with Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, of Intel, along with Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent. The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story.\u201d\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Tan is in the clear:\n\u201cMr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d\nThis suggests that the administration still hopes to strike some sort of oversight deal with Intel (much like it has also been pursuing with NVIDIA and AMD) to ensure that, regardless of what Tan claims, neither he nor the company ends up favoring China.\nWhile neither Trump nor Intel (who has yet to comment publicly on the meeting) has revisited the subject of Tan\u2019s dismissal, the executive\u2019s biggest challenge to keep his job may still lie ahead, depending on how he navigates the issues that were already piling up before the White House got involved.\nAirPods deals on Amazon\n- AirPods Max, USB-C Charging: $479.99 ($549 off)\n- AirPods Pro 2, USB-C Charging: $169 ($80 off)\n- AirPods 4 USB-C Charging: $99 (was $129)\n- AirPods 4, USB-C and Wireless Charging: $148.99 (was $179)\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

This development follows Trump's recent call for the ouster of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who has been criticized for his ties to China. Despite internal tensions, Tan's position appears to have stabilized for now, as Trump expressed a more optimistic view of him after a recent meeting.",
