  "title": "Liquid AI wants to give smartphones small, fast AI that can see with new LFM2-VL model",
  "description": "Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.",
  "content": "Liquid AI has released LFM2-VL, a new generation of vision-language foundation models designed for efficient deployment across a wide range of hardware \u2014 from smartphones and laptops to wearables and embedded systems.\n\nThe models promise low-latency performance, strong accuracy, and flexibility for real-world applications.\n\nLFM2-VL builds on the company\u2019s existing LFM2 architecture, extending it into multimodal processing that supports both text and image inputs at variable resolutions.\n\nAccording to Liquid AI, the models deliver up to twice the GPU inference speed of comparable vision-language models, while maintaining competitive performance on common benchmarks.\n\n\u201cEfficiency is our product,\u201d wrote Liquid AI co-founder and CEO Ramin Hasani in a post on X announcing the new model family:\n\nTwo variants for different needs\n\u2022 LFM2-VL-450M \u2014 a hyper-efficient model with less than half a billion parameters (internal settings) aimed at highly resource-constrained environments.\n\u2022 LFM2-VL-1.6B \u2014 a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.\n\nBoth variants process images at native resolutions up to 512\u00d7512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.\n\nFor larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.\n\nLiquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.\n\nThe company\u2019s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.\n\nUnlike traditional architectures, Liquid\u2019s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.\n\nIn July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nLEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid\u2019s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB\u2014small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.\n\nIts companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI\u2019s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company\u2019s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.\n\nThe projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.\n\nUsers can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.\n\nThe models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nIn inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024\u00d71024 image and short prompt.\n\nLFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.\n\nThe models are released under a custom \u201cLFM1.0 license\u201d. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.\n\nThe company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nWith LFM2-VL, Liquid AI aims to make high-performance multimodal AI more accessible for on-device and resource-limited deployments, without sacrificing capability.",

      "text": "Today, we release LFM2-VL, our first series of vision-language foundation models. These multimodal models are designed for low-latency and device-aware deployment. LFM2-VL extends the LFM2 family of open-weight Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) into the vision-language space, supporting both text and image inputs with variable resolutions.\nLFM2-VL offers a practical and versatile solution for various device environments, ranging from phones, laptops, and single-GPU instances to wearables and other embedded devices. Our models achieve great performance on vision-language tasks while offering significant efficiency gains, with up to 2x inference speedups on GPU compared to existing models.\nLFM2-VL comes in two variants with the hyper-efficient LFM2-VL-450M for highly resource-constrained settings, and the more capable but still lightweight LFM2-VL-1.6B. It offers an efficient solution that is integrated into the open-source ecosystem, as well as LEAP for customization and multi-platform edge deployment.\nHighlights on LFM2-VL\n- New efficient models based on LFM2: LFM2-VL-450M and LFM2-VL-1.6B, designed for resource-constrained environments\n- 2\u00d7 faster inference speed on GPUs compared to existing VLMs while maintaining competitive accuracy\n- Flexible architecture with user-tunable speed-quality tradeoffs at inference time\n- Native resolution processing up to 512\u00d7512 with intelligent patch-based handling for larger images, avoiding upscaling and distortion\nArchitecture\nLFM2-VL consists of three main components: a language model backbone, a vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.\nFor the language model tower, LFM2-VL builds upon the LFM2 backbone, inheriting from either LFM2-1.2B (for LFM2-VL-1.6B) or LFM2-350M (for LFM2-VL-450M).\nFor the vision tower, LFM2-VL uses SigLIP2 NaFlex encoders to convert input images into token sequences. Two variants are implemented:\n- Shape-optimized (400M) for more fine-grained vision capabilities for LFM2-VL-1.6B\n- Base (86M) for fast image processing for LFM2-VL-450M\nThe encoder processes images at their native resolution up to 512\u00d7512 pixels, efficiently handling smaller images without upscaling and supporting non-standard aspect ratios without distortion.\nLarger images are split into non-overlapping square patches of 512\u00d7512 each, preserving detail. In LFM2-VL-1.6B, the model also receives a thumbnail (a small, downscaled version of the original image capturing the overall scene) to enhance global context understanding and alignment. Special tokens mark each patch\u2019s position and indicate the thumbnail\u2019s start.\nFor the multimodal projector, we implement a 2-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle to reduce image token count. This allowed us to increase throughput without major quality loss. For example, a 256\u00d7384 image generates 96 image tokens, a 384\u00d7680 image produces 240 tokens, and a 1000\u00d73000 image yields 1,020 tokens.\nThis flexible architecture enables users to adjust the speed-quality tradeoff during inference without retraining. Both the maximum number of image tokens (which controls effective input resolution) and the number of image patches are user-tunable, allowing performance optimization for specific use cases and latency requirements.\nTraining\nLFM2-VL builds on the LFM2 base model. Vision and language capabilities are then fused during a joint mid-training phase, where the ratio of text to image data is gradually adjusted from 95% to 30%.\nThis is followed by a joint supervised fine-tuning stage with an emphasis on image understanding. Vision training data comes from a combination of large-scale open-source datasets and in-house synthetic vision datasets, selected to balance coverage across diverse tasks. Overall, LFM2-VL is trained on the order of 100 billion multimodal tokens.\nEvaluation\nBenchmarks\nWe evaluate LFM2-VL on several public vision-language benchmarks. The model shows excellent performance in high-resolution image understanding and multimodal instruction following, while maintaining strong performance in other tasks.\nInference speed\nOur models excel in inference speed, achieving the fastest performance among all competitors on GPU. We evaluate LFM2-VL in a typical workload consisting of one 1024x1024 image, paired with a short prompt such as \u201cDescribe this image in detail,\u201d and generate 100 output tokens, under default settings for each model. In these conditions, LFM2-VL runs up to 2\u00d7 faster than the fastest comparable model, while delivering competitive accuracy.\nBuild with LFM2-VL\nLFM2-VL models are available today on Hugging Face with example finetuning code in Colab. We\u2019re releasing them under an open license, which is based on Apache 2.0. Our license allows you to freely use LFM2-VL models for academic and research purposes. You can also use the models commercially if you\u2019re a smaller company (under $10M revenue). Above this threshold, you should contact us (sales@liquid.ai) to obtain a commercial license. You can get more details about our license here.\nSince LFM2-VL models are designed for on-device efficiency, we recommend testing them privately and locally on your device. They are currently compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL. We are actively working with the community to integrate LFM2-VL into other popular inference and finetuning frameworks.\nIf you are interested in custom solutions with edge deployment, please contact our sales team at sales@liquid.ai."
