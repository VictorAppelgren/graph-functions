      "feedback": "The draft is on the right topic (ust10y) but drifts into crypto‑flow lore and generic “strong structural drivers” language that weakens the causal chain. Tighten it by: 1) explicitly mapping the view to the ust10y handle with a signed range (+20‑30 bp to 4.0‑4.2 %) and citing OGK8WLL69; 2) confining all discussion to Fed policy, term‑premium dynamics, and the 10‑year curve, dropping any mention of crypto unless it is a direct driver of the yield (and then cite OGK8WLL69 for that link); 3) adding a concrete catalyst window (Sept 25 2025 Fed meeting, Aug 2 CPI, Aug 15 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening) and assigning probabilities (e.g., 80 % chance of the 20‑30 bp rise, 15 % chance of a Fed hike that reverses the move, 5 % chance of a regulatory shock that erodes the demand floor); 4) replacing vague “moderate confidence” with a numeric confidence score (e.g., 70 % confidence) and backing it with the cited evidence; 5) removing any sentences that do not contain an inline citation or that reference non‑canonical handles. This will produce a concise, evidence‑anchored view that satisfies the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements.",
