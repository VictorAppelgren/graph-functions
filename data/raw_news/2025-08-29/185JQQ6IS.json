  "title": "Coach Prime Says Positivity Is Key To Success And Good Health",
  "description": "After what he calls a \"touch and go\" summer health scare, Coach Prime touts positivity an healthy choices for him and the Colorado Buffaloes",
  "content": "In late July, football legend and University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders revealed that during the offseason, he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer and had also been successfully treated for his condition.\n\nI spoke with the Hall of Fame player and Florida State icon a week ago over Zoom, and, as one would expect, Coach Prime\u2019s outlook was positive and thankful, and his conversations transparent.\n\n\u201cMy health journey is very important to me, and as you know, it was touch and go for a minute,\u201d he said.\n\nCertainly, Sanders has had his share of health challenges, especially for someone as active as he is.\n\nIn late 2021, while coaching at Jackson State, Sanders developed blood clots in his left leg and underwent surgery and hospitalization for over three weeks. His treatments reportedly included having two toes amputated. In the following weeks, Sanders began rehab while continuing to coach from Colorado\u2019s sidelines.\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, another surgery addressed blood clots near his groin, followed by some ongoing nerve pain and swelling in his left leg and foot the following spring.\n\nYet, after a 9-4 second season and a bowl game appearance with Colorado last year, things are looking up for the ever-positive and magnetic Sanders.\n\nSanders just turned 58 in early August, and he said it\u2019s not just visits to the doctor or fitness regimens that are top of mind right now. He said consuming the right foods is a big part of maintaining one\u2019s health.\n\nEarlier this month, Sanders signed on as a spokesperson for California Almonds and has been speaking on the topics of health and nutrition, while gearing up for the 2025 NCAA Football season.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s vital that I eat the right things and employ the right relationships to remain health and remain fundamentally sound. I want to keep my peace, my joy, my love,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cand almonds help me do that. And it keeps my skin looking fly.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cI just gotta be really conscious of what I do, what I eat, and who I\u2019m around.\u201d\n\nSanders also talked about his younger years in the 1980s and 1990s as a top-flight athlete, during a time at the end of the 20th century in which young people weren\u2019t thought to have many concerns about what they ate. He hints that as a younger athlete, his fitness regimen and working out were it.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, you did whatever. We weren\u2019t as health-conscious or as savvy as we are now.\u201d Sanders, who was sitting in the head coach\u2019s office at CU when I spoke to him, said that \u201cright now, we have almonds around the complex,\u201d also adding that his players, or \u201cthe kids can grab (them) throughout the day,\" including before, during, and after practice.\n\nRelated story: Coach Prime wants young people to save and invest\n\n\u201cNow, everyone has resources, and what we have at CU is to give the kids the best. We want our players to have the best, and what we have in play is based on what they want to achieve in life.\u201d\n\nSanders stated that mindful eating and proper nutrition are integral to the University of Colorado\u2019s football program and other athletics programs. However, Sanders believes that helping all young athletes make better choices on and off the field is largely about relationships.\n\n\u201cYoung people are not simply going to listen to anyone, but they take advice when you have a relationship. Not only that, but if you are taking the right steps in life and they deem you successful, they\u2019re going to try to imitate and emulate what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nTomorrow night, the Buffaloes take on Georgia Tech at home, followed by another home game against Delaware, September 6.\n\nThen, it\u2019s deep into the Big 12 action, with Colorado taking on Houston on September 12, followed by other conference clashes versus BYU on September 27, as well as TCU and No. 22-ranked Iowa State in early October.\n\nSanders explained that it\u2019s not only his personal success as a player and public figure that helps motivate his team.\n\n\"We have three Hall of Famers coaching here, all of whom have had success in the NFL. And we\u2019re trying to build that road map for (CU\u2019s players) in that direction.\n\nIn addition to him as head coach, the Buffaloes also boast Marshall Faulk as running backs coach and Super Bowl LV winner Warren Sapp as the team\u2019s senior quality control analyst. There\u2019s also the legend of the late Bill McCartney, a College Football Hall of Fame inductee, who led the Buffaloes to their last national championship in 1990.\n\nThat said, Sanders also speaks very highly of his players.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have anybody around here going to jail, getting into trouble, or abusing anybody. Everyone around here is doing the right things and making the right choices, and I\u2019m grateful for that.",

      "text": "After supercharging the University of Colorado\u2019s football program and posting a 9-4 season last year in the very competitive Big 12 conference, you could say that things are on the upswing for Deion Sanders, aka \u201cCoach Prime.\u201d But he\u2019s always been about successes, both large and small.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Famer, ex-baseball pro, beloved media personality, and head coach is apt to talk these days about his early days in sports and how different the mindset is today among promising athletes compared to the athletes of the 1980s and '90s.\n\u201cThings are different now in that people are not waiting to graduate and go into the workforce to acquire revenue. You have a large number of athletes coming out of high school, generating a tremendous amount of opportunity,\u201d Sanders said last Wednesday in our interview via Zoom.\nHe hinted that not only NIL but also the rise of social media and the social media influencer as a new economic force has changed the game for the young and ambitious.\n\u201cYou have so many different ways to access finances that you have to know what to do with it before you really attain it,\u201d Sanders added.\nHe admits that today\u2019s young professional athletes and Generation Z as a whole may be more enterprising, if not savvy with money, but says times were different during his playing career.\nThe affable Sanders talked about his own experiences as a young person with aspirations to make it big in sports. And also that like much of the American populace, he got little advice and no formal education on financial matters of any kind.\n\u201cI used to keep my money in a shoe, man, and also in a shoebox. I was young and dumb, and nobody in my generation had anything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I was the first person in my whole family to go to college.\u201d\nSanders mentioned that after his junior year at Florida State, he signed a contract with the New York Yankees while planning the rest of his future and the second move toward the 1989 NFL Draft. A lot of opportunity was on the table for Sanders, then 22. But the upcoming stress of financial responsibility, he said, loomed.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any financial literacy and didn\u2019t even think of it. Back then, (as an athlete) you wanted to be a millionaire but had no idea what to do with it,\" Sanders said.\nFor that reason, Sanders has decided to increase his already wide visibility and take on a new role. And not in sports but as a financial mentor to a nation of ambitious young people. From now on, you can call Sanders \u201cCoach Chime.\u201d\nThis week, it was announced that Sanders has joined up with Chime Financial, the San Francisco\u2013based financial technology company known for its fee-free banking services. Sanders is part of Chime\u2019s new campaign aimed at helping everyday people build credit, save money, and feel more confident in their financial decisions.\n\u201cThank God we have a company now that invests in our youth,\" Sanders said, \u201cand invests in the fact that people want to know more and know the intricate details about finances.\u201d He added that Chime aims to educate young people on how they can make the most of money. \u201dI\u2019m happy to be a part of working with them.\"\nVIDEO: \u201cCoach Chime\u201d says wealth isn\u2019t built overnight.\nAs part of the partnership, Coach Chime is also a mentor in the Chime Community Changemakers program, which supports grassroots organizations working to break down financial barriers in various communities across the country.\nThe Changemakers program specifically works in areas like workforce development, entrepreneurship support, and utilizing nontraditional education to tackle the debt crisis that faces a lot of American consumers.\nChanneling his inner coach, Sanders said that it\u2019s not just about hitting big goals, such as buying a house, but also celebrating the small wins along the way.\nSanders also said that athletics don\u2019t have anything directly to do with the overall mission. He said he knows that there are millions of young people out there who don\u2019t follow college or professional sports and who are not athletes but have the same level of aspirations as he did professionally and financially.\n\u201cChime is much more than a banking app; it\u2019s a real partnership that helps people get ahead. And I like that. It does not just take sports to make money,\u201d Sanders explained. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people making money on the internet and people using Chime who\u2019ve never picked up a ball or glove or anything. Knowing what to do with revenue is the difference.\u201d\nHe also said that a lot of time in the landscape of sports media, \u201cwe hear about the ones who didn\u2019t make it. But we want to talk up the successes and create those stories from this wonderful company.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s paying down debt, building savings, or sticking to a budget, Sanders said that a good financial playbook is all about showing up every day and making progress. He underscores that the message is about celebrating progress, not perfection, and empowering people to talk openly about their financial journey, no matter how small the steps may seem.\nSanders also said he thinks his everyday role involves more than football. \u201cThis is what I bring into the work with our kids at Colorado all the time\u2014people to talk to them about financial literacy. How could you have a football or basketball coach but not have a financial coach?\u201d\nSanders described the Chime partnership with the kind of million-dollar enthusiasm he is known for: \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m happy. Because this is my heartbeat.\u201d"

      "text": "Detroit Lions lifer Barry Sanders is considered one of the greatest running backs in NFL history. Over a decade playing for the Detroit Lions (1989-1998), the 10-time Pro Bowler led the NFL in rushing yards four times, while also ushering his team to the postseason five times.\nSanders finished his NFL career with a rushing total of 15,269 yards and sits in fourth place on the NFL\u2019s list of All-Time Rushing Yards Leaders. Sanders was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.\nSince retirement, Sanders and his family have lived in the Detroit area and have been avid supporters of the Detroit Lions, now one of the league\u2019s best teams.\nYet, Sanders said that in mid-2024, during a college visit to the University of Toledo with his youngest son, Noah, a health scare changed his outlook on life.\n\u201cIt was a year ago, and I was ready to go on a recruiting trip with my son,\u201d Sanders said during our Zoom interview a week ago. \u201cThat day I woke and had this heartburn type of feeling in my chest.\u201d\nSanders said he continued his morning, trying to shake off the feeling and enjoy the day, adding, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what it possibly could be. I hadn\u2019t bumped anything or exercised yet that morning. I was just, like, man, what is this?\u201d\nThat day, Sanders was set to tour the campus and facilities at the University of Toledo. Noah Sanders graduated from Birmingham Groves High School this month and is committed to playing football for the Toledo Rockets, starting this fall.\n\u201cSince the school is just an hour away, I sent my son to campus and said, \u201dI\u2019m going to drive home. I\u2019m just not feeling good.\" After getting back home to Michigan in the early afternoon, Sanders wrestled with the idea of stopping into the hospital as a precaution.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go away, but it didn\u2019t worsen,\u201d Sanders said about the discomfort. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, but I figured\u2014let me just drive to the emergency room.\u201d\nOnce Sanders was at the hospital, he said no particular alarm bells went off. Yet, after conducting some routine tests and checking his vitals, the doctors performed a cardiac catheterization test, which involves injecting a special dye into the coronary arteries, followed by an X-ray to assess normal blood flow through the vessels or potential blockages.\n\u201cThey did tests. Blood pressure was fine. Heart rate was fine. But then, later, they looked my my enzymes, and said my enzyme count was high,\" Sanders said.\nCardiac enzyme tests, also known as biomarker tests, measure proteins released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. Such tests can indicate potential heart conditions, such as inflammation of heart muscles, or even a heart attack.\nAnd shortly after more analysis, doctors had notified Sanders that he had, indeed, had a heart attack.\n\u201cIt took me a second\u2014like, wow, are you serious?\u201d Sanders said.\nTaken aback by a heart attack\nSince that episode on Father\u2019s Day weekend last year, Sanders said that he\u2019s taken the opportunity to learn more about his condition as well as make changes.\n\u201cI still exercise and always have,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut now, I watch what I eat, and eat less. I definitely go on more walks, and listen to what my doctors tell me.\u201d\nBut Sanders, 56, decided not only to focus on his own health, but to go a step further. He said that shortly after his heart attack, he had heard that pharmaceutical company Amgen had been working on a television documentary about the very health concern Sanders face.\nVIDEO: Hall of Famer Barry Sanders narrates \u201cThe Making of a Heart Attack.\u201d\n\u201cI learned Amgen was doing a documentary called The Making of a Heart Attack,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cI decided I wanted to be a part of it, and learn everyone else\u2019s story, and tell my story.\u201d\nThe Making of a Heart Attack first aired on A&E, Saturday, June 14, 2025. The documentary explores the specifics of heart disease, the world\u2019s most widespread and costly health threat, affecting people all over the world. The film features real patient stories to raise awareness about cardiovascular disease and the role LDL-C, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, can play in heart attacks and strokes.\nRelated story: Mike Greenberg says taking care of your heart is huge\nThe documentary is also currently screening at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, in Cannes, France, until June 26.\nDr. Sara Collins, an interventional cardiologist based in Maryland, discussed the dangers of high cholesterol, particularly when combined with infrequent monitoring of everyday health risks.\n\u201cOne of the most important messages from Barry\u2019s journey is that cardiovascular risk isn\u2019t always obvious,\" Dr. Collins said. \"High LDL-C can exist without symptoms, which is why regular cholesterol testing and personalized lifestyle management and treatment are essential for preventing another heart event, no matter how healthy you feel.\u201d\nShe explained that people, especially those above the age of 40, should not assume they are 100% healthy merely because they have never experienced symptoms.\n\"Even after a first event, it\u2019s critical to know your LDL-C number and work with your doctor to ensure it's at an appropriate level, because the risk doesn\u2019t stop with recovery. Proactive management can be lifesaving.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have conversations about heart health,\" Sanders added, also saying, \u201cI hope (the documentary) will help a lot of people.\u201d\nThe Sanders-narrated documentary can be viewed for free at any time online.\nLions lifer and big fan\nSanders\u2019 favorite ball club, the Detroit Lions, has been on a tear the last few years. Last season, the Lions, led by head coach Dan Campbell, logged a 15-2 regular season record, the NFC\u2019s best. And although the Lions came up short in the postseason, after a 45-31 Divisional Playoff loss to Washington, Sanders calls them one of the NFL\u2019s best teams.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to follow them, and to see what Ford Field has become within our division, and the NFL. It\u2019s not a place where people can take it for granted that they are going to get a win,\u201d Sanders said.\nLast season, Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, tackle Penei Sewell, and punter Jack Fox went All-Pro, as the Lions led the NFC in offense, boasting an average of 409.5 yards per game and 4,474 total passing yards.\nThe Lions\u2019 defense also allowed only 20.1 yards per game by opponents, the fourth-best in the conference. Quarterback Jared Goff was also short-listed for the league\u2019s MVP Award.\n\u201cEveryone knows that now if you are playing the Lions, you\u2019re playing one of the toughest teams.\"\nSanders also points out that after a decade of missing the playoffs from 2002-2010, followed by another postseason drought from 2017-2022, Lions fans are not only resilient but some of the NFL\u2019s most enthusiastic fans.\n\"It\u2019s not uncommon for Lions fans, even when they\u2019re not at Ford Field, to take over the stadium. There\u2019s a feeling that is electric about the team. It\u2019s great to see.\u201d\n##\nRead Frye\u2019s recent interviews with Mike Greenberg and Deion Sanders."

      "text": "Sam Leavitt\u2019s last game of the 2024-2025 season was a New Year\u2019s Day thriller. Leavitt\u2019s Arizona State Sun Devils were down 17-3 in the first half of the Peach Bowl. But soon after the first moments of the second half, the Sun Devils had the high-flying Texas Longhorns on the ropes.\nBut Leavitt said he took nothing for granted, even if Texas, an SEC team, was thought of before the ref\u2019s first whistle as the odds-on favorites.\n\u201cWalking in that stadium as someone who was (initially) a red shirt freshman, not even supposed to be there, you take it in and really understand the moment,\u201d Leavitt said.\nThe Sun Devils outscored the Longhorns 21-7 in that second half, pushing the game into double overtime, thanks to a one-two punch from the 20-year-old quarterback and their ace running back, Cam Skattebo. Skattebo rushed for 143 yards and scored two touchdowns on 30 carries, while Leavitt provided plenty of air support, passing for 222 yards.\nDuring that game, the Sun Devils\u2019 defense also did its share, chasing Texas QB Quinn Ewers out of the pocket throughout the game and forcing Longhorns\u2019 kicker Bert Auburn to miss two of three field goals.\nIt all came down to the wire down to the wire in double overtime, when down 38-31, Leavitt and ASU made a march toward the endzone. Leavitt\u2019s and ASU\u2019s only turnover of the game came on a third inside the opposition\u2019s 20-yard line when Texas safety Andrew Mukuba boxed out intended receiver Melquan Stovall to pick off Leavitt\u2019s pass and end the game.\nShown on ESPN, the game was heralded as an \u201call-time classic,\u201d and the near upset of one of the SEC\u2019s top teams boosted both ASU\u2019s profile and Leavitt as one of college football\u2019s standout quarterbacks.\nI joked to Leavitt during our interview this summer that he and his Big 12 champion team not only played one of Arizona State\u2019s most memorable games, but almost made Matthew McConnaghey cry.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of him,\u201d Leavitt said of the Oscar Award-winning actor and Longhorns diehard. \u201cBut that would have been great.\u201d\nThat said, Leavitt says that while he and his team always intended to rise to the moment at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, they knew their opponents were no brush-off.\n\u201cI remember seeing the Texas player No. 95,\u201d he said of 6-foot-6, 325-pound defensive lineman Alfred Collins. \u201cI thought, \u2018that might be the biggest player I\u2019ve ever played against\u2019.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s Peach Bowl marked the Sun Devils\u2019 first major bowl game in over a decade. Last year, ASU football had just joined the Big 12 after leaving the PAC-12 and hadn\u2019t had a winning season since 2019. Their position as the No. 4 seed in the College Football Playoff (CFP) felt like new and exciting territory.\n\u201cYou look around at all the fans and the situation and really embrace it,\" Leavitt explained. \"Then you go back to it like any other game.\u201d\nLooking forward to this season, Leavitt said that Skattebo, now a player for the New York Giants, will be missed. But he acknowledged that the Sun Devils are ready to contend for another Big 12 title and much more.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not going to try to replace Skat\u2014he\u2019s a unique player you can\u2019t replace,\" Leavitt explained. \"But what great coaches do is make people play to their strengths, plus we have a bunch of guys who are good with the ball in their hands.\u201d\nLeavitt said that one of the reasons he wanted to come to Arizona State after spending his first year with the Michigan State Spartans was to work under Sun Devils head coach Kenny Dillingham.\nDillingham joined ASU in 2023 and is the first ASU alumnus to win the Sun Devils\u2019 head coaching role. Projected to finish dead last in the Big 12 last season, Dillingham and ASU instead won the Big 12 Championship.\n\u201cI learned a lot at Michigan State, watched a lot of tape there, learned the college game, and all that game gave me a lot of confidence coming in,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut part of the reason I wanted to come here was because of what Coach Dillingham had with other quarterbacks, like Bo Nix.\u201d\nDillingham held the roles of both offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Oregon, prior to being tapped by Arizona State as head coach.\n\u201cSome of the biggest things,\u201d Leavitt said he takes from Dillingham\u2019s coaching are, \u201csituational football and understanding when to take risks, plus my role and how to treat people. He teaches you how to interact with your peers better.\u201d\nVIDEO: Sam Leavitt on fire at last season\u2019s Peach Bowl versus Texas.\nLeavitt knew that after his first year at Michigan State, entering the transfer portal might bring him to a new team and a new challenge, but that earning a starting quarterback role was his ultimate goal.\n\u201cIt was about showing the team I\u2019m a hard worker, showing who I am as a competitor,\" Leavitt said. \"Then, once you win the job, it\u2019s about playing well.\u201d\nRisk is a big part of the Sun Devils\u2019 comfort zone\nLeavitt says that now, after such a successful run last season, he feels like the possibilities are endless for Arizona State. But also, he thinks his coaching staff and ASU\u2019s system are built in a way in which he can play his game to its fullest.\n\u201cAt times when it\u2019s, say, third down and 8, you might take more risk knowing that if you take a sack, who cares\u2014you\u2019re not going to go on 4th and long,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d\nOverall, Leavitt hints that now, like other perennial contenders such as Oregon and even Alabama, the Sun Devils\u2019 style of football is not a particularly conservative one. But her said in order to thrive in risky situations, the Sun Devils focus on fundamentals and team chemistry.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re out there, we treat third down like second down. People might say we play risky, but we know certain times like those are the game changers. And we know how to do it.\u201d\nESPN just named Leavitt among its \u201c40 most important players in college football in 2025\u201d last week, also calling Leavitt one of the three most important players in the Big 12 title race. Meanwhile, there have been whispers from Steelers fans and writers hoping that the 6-foot-2 sophomore might become their next franchise quarterback.\nJoining Leavitt on the field are a number of exciting players, including wide receiver Jaren Hamilton, a transfer who came in after playing only a few times over two seasons at Alabama. There\u2019s also rookie Jai\u2019Storm Knight on the offensive line, who will be instrumental in closing gaps and providing protection, to provide more opportunity for Leavitt to shine.\nSports Illustrated has predicted that ASU will win another Big 12 title and easily secure a spot in the NCAA postseason.\nBut Leavitt thinks that No. 11-ranked Arizona State\u2019s best scenario will involve the Sun Devils playing their own relentless, fast-paced way, while facing down other Top 25-ranked Big 12 teams like BYU, Kansas State, Texas Tech, and Iowa State.\n\u201cThis season, we\u2019ll focus on opening up things, with a lot more controlled passing,\u201d Leavitt said. \"And there are some new things on my task list that I\u2019m pretty excited about for this season.\u201d\nRead Frye\u2019s interviews with Coach Prime and Barry Sanders.\n##"
