  "description": "It\u2019s no secret the Trump Administration loves bitcoin and crypto. And as news this week from the Department of Commerce shows, that enthusiasm is now",
  "content": "For businesses, blockchain adoption hinges on balancing cost, speed and confidentiality: while it can boost trust and automation in decentralized ecosystems, in many enterprise cases traditional databases remain faster, cheaper and more practical.\n\nThe move highlights blockchain\u2019s core strength of verifiability, rather than efficiency, making it valuable in contexts where multiple parties with conflicting incentives must share trusted data (e.g., supply chains, compliance, cross-border trade).\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced it will publish GDP data on nine major blockchains starting with July 2025 figures, aiming to make economic statistics immutable, transparent and tamper evident.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret the Trump Administration loves bitcoin and crypto. And as news this week from the Department of Commerce shows, that enthusiasm is now spilling over across the rest of the government.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nOn Thursday (Aug. 28), the Commerce Department announced that it will begin posting real gross domestic product (GDP) data on blockchain, beginning with the July 2025 data, to the following nine blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS and Optimism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only fitting that the Commerce Department and President Donald Trump, the Crypto-President, publicly release economic statistical data on the blockchain,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in a statement. \u201cWe are making America\u2019s economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before, cementing our role as the blockchain capital of the world. And everybody has to admit that 3.3% GDP growth is impressive.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the move might sound like a symbolic flourish meant to placate Washington\u2019s emerging pro-crypto bloc. But dig deeper and it raises a serious question for corporate leaders: if the federal government is anchoring its data to blockchain, should businesses consider doing the same?\n\nRead more: Wall Street Moves On-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global\n\nDecoding Whether Blockchain Is Buzzword or Advantage\n\nFor the Commerce Department, publishing GDP on blockchain is less about crypto evangelism than about experimenting with verifiability at scale. Economic data is a cornerstone of policymaking and market forecasting. Anchoring official numbers to multiple public chains ensures that the figures are accessible in a tamper-evident way, reducing the risk of manipulation or misinformation. If a number were altered on an agency website, blockchain-anchored records would reveal the discrepancy immediately.\n\nThat assurance resonates in an age when trust in institutions is fragile and digital disinformation proliferates. Yet the government\u2019s embrace is not a wholesale migration to blockchain, but a limited distribution method and an additional channel for publishing data, not a replacement for existing systems.\n\nThe central advantage of blockchain is not speed, efficiency or even decentralization. It is verifiability. Data written to a chain can be independently checked, time-stamped and confirmed against consensus mechanisms. For sensitive business processes such as auditing, compliance reporting or intellectual property rights and more, this attribute can be powerful.\n\nFor every company contemplating blockchain adoption, the decision boils down to economics. Blockchains, particularly public ones like Ethereum, impose transaction fees and latency that traditional databases do not. Permissioned, private blockchains can address performance issues but often recreate the same trust dynamics as conventional systems, except with added complexity.\n\nThat means blockchain is best suited for scenarios where multiple parties who do not fully trust one another must share data. If your business already controls the data environment, blockchain may add little value. But if you operate in ecosystems rife with conflicting incentives \u2014 supplier networks, financial consortia, cross-border logistics \u2014 blockchain\u2019s tamper-proof guarantees may justify the cost.\n\nSee also: The Stablecoin Debate for CFOs Isn\u2019t Around Yield; It\u2019s Around Plumbing\n\nWhat\u2019s missing, at least so far, is a clear case for blockchain as a default business database. Enterprises run on speed, reliability, and cost efficiency. Cloud databases from Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure excel at those metrics. Blockchain, by design, sacrifices performance for resilience and verifiability. That trade-off is valuable in certain scenarios but unnecessary in many others.\n\nFor sensitive or proprietary business data, blockchain is often overkill. Most firms need to balance transparency with confidentiality. Posting supply-chain information or compliance certificates to a public ledger can invite scrutiny not only from regulators but also from competitors. Private blockchains, which restrict access to authorized participants, offer a middle ground, but at that point the system begins to resemble a conventional database with extra overhead.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped the marketplace from responding with innovations. Earlier this August, GoodWares debuted what it calls the first blockchain-powered enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for eCommerce.\n\nElsewhere, Google Cloud is positioning its own Layer 1 blockchain as a neutral infrastructure layer for use by financial institutions.\n\nUltimately, the Commerce Department\u2019s experiment offers several lessons for executives deciding whether blockchain belongs in their own data strategies. First, separate the concept of transparency from the technology. Blockchain is one way to achieve verifiable records, but not the only way. Digital signatures, hash verification and mirrored databases can provide similar guarantees without the operational complexity of public ledgers.\n\nSecond, consider your audience. If your data is meant to be consumed by regulators, investors or customers who demand the highest level of trust, blockchain can add symbolic and practical reassurance. But if your audience is internal or composed of trusted partners, an API backed by service-level agreements may be both cheaper and more reliable.\n\nThird, watch for automation opportunities. The most compelling use cases for blockchain data publication involve smart contracts and decentralized ecosystems. If your industry is experimenting with tokenized assets, programmable finance, or decentralized supply-chain management, placing critical data on-chain could position you for the next wave of integration.\n\nThe challenge for executives is to distinguish between buzzword and business advantage. The U.S. government\u2019s experiment shows both are possible, and that the line between them depends less on the technology itself than on the problems companies are trying to solve.",

      "text": "One of the overarching themes of 2025, outside of its notable levels of uncertainty, is the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto markets.\nThat theme got a shot in the arm this week, with the news Wednesday (July 2) that J.P. Morgan is reportedly developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, while on Monday (June 30), crypto exchange Kraken unveiled its long-anticipated platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities. That same day, Robinhood also announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users.\nCrucially, Kraken\u2019s own offerings were similarly available only for eligible non-U.S. clients.\nWhile the initiatives may appear distinct, ranging from environmental credits to fractionalized equity exposure, the connective tissue is the same. Moving traditional financial services onto the blockchain. These moves represent a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), sidestep traditional clearing infrastructure, and begin transitioning toward 24/7, programmable trading markets.\nBut these rapid developments also raise existential questions for market regulators and central intermediaries. Are tokenized securities complementary to, or competitive with, traditional capital markets? Can existing legal frameworks scale across these hybrid asset classes? And who bears responsibility when decentralized and centralized elements collide?\nRead more: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized\nReshaping Market Infrastructure Through Tokenization\nTokenization, long the buzzword of blockchain evangelists, has entered its next phase. While initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dominated earlier narratives, the current wave of interest centers around tangible, regulated assets \u2014 stocks, bonds, commodities and now carbon credits.\nEven BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: \u201cEvery stock, every bond, every fund \u2014 every asset \u2014 can be tokenized.\u201d\nKraken and Robinhood\u2019s own tokenized equities operate through offshore subsidiaries to remain compliant with current U.S. laws. These tokenized shares are backed 1:1 by real stocks custodied by licensed brokerages. The twist? Instead of trading through traditional clearinghouses on a T+2 settlement basis, these assets can now be exchanged 24/7 on blockchain rails, with near-instant settlement and global reach.\nFor retail investors, especially outside the U.S., this offers fractional ownership of American blue-chip stocks without intermediaries or time zone constraints. For institutions, it hints at a future where securities can be programmed with smart contracts, auto-execute dividends and facilitate compliance in real time.\nPYMNTS explored this topic earlier in the month in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.\n\u201cThe tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto \u2026 making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,\u201d McLain said. \u201cWe want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.\u201d\nSee also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks\u2019 Tokenization Projects\nUnderstanding the Regulatory Frontiers\nStill, these launches come amid intensifying efforts by U.S. and European regulators to bring coherence to the digital asset ecosystem. And despite the momentum, the regulatory picture remains murky. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not offered formal guidance on tokenized versions of registered securities traded offshore.\nThese assets are typically structured as derivatives or depositary receipts, akin to synthetic products like CFDs and are not true equities in the traditional sense. As with many innovations, there can be a fine line between democratizing access and weakening safeguards.\n\u201cThese \u2018OpenAI tokens\u2019 are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval\u2014we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful,\u201d tweeted OpenAI\u2019s press account on X (formerly Twitter).\nStill, regulatory momentum is gathering in the U.S. and PYMNTS covered how Republican senators at the end of last month (June 24) unveiled a set of principles to serve as a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets and crypto markets.\n\u201cBanks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,\u201d Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. \u201cWithout a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.\u201d"

      "text": "The reason? The way that the GENIUS Act is worded could allow for customers to earn yield (interest) through a loophole enabling crypto exchanges themselves, and not issuers, to indirectly offer interest and rewards to people holding stablecoins issued by third parties like Circle or Tether.\nThe banking sector\u2019s argument has been blunt: if stablecoin issuers begin paying interest, Americans could abandon bank deposits in search of better yield. The specter of deposit flight is one that bank lobbyists know resonates with regulators and lawmakers, particularly in a post-Silicon Valley Bank environment where confidence in bank stability remains fragile.\nYet while banks worry about yield, corporate finance officers, treasurers, and payments executives are discovering that the real problem with stablecoins may have little to do with interest rates.\nInstead, the messy and fragmented infrastructure underpinning stablecoins, including the proliferation of blockchains, the lack of interoperability between wallets, and the absence of common settlement rails is what is giving finance execs a headache, particularly those eyeing the use of stablecoins for cross-border expansion. Unlike dollars in the bank, stablecoins don\u2019t sit neatly in one place. They\u2019re scattered across competing blockchains, wallets and exchanges, each with their own technical quirks and settlement rules. For treasurers, that can create friction in the very efficiency story stablecoins are supposed to deliver.\nThis, even more than the banking industry\u2019s yield debate, could determine whether stablecoins mature into a mainstream corporate tool for cross-border payments and working capital, or whether they remain siloed within crypto trading platforms.\nSee also: FinTech Partnerships Look to Crack Stablecoin On- and Off-Ramp Challenges\nFragmentation and the Stablecoin Landscape\u2019s Plumbing Problem\nStablecoins began as a niche instrument for traders moving in and out of volatile cryptocurrencies without touching the banking system. By anchoring to the U.S. dollar, they offered a haven of relative stability inside the crypto ecosystem. Over time, however, their utility as digital dollars caught the attention of corporations experimenting with faster settlements, treasury diversification and new payments rails.\nToday, the stablecoin landscape is less a unified ecosystem than a patchwork quilt of competing blockchains and wallet standards. USDC, one of the leading stablecoins, exists simultaneously on more than a dozen blockchains, from Ethereum and Solana to Avalanche and Polygon. Each chain has its own consensus mechanisms, fee structures, and technical constraints. Moving tokens across them isn\u2019t trivial, it requires bridging services, custodians, or specialized wallet infrastructure.\nFor a chief financial officer (CFO), this means that what appears on paper to be \u201cone dollar\u201d of USDC is in practice fragmented across different technical domains. A treasury team that wants to receive stablecoins from a supplier might need to decide whether to settle on Ethereum, where fees can spike unpredictably, or on a cheaper but less battle-tested chain. Once funds arrive, moving them to another chain to meet liquidity needs can be cumbersome and introduce counterparty risk.\nWallet fragmentation compounds the problem. A wallet built for Ethereum may not natively support Solana-based tokens; a custody solution tailored to corporate governance may be slow to add new chain integrations. Executives tasked with safeguarding funds must navigate a thicket of technical incompatibilities and compliance risks, undermining the very efficiency gains that stablecoins promise.\nRead more: Are Closed-Loop Financial Instruments the Future of Institutional Stablecoins?\nUnderstanding Corporate Adoption in Practice\nStablecoins expose a paradox of modern finance: the technology is designed for frictionless transfer, yet its current deployment creates new frictions at scale. In traditional banking, dollars are fungible across institutions thanks to clearinghouses, payment networks, and regulatory frameworks that enforce consistency. A dollar at JPMorgan is the same as a dollar at Wells Fargo, and payments between them clear through established rails.\nStablecoins lack that universality. The same \u201cbrand\u201d of stablecoin can behave differently depending on the chain it resides on. Without common rails, treasurers must effectively treat each version of the token as a distinct asset. Accounting for these variations, integrating them into ERP systems, and managing liquidity across chains all require layers of middleware that are still immature.\nThis, in turn, ultimately plays into banks\u2019 lobbying strategy. By focusing the debate on the potential threat to deposits, banks have successfully framed stablecoins as a systemic risk rather than an operational tool. Yet as long as policymakers fixate on yield, the more immediate pain point for corporates, fragmentation, remains unaddressed.\nIf history is any guide, efficiency will eventually prevail. Just as credit cards, mobile payments and digital banking overcame early fragmentation, stablecoins may ultimately converge around interoperable standards. But until that day, the challenge for CFOs is not yield. It is plumbing, pipes and the invisible architecture of money."

This opens a huge gap: bigger players thrive, while their smaller counterparts struggle.\nIn addition to GoodWares AI and blockchain tech, the company uses what it calls its Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), a \u201cdynamic, visual brain\u201d that monitors changes such as shipping delays or supplier issues and \u201cinstantly shows the ripple effects across the entire operation.\u201d\nThe trend of small businesses leveraging digital tools for their eCommerce needs is something PYMNTS explored last year as the holiday shopping season approached.\nThat same report pointed to research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cNew Report: SMBs Race to Critical Mass on AI Usage\u201d which shows that 61% of small businesses say thy use AI to automate daily tasks.\nIn related news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the three-decade evolution of eCommerce, which has lately seen retailers embed banking-like services into shopping experiences, such as installment plans and savings rewards, \u201cblurring the line between commerce and FinTech.\u201d\nFor example, Google recently debuted a series of payment updates designed to court online shoppers such as an expansion of the company\u2019s pay-over-time options, which let shoppers in the United States choose from buy now, pay later providers like Affirm and Zip through autofill on Chrome in a few clicks.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cWhat Consumers Do When Their Go-To Credit Choice Is Unavailable\u201d found that a third of shoppers buying essentials would skip the purchase if their preferred payment method were not offered.\n\u201cIf the first three decades of eCommerce were about digitizing the store, the next three may be about digitizing the shopper,\u201d that report concluded. \u201cThe lines between online and offline are already blurring. In 2055, we may look back at the idea of a checkout page the way we now view fax machines.\u201d"

It examines the broader trend of blockchain adoption in business, noting that while public chains offer tamper\u2011proof records, their cost and latency make them suitable mainly for multi\u2011party trust scenarios rather than everyday enterprise databases. The piece also covers recent tokenization initiatives by JP\u202fMorgan, Kraken, and Robinhood, the regulatory uncertainty surrounding tokenized securities, and the challenges of stablecoin fragmentation for corporate treasury. Finally, it touches on Google Cloud\u2019s Universal Ledger and GoodWares\u2019 AI\u2011powered blockchain platform as examples of industry efforts to integrate blockchain and AI into financial and supply\u2011chain operations.",
