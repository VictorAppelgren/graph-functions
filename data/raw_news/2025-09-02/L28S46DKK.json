  "description": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Wednesday, September 3, 2025 with the theme \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet!\u201d read on.",
  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Strands for Wednesday, September 3, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues and tips, and finally the solution to the puzzle with the theme \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet!\u201d\n\nFor an easy way to come back to our Strands hints every day, . You can also find our past hints there as well, in case you want to know what you missed in a previous puzzle. (If you play , , or , check out our hints for those games, too.)\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll give you some oblique hints at today\u2019s Strands answers. And farther down the page, I\u2019ll reveal the spangram and the answers. Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\n\nHint for the spangram in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nHow you might describe an overly sweet drink, like Kool-Aid or a milkshake.\n\nHint for the theme words in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nWe\u2019re about to give away the answers to today\u2019s Strands puzzle.\n\nWhat is the spangram in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nWhat are the theme words in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nHere\u2019s what the board looks like when the puzzle is solved:\n\nI assume today\u2019s puzzle will feature sweet treats, like candy, cakes, etc.\n\nI see the word GRANULATED across the bottom of the puzzle. \ud83d\udd35 That\u2019s a type of sugar, so I guess that\u2019s the theme today: forms of sugar.\n\nI see SUGARY across the center, which is the spangram. \ud83d\udfe1\n\nBROWN is near the bottom right edge. \ud83d\udd35\n\nWhat is this letter grouping to the left of BROWN? TREVNI? VERTIN? TINVER? Oh, it\u2019s INVERT, a form of sugar I\u2019ve never heard of . \ud83d\udd35 I guess it\u2019s a kind of syrup?\n\nPOWDERED is along the top of the spangram. \ud83d\udd35\n\nCUBE is in the upper left corner. \ud83d\udd35\n\nLastly, TURBINADO, which I think is the same thing as \u201craw\u201d sugar. \ud83d\udd35\n\nYou can find the Strands game on the New York Times website and in the NYT Games app.\n\nWhen you start playing, you\u2019ll see a game board with an assortment of letters, flanked by a clue that gives a hint at the board\u2019s theme\u2014this will be a phrase, like \u201cBetter with age.\u201d Your job is to find the hidden words within the board that reflect the puzzle\u2019s theme.\n\nThe most important word to find is the \u201cspangram,\u201d a word that more explicitly states the puzzle\u2019s theme. (For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\n\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\n\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\n\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\n\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Strands.",

      "text": "Invert sugar is frequently used to sweeten and improve the quality of a variety of commercial and homemade confections.\nYou may wonder what invert sugar is and how it differs from regular table sugar.\nThis article explores everything you need to know about invert sugar, including what it is, how it\u2019s made, and how it\u2019s used.\nInvert sugar \u2014 also known as invert sugar syrup or invert syrup \u2014 is a liquid sweetener made from granulated table sugar and water.\nTable sugar is a compound scientifically known as sucrose. It\u2019s formed when one sugar molecule called glucose chemically binds to another sugar molecule called fructose (\nInvert sugar is created via hydrolysis, a process in which sucrose is mixed with water and heated until the bonds between glucose and fructose break. Enzymes or acidic ingredients like citric acid or cream of tartar can be added to expedite the process (2).\nThe result is a thick, sweet syrup comprised of half glucose and half fructose (2).\nBecause fructose is the sweetest type of natural sugar, the presence of free fructose in invert sugar gives it a much sweeter flavor compared with regular table sugar (\nWhy is it called invert sugar?\nInvert sugar earned its name from its unique light-reflective properties.\nThe presence or absence of chemical bonds between sugar molecules can alter the direction in which light is reflected as it passes through them.\nWhen polarized light passes through regular table sugar (sucrose), it\u2019s always reflected in a certain direction. When the same light passes through invert sugar, it reflects in the opposite \u2014 or inverted \u2014 direction. Hence, it\u2019s called invert sugar.\nSummaryInvert sugar is a liquified form of table sugar in which the chemical bonds between glucose and fructose molecules have been broken.\nInvert sugar\u2019s primary function is to sweeten foods and beverages, but it also comes with several functional benefits.\nIt helps baked goods retain moisture and improves texture by preventing crystallization, which can occur when using regular table sugar.\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried adding granulated sugar to a cold beverage like iced tea or coffee, you\u2019ve likely noticed that sugar crystals don\u2019t readily dissolve.\nInvert sugar gives more a uniform sweetness and mitigates the problem of sugar crystals collecting in the bottom of your glass, as it\u2019s considerably more water-soluble than regular sugar.\nInvert sugar can be used in combination with other sweeteners to sweeten a variety of common foods, such as:\n- ice cream\n- sorbet\n- gelato\n- jellies\n- fudge\n- ganache\n- taffy\n- soft-baked cookies\n- cakes\n- frozen cocktails and other iced beverages\n- flavored syrups\nInvert sugar is also frequently used to ferment products like beer and kombucha.\nFully inverted sugar contains around 50% glucose and 50% fructose, but you can purchase or make it with varying concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose depending on how long it\u2019s heated.\nCommercially prepared invert sugar is arguably the most convenient and chemically precise option, but it\u2019s not always available in regular grocery stores.\nIf your local grocery store doesn\u2019t carry it, you may have better luck finding it online or in specialty restaurants or bakery supply shops.\nHow to make invert sugar at home\nAlthough it may sound daunting, making invert sugar at home isn\u2019t complicated. The process takes a little over an hour and all you need is water, sugar, cream of tartar, and a candy thermometer.\nStart by mixing 2 cups (480 mL) of water with 4.4 cups (1 kg) of granulated sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar in a pot. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat until it reaches 236\u00b0F (114\u00b0C), stirring occasionally.\nNext, remove the mixture from the heat, cover, and let cool. Once it\u2019s cool enough to handle, transfer it to a jar and store it in your refrigerator for up to 6 months.\nSummaryInvert sugar sweetens foods like cakes, ice cream, and candy while helping them maintain a smooth texture and improving moisture retention.\nInvert sugar is a form of added sugar, and its nutritional features are almost identical to those of regular table sugar or corn syrup.\nInvert sugar contains about 46 calories and 13 grams of sugar per tablespoon (15 mL) (\nIt\u2019s important to limit your intake of foods that contain invert sugar. Overconsumption of any type of added sugar is associated with an increased risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, and obesity (\nAlthough added sugar can be safely consumed in moderation, the American Heart Association recommends limiting your intake to no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams per day) for women and 9 teaspoons (37.5 grams) per day for men (\nSimply treat invert sugar like any other form of added sugar and aim to avoid consuming too much to reduce your risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes.\nSummaryInvert sugar is a form of added sugar and overconsumption could lead to negative health effects.\nInvert sugar is a liquid sweetener made from table sugar (sucrose) and water.\nIt\u2019s formed when the bonds between the sugars in sucrose are broken, resulting in a thick, sweet syrup comprised of 50% fructose and 50% glucose.\nInvert sugar adds sweetness and helps improve moisture retention and quality in a variety of sweets like ice cream, cakes, cookies, and candy.\nNutritionally, invert sugar is similar to any other type of added sugar like table sugar or corn syrup. You should consume it sparingly, as consuming too much may contribute to negative health outcomes.\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying invert sugar, you can purchase it online or try making it at home."

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Strands for Tuesday, September 2, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues and tips, and finally the solution to the puzzle with the theme \u201cThings are starting to take shape.\u201d\nFor an easy way to come back to our Strands hints every day, bookmark this page. You can also find our past hints there as well, in case you want to know what you missed in a previous puzzle. (If you play Wordle, Connections, or Quordle, check out our hints for those games, too.)\nBelow, I\u2019ll give you some oblique hints at today\u2019s Strands answers. And farther down the page, I\u2019ll reveal the spangram and the answers. Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\nHint for the spangram in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\nSchool subject for shapes.\nHint for the theme words in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\nSpecific shapes and terms learned in this specialized type of math.\nBEWARE: Spoilers follow for today\u2019s Strands puzzle!\nWe\u2019re about to give away the answers to today\u2019s Strands puzzle.\nWhat is the spangram in today\u2019s Strands?\nToday\u2019s spangram is GEOMETRYCLASS.\nWhat are the theme words in today\u2019s Strands?\nThe theme words today are: ANGLE, POINT, CIRCLE, LINE, AREA, VOLUME, PLANE.\nHere\u2019s what the board looks like when the puzzle is solved:\nHow I solved today\u2019s Strands\nI\u2019ll start looking for shape and geometry words.\nThere\u2019s ANGLE in the upper left. \ud83d\udd35\nI see GEOMETRY to the right of that, which is probably the start of the spangram. Yeah, it\u2019s GEOMETRYCLASS. \ud83d\udfe1\nCIRCLE is in the bottom left. \ud83d\udd35\nPOINT finishes the left half. \ud83d\udd35\nLINE is in the upper right. \ud83d\udd35\nVOLUME is in the center, along the right edge. \ud83d\udd35\nPLANE is in the bottom right corner. \ud83d\udd35\nLastly, AREA. \ud83d\udd35\nStrands #548 \u201cThings are starting to take shape\u201d \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udfe1\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35 \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\nHow to play Strands\nYou can find the Strands game on the New York Times website and in the NYT Games app.\nWhen you start playing, you\u2019ll see a game board with an assortment of letters, flanked by a clue that gives a hint at the board\u2019s theme\u2014this will be a phrase, like \u201cBetter with age.\u201d Your job is to find the hidden words within the board that reflect the puzzle\u2019s theme.\nA crossword crossed with a word search\nThe most important word to find is the \u201cspangram,\u201d a word that more explicitly states the puzzle\u2019s theme. (For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\nHow to win Strands\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Strands."
