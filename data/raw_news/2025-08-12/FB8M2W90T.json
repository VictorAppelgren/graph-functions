  "description": "The U.S. company credited with making photography accessible to everyday people and revolutionizing film says its \"ability to continue\" is in doubt.",
  "content": "The American company credited with revolutionizing amateur photography is warning it could go out of business after more than 130 years.\n\nThe Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak Co. offered a bleak picture of its financials in earnings reports and filings, tracking a second quarter loss and sending shares tumbling in early trading Tuesday, Aug. 12.\n\nThe iconic brand said in Monday, Aug. 11 government filings that there is \"substantial doubt\" about the company\u2019s ability to continue, as it faces more than $470 million in debt and slashes its pension plan in an attempt to remain afloat.\n\n\"Kodak has debt coming due within twelve months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,\" the company said in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nKodak became one of the most iconic American companies in the late 19th century with the introducton of the Kodak #1 camera in 1888, credited with making photography accessible to the everyday person. Though it rose to prominence for its film photography products, it struggled to adapt to the changing industry as digital imaging took over, with the company filing for bankruptcy in 2012. In recent years, it has pursued specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Kodak said its consolidated revenues were $263 million at the end of the quarter on June 30, a decrease of $4 million since the same period last year. Gross profit decreased 12% compared to last year's second quarter end, Kodak disclosed, and its cash balance sits at $155 million, marking a loss of just under 23% since the end of December.\n\nJim Continenza, Kodak\u2019s Executive Chairman and CEO, said tariffs have not had a \"material impact\" on its businesses, noting the domestic production of many of its products such as printing plates, film, inkjet presses and inks and pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nKodak's chief financial officer David Bullwinkle said in the company's Aug. 11 statement it plans to focus on its advanced chemicals and materials sector moving forward, and said the cut to its retirement program is going toward paying down its debt.\n\nHe said the company expects to \"have a clear understanding\" by Friday, Aug. 15 of how it will meet its debt obligations.\n\n\"For the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on reducing costs today and converting our investments into long-term growth,\" Bullwinkle said.\n\nThe company was founded by George Eastman in 1889 and renamed a few years later to the Eastman Kodak Company. Eastman's Kodak Brownie camera introduced in 1900 made photography accessible to everyday Americans, later introducing color versions in the 1920s and 1930s, and offering the world's first digital camera in 1975.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Farmers' Almanac winter forecast for 2025-2026: A long season of cold, snow across US\nThe upcoming 2025-2026 winter may not be as brutal as last year's season, which led to record-setting cold temperatures, the Farmers' Almanac says. But expect plenty of snow and wintery weather.\nAfter winter 2024-2025 brought record-breaking snowfall and dangerously cold temperatures to parts of the U.S., an \"old-fashioned winter,\" as forecast by the Farmers' Almanac may be welcome news for farmers \u2013 and the rest of us, too.\nThe 209th edition of the Farmers' Almanac, out now, forecasts \"Chill, Snow, Repeat\" weather patterns for the upcoming 2025-2026 winter season.\nThe cold and snow may not reach as far south as last year, but the Northern Plains to the New England are likely in for a cold, snowy winter, \"hopefully not as brutally cold as last,\" Farmers' Almanac Editor Sandi Duncan told USA TODAY.\n\"Most of the country is on tap for a cold or very cold winter, kind of almost going back to an old-fashioned winter,\" Duncan said. \"It's going to cool down, it's going to snow, then it might warm up a little, then it's going to repeat itself again.\"\nEven though the upcoming winter may not bring a repeat of last year's prolonged bone-chilling temperatures, the upcoming season's expected weather cycle means \"this winter\u2019s shaping up to be a wild ride,\" the Almanac predicts.\nWintery effects may begin in late fall as cold winter temperatures could \"sneak in a little bit early in many of the northern sections,\" Duncan said.\nWhile winter doesn't officially start until Dec. 21, \"we do see some very cold conditions, kind of blowing in with some possible snow in some areas,\" she said. \"I think the greatest chance of a White Christmas would be out in the northern Plains, perhaps, but not too many other places.\"\nWinter could linger, too. \"It looks like it's going to hang on for a little bit through March and even through April \u2026 especially in New England, Great Lakes and the northern Plains,\" Duncan said.\nDid the Farmers' Almanac get its winter weather prediction right last year?\nIn part, the Almanac proffers, mentioning in the new edition how its winter 2024-2025 forecast \"for a mild winter in Texas and the Southern Plains hit the mark, and we correctly called the cold weather over the Northern Plains and Great Lakes.\"\nThe Almanac also notes, \"We also accurately forewarned of a very cold spell at the end of January,\" perhaps referencing some of winter 2024-2025's milestones including the arctic air mass that contributed to cold weather advisories that month. \"But La Ni\u00f1a threw a curveball, leaving us with fewer wet weather events than expected,\" the Almanac said.\nFebruary also brought dangerously cold temperatures but overall, the contiguous U.S. had the third warmest winter on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with an average temperature of 34.1 degrees F, 1.9 degrees above average.\nThere's a chance a La Ni\u00f1a winter could be in store, according to the Climate Prediction Center. That could mean cold and snow for the Northwest, dry conditions in the South, and higher-than-average temperatures in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\nThe Farmers' Almanac creates its forecasts \"using a proprietary formula that adapts to the mysteries of nature and the ever-changing world in which we live,\" this edition notes. \"The basis of our prediction method was developed by our founding editor according to correlations between celestial events and various meteorological conditions.\"\nWhile scientists may question the accuracy of The Farmers' Almanac \u2013 and the competing The Old Farmer's Almanac \u2013 the guide, which includes planting tips and an astronomical calendar, remains an interesting read.\nHere's a closer look at its regional winter forecasts.\nNortheast, New York: 'Active time' for storms in late January\nWinter in the New England and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont) will include a \"cold snap\" around Jan. 8-15, especially in New England, but \"leaking down into some of the more northern Mid-Atlantic states,\" Duncan said.\nNew England, along with the Northern Plains, is expected to bear the brunt of the season\u2019s coldest temperatures, according to the Almanac.\nIn mid-January, the Almanac expects \"some pretty good snowstorms in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and southern New York \u2026 (and) then again in February, between the 8th and the 11th, we're calling for some very cold conditions, with some heavy snow in northern New England.\"\nMilder temperatures in early March will be followed by colder temperatures and cold, gusty winds in the middle of the month, the Almanac says.\nMidwest, Ohio, and Michigan: 'Big freeze' in January\nIn the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin), New Year's Day will bring chilly, breezy temperatures; northern Michigan and Wisconsin can expect snow.\nAs in the Northeast, the region will get cold temperatures \"perhaps blowing down from the north, especially in Indiana and northern Michigan,\" Duncan said. \"And we're calling for a pretty big snowstorm\" in the Great Lakes region from February 8-11. As the snow gives way to very cold temperatures there, snow moves into Kentucky and Ohio. The beginning of March brings snow to most of the region. The month ends with brisk, windy conditions, plus snow in the north.\nNorthwest: Rain and wet snow for Idaho, Oregon and Washington\nGood news for skiers in the Northwest region (Idaho, Oregon and Washington) because there's overall chilly and wet conditions expected this winter. \"the wet conditions obviously in the mountains are going to help that snow pack \u2026 (for) skiing,\" Duncan said.\nThe Pacific Northwest\u2019s mountains \"are gearing up for some impressive snowfall totals,\" the Almanac says.\nFor coastal Washington in the middle of February and March, \"we're calling for a lot of wet conditions, especially along the coast,\" with rainstorms, Duncan said.\nNorth Central states, Colorado: 'More like winter'\nThe North Central states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming), along with the Great Lakes region, \"are set for a classic winter wonderland,\" the Almanac says.That means the region can expect a \"very cold and snowy\" winter, Duncan said. Snowstorms are expected mid-February in Kansas and Nebraska and in mid-March in the Central Plains.\nEaster may even bring light snow to the Dakotas and Minnesota, while it will be chilly but clear in Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.\nSoutheast, Florida: 'Mild and wet' winter\nWinter is expected to bring average temperatures and wet conditions in the Southeast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia), according to the Almanac.\nThe second week of January will bring \"some very cold temperatures with some possible wintry precipitation, in the more northern areas, such as the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia,\" Duncan said.\nFebruary will also be \"a very wet period, especially from the 16th to the 20th, then turning mild at the end of February, but unsettled in many places,\" she said. \"So just very wet, I would say, is the focus.\"\nTexas, South Central: Another winter snowstorm predicted\nCold and wet conditions are expected this winter in the South Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and Texas, too. \"We don't see too much snow, but we're feeling like some of these more northern areas in this region may have icy rain and the cold conditions, so you might want to make sure you have deicer and your boots ready,\" Duncan said.\nNorthern Texas could get snow and freezing rain in mid-January and snow again in mid-February and mid-March, according to the Almanac. Mild weather will arrive as the month of March nears its end.\nCalifornia, Southwest: 'Fair, dry, very chilly' Christmas\nSouthwest states (Arizona, California, Nevada \\, and Utah) are forecast to have average temperatures and wet conditions \u2013 weather that could help prevent a repeat of the January wildfires in California, Duncan said.\nCalifornia is expected to get rain ahead of windy conditions at the end of January. \"Hopefully it will be enough moisture in the air in California that we don't see anything crazy like it was last year,\" Duncan said.\nOverall, the region should have a \"nice winter with not too many extremes,\" she said.\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "The next Kodak moment: a smartphone?\nNEW YORK\u2013Quick, what\u2019s the first thing that you think of when you think of \u201cKodak\u201d?\n\u201cFilm,\u201d \u201cphotography,\u201d \u201cpictures,\u201d \u201ccameras,\u201d are obvious choices, and if you\u2019re thinking more negatively, perhaps even \u201cbankruptcy\u201d will leap to mind.\nWhat you probably didn\u2019t come up with was \u201csmartphone.\u201d\nAnd yet Eastman Kodak in partnership with Britain's Bullitt Group has just launched the Kodak Ektra in the U.S., an unlocked $399.99 American-version of an Android-based \u201ccamera-first\u201d smartphone that initially began shipping to European consumers late last year, and that was showcased during the CES trade show this past January.\nNot surprisingly, Kodak is playing up the features in Ektra that speak photography, but while many of the pictures I took during my brief tests were quite decent, I can't say I was blown away or that Kodak was leaps and bounds ahead of the best camera phones out there, including the latest iPhones and Samsung Galaxys. I did like this close up of flowers I shot with the Ektra in macro mode.\nWhat's more, there was just enough of a lag that the subject of one of my photos moved before the camera snapped his picture.\nTo be fair, I didn't dig into all the manual shooting options, which include the ability to change the ISO, white balance, shutter speed and so on.\nThe Ektra certainly looks the part. It has a protruding 21-megapixel/f 2.0 aperture lens covered by glass, a 13-MP front facing lens, dual LED flash, dual press dedicated shutter button, and yes, a wrist strap. You can double-press the shutter button to fire up the camera, even from the lock screen.\nKodak sells such camera-style accessories as a handsome over-the-shoulder $79.95 leather case that should appeal to hipsters and anyone with a nostalgic bent. And the yellow box that the Ektra itself comes in is sure to bring back memories of Kodak's heyday.\nKodak designed Ektra to be ergonomically-weighted to feel like a camera in horizontal or vertical orientation--the placement of the shutter made me think that was more so when I held the phone horizontally. You can also shoot pictures by pressing the volume buttons (when in the Camera app, of course) or tapping an on-screen button.\nA slight bulge at the right edge of the phone (when held horizontally) adds to the aesthetic, and if you so choose you can stand the phone up on its side.\nYou can switch among various scene modes (sport, HDR, macro, panorama, etc.) using a virtual thumb dial that is also meant to evoke the past. But the software interface is a little bit clunky.\nGoogle\u2019s Snapseed photo-editing tool is one of the preloaded apps. Another is a Super 8 app with filters and vignettes based on vintage Kodak\u2019s Ektachrome and Kodachrome films, with old-fashion graphics to match. I love the idea but found the software confusing.\nDespite resembling a camera, this mid-tier phone felt natural held up to my ear when I was using it as, well, a phone. It has a 5-inch Full HD touch display and it comes with 32GB of memory, expandable via microSD, along with 3GB of RAM. It runs the older Marshmallow flavor of Android.\nCan Kodak make a go of it in the phone business? You can\u2019t help but be skeptical. For starters, this isn\u2019t even Kodak\u2019s first stab at a phone. In January 2015, it launched a smartphone in Europe with Bullitt that was discontinued before ever making it to the U.S.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the same smartphone that our very well entrenched and capable competitors can be,\u201d says Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke says of Apple and Samsung. \u201cWe wanted to be differentiated around the image, around the nostalgic (and) authentic feel of adding a camera-first smartphone.\u201d\nKodak\u2019s troubles have been well chronicled, of course: How the film pioneer famously fell on hard times when it was slow to respond to digital. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2012, finally emerging out of it in September the year after.\nThese days, Clarke insists \u201cthe Kodak comeback is well along.\u201d Kodak is a public company with revenues last year of $1.5 billion. It is focused on advanced materials, film, printing, software and, as evidenced by the release of the Ektra, consumer products. Kodak has been profitable for four straight quarters. Kodak's stock closed Wednesday at $9.85, down 21% in the past year.\nClarke isn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to think that the Ektra is suddenly going to supplant an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. But he does believe there\u2019s a market for what Kodak is selling: \u201cIf you are a serious photographer you\u2019ll still want all the bells and whistles of a full digital camera,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a bunch of people who want something in between a digital camera and a me-too kind of photo experience with their standard smartphone. We think we\u2019ll be attractive to those (people).\u201d\nThe company can only hope that a smartphone generates fresh Kodak moments.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter"

      "text": "This camera revolutionized photography. Whatever happened to the Kodak Instamatic?\nWith Halloween around the corner, it's a good time to look back at how a people used to capture family memories.\nThe Kodak Instamatic camera was called \"revolutionary\" when it hit the market in a huge way in March 1963. The public and industry analysts alike loved the Instamatic for its simple-yet-sophisticated features. Consumers snapped up more than 70 million Instamatics and shutterbugs everywhere snapped \"Kodak Memories\" like never before.\nKodak introduced several versions of the Instamatic over the years, with the common feature being the easy-to-load film cartridge, which eliminated the problems associated with handling and loading \"roll\" film. Desmond Stone wrote in a 1963 story from the Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network, announcing the new camera that the Instamatic \"will make picture-taking easier than falling off a log.\"\nThen-Kodak President William S. Vaughn alluded to Kodak founder George Eastman's early slogan of \"You press the button, we do the rest\" during a news conference at New York City's Waldorf Astoria hotel.\n\"His aim was to make the camera as easy to use as the pencil,\" Vaughn said in the Stone story. \"Picture-taking, on this day \u2026 has indeed become just that easy.\"\nThe lowest-end and most popular model of the first such cameras was the Instamatic 100, which listed for $16. Five years of planning and teamwork (under the secret-design code name of Project 13) went into the Instamatic system of photography. News accounts said experts worldwide were involved in the planning and called it the most integrated of all programs in the history of Kodak coordination.\nThe original Instamatic cameras used 126-size cartridges, also known as Kodapak cartridges. Each cartridge had enough film for 12 or 20 exposures. A few years after the launch, the Instamatic was adapted to work with Sylvania Electric's brand-new flash cube. Kodak couldn't make Instamatics fast enough to meet the demand.\n\"The Instamatic was what is known as a 'film burner,' a camera that inspired photographers to snap away relentlessly,\" Douglas Collins wrote in the book \"The Story of Kodak.\" Company officials might just as readily have called it a cash cow.\nThe plastic bodies of the camera could be mass produced, as could the high-quality acrylic lenses. Collins called the integrated design a \"marvel\" of industrial engineering.\nSoon enough, Kodak unveiled Instamatic movie cameras and a \"fashion line\" of still Instamatic cameras. Sales continued to grow. In 1969, Kodak introduced a new Instamatic, the 44, called the baby of the Kodak line and advertised as \"ideal for kids and mothers.\" Next up was the Pocket Instamatic, a smaller version launched in 1972 that used a 110-sized film cartridge and sold as well as the original Instamatics.\nIn his book, \"A History of Photography in 50 Cameras,\" Michael Pritchard noted that the Instamatic was not the first camera with a drop-in cartridge. Cameras used them dating from the 1890s and early 20th century, Pritchard wrote, including a model produced in the United Kingdom in 1904 known as \"The Ticka.\" But those cameras and cartridges were more of the novelty type, and \"roll\" film proved vastly more popular until the idea was taken up again by the Kodak Instamatic.\nKodak developed the Instamatic as a way to fend off competition from Japanese companies and their high-quality 35 mm cameras, Pritchard wrote, and turned its attention to securing the amateur market. The Instamatic did so abundantly. Pritchard labeled it \"Kodak's most successful camera ever.\"\nThe company continued to unveil new models, including the Tele-Instamatic 608 in 1974 that had a pop-up \"flip-flash\" bulb. Less successful was Kodak's Disc Camera, launched in 1982 with individual tiny color negatives attached along the edge of a revolving circular disk. The Disc Camera was on the market only until 1988.\nGoogle antitrust trial: What Google\u2019s antitrust trial means for the way you search and more\nThat was the same year that the last of the Kodak Instamatics, the X-15F camera, was on the market, according to the Kodak website. The Pocket Instamatic had ended its run in 1976. Consumer attitudes had changed, first with more interest in 35 mm cameras and then digital photography.\nKodak stopped making the 126 film cartridges at the end of 1999. Now the camera is left to memories, perhaps \"Kodak Memories\" of its own. But for quite a while, the Kodak Instamatic ruled among amateur photographers and made lots of money for the once-mighty company.\nIn a 2013 Democrat and Chronicle story, Tom Tobin wrote that the Instamatic \"hit the retail market with the force of transformation\" and \"made the entire industry sit up and pay attention.\" A former Kodak official told Tobin that one of his colleagues at the company said the Instamatic \"was the smartest thing that the company ever did.\"\nAlan Morrell is a Rochester-based freelance writer.\nThis story was originally published in December 2015 as part of the Whatever Happened To series."

      "text": "Kodak blows itself up in hopes of surviving\n- Kodak will be out of the photo business when it sells its photographic paper and film businesses\n- Desktop inkjet printer manufacturing will stop next year\n- Document-scanner and photo-kiosk operations also are for sale\nROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 All those photos you shot years ago on film and stuck in a scrapbook or shoebox theoretically will last for centuries.\nThe phrase \"Kodak moment\" may survive for years to come as part of pop culture.\nSurvival of the company that invented film photography for the masses and technology for mobile phone photography is far less certain as it transforms itself into part of the commercial printing and packaging industry.\nThe likelihood Kodak will get through its ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy rises almost daily. Eleven months in, Kodak has secured an $830 million line of credit from various lenders \u2014 money that is supposed to carry it through the rest of its bankruptcy and out the other side.\nAnd the company continues to maintain it will come out of bankruptcy sometime in the first half of next year as a pruned-down but finally profitable company.\nThat post-bankruptcy Kodak will barely resemble the company that filed for bankruptcy protection in January. Desktop inkjet printer manufacturing will stop next year though the company will continue to make the inks. Kodak expects to save $100 million next year by ending all the retiree health benefits it long has provided. And the company estimates it has shed roughly 3,700 positions worldwide this year, or roughly 1 in 5 workers, including numerous middle and upper managers alongside hourly workers.\nBut perhaps most momentously, Kodak will be out of the photography business.\nThe digital camera business has been shut down. The photographic-paper and still-camera film businesses are for sale alongside the document-scanner and photo-kiosk operations.\nThe heavy lifting is not getting out of bankruptcy, but the months and years afterward.\n\"The major question is the longevity,\" said Art Roberts, president of Kodak retiree group EKRA Ltd. \"There's probably enough confidence in the 12- to 24-month window, but is there technology to carry that into the future? I don't know.\"\nThe future\nIf Kodak has a fan, it's John Place.\nThe chief executive of Mercury Print Productions here, Place had a Kodak Prosper 5000 digital printing press installed last year. He expects to have a Prosper 1000 installed within a couple of weeks and looks to buy another Prosper 5000 some time next year.\n\"They have the best technology,\" Place said. \"But Kodak has always been bad at marketing.\"\nSince Mercury installed its Prosper 5000, numerous potential Kodak customers have come through Mercury, seeing the digital printing press running almost constantly, churning out textbooks.\n\"My opinion is, (Kodak) is going to be successful,\" Place said. \"And we're going to help them be successful.\"\nAfter decades of generating Midas-like fortunes by putting light-sensitive chemicals on plastic strips, Kodak sees its next life revolving around a similar deposition process \u2014 this time in printing. Specifically, Kodak is looking to commercial printing, packaging printing and print industry services \u2014 as well as the just-emerging field of functional printing \u2014 to be its next life.\nThe choice has not been happenstance.\nThe thought process started back in the mid-2000s, said Christopher Payne, vice president of Kodak's business-to-business marketing, when Kodak began acquiring a variety of print-related businesses, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on such firms as NexPress and Scitex.\nKodak's entry to the packaging world is more recent, with its introduction of the Flexcel NX printing system in 2008. And functional printing \u2014 using printing technology as a means of manufacturing such goods as circuit boards or solar cells \u2014 is itself in its infancy.\nToday, print \"is the only business they have that they could emerge from bankruptcy with and have a hope of succeeding,\" said Tone Kelly of Webster, N.Y. He retired in 2007 after 34 years with the company, most of it in corporate strategy.\nThe high-speed inkjet Prosper system \"is a breakthrough technology,\" Kelly said. \"If they get that going, \u2026 it'll be a real opportunity.\"\nPackaging printer Hammer Packaging in Henrietta, N.Y., has been a user of Kodak pre-press offerings such as plates before and through the bankruptcy.\n\"Everything's been on time,\" Chief Executive James Hammer said. \"They've got good products. The credibility is still there.\"\nBut whether Kodak can make a big splash in packaging printing will depend on it being able to offer technology and products that set it apart from the competition \u2014 akin to its inkjet technology in commercial printing, Hammer said.\nKodak has a Feb. 28 deadline for its plan to repay creditors and exit bankruptcy. The plan has to be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\nThe plan itself, even if Kodak's creditors sign on to it, \"does not necessarily mean that the parties believe that a company will succeed, just that there is some possibility and it is the best deal they can get at the time and better than an orderly liquidation,\" said John C. Ninfo II, a retired U.S. bankruptcy judge for the Western District of New York.\nYet now arguably is not the best time to bet the farm on printing. While it's a growing industry in much of the developing world, commercial printing is on the decline in the United States, according to quarterly Census Bureau economic statistics.\nAnother of western New York's traditionally dominant companies, Xerox Corp., has made a major bet on business services as its printing equipment business growth has slowed to a crawl.\nAlternate reality\nThe difference, according to Kodak, is its printing technology, with its high-speed inkjet Stream technology putting it on the path to a sort of holy grail in the print world \u2014 the speed and image quality of offset printing but the ability to do short press runs or personalization that comes with digital.\nHowever, Kodak has a history of great technology that it never could translate into big bucks. Think organic light-emitting diodes. Think digital photography.\nAs the end of silver halide photography became evident, Kodak had a history of throwing lots of spaghetti at walls to see what might stick, from digital photography to pharmaceuticals.\n\"Kodak's biggest problem was its success,\" said Roberts of the retiree group. \"The film business was so profitable that every other technology was a second cousin through the years.\"\nKodak's bankruptcy likely would have gone very differently if the company had been able to more quickly or more lucratively turn its digital imaging patents into cash.\nThe company went into bankruptcy in part for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court protections that would come with such a sale. And while a Kodak-hired consultant had put a potential value of $2.4 billion on the patents, Kodak last week announced it had signed a tentative deal to let them go for $525 million.\nWhile the company's objectives during bankruptcy reorganization \u2014 such as sell the patents and cut retiree benefit costs \u2014 remained unchanged during the past 11 months, \"we have had to make some difficult decisions throughout the reorganization based on the realities of what is required to emerge,\" Kodak spokesman Christopher Veronda said.\nKodak's management \"made a lot of wise decisions to go to Chapter 11 \u2014 they had so much baggage in terms of the pension plans, so much dead weight,\" said Chief Executive Alexander Poltorak of General Patent Corp., a Rockland County, N.Y., intellectual property services firm. \"They had to shake it off.\"\nWhile the patent sale also probably was the right decision, Poltorak said: \"The patents could've been sold a long time ago. That was a big mistake.\"\n'UnKodak' emerges\nKodak has a number of backers banking on it having a viable future. A number of financial institutions and hedge funds are floating the company $830 million in financing.\n\"If you're putting down $830 million, you've got to have some reasonable assurance you're going to get your money back,\" Roberts said.\nWhile bankruptcies usually wipe out shareholders' stock, leaving them with worthless paper as new shares get issued, Kodak's shareholders potentially could see some returns, said Ken Luskin of Intrinsic Value Asset Management Inc.\n\"At this point, it's what are you going to get for (the photo kiosk and document scanner businesses)? How much can you knock down (the U.K. pension obligation)? If they can get decent valuations, there's equity left over for shareholders,\" he said.\nAt the same time, there's plenty of pessimism in the investment community.\nThe average price of a share of Kodak stock this year? Around 27 cents. And credit rating firms like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch today don't even bother giving a grade to Kodak's corporate debt.\nThere's also an argument to be made that Kodak has nothing of value.\nRetired company Vice President Terrence Faulkner, in a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy Court early this year, argued that Kodak likely would fail not long after coming out of bankruptcy, given the challenges of competing in desktop inkjet and the slide of other product lines such as photo paper and motion picture film.\nToday, he said, \"a Kodak that has exited film, digital cameras, inkjet and spun off health is no longer Kodak.\"\nThose moves, plus the sale of the digital imaging patent portfolio, will leave \"a very different and much smaller company,\" Faulkner said. Meanwhile, Kodak's remaining businesses will face competitors \"larger than the emergent UnKodak and better funded.\n\"UnKodak is struggling to emerge from Chapter 11 at a time when businesses are very hesitant to make investment in new equipment,\" Faulkner said.\nEKRA, the retiree group, estimates that unsecured creditors will get back 10 cents to 20 cents on the dollar, making it highly unlikely shareholders would see their shares survive.\n\"The strategy moving forward still makes sense,\" said Jim Weaver of Irondequoit, N.Y., who retired from Kodak earlier this year after spending most of his career in R&D and commercialization. \"But it's not a slam dunk. ... The path forward, it's not like we're in a cash cow business anymore. These are going to be challenging businesses, without a doubt.\"\nMatthew Daneman also writes for the (Rochester, N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle.\nClick here to enlarge. (Image will open in a separate window.)"

      "text": "Kodak Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nROCHESTER, N.Y.\nAugust 11, 2025\nEastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) today reported financial results for the second quarter 2025.\nSecond quarter 2025 highlights include:\n- Consolidated revenues of $263 million, compared with $267 million for Q2 2024, a decrease of $4 million or 1 percent\n- Gross profit of $51 million, compared with $58 million for Q2 2024, a decrease of $7 million or 12 percent\n- Gross profit percentage of 19 percent, compared with 22 percent for Q2 2024, a decrease of 3 percentage points\n- GAAP net loss of $26 million, compared with net income of $26 million for Q2 2024, a decrease of $52 million or 200 percent\n- Operational EBITDA of $9 million, compared with $12 million for Q2 2024, a decrease of $3 million or 25 percent\n- A quarter-end cash balance of $155 million, compared with $201 million on December 31, 2024, a decrease of $46 million; cash flow from operations decreased by $40 million from the prior-year period\n\"In the second quarter, Kodak continued to make progress against our long-term plan despite the challenges of an uncertain business environment,\" said Jim Continenza, Kodak\u2019s Executive Chairman and CEO. \"While tariffs did not have a material impact on our business in Q2, we are assessing the potential impact of new tariffs going forward. It\u2019s important to note that Kodak is committed to U.S. manufacturing \u2014 in fact, we manufacture a wide range of products in the U.S., including lithographic printing plates, photographic and industrial films, inkjet presses and inks, and pharmaceutical key starting ingredients \u2014 and our expectation is that tariffs instituted by the U.S. government are designed to protect American businesses like ours. We continue to accelerate the growth of our Advanced Materials & Chemicals (\"AM&C\") business. I\u2019m pleased to report that our AM&C group\u2019s cGMP pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is now registered with the FDA and certified to manufacture and sell regulated pharmaceutical products, expanding our current business in unregulated pharmaceutical products. The facility will begin operation manufacturing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for laboratory use and create a bridge to manufacturing more sophisticated specialty products, such as injectable IV saline, in the future. For the balance of the year, we plan to focus on serving our customers, strengthening our balance sheet and developing growth businesses for our future.\"\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2025, revenues were $263 million, a decrease of $4 million or 1 percent compared to the same period in 2024. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $5 million, revenues decreased by $9 million, or 3 percent when compared to the prior year.\nGAAP net loss was $26 million for the quarter, compared to net income of $26 million in 2024, a decrease of $52 million or 200 percent. Operational EBITDA for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, was $9 million, compared to $12 million in 2024, a decrease of $3 million or 25 percent. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1 million, Operational EBITDA decreased by $4 million or 33% compared to the prior year. The decrease in Operational EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes and higher aluminum and manufacturing costs, partially offset by price increases and lower spend on investments in information technology systems, organizational structure and costs associated with trade shows.\nKodak ended the quarter with a cash balance of $155 million, a decrease of $46 million from December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures to fund growth initiatives, changes in working capital, impact of higher costs and lower profitability from operations.\n\"During the second quarter, Kodak continued its focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and investing in growth initiatives in our AM&C group,\" said David Bullwinkle, Kodak\u2019s CFO. \"Revenue for the quarter was roughly flat year over year, which was in line with expectations, and we continued to see revenue growth in our AM&C business. In Q2 we saw a significant improvement in our use of cash compared with the first quarter, reducing our cash balance by $3 million to $155 million, compared with $201 million on December 31, 2024. The termination of our U.S. Kodak Retirement Income Plan and subsequent reversion of excess funds to pay down debt is progressing as planned. We expect to have a clear understanding by August 15 of how we will satisfy our obligations to all plan participants, and we anticipate completing the reversion by December of 2025. For the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on reducing costs today and converting our investments into long-term growth.\"\nGoing Concern Assessment\nKodak has included a disclosure regarding its going concern assessment in its second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q filing. Kodak\u2019s plans to adequately fund its preferred stock and debt obligations when they become due are to use the proceeds from the expected reversion of cash to the Company upon settlement of obligations under the Kodak Retirement Income Plan to reduce the amount of term debt and to amend, extend or refinance its remaining debt and preferred stock obligations. These plans are not solely within Kodak\u2019s control and therefore are not deemed \"probable\" under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. As a result, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as of the issuance date of the Company\u2019s second quarter financials. Refer to Going Concern subsection of Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in the Company\u2019s second quarter 2025 Form 10-Q for additional information.\nRevenue and Operational EBITDA by Reportable Segment Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024\n| ($ millions) | ||||\n| Q2 2025 Actuals | Advanced Materials & Chemicals |\nBrand | Total | |\nRevenue Operational EBITDA * |\n$178 $(4) |\n$75 $8 |\n$6 $5 |\n$259 $9 |\n| Q2 2024 Actuals | Advanced Materials & Chemicals |\nBrand | Total | |\nRevenue Operational EBITDA * |\n$186 $- |\n$73 $8 |\n$4 $4 |\n$263 $12 |\n| Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024 Actuals B/(W) |\nAdvanced Materials & Chemicals |\nBrand | Total | |\nRevenue Operational EBITDA * |\n$(8) $(4) |\n$2 $- |\n$2 $1 |\n$(4) $(3) |\n| Q2 2025 Actuals on constant currency ** vs. vs. Q2 2024 Actuals B/(W) |\nAdvanced Materials & Chemicals |\nBrand | Total | |\nRevenue Operational EBITDA * |\n$(13) $(4) |\n$2 $(1) |\n$2 $1 |\n$(9) $(4) |\n* Total Operational EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests where officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face.

Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Tropical Storm Erin forecast to become first hurricane of Atlantic season\nTropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean could eventually develop into a \"major hurricane,\" federal forecasters said.\nEditor's Note: Tropical Storm Erin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. See the latest update on Tuesday, Aug. 12.\nTropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, meteorologists said.\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami announced on Monday, Aug. 11, that Erin had developed from a tropical wave as it churned west of the Cabo Verde Islands, an archipelago that sits off the western coast of Africa.\nAs of 11 a.m., the storm was moving west at 20 mph and had sustained winds of 45 mph, the hurricane center said. The storm was located 280 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands and over 2,300 miles from the Leeward Islands.\nThe storm is expected to continue strengthening as it barrels west over the coming days. The hurricane center said several regional models \"show Erin becoming a major hurricane,\" which is defined as any storm classified as a Category 3 or stronger, meaning it has winds over 110 mph.\nErin was one of three disturbances meteorologists were tracking in the Atlantic \u2013 and is the one that poses the biggest threat. It is still early and there are high levels of uncertainty in the storm's long-term track. Still, experts urge those with interests in the Caribbean and the eastern coast of the U.S. to monitor its development.\nWarm Atlantic waters to fuel Erin's development into a hurricane\nAs Tropical Storm Erin heads west, it will encounter exceptionally warm waters that could fuel its development into a major hurricane, said AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva.\nWater temperatures across much of the Atlantic \"are plenty warm to support tropical development and even rapid intensification,\" DaSilva said in an online outlook.\nHe added that there are several factors that could influence where the storm eventually lands, including the strength of a cold front moving off the eastern coast of the U.S.\nIf the cold front is fast and strong, it could push the storm back out to sea and away from the U.S., DaSilva said. If it's slow and weak, the storm could push right through it and pose a threat to the Eastern Seaboard. Other factors include wind shear and the position of the \"Bermuda High,\" an area of high pressure that could steer the hurricane. So far, it's too early to know where the storm will go.\nStorm tracker: Tracking storms in the Atlantic\nSpaghetti models for Tropical Storm Erin\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\nForecasters track 2 other disturbances in the Atlantic\nApart from Tropical Storm Erin, meteorologists are tracking two systems in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIn the central Atlantic, a weak trough of low pressure with a low chance of developing is expected to drift northward. The disturbance is \"only producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity,\" the hurricane center said.\nMeanwhile, a few hundreds miles off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, a system was tracked moving north over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. By midweek, forecasters say the system will encounter cooler waters, \"ending its chances for further tropical development.\"\nBoth systems have a 10% chance of developing over the next week, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nWhat is happening in the Pacific?\nHurricane Henriette, located north of Hawaii, is forecasted to remain a hurricane for several more days before dissipating into a storm and disappearing before it makes landfall, according to the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center.\nTropical Depression Ivo, located west of Mexico, is also forecast to dissipate by Tuesday, Aug. 12, before making landfall.\nStorm tracker: Tracking storms in the Pacific\nWhen did the 2025 hurricane season begin?\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.\nActive hurricane weather typically peaks between mid-August and mid-October.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan: If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies: Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions: Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan: NOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home: Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Trump says he's looking at reclassifying marijuana at federal level\nIn 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said at news conference August 11.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\nSchedule I drugs are defined as highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use. Marijuana has belonged to this class of drugs since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970. If reclassified, marijuana would be treated the same as drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, which can be prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies.\nReclassifying marijuana would be the biggest change in marijuana policy the federal government has taken since the drug was first outlawed, but it would not make recreational usage legal under federal law.\nThe move began in 2022, when then-President Joe Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration to review how marijuana is scheduled. In 2023, Health and Human Services recommended that marijuana be moved to Schedule III. In 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nTrump said the decision is complicated, weighing the benefits of marijuana use for medical reasons against potential societal impacts.\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana,\" he said."

      "text": "Kodak smells success in odor-free fabrics\nScience put a man on the moon.\nScience eradicated smallpox.\nAnd when Eastman Kodak Co. scientist Gary Slater wore the same T-shirt for two weeks straight, it was science that prevented it from turning funky.\n\"It feels good,\" Slater said as he pulled the collar of the silver-infused and since-laundered shirt out for inspection. \"I love it.\"\nKodak \u2014 long a photography company, now a printing technology company \u2014 has always been a silver company. The compound silver halide is a key ingredient in photographic film due to its reactivity to light. And the company traditionally has been among the largest consumers of silver in the world for its film products.\nNow Kodak is hoping to turn another property of silver \u2014 its ability to kill germs and bacteria \u2014 into stink-free socks.\nRochester-based Kodak in November announced it had signed an agreement to exclusively provide a silver sulfate compound to PurThread Technologies Inc., with that company in turn using the material in the manufacture of synthetic fibers that then get woven into yarn. The two companies in February said they were expanding that relationship with a joint development agreement that would see them working on other possible products.\nThe Kodak additive, AgAM 100, specifically is aimed at preventing the discoloration and odor caused by sweat-eating microbes.\nGarments incorporating PurThread products can be worn \"for days and days and days and it won't smell,\" Kodak Chief Technology Officer Terry Taber said.\nNorth Carolina textile firm PurThread started in 2009 with the idea of making antimicrobial fabrics for health-care settings. While that market and application remains an eventual goal, said President Lisa T. Grimes, PurThread first is targeting the athletic gear world with its Kodak-infused products. On its own online company store, PurThread sells a $75 lab coat, $35 medical scrub top and $65 golf shirt, all promising to inhibit the growth of any odor-causing bacteria or fungus.\nPurThread-made yarn \u2014 made with Kodak's silver sulfate powder mixed into each strand like chocolate chips in cookie dough \u2014 first hit the market in fall 2013. PurThread contracts out the manufacturing of its yarn to various U.S. companies, Grimes said.\n\"There's a lot of interest in embedded technology that doesn't wash off and run down the drain,\" Grimes said. \"We're getting good reception in the marketplace.\"\nTaber said Kodak expects \"modest revenues\" this year from the PurThread work, but hopes to see those numbers ramp up in 2015 and 2016 as the two companies roll out a variety of other products.\nSilver has long been known for its antimicrobial properties. \"There are stories of people centuries ago taking silver coins and putting them on cuts,\" Taber said. \"I don't know if they're true.\"\nHowever, silver's use as an antimicrobial agent has been limited. Merely making silver sulfate is one thing, Taber said: \"You have to get it in a form you can deliver it in and it maintains its effectiveness. The real inventiveness Kodak brings to this is creating the right silver salt that is stable through all these processes.\"\nKodak has tried this line of business years ago with a liquid silver sulfate solution that would work as a coating, Taber said. That approach never panned out, though products coated with the solution did pass the 50-wash test, Taber said. The embedded silver sulfate particles are \"something we knew would have longer term application,\" he said. \"And it has a wider range of applications.\"\nBeing entwined with PurThread is part of a business goal of Kodak to team up with other companies. Kodak last fall announced an agreement with Swiss machinery maker BOBST that would see Kodak technology used in BOBST box-making equipment. And it is working with a pair of touchscreen film manufacturers, supplying raw materials and some technical expertise.\n\"We're always looking for new business relationships,\" Taber said. \"One of the hallmarks of the new Kodak is that in a lot of the businesses \u2014 in digital printing and functional printing, whether it be the materials or substrates or components \u2014 we'd be working with partners.\"\nDaneman also reports for The (Rochester, N.Y.)

A large initial explosion was followed by secondary ones, officials said.\nIn a separate social media post Monday evening, Allegheny County Emergency Services said the second fatality was a person who had previously been considered missing.\n\"Officials can confirm there has been a second fatality in connection with this incident,\" the agency said. \"This was the last of the two individuals that was initially unaccounted for.\"\nOne of two persons first reported missing was rescued, joining the list of those injured and taken to a local hospital, according to Victor Joseph, assistant superintendent of the county police. Dozens of others sustained injuries that didn't require hospitalization, a spokesperson said.\nU.S. Steel Executive Vice President Scott Buckiso told reporters at an afternoon news conference that the plant was stable except for the two structures shut down after the first explosion at 10:50 a.m. An investigation into the cause is underway.\nAllegheny County Emergency Services said the scene \"is now secure\" and that the agency, along with the county police department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, would remain on site.\nConstruction worker Zachary Buday, who was near the steel plant when the explosion happened, told WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh that it \"sounded like thunder.\"\n\"It shook my chest. It shook the building, then we saw the dark smoke rising from the steel mill,\" he said. \"Put two and two together. It's like something bad happened.\"\nThe station also reported that five of the 10 injured persons had been released from the hospital by 4 p.m. ET.\nThe moment of the initial blast, followed by large plumes of smoke shooting high into the air, is captured live in video from the BreatheProject, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that advocates for improvements to air quality in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nSearch for missing person amid intense heat\nAmbulances and other emergency vehicles circulated through the main gate of U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works late Monday afternoon, several hours after the series of explosions.\nKasey Reigner, spokesperson for the Allegheny County Emergency Services, said there were initially dozens of \"walking wounded\" who were treated at the scene and sent home. She could not elaborate on the condition of those who were hospitalized, but pointed out the difficulty of searching for the missing person amid the destruction.\n\"It's really hot and that's a challenge,\" Reigner said. \"Our firefighters are trading people in, who can go in and put in the most effort in the heat, but this is a coordinated effort. We have pretty much dozens of agencies working together outside of Clairton, outside U.S. Steel, working to find the person that's left inside.\"\n'The whole house shook,' neighbor says\nAdrian Sparks lives in her family's brick home on a steep hill overlooking the coke plant. The morning explosion rocked her house and \"scared the living daylight out of me,\" she said.\n\"I heard a big boom and I jumped up,\" said Sparks, who was sitting on the side of her bed. \"I thought a vehicle hit my house. The whole house shook. My bed shook and I looked around. I didn't see anything. I turned my scanner on. They said there was an explosion in the mill. So me and my dog jumped in the car and I rode down by the ball field and that's when all the rescue workers were coming in, police and everything.\"\nAs a retired factory worker, Sparks said the fatality from the blast hit close to home. She worked in General Motors plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky before retiring and returning to Clairton in August. She remembers at least one other loud explosion at the plant several years ago.\n\"I just worry about the safety and the air quality,\" she said. \"These corporations, it's all about money. It's all corporate greed. They don't care about safety like they should.\"\nGov. Shapiro says 'multiple explosions' took place at plant\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on social media the steel plant was the site of \"multiple explosions,'' and that his administration will provide whatever resources are required.\n\"Injured employees have now been transported to local hospitals to receive care, and search-and-rescue efforts remain active at the plant,'' Shapiro said. \"If you\u2019re in the area, continue to follow the instructions of local authorities.''\nU.S. Sen.

The Clairton Plant is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the country and serves the commercial coke market as well as U.S. Steel's steelmaking facilities, according to U.S. Steel.\nThe longtime manufacturing icon, whose origins date back to the 19th century, was acquired in June by Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steelmaker, in a $14.9 billion transaction.\nThe Clairton plant operates 10 coke oven batteries and annually produces more than 4 million tons of coke, a type of fuel used in the steelmaking process, per U.S. Steel.\nWhat is a coking plant?\nA coking plant turns coal into coke, which is in turn used to make steel in a blast furnace. The coal is softened, then liquified and re-solidified into coke. Coal in a coking plant is heated without oxygen to temperatures as high as 1,125 degrees Fahrenheit, removing its impurities. The resulting coke is a porous, carbon-heavy material.\nContributing: Reuters"
