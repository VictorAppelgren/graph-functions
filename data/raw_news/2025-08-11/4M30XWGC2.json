  "content": "Stray cat with 'worst case of fleas' on the mend\n\nA stray cat with the worst case of fleas vets said they had seen \"in years\" is recovering after more than a month of treatment. Named Firefly by staff, the male was brought into Woodgreen Pets Charity in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, by a member of the public who saw the cat struggling on one of the hottest days of the year last month. Woodgreen said he was \"dangerously\" dehydrated, \"ravenously\" hungry and much of his fur was missing because the flea infestation was so severe. The charity urged people to be aware of the dangers that extreme heat poses to pets - and particularly to stray or abandoned animals.\n\nThe long-haired black and white cat is about four years old and was not neutered or microchipped, so Woodgreen staff ha no idea if he ever belonged to anyone or how long he had been fending for himself. The charity said when Firefly was brought in he was so underweight that vets had to put him on fluids immediately. Vets described it as one of the worst cases of fleas they had seen in years. They said he was \"slowly gaining strength\" although remained underweight and \"constantly hungry\".\n\nBeverley Street, senior operations manager at Woodgreen, said: \"If Firefly hadn't come to us when he did, he wouldn't have survived. He was in a terrible state, and it was obvious he hadn't eaten for a while. \"If you find an unwell or injured stray cat during hot weather, try to move them to a shaded, well-ventilated area and offer them cool, fresh water. \"Contact a local vet or rescue charity as soon as possible - it may save their life. \"Always avoid leaving animals in confined spaces for long periods during high temperatures - even with the best intentions, the heat can quickly become deadly.\"",

Switch on a fan to circulate as much cool air as possible and keep the hot air out,\" she said.\nThe RSPCA has also issued advice, saying \"the soaring temperatures can pose huge risks to pets, wildlife and farm animals\".\nCarrie Stones, the charity's campaign manager, said: \"It's important we do everything we can to keep them cool and comfortable while the heat is here.\"\nSome of its tips include filling a paddling pool or spraying a hose for your dog to play in \u2013 although you should always supervise them around water.\nFish tanks should be kept out of direct sunlight and outdoor animals should be provided with shade and plenty of fresh water.\n\"It's also a really helpful idea to support local wildlife, too, by popping out some bowls of water to help birds, foxes and other wildlife,\" said Ms Stones.\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Cambridgeshire?\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\nRelated topics\n- Published21 June\n- Published19 June"
