  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have delivered dividend growth on par with ExxonMobil.\n\u2022 None NNN REIT has the third-longest dividend growth streak in the REIT sector.\n\u2022 None Medtronic is on the cusp of joining this elite group of dividend stocks.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil \u203a\n\nDividend Kings are the most durable dividend stocks, having increased their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years. This resilience is impressive, as they've weathered at least seven recessions in that time.\n\nThe list of current Dividend Kings is short, with only 55 companies. More companies should join this group as they reach the milestone in the coming years. Here are three likely future Dividend Kings.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is steadily marching toward Dividend King status. The oil giant has now increased its dividend for 42 straight years, the longest current streak in the oil patch. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) have delivered dividend growth of 42 or more years.\n\nThe energy company has put itself in a strong position to continue increasing its dividend. ExxonMobil's plan to 2030 aims to deliver the growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the dawn of the next decade. That has it on track to deliver compound annual growth rates of 10% for earnings and 8% for its cash flow over the next five years.\n\nExxon aims to deliver this robust growth by investing $140 billion into higher-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program. It also expects to achieve another $7 billion in structural cost savings by 2030, compared to the third quarter of last year.\n\nExxon is also building the energy company of the future by investing in several lower-carbon energy technologies, including hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, and lithium. These and other new businesses have the potential to add $3 billion to its earnings by 2030 and $13 billion by 2040. Combine all this with Exxon's fortress financial profile, and the oil giant seems destined to eventually earn the crown of Dividend King.\n\nNNN REIT (NYSE: NNN) reached an important milestone last year when the real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered its 35th consecutive dividend increase. Only two other REITs and fewer than 80 publicly traded companies have reached that level. The REIT has since extended its streak to 36 straight years.\n\nThe landlord has a very simple business model: It invests in single-tenant net leased properties. It acquires properties secured by long-term net leases (initial terms of 10 to 20 years) in prime locations within strong markets. These properties produce very reliable rental income.\n\nNNN REIT establishes relationships with expanding retailers, which steadily provide it with new investment opportunities. It typically acquires properties via sale-leaseback transactions. These relationship-based transactions provide clients with capital to continue expanding their retail footprints, which ultimately presents the REIT with new investment opportunities. NNN REIT maintains a conservative financial profile, which allows it to continue expanding its portfolio (and dividend) throughout the economic cycle.\n\nMedtronic (NYSE: MDT) is close to earning Dividend King status, with 48 straight years of dividend growth. The medical device maker is well-positioned to continue raising its payout.\n\nThe healthcare company plans to separate its diabetes business over the next 18 months. It ideally plans to complete an initial public offering of the unit and a subsequent split-off of the business. This strategy will allow it to focus all its attention on its growing cardiovascular, neuroscience, and medical-surgical units.\n\nThose three markets are large and growing at a mid-to-high single-digit annual rate. Medtronic aims to capture a larger share of these expanding markets by continuing to invest heavily in research and development to launch new and improved products. It also has the balance sheet strength to make acquisitions as the right opportunities arise. These growth investments should increase its cash flow, enabling Medtronic to ascend to the next level of dividend royalty.\n\nExxonMobil, NNN REIT, and Medtronic are all well on their way to eventually becoming Dividend Kings. They have the financial strength and visible earnings growth potential to continue increasing their dividends for years to come. All this means they're ideal stocks to buy for those seeking durable, steadily rising dividend income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ExxonMobil wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "text": "Even novice investors have probably heard the term \"IPO\" before. IPO stands for \"initial public offering\" in the stock market. A privately held company that completes an IPO offers shares of itself to the public for the first time. The newly issued shares begin trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public? It means that it completes an IPO (or similar process) and makes its stock available to investors. Shares of pre-IPO companies or private companies are generally owned by just a small group of company insiders and employees, as well as early investors such as venture capitalists.\nHow does an IPO work?\nHow does an IPO work?\nAny privately held company can go public through an IPO. Companies that complete IPOs are often fast-growing companies in the tech industry or another high-growth sector. However, they can also be mature companies -- such as Petco (WOOF 0.79%) and Levi Strauss (LEVI 0.93%) -- that are owned by private equity firms seeking to exit their positions. Some of the most attractive IPOs are \"unicorns,\" or tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion in the private markets.\nWhen a company is ready to go public, it hires an investment bank (or several banks) to underwrite the IPO. Generally, a company goes public after it has a proven track record of growth and other favorable results that are attractive to investors. Banks underwrite IPOs by committing money to buy the shares being offered before they're listed on any public exchange.\nAnother role of the underwriter is to perform due diligence on the company to verify its financial information and analyze its business model and prospects. With the help of the underwriter, the company files a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which includes its prospectus. The purpose of the filing is to provide detailed information on the company's finances, business model, and growth opportunities.\nThe company often meets with institutional investors such as pension funds, foundations, and endowments to make sure the IPO has buyers. After an initial block of shares is sold, the company and its underwriters set an initial public price and a date for the stock to begin trading on a public exchange.\nOn IPO day, the company's stock becomes available to the general public, and the stock then trades among investors on the open market.\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nWhy do companies pursue IPOs?\nThe primary benefit of going public is easier access to capital. The money raised from an IPO can be used for expansion, research and development, marketing, and other purposes.\nIPOs also reward equity holders in the company. Executives, employees, and others who own equity stakes can easily sell their holdings, generally after a lock-up period of six months once the stock is publicly traded. The lock-up period helps stabilize the stock price by preventing insiders from selling all their holdings immediately after the IPO.\nWhile private companies are valued based on private funding rounds, which can be burdensome and time-consuming, public companies are valued based on the market price. There's no additional work for the company to do to raise its valuation, and stock prices have the potential to appreciate much faster than private company valuations, assuming the business warrants it.\nThere are also drawbacks to going public since companies are required to adhere to SEC reporting requirements. Publicly traded companies must issue regular disclosure statements, release their financial results, and conduct quarterly earnings calls, among other requirements. Public companies have fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders and satisfying their demands can cost management control, time, and money -- especially if an activist investor takes an interest in the stock.\nAlternatives to IPOs\nAlternatives to IPOs\nThe traditional IPO process isn't the only option for going public. Increasingly, companies are going public through direct listings. Among the stocks that have gone public through direct listings in recent years are Spotify (SPOT -2.23%), Slack (now owned by Salesforce) (CRM -3.51%), Coinbase (COIN 2.97%), Roblox (RBLX 1.77%), and Amplitude (AMPL -2.86%).\nIn a direct listing, a company simply allows the stock to begin trading on a public exchange such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. No new shares are issued. Rather, the direct listing gives insiders an opportunity to sell their shares on the open market. Going through a direct listing avoids many of the fees associated with underwriters and the need to go through a \"road show,\" or presenting the investment opportunity to institutional investors. It also eliminates the lock-up period necessary for IPOs, allowing insiders and employees to immediately sell their shares.\nA direct listing doesn't raise new capital the way an IPO does; no new shares are offered. It's also riskier in some ways than an IPO since there isn't an underwriter to help drum up demand for the stock. Direct listings tend to work best for well-known companies with an interested investor base and a clear value proposition.\nDutch auctions are also an option for companies seeking to go public without an IPO, although they are less common. Alphabet (GOOG -0.3%) (GOOGL -0.27%) is perhaps the best-known company to go public through a Dutch auction, using the technique in 2004. In a Dutch auction, potential buyers list the price they're willing to pay, and, when the company believes the price is high enough, it sells new shares at that price. Unlike a direct listing, Dutch auctions raise new capital.\nAre IPO stocks good investments?\nAlthough IPOs can be good for the issuing companies, they're not always great for individual investors. Investing in IPOs can be profitable, but it is generally much riskier than investing in blue chip stocks or mature companies. The prices of newly issued stocks often fluctuate wildly on the first trading days because it's not always easy for the stock to find its equilibrium price.\nHowever, IPO stocks can generate huge returns when they succeed. Some of today's top public companies completed their IPOs just a few years ago:\n- Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) debuted on the Nasdaq for $38 a share in 2012 and now trades at prices above $300.\n- Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) priced its 2010 IPO at a split-adjusted $3.40 per share. The stock price skyrocketed in 2020 and is now above $1,000 a share, representing a gain of roughly 30,000%.\n- E-commerce juggernaut Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has jumped more than 6,000% from its 2015 IPO price of $17 to more than $1,000.\nOf course, for every big IPO winner, there are a number of losers, most of which are quickly forgotten by the market. Lyft (LYFT 0.37%), for example, debuted in 2019 at $72, but it is down roughly 50% since then. The ridesharing company was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and visions of self-driving cars haven't been fulfilled. Earlier high-profile tech IPOs such as GoPro (GPRO -7.09%) and Fitbit also flopped, leading to billions of dollars in losses for investors.\nRelated Investing Topics\nIPO stocks can be great investments, but, historically, most underperform the market. The stock market, especially the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) -- as a large-cap benchmark index -- is generally composed of successful, profitable companies. Failing and failed companies don't continue to be listed by major indexes.\nIPO stocks, which are unproven, may not live up to their potential. Before investing in IPO stocks, take the time to vet the issuing companies carefully.\nFAQs\nWhat does IPO stand for?\nInitial public offering\nWhat does IPO mean?\nIPO refers to the time when a privately held company offers shares of itself to the public for the first time, trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nWhat does it mean when a company goes public?\nIt means that that company has made its stock available to retail investors for the first time.\nShould you invest in IPOs?\nYou should invest according to your personal risk tolerance, with the knowledge that most IPOs underperform the market."

      "text": "The economy moves in a cycle with four basic stages:\n- Expansion: A period of sustained growth.\n- Peak: A time of slowing growth.\n- Contraction: A period of economic decline, also called a recession.\n- Trough: A transitional time when the economy stops declining and begins to recover.\nThis cycle can have a significant impact on industries tied to economic growth. Stocks in those sectors tend to be very cyclical. Corporate profits typically rise during an expansion and contract during a recession, taking the price of cyclical stocks with them. This cyclicality contrasts with other types of stocks that tend to generate steady profits in good times or bad, making them relatively recession-proof.\nThe economy has been in an expansion phase for the past several years. This continued growth has come even though the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates high to tame inflation. While higher rates have slowed the economy, it's not yet clear whether it's nearing a peak or just taking a breather. However, the uncertainty has caused a lot of volatility in cyclical stocks.\nHere\u2019s what you should know about investing in cyclical stocks.\nWhat is a cyclical stock?\nWhat is a cyclical stock?\nA cyclical stock is one whose underlying business generally follows the economic cycle of expansion and recession. Cyclical businesses perform well during economic expansions but typically experience significantly declining sales and profits during recessions and other challenging economic times.\nCyclical stocks tend to move up and down in value alongside the market.\nBest cyclical stocks to buy in 2025\nBest cyclical stocks to buy in 2025\nWhile the economy has been expanding since 2020, it seemed to be nearing a cyclical peak in 2022 when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to curb inflation. However, the economy has proven to be more resilient than many expected and still hasn't experienced a recession as of early 2025. Nonetheless, the rise in interest rates has still had an effect on cyclical stocks.\nDespite this impact, some cyclical stocks have longer-term tailwinds that should enable them to thrive even if economic headwinds grow stronger. With that in mind, here are four top cyclical stocks that should still thrive in the coming year:\n1. The Walt Disney Company\nEntertainment giant Disney (DIS 0.11%) has some cyclicality to its business. Consumers reduce their spending on discretionary purchases, such as vacations during a recession. That affects Disney\u2019s experiences (parks, cruises, and vacation clubs) and other consumer products businesses.\nHowever, despite concerns about the economy, Disney is seeing resilient demand for the experiences it offers. In its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, revenue for U.S. parks and experiences increased by 3%, while consumer product revenue rose by 1%. Meanwhile, another entertainment offering, Disney+, continues to add subscribers as more people switch to streaming.\nDisney could buck the economic cycle by continuing to boost its revenue and earnings in the coming years. The company expects to deliver high-single-digit growth in its adjusted earnings per share in its 2025 fiscal year. Meanwhile, Disney is anticipating double-digit earnings growth for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n2. Airbnb\nAirbnb (ABNB -2.23%) is a leading online vacation rental platform. While demand for vacations tends to decline during a recession, Airbnb's platform should prove to be very resilient. \"Airbnb is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was several years ago,\" the company wrote in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter. \"We're continuing to build on this momentum in 2025, executing a multiyear strategy to perfect the core service, accelerate growth in global markets, and launch and scale new offerings.\"\nThe company wants its app to be a lot like Amazon (AMZN -0.7%). It aims to be the go-to source for travel and living needs. The company intends to build several new businesses in the coming years. It plans to start by investing in experiences that enhance user stays, such as tours led by locals. Airbnb also anticipates expanding into other new areas, like partnering with companies like grocery stores and cleaning services. The company's expansion strategy should enable it to continue growing in the future, even if there's a cyclical downturn in travel.\n3. EPR Properties\nEPR Properties (EPR -1.93%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on owning experiential real estate such as movie theaters, ski resorts, eat-and-play locations, and other attractions. Demand for these experiences tends to decline during a recession. However, that won't have as much of an impact on EPR Properties due to its business model.\nThe REIT leases its properties to operating tenants under long-term triple net (NNN) agreements. Those leases supply it with a very stable rental income. It pays out a meaningful portion of its steady cash flow via its monthly dividend. EPR reinvests the rest into buying additional income-producing experiential properties. Those investments help grow its rental income, which should enable the REIT to continue increasing its dividend even during a recession.\n4. Nucor\nSteel producer Nucor (NUE -0.91%) tends to be highly cyclical since demand for steel ebbs and flows with the economy. When the economy is expanding, companies use more steel to construct buildings, cars, and other industrial goods. However, demand for steel tends to decline during a recession.\nWhile Nucor could eventually see a slowdown in steel demand, it's benefiting from an increase in infrastructure spending. The company's business also has proven more resilient than others in the steel sector over the years, as shown by its dividend. As of late 2024, Nucor had paid 207 consecutive quarterly dividends. It has increased its dividend payment for 52 straight years -- every single year since it first started paying dividends in 1973, qualifying it as a Dividend King, or a company with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases.\nExamples\nExamples of cyclical industries\nIt's not practical to list every cyclical industry. However, to give you a good idea of some of the sectors prone to cyclicality, here are eight prominent and easy-to-understand examples:\n- Airlines: During good economic times, individuals and businesses tend to be more willing and able to spend money on airline tickets than during lean periods.\n- Hotels: Like airlines, hotels depend on individuals and businesses spending money on travel.\n- Retail: During economic contractions, people tend to spend less on discretionary retail goods. However, retailers primarily selling things that people need are not as cyclical, especially when they prioritize offering discounts. Walmart (WMT 0.18%) can be considered countercyclical since the company's sales often increase during tough times.\n- Restaurants: During economic downturns, people eat at home more often than they do during prosperous times, and restaurant stocks often suffer as a result.\n- Automakers: Consumers tend to hang on to their vehicles longer when recessions hit and are more inclined to buy new vehicles in prosperous times, so automaker stocks tend to be quite cyclical.\n- Technology: Most (but not all) tech stocks are cyclical. Individuals and businesses are less inclined to spend money on the latest technologies and electronic devices during recessions.\n- Banks: Bank stocks are cyclical. In a recession, the profitability of banks often declines. Recessions reduce demand for banking products, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, and more consumers who already have loans struggle to pay their debts. In addition, interest rates usually fall during recessions, causing bank profit margins to contract.\n- Manufacturing: In tough times, companies that manufacture physical products generally experience plunging demand as individuals and businesses spend less on pretty much everything.\nMany of the sectors mentioned above, such as automotive and retail, are consumer-facing industries and, therefore, part of the consumer cyclical sector. Consumer cyclicals are consumer discretionary goods that, unlike consumer staples, aren't strictly necessary purchases.\nConsumer cyclicals are divided into two subcategories: durable and non-durable. Durable cyclicals include physical consumer goods that have long useful lives (e.g., vehicles). Non-durable cyclicals have shorter useful lives or are consumed quickly (e.g., clothing and prepared foods).\nEach recession is different. An economic downturn might not affect all cyclical stocks in the same way. For example, while technology stocks tend to be cyclical, heavy investments in new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) could continue driving growth for this sector, even if there's a recession in the next couple of years.\nExamples of non-cyclical industries\nSome types of businesses aren't affected much by economic cycles. The stocks of these companies are non-cyclical and are known as defensive stocks or recession-proof investments. They tend to perform similarly during both economic contractions and expansions.\nHere are a few of the most prominent non-cyclical industries:\n- Non-discretionary retail are companies selling things that people need, and they tend to be rather resilient in nature. In addition to big-box retailers such as Walmart, drugstores and grocery stores fit into this category.\n- Utilities stocks tend to be highly defensive since consumers (for the most part) continue to pay their electric and water bills even during the deepest recessions.\n- Real estate is another sector that can be considered defensive, although the degree of defensiveness of a stock depends on the nature of the company's properties. For example, REITs that focus on necessity retail or medical office buildings usually perform better in difficult economies than those that invest in hotels. However, the industry does have some cyclicality related to interest rates. Rising rates tend to weigh on real estate values while falling rates benefit the sector.\nThat said, the nature of a recession or downturn can have surprising effects on normally defensive holdings. For example, a severe recession can weigh on even the most defensive stocks as investors pivot to even lower-risk investments such as bonds or cash until the dust settles.\nExamples of cyclical and defensive stocks\nTo give you some concrete ideas of the types of stocks we're talking about, here are some common cyclical and defensive stocks:\nCyclical stocks\n- JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.2%)\n- Apple (AAPL -0.92%)\n- General Motors (GM 0.93%)\n- Boeing (BA -1.43%)\n- Texas Roadhouse (TXRH 1.17%)\nDefensive stocks\n- Dominion Energy (D -0.51%)\n- Costco (COST 0.79%)\n- Equity Residential (EQR -1.42%)\n- General Mills (GIS -0.96%)\n- Coca-Cola (KO 0.62%)\nTo be clear, none of the companies on these lists are perfectly cyclical or perfectly defensive. Depending on the circumstances of a specific recession, some of the cyclical names could do relatively well. Meanwhile, the defensive stocks could see profits significantly decline. However, these are still good examples of stocks that generally behave either cyclically or defensively.\nRelated investing topics\nWhen should you buy cyclical stocks?\nIn a perfect world, the best investment strategy would be to buy cyclical stocks at the start of an economic expansion and to sell them just before a recession. But trying to predict the timing of a future recession or expansion is a losing battle.\nOwning a combination of cyclical and defensive stocks in your portfolio is smarter. You'll be well-positioned to prosper when the economy is growing but also will have some downside protection when the economy contracts."

      "text": "Lithium, the elemental metal, is a much-discussed commodity these days. It's used to manufacture batteries, notably for electric vehicles (EVs), so many investors feel optimistic about companies that produce and refine the basic material.\nHowever, anyone investing in the sector should prepare for a wild ride. The price of lithium carbonate (used in batteries) rocketed almost sevenfold from the summer of 2021 to the fall of 2022, only to fall back down to 2021 levels in early 2025.\nAutomakers and battery manufacturers accelerated investment in EVs during the COVID-19 pandemic but then pulled back as relatively high interest rates constrained auto sales, including EVs. The resulting oversupply of lithium caused the lithium price to fall through 2023 and into 2025.\nEven with the oversupply, soaring battery demand from EVs and energy storage (saving power for later distribution to the electric grid) have some investors anticipating a solid recovery in lithium demand in the next few years.\nIn the U.S., the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a significant step towards a greener future, allocated $5 billion in federal funding for EV charging stations. Also, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was passed to provide credits for consumers, further supporting former President Joe Biden's ambitious goal of EVs accounting for 50 percent or more of new auto sales by 2030. With such strong government support and automakers aligning their strategies, the future demand for lithium looks promising.\nThat said, automakers have pared back EV investment plans, and the rate of growth of EV adoption has slowed compared to previous estimates.\nHere's what you need to know before considering an investment in this essential material used in battery development.\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nFour leading lithium stocks\nFour leading lithium stocks to consider in 2025\nLike any basic materials and metals investment, betting on lithium isn't for the faint of heart. Soaring demand for a material used in manufacturing doesn't automatically equate to higher sales and profits for a company. Supply also plays a hand in the market price of the basic material, so when supply outpaces demand, prices fall -- and the material producer's sales can fall, too, even if demand is expanding.\nAs with all mining operations, establishing new lithium projects can be a substantial financial commitment. It often takes several years to reach full production, which can strain a mining company's financial resources. However, the long-term potential of these projects can be a significant draw for investors.\nWhile the long-term outlook is positive, the near term contains many challenges. Growing production in Chile and Argentina is creating a supply glut, while automakers' demand for lithium carbonate remains relatively weak.\nTop lithium stocks for 2025\nHere are four leading lithium producers in the lithium market:\n| Company | Market Cap | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) | $12 billion | Diversified chemicals and base material producer and major lithium producer. |\n| Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) | $9 billion | One of the world's largest suppliers of lithium. |\n| Ganfeng Lithium (OTC:GNEN.F) | $6.1 billion | China's largest producer of lithium. |\n| Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) | $666 million | Has a joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass in Nevada to supply battery-grade lithium carbonate. |\n1 - 2\n1. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile\nAs one of South America's top basic materials and chemical companies, Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) is one of the world's largest producers of lithium used in batteries and other energy storage technologies.\nIts two major shareholders are Chile's Pampa Group (a mining company), owning 26%, and China's Tianqi (an EV battery metal processor), owning 22%.\nThe company is currently highly reliant on Chilean resources, and it remains to be seen how state control of lithium will affect SQM's ability to generate a profit.\nSQM predicts demand for lithium will outpace supply over the long term, so it has been investing to increase its production capacity. With recent improvements now complete, the company claims it will be able to increase its market share in supplying lithium, mainly for EV batteries. However, its outlook for 2025 includes an expectation that excess battery material capacity will continue through the year.\n2. Albemarle\nMining and chemical producer Albemarle is leading the charge in global lithium output. Among the company's biggest customers is Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY), which manufactures lithium batteries for everything from small consumer electronics to EVs. Samsung (SSNL.F 9.01%) and Corning (GLW -1.25%) are also significant customers.\nAlthough lithium prices can be volatile and will ultimately guide the direction of Albemarle's sales, the company has proven itself over the years to be a durable mining operation that can bring lithium to market.\nThe company swung to a net loss of $1.2 billion in 2024 due to the collapse in lithium prices, and management is reacting by cutting capital expenditures and other costs to solidify its balance sheet while waiting for an upturn in the lithium market.\nIt's an excellent place to start if you are looking for exposure to the upside potential of the price of lithium carbonate, but investors will need to be patient and have the stomach to tolerate bad news in the short term.\n3 - 4\n3. Ganfeng Lithium\nOn the other side of the Pacific, Ganfeng Lithium is China's largest producer of base materials for lithium battery manufacturing. Given the sheer size of China's population (1.4 billion) and the rapid rise in EV sales, Ganfeng is well positioned as a top supplier to EV manufacturers based in China and manufacturers based elsewhere, such as Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) and BMW (BMW 0.3%).\nThe company is well capitalized with cash and manageable debt, and it has generated healthy profit margins. With China now dominating the EV market, the company has a bright future.\n4. Lithium Americas\nLegacy automakers have big plans to electrify their vehicle lineups in the coming years, which means millions of new EVs could be sold. The potential trend has led to a big jump in smaller, more speculative lithium stocks such as Canada-based Lithium Americas.\nLithium Americas currently doesn't generate any revenue. The value of the company lies in its joint venture with General Motors (GM 0.93%) to fund, develop, construct, and operate a commercial mine and chemical manufacturing operation in Thacker Pass, Nevada.\nThe company expects to complete Phase 1 of the project in late 2027, with an expectation of producing 40,000 tonnes per year of battery-grade lithium. As such, investors are hoping demand will pick up in time for the start of the project. Lithium Americas is a highly speculative stock that will attract enterprising investors, but most investors will want to tread lightly with these speculative bets.\nRelated investing topics\nStaying diversified\nStaying diversified\nTo help lessen wild swings in value, consider buying a lithium ETF such as the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT 5.55%) or invest in a basket of lithium stocks such as the ones listed above. Given the ups and downs in lithium production, keep any investment in this niche of the mining and chemicals industry small and stay focused on the long term.\nFAQ\nLithium stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best lithium stock to buy?\nFor investors looking for exposure to the price of lithium, Albemarle looks like the safest bet, with Lithium Americas an option for risk-seeking speculative investors.\nIs it worth investing in lithium stocks?\nThe sector is only worth looking at if you believe future demand coming from the EV industry and ongoing supply restraints on lithium are likely to send the price of lithium higher.\nWhat lithium company does Tesla use?\nTesla has agreements with Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) and Ganfeng to supply lithium. In addition, Tesla owns the rights to a Nevada lithium mine."

      "text": "A REIT (pronounced REET), or real estate investment trust, is an entity that holds a portfolio of commercial real estate or real estate loans. Congress created REITs in 1960 to provide all investors, especially retail investors, with access to income-producing commercial real estate. REITs combine the best features of real estate and stock investment.\nThis guide will walk you through everything you need to know about real estate investing through REITs. We\u2019ll cover the types of REITs, REIT pros and cons, how to invest in REITs, and what qualifies a company as a REIT.\nTypes of REITs\nTypes of REITs\nThere are several types of REITs. Let's start with classifying REITs by access:\n- Publicly traded REITs trade on major stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Exchange. Anyone with a brokerage account can invest in a publicly traded REIT. Publicly traded REITs must register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide audited financial reports.\n- Public non-traded REITs are also open to all investors but don't trade on stock exchanges. Investors can purchase public non-traded REITs through their financial advisor or on online portals sometimes known as real estate crowdfunding platforms. Public non-traded REITs also must register with the SEC and provide audited financial information.\n- Private non-traded REITs aren't available to the public. They're usually only open to high-income earners or high-net-worth individuals. Private non-traded REITs are exempt from SEC registration.\nWithin those REIT types are three subcategories by asset type:\n- Equity REITs own and operate income-producing real estate such as apartments, office buildings, and warehouses.\n- Mortgage REITs, or mREITs, provide financing for real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and earning fixed income from the interest on these investments. They typically hold a portfolio of income-producing mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or other real estate-backed loans.\n- Hybrid REITs invest in a combination of income-producing real estate and real estate-backed loans.\nFinally, we'll look at the dozen equity REIT types by sector or property type:\n- Office REITs own and manage office real estate such as skyscrapers and office parks. Many office REITs focus on a specific region (New York City or the West Coast, for example) or a type of tenant (technology companies, government agencies, or biotech).\n- Industrial REITs own and manage industrial facilities such as warehouses, distribution centers, light manufacturing, or cold storage. Many of these properties are crucial for e-commerce. Most industrial REITs focus on a specific industrial property type or region.\n- Retail REITs own and manage retail real estate such as regional malls, shopping centers, or freestanding retail buildings. Most retail REITs will focus on a specific property type such as grocery-anchored shopping centers or freestanding retail properties triple net leased to essential retailers such as convenience stores and pharmacies.\n- Hospitality REITs own hotels and resorts, usually managed by a third-party hotel brand. They rent space in these properties to guests on a nightly or weekly basis.\n- Residential REITs own and manage residential real estate such as apartment communities, single-family homes, and manufactured home parks that they rent out to residents. Residential REITs focus on a specific property type.\n- Timberland REITs own and manage timberland. They specialize in harvesting and selling timber. Some timberland REITs also own wood products manufacturing facilities and sell portions of their real estate for other uses such as a housing development.\n- Healthcare REITs own and manage healthcare-related real estate such as senior living facilities, hospitals, medical office buildings, and skilled nursing facilities. They lease these properties back to healthcare systems that operate the facilities.\n- Self-storage REITs own and manage self-storage facilities that they rent to individuals and businesses.\n- Infrastructure REITs own and manage infrastructure such as fiber cables, telecommunications towers, and energy pipelines. They lease capacity on this infrastructure to mobile carriers or energy companies.\n- Data center REITs own and manage data storage facilities. They lease space in these facilities to technology companies and other businesses to house servers and other equipment. These REITs also provide an uninterruptible power supply, a regulated temperature, and physical security.\n- Diversified REITs own and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate. For example, they might have a portfolio of office properties, industrial real estate, and retail properties. Some diversified REITs focus on specific markets, owning a mix of residential, retail, and office properties in one city, while others are diversified by property type and geography.\n- Specialty REITs own and manage unique properties such as movie theaters, casinos, farmland, outdoor advertising, or ground leases.\nRelated investing topics\nPros and cons\nREIT pros and cons\nInvesting in REITs has several benefits, including:\n- They usually pay above-average dividend yields compared to other stocks, making them ideal for those seeking passive income from real estate.\n- They offer diversification from the stock market since REITs tend to be less volatile than other stocks.\n- REITs don't pay federal corporate income tax, shielding investors from \"double taxation.\"\n- They offer attractive total return potential, e.g., stock price appreciation plus dividend income.\n- Publicly traded REITs offer greater liquidity compared to owning real estate outright.\n- Public REITs are highly transparent, including providing audited financial statements.\n- Lower cost compared to buying commercial real estate outright.\nHowever, REITs also have some drawbacks, including:\n- Higher tax liabilities because REITs pay nonqualified dividends. Because of that, REITs are often best held in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA.\n- Sensitivity to changes in interest rates. REIT stock prices often decline as interest rates rise.\n- Property-specific risks such as tenant move-outs, industry headwinds, and technological disruption.\n- The risks of using too much debt.\nHow to buy REITs\nHow to buy in REITs\nInvestors have many ways to invest in REITs. The easiest is to buy shares of publicly traded REITs through a brokerage account. An investor could purchase a diversified REIT or invest in several different REITs to build a diversified portfolio. REITs are relatively inexpensive to buy, with most trading below $100 a share.\nAnother way to invest broadly across the REIT sector is to buy a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on REITs. REIT ETFs and REIT mutual funds are also easy to buy and relatively inexpensive to purchase.\nFinally, you can invest in public non-traded REITs through a financial advisor or a real estate crowdfunding portal. That makes them a little more challenging to purchase. They also often have higher minimum investments, usually $2,500 or more to start.\nHow does a company qualify as a REIT?\nHow does a company qualify as a REIT?\nCompanies must meet specific criteria to qualify as a REIT, which receive special tax treatment so they don't pay corporate income tax. These qualifications include:\n- REITs must pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends each year. Many REITs will pay out more than 100% of their taxable income because their cash flow, measured by funds from operation (FFO), is often higher than income due to depreciation.\n- Be an entity that would be taxable as a corporation.\n- A board of directors or trustees must manage them.\n- They must have fully transferable shares.\n- Have a minimum of 100 shareholders after its first year as a REIT.\n- Have no more than 50% of its shares held by five or fewer people during the last half of its taxable year.\n- They must invest at least 75% of total assets in real estate assets or cash.\n- Get at least 75% of its gross income from real estate-related sources, including rents from real property, interest on mortgages, financing real property, and the sale of real estate.\n- A REIT must get at least 95% of its overall gross income from those real estate sources and dividends or interest from any source. In other words, 75% of its gross income must come from real estate, and only 5% can come from sources other than real estate, dividends, and interest income.\n- Have no more than 25% of its assets in non-qualifying securities or stock in a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nREITs often make great passive income investments\nCongress created REITs so that anyone could own income-producing real estate. REITs must pay a dividend, making them a great way to earn passive income. Add in their diversification benefits and historical returns, and REITs can be an excellent investment option."

      "text": "Dividend Kings have a long history of delivering market-beating returns for investors and proving to be generally steady, safe holdings. A Dividend King is a company that's grown its dividend payment for at least 50 consecutive years.\nCompanies that pay -- and then grow -- their dividends every year generally have the sort of characteristics investors should look for:\n- Durable competitive moats that help them generate steady profits year after year.\n- Some ability to grow earnings per share over the long term.\n- Prudent board members and management who prioritize returning excess profits not needed for reinvestment back to shareholders.\nWhat is a Dividend King?\nWhat is a Dividend King?\nWhat's the most exclusive group of dividend stocks? It might not be what first comes to mind.\nMany investors are familiar with the Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae. (The term Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC.) These stocks are members of the S&P 500 that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\nBut there's an even more elite group of dividend stocks that doesn't receive as much attention. Dividend Kings don't have to be members of the S&P 500, but they must reach an ultramarathon-like dividend streak -- at least 50 consecutive years of payout growth.\nHere's what you need to know about the Dividend Kings and how they can fit into your investment portfolio.\n2025 Dividend Kings\n2025 Dividend Kings list\nThese 55 stocks qualified as Dividend Kings as of March 3, 2025, including two \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings that qualify depending on how you interpret dividend growth.\n| Dividend King | Sector | Dividend Increase Streak |\n|---|---|---|\n| American States Water (NYSE:AWR) | Utilities | 70 |\n| Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) | Industrials | 69 |\n| Northwest Natural Holding (NYSE:NWN) | Utilities | 69 |\n| Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) | Consumer Goods | 69 |\n| Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) | Industrials | 68 |\n| Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) | Consumer Goods | 68 |\n| Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) | Industrials | 68 |\n| Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) | Financials | 65 |\n| Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) | Consumer Goods | 63 |\n| Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) | Healthcare | 62 |\n| Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) | Consumer Goods | 62**** |\n| Lancaster Colony (NASDAQ:LANC) | Consumer Goods | 62 |\n| Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) | Consumer Goods | 61 |\n| Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) | Industrials | 53 |\n| Nordson (NASDAQ:NDSN) | Industrials | 61 |\n| Farmers & Merchants Bancorp (OTC:FMCB) | Financials | 59 |\n| Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) | Consumer Goods | 59 |\n| California Water Service Group (NYSE:CWT) | Utilities | 58 |\n| Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) | Consumer Goods | 58** |\n| ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) | INdustrials | 57 |\n| Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) | Real Estate | 57 |\n| Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) | Industrials | 57 |\n| Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) | Financials | 57 |\n| SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) | Utilities | 57 |\n| Stepan (NYSE:SCL) | Industrials | 57 |\n| H.B.

This shouldn't be a surprise. Companies in these sectors tend to pay dividends and raise their prices with inflation, and many have also been in operation for a long time. The list breaks down as follows:\n- 16 industrial companies\n- 16 consumer goods\n- 9 utility stocks\n- 4 healthcare stocks\n- 6 financial stocks\n- 1 energy stock\n- 1 materials stock\n- 1 real estate stock\n- 1 tech stock\nThere aren't any exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus exclusively on Dividend Kings. However, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL -0.22%) owns shares of all Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae.\nChanges in 2025\nDividend King changes in 2025\nAlthough there's some risk that a potential recession could upend one or more of these dividend streaks, companies that make this list rarely lose their status. There's tremendous pressure on companies that have increased their dividends for 50-plus years to keep their streak going. No CEO wants to be known as the leader who messed up an impressive dividend track record.\nChief Executive Officer (CEO)\nConversely, it takes a half-century to make this list, a rare feat indeed. Yet we have recently seen several companies achieve Dividend King status. Automatic Data Processing joined the exclusive club in 2024. So far in 2025, we have added one new Dividend King, RLI Corp, with its dividend increase in February adding it to the royal list.\nThese stocks are now former Dividend Kings\nDespite management's efforts (or often because of them), not all companies stay on the list. In 2024, two former Dividend Kings cut their payouts, losing status.\nLeggett & Platt (LEG -1.4%) was the first, slashing its dividend in April, ending a 52-year run of dividend growth. 3M (MMM 1.31%) cut its payout more recently, lowering the dividend in May and bringing its six-decade growth streak to an end. In the case of both companies, bloated expenses, weak growth, and a number of acquisitions that haven't gone well played a role in the financial results weakening and eventually leading to a need to cut the payout.\nTwo \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nA note on two \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nWe have added Canadian Utilities and Tootsie Roll Industries to this list. Both have characteristics that make them Dividend Kings, though some investors may argue they make the cut on a technicality or two.\nCanadian Utilities is certainly a king if you're a Canadian investor; however, the changes in foreign exchange rates have recently made the effective dividend paid to U.S. investors fall. We don't want to shortchange the company or our Canadian investors because of this. The money the company has paid from its coffers every year has indeed increased for 53 years in a row.\nTootsie Roll is a little more complex. To start, the company has a long history of paying a dividend, but the $0.09 quarterly cash portion of the dividend has remained unchanged for years. Its payout has grown via the 3% stock dividend it also pays every year. So long as the stock price increases in value, the total dividends paid grows. We thought this quirk was worth explaining in detail.\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nThree key factors could affect many stocks in 2025, including several of the Dividend Kings:\n- Inflation\n- Interest rates\n- A possible recession tied to the two factors above\nThese factors could benefit some stocks but hurt others. Here are three Dividend Kings that could be winners in 2025:\n1. Target\nTarget has been on a seriously rough ride in recent years. Like many other big-box retailers, the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges left the company with too many of the wrong goods and rising costs, pressuring its cash flow following the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe expectations of its e-commerce-driven business during the pandemic, along with some continued struggles with inventory and store-level execution, have weighed on its business in recent years, pulling shares to some of the lowest levels in the past five years. And while the business hasn't delivered the growth many expected, it's in far better shape than the stock would have many investors believe.\nIts e-commerce investments and large physical presence are a powerful combination that should serve Target well. Target is a major supplier of consumer staples, and even as consumers feel the pinch on their discretionary spending, Target is built to profit across economic environments.\nTrading for a cheap valuation and paying a safe dividend, Target looks like a great Dividend King to buy today and hold for the long term.\n2. Altria\nSome investors look at the tobacco giant with disdain; others simply won't buy a company whose products cause so much harm. But if that's not a concern for you, Altria should be on your list.\nThe company has had a number of missteps around vaping products in recent years, and its ability to crack the cannabis market isn't clear (nor is the future of cannabis's legality in many of Altria's markets).\nHowever, it continues to generate mountains of cash -- $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters -- and returns much of that, $6.8 billion, to shareholders in dividend income. It also sells a product its customers buy across every economic condition, making its sizable dividend safe in every economic environment.\n3. Johnson & Johnson\nAnother Dividend King that's gone through a tumultuous past several years is Johnson & Johnson (J&J). However, the healthcare giant could emerge as a winning stock this year. To start, today's J&J is a more streamlined business, having divested Kenvue, its consumer products business, in 2023. Now, the company is focused on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and technology exclusively.\nOver the past few years, J&J stock hasn't made for a great investment even with dividend growth, returning under 9% in total over the past three years. However, despite the paltry return in recent years, the five- and 10-year returns are better, at closer to 8% per year on average even with the recent weakness. With the company now lean and focused on its core pharma and medical devices businesses, 2025 could be a great year to add J&J to your long-term dividend growth portfolio.\nFuture Dividend Kings\nFuture Dividend Kings\nHere are some notable companies close to King status, and how long their current dividend growth streak is:\nThere are several large, well-known companies that are also primed to join the Dividend Kings list in the next half-decade. We will update the list as they move closer!\nRelated investing topics\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nDividend Kings aren't necessarily a good fit for every investor. Many of these stocks frequently deliver relatively low growth and may or may not prove better investments than the stock market average. For example, of the 10 Dividend Kings with the longest records for dividend increases, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, while six of the 10 have outperformed since 1990.\nIn other cases, their long records of growing payouts can make them reliable income generators, but being a Dividend King is no promise of market-beating returns.\nDividend Kings can be a great component of retirement portfolios or for investors looking for reliable income. Most of these stocks offer higher dividend yields than the average yield of S&P 500 members. Their consistency in paying and increasing dividend payouts can also provide a measure of confidence for anyone, depending on income generated by the dividend stocks they own.\nFAQ\nDividend Kings FAQ\nAre Dividend Kings a good investment?\nIn general, Dividend Kings as a group are solid investments. However, each company presents its own individual risks and opportunities and should not be bought just because it's a Dividend King. That said, as part of a broad, diversified portfolio, Dividend King stocks can be a great way to build and maintain wealth and generate income.\nWhat is considered a Dividend King?\nA Dividend King is a publicly traded company that has both paid and increased a regular dividend every year for at least 50 consecutive years.\nWhat is the highest-yielding Dividend King in 2025?\nAs of late 2024, Altria had the highest yield, about 9.56% at recent prices. The tobacco products giant often has a very high yield, with the stock typically trading for a below-average earnings multiple that keeps shares cheap and the yield high.\nWhat is the highest-paying Dividend King?\nThe Dividend King with the highest yield is Altria, with a 9.56% yield as of late 2024."

      "text": "Hydrogen is an energy source that emits no greenhouse gases when burned. The only waste product is water vapor, making it a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal.\nThe drawback of hydrogen as a fuel source is that it's rarely found in an easily extractable form. Although hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, most methods emit greenhouse gases. Furthermore, it has not yet been produced at the scale needed to be economically competitive with fossil fuels.\nHowever, that could change in the coming years. Several companies are working hard to tap into the enormous promise of this potentially emission-free fuel.\nHow to invest\nWhat to know about investing in hydrogen\nThere are several ways to produce hydrogen. Some methods produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. For example, the industry describes hydrogen obtained from burning natural gas as \"blue hydrogen.\" Using this form of hydrogen requires carbon capture and storage (CCS) to sequester the associated carbon dioxide underground to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.\nCarbon Credits\nAnother method uses renewable energy to power an electrolyzer that splits hydrogen from water molecules. This process produces \"green hydrogen,\" which results in no carbon emissions. Green and blue are two of the many colors used to classify hydrogen by its production method and emissions profile.\nHydrogen fuel cells work much like batteries, generating electricity through an electrochemical reaction. However, hydrogen fuel cells are refueled with more hydrogen rather than being recharged like a traditional battery. We could use hydrogen fuel cells for motorized vehicles (e.g., cars, trains, buses, maritime vessels, and trucks) and as a stationary power source.\nSome advocates contend that, with some modifications, hydrogen might eventually replace natural gas in the pipeline system. It could then be used in power plants to generate electricity and as a fuel source for our homes. Because of its potential, some forecasts peg the future value of the clean hydrogen market as high as $11 trillion.\nAlthough clean hydrogen holds great promise as a potential emissions-free fuel source, it's costly to produce. It costs about $1.50 per kilogram to produce hydrogen from natural gas and $5 per kilogram to produce clean hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy wants to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram over the next decade to make it a more competitive fuel source.\nBest stocks\nBest hydrogen stocks to buy in 2025\nGiven the potential of clean hydrogen, a growing number of companies are investing in the sector. Many energy and industrial companies are in the early stages of exploring the possibility of hydrogen energy.\nHowever, a handful of companies are already emerging as early leaders in the sector. Here are five leading hydrogen companies to keep an eye on as the industry matures.\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|\n| Linde (NASDAQ:LIN) | $221 billion | Chemicals |\n| Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) | $9 billion | Electrical Equipment |\n| Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) | $2 billion | Electrical Equipment |\n| BP (NYSE:BP) | $88 billion | Oil, Gas and Consumable Fuels |\n| Air Products And Chemicals (NYSE:APD) | $63 billion | Chemicals |\nHere's a closer look at some of the best hydrogen stocks to buy as the sector starts taking center stage in the coming years.\n1. Air Products\n1. Air Products\nAir Products (APD -1.62%) is a global leader in supplying industrial gases and liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing technology and equipment. It's also one of the world's largest suppliers of merchant hydrogen and a leader in hydrogen fuel infrastructure. It has more than 100 hydrogen plants with the capacity to produce 7 million kilograms of fuel each day.\nAir Products aspires to be a leader in providing solutions to the world's energy and environmental challenges through gasification, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen. It has several major hydrogen projects underway that it expects to complete in the coming years.\nFor example, it's investing $4.5 billion to build the world's largest blue hydrogen facility in Louisiana. When it comes online, the project is projected to capture and permanently store more than 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This project is one of several that are under development as part of its multibillion-dollar backlog of hydrogen and energy transition projects.\nHowever, despite its leadership in hydrogen, Air Products has run into issues expanding its business. The company noted in its first-quarter earnings report in May 2025 that about $5 billion of its capital projects are underperforming in their objectives, which includes three hydrogen projects.\nThe company also canceled three other projects in early 2025, including its proposed $500 million Massena green hydrogen project in upstate New York, due to regulatory and market changes. Despite those issues, the company remains committed to continuing its investment in hydrogen.\n2. BP\n2. BP\nBP (BP -0.6%) is a global oil and gas producer with grand lower-carbon energy ambitions. It set a goal to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier. Hydrogen is an aspect of its strategy. BP intends to grow its hydrogen business by investing in five to seven hydrogen and CCS projects worldwide.\nFor example, the company partnered with Iberdrola (IBDRY 0.08%) to build a 25-megawatt green hydrogen project at its Castellon refinery. It expects the project to be operational in the second half of 2026.\nMeanwhile, the company selected Cummins (CMI 0.33%) to supply a 100-megawatt proton exchange membrane electrolyzer for its largest project (Lingen) in Germany, which could produce as much as 11,000 tons of green hydrogen annually once commissioned in 2027.\nThe company is also planning to build H2Teesside, one of the largest blue hydrogen facilities in the U.K. However, BP did cancel its HyGreen Teesside project, its first planned green hydrogen project in the U.K.\n3. Plug Power\n3. Plug Power\nPlug Power (PLUG 4.64%) is a pioneer in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. It created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology and has deployed an industry-leading 69,000 fuel cell systems for the e-mobility market (using electric powertrain technologies to power vehicles and fleets).\nIt's one of the world's largest hydrogen buyers and operates a leading hydrogen refueling network in North America with more than 250 fueling stations. Plug Power is building an end-to-end green hydrogen network to produce, store, and deliver the fuel across North America and Europe.\nThe company's strategy is to build the world's first green hydrogen ecosystem. Plug Power is developing several green hydrogen production plants, which it expects to be operational by the end of 2028.\nThose growth projects, combined with Plug's Project Quantum Leap cost-cutting initiatives, position the company for improving cash flows and put it on the path toward profitability. Plug Power also sold stock to raise $280 million in cash in March 2025 to strengthen its financial position. In addition, it signed a $525 million secured credit facility with Yorkville Advisors in late April to bolster its liquidity.\nThe company also reported improving first-quarter results in early May 2025. Its revenue rose from $120.3 million to $133.7 million, while its cash burn rate slowed from $288.3 million in net cash used to $153.1 million.\nCEO Andy Marsh commented in the earnings press release: \"With new capacity online in Louisiana, accelerating adoption of our GenEco electrolyzers, and improved cash flow discipline, Plug is executing with focus and urgency. We're delivering real progress toward profitability and scaling our hydrogen ecosystem to meet growing global demand for clean energy.\"\nIn June 2025, Plug Power expanded its strategic collaboration with Allied Green to Uzbekistan. Plug will supply a new 2-gigawatt (GW) electrolyzer as part of a $5.5 billion green chemical production facility. The project follows a 3-GW electrolyzer deal with Allied in Australia.\n4. Bloom Energy\n4. Bloom Energy\nBloom Energy's (BE 2.12%) mission is to produce clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The company has developed the Bloom Energy Server, an electric power-generation platform. It also created the Bloom Electrolyzer, using the same solid oxide technology as its Bloom Energy Server. The product can produce clean hydrogen 15% to 45% more efficiently than others on the market.\nBloom Energy believes the Bloom Electrolyzer is a major leap forward for hydrogen. It hopes the technology will enable heavy industries, such as steel, chemicals, cement, and glass manufacturing, to decarbonize. Bloom Energy can pair its Bloom Electrolyzer with solar energy and wind energy to generate green hydrogen, which it can store and eventually turn back into electricity for future use.\nDemand for its products is growing, too. For example, in April 2025, Bloom Energy partnered with Conagra Brands (CAG 0.1%) to supply 70% to 75% of the electricity needed to power its facilities in Ohio.\nIt's also becoming the solution of choice for powering artificial intelligence (AI), such as data centers and businesses using the technology for productivity gains. Bloom estimates that by 2030, 27% of data center facilities expect to fully power their operations with on-site generation, providing a large market opportunity for the company's energy servers.\nMeanwhile, the company enhanced its financial flexibility in May 2025. Bloom exchanged $112.8 million of 2.5% green convertible notes due in 2025 for $115.7 million of 3% green convertible notes due in 2029, extending this maturity several years into the future.\n5. Linde\n5. Linde\nLinde (LIN -0.43%) has developed several technologies to efficiently compress and safely refuel hydrogen. It also offers technologies to lower hydrogen's carbon emissions through carbon capture and storage.\nIn 2023, the company agreed to invest $1.8 billion to supply clean energy to a large-scale blue ammonia plant in Texas. Linde plans to build the infrastructure needed to sequester more than 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, offsetting the emissions of the hydrogen supplied to the plant.\nIt signed a deal with oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM -0.89%) to transport and permanently store the captured carbon dioxide. The company expects the project to start in 2025.\nLinde also agreed to invest more than $2 billion in building a clean energy facility to support Dow's (DOW -1.65%) Path2Zero production complex in Canada. Linde expects to complete the facility in 2028. It also signed a deal in 2024 to build a 100-megawatt renewable hydrogen plant for Shell (SHEL -0.34%) in Germany, which it expects will begin commercial operations in 2027.\nIn June 2025, Linde signed a long-term agreement to supply industrial gases to a low-carbon ammonia facility in Louisiana. The new $400 million on-site facility will complement the company's existing hydrogen and syngas infrastructure in the region.\nRelated investing topics\nInvestment considerations\nInvestment considerations for hydrogen stocks\nHydrogen energy has enormous potential. The emissions-free fuel could help decarbonize heavy industry, replace natural gas, and store renewable energy, paving the way for a truly net-zero world. It represents a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity.\nHowever, hydrogen is still developing as a commercially viable fuel source. The industry needs to scale up and reduce costs to become competitive with fossil fuels and other emerging technologies, such as battery storage. The industry also relies on government support in the form of loan guarantees and other tax incentives, which can change based on the outcome of elections.\nGiven these factors, investors should evaluate whether they can handle the risks associated with investing in hydrogen stocks. Many pure-play hydrogen companies are unprofitable, making them more risky.\nMeanwhile, other larger companies involved in the sector make most of their money elsewhere. Investors might want to watch the sector from the sidelines or invest in hydrogen by taking a basket approach (buying several different hydrogen stocks with varying risk profiles).\nFAQ\nHydrogen stocks FAQ\nAre hydrogen stocks worth buying?\nHydrogen stocks can be worth buying. The global hydrogen industry has tremendous growth potential. The fuel could one day replace natural gas for residential, commercial, and industrial usage.\nIt could also be an important low-carbon fuel for the transportation industry. If hydrogen lives up to its promise, companies focused on the sector could see significant revenue and earnings growth, giving their stocks the fuel to skyrocket in the future.\nWho is the largest hydrogen producer in the United States?\nLinde is the largest hydrogen producer in the world (and widely viewed as the top U.S. producer). Its total liquid hydrogen production was 170 tons per day in 2024.\nWhat hydrogen stock is Amazon investing in?\nIn 2022, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) signed a green hydrogen supply deal with Plug Power. The agreement will provide the e-commerce giant with emissions-free fuel to power some of its fleet, starting in 2025. As part of the deal, Amazon received warrants to buy as many as 16 million shares in Plug Power.\nWhich hydrogen ETF is best?\nAs of mid-2025, one exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on hydrogen stocks: Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ: HYDR). The pure-play hydrogen ETF is very small (less than $25 million of assets under management). It has a reasonable ETF expense ratio (0.5%) and holds about 25 hydrogen stocks.\nWhat are the risks of investing in hydrogen stocks?\nHydrogen stocks share many of the same risks as other stocks, including volatility, the potential for mismanagement, the possibility of underperformance, and the risk of permanent loss.\nOn top of that, hydrogen companies face some specific risks. For example, green hydrogen isn't commercially viable at current market prices, many hydrogen companies are unprofitable, and the sector requires government support, which can shift based on election results."

      "text": "Compound annual growth or CAGR is an oft-quoted growth measurement. The metric can be calculated or projected for anything that changes value over time, from individual stocks to entire industries.\nKeep reading to learn what CAGR is, how to calculate it, and how to use it. You'll also find out why you should prioritize CAGR over average returns when assessing an asset's growth history.\nUnderstanding CAGR\nUnderstanding CAGR\nCAGR is the smoothed-out annual growth rate required for an asset to move from a starting value to an ending value. As an example, say you own a share of stock worth $50. Five years later, the stock's market price is $150. CAGR tells you how much the stock would have appreciated annually if the growth was consistent throughout the five years. The formula assumes you take no profits during the measured period.\nIn reality, stocks rarely gain or lose value evenly. A $50 share may go down to $25 and then up to $300 before moderating to $150. CAGR overlooks that volatility for a simpler and more comparable representation of an asset's growth.\nThe CAGR formula\nThe CAGR formula\nYou need three values to calculate CAGR: A beginning value, an ending value, and the number of years being measured. In our example, the beginning value is $50, the ending value is $150, and the number of years is five.\nThe CAGR formula is:\n((((ending value/beginning value) raised to the power of 1/n)-1)x100).\nHere is the formula, broken down into four steps:\n- Divide the beginning value into the ending value. For our example, this would be $150 divided by $50, which equals 3.\n- Divide 1 by the number of years. The answer here for our example is 0.2.\n- Next, you'll use the number from the previous step, 0.2, as an exponent, applied to the number from the first step. In other words, you raise the value calculated in the first step to the power calculated in the second step. A calculator or spreadsheet can do this for you. The rounded answer with our numbers is 1.246.\n- Subtract 1 from 1.246 to get to 0.246. Convert that decimal into a percentage by multiplying by 100. That equates to a CAGR of 24.6%.\nYou can test the calculated CAGR by applying the unrounded percentage to the starting value five times.\n- Year 1: $50 grows to $62.29.\n- Year 2: $62.29 grows to $77.59.\n- Year 3: $77.59 grows to $96.66.\n- Year 4: $96.66 grows to $120.41.\n- Year 5: $120.41 grows to $150.\nWhat you can and can't do with CAGR\nWhat you can and can't do with CAGR\nCAGR is useful for comparing asset behavior. You can use it to evaluate a stock against its peer group or a benchmark index. Or, you can rely on CAGR metrics to track and measure your entire portfolio relative to the market as a whole.\nYou can also use CAGR to compare assets that are less correlated, such as stocks and gold. A longer time frame is necessary for that comparison, to ensure you're covering positive and negative cycles for both asset types.\nYou cannot use CAGR if you are contributing to or withdrawing from a position, however. The formula assumes a single initial investment. If you make contributions during the measurement period, the calculated CAGR would overstate actual growth. Likewise, distributions would understate actual growth.\nAlso note that CAGR only quantifies growth; it does not measure risk or volatility. In our example above, the stock produced a CAGR of 24.6% by going from $50 to $150 in five years. That value change could happen with slow-and-steady growth or with radical fluctuations. The CAGR measurement alone sheds no light on the path between the starting and ending values.\nRelated investing topics\nCAGR vs. average returns\nCAGR vs. average returns\nCAGR is not the only way to quantify investment growth over time. Another commonly used metric is average return. You should know these two numbers are not equal or comparable.\nTo calculate average return, you start by summing the growth rates in each year of the period. Then you divide that sum by the number of years.\nCAGR, however, ignores the annual growth rates. It only considers the ending value compared with the beginning value. This will produce a more conservative and realistic growth number vs. averaging annual growth rates.\nReturning to our $50 stock example, say the stock's value stays flat for four years and then grows 200% in the fifth year. The ending value is still $150. The average annual growth rate in that scenario is 40%. The math begins with summing four zeros and 200 for the annual growth rates. You then divide 200 by five years to get to 40.\nAs you can see, the same investment can have a CAGR of 24.6% but an average annual growth rate of 40%. So, if growth rates influence your trade decisions, be sure you know which growth rate you're being quoted."

      "text": "ExxonMobil (XOM -0.89%) is one of the world's largest energy companies. The iconic oil and gas giant traces its roots all the way back to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. It has grown over the years by investing in exploration for new energy sources and acquiring rival oil and gas producers.\nExxonMobil is an integrated energy company. It operates upstream oil and gas production facilities, midstream assets like pipelines, and downstream businesses like refining and chemicals. An integrated business model enables ExxonMobil to maximize the value of its production. It also helps mute some of the effects of oil and gas price volatility.\nExxonMobil makes most of its money producing fossil fuels that emit climate-changing carbon dioxide when burned. The company plans to continue investing heavily in expanding its traditional fossil fuel businesses over the coming years to support growing demand.\nHowever, the oil company is also investing in renewable energy and making other strides to reduce its environmental impact. It's building a low-carbon business of potential sustainable solutions like carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen, lithium, and biofuels.\nHere's a step-by-step guide on buying ExxonMobil shares and some factors to consider before investing in the oil stock.\nHow to buy\nHow to buy ExxonMobil stock\nTo buy shares of ExxonMobil, you must have a brokerage account. If you still need to open one, these are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms. Here's a step-by-step guide to buying ExxonMobil stock:\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in ExxonMobil?\nBefore you purchase shares of ExxonMobil, you need to consider whether you want to invest in the oil company. Here are some reasons to buy shares:\n- You strongly believe that oil and gas prices will rise in the future.\n- You have a high conviction that fossil fuels will remain vital energy sources for decades to come.\n- You think ExxonMobil's lower-carbon investment strategy will pay off over the long term.\n- You want to collect passive income from dividends.\n- You understand how ExxonMobil makes money.\n- You want to invest directly in the company.\n- You know that oil price volatility can have a major impact on ExxonMobil's cash flow and stock price.\n- You believe that ExxonMobil's investment strategy will grow shareholder value over the long term.\n- You prefer the company's integrated business model to the independent exploration and production focus of others in the sector.\nConversely, here are some factors to consider that might lead you to decide against buying ExxonMobil stock:\n- You're concerned about the environment and don't want to invest in a company that primarily produces carbon-emitting fossil fuels.\n- You're not sure that oil and gas prices will increase in the future.\n- You believe fossil fuels will become extinct within your lifetime as clean energy sources like renewable energy replace legacy energy sources.\n- You're not sure whether carbon capture and storage will become a commercially viable technology.\n- You don't need dividend income.\n- You think ExxonMobil's best days are in the rearview mirror.\n- You're a more risk-averse investor and want to avoid the volatility of investing in an oil stock.\nProfitability\nIs ExxonMobil profitable?\nEarnings growth helps fuel stock price appreciation over the longer term. It's an ideal area for beginning investors to focus on before buying shares in a company.\nExxonMobil is a wildly profitable company. The oil and gas company reported an industry-leading $7.7 billion in earnings and $13 billion in cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2025. That built on its strong 2024 when it delivered $33.7 billion of earnings and $55 billion of cash flow from operations, its third-best year in a decade, even though market conditions weren't above average.\nThe oil giant expects to make even more money in the future. It aims to add $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by 2030. The company expects to deliver these additional earnings by investing in its advantaged assets (lower cost and higher margins) and delivering significant structural cost savings.\nDividends\nDoes ExxonMobil pay a dividend?\nExxonMobil has an illustrious history of paying dividends. The oil and gas producer has paid dividends for more than 100 years. As of mid-2025, the company had increased its dividend for 42 consecutive years. That's the longest streak in the oil and gas sector, a level that only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have achieved. The oil giant also offered a well-above-average dividend yield (more than 3.5% in mid-2025 compared to less than 1.5% for the S&P 500).\nETF options\nETFs with exposure to ExxonMobil\nInstead of actively buying shares of ExxonMobil directly, you could also passively invest in the oil and gas company through a fund holding its shares.\nExxonMobil is one of the largest traded companies by market capitalization and a widely held stock. ExxonMobil is in several stock market indexes, including the S&P 500 index. As a result, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that benchmark their returns against those indexes hold ExxonMobil stock.\nAccording to data from ETF.com, 396 ETFs held an estimated 699.1 million shares of ExxonMobil as of mid-2025. One of the largest holders was the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE -0.85%), with 60 million shares. The ETF also had the greatest allocation to ExxonMobil stock at 24.1% of the fund's holdings. It's an ideal option for investors seeking an alternative way to invest passively in ExxonMobil and other large energy stocks.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nStock splits\nWill ExxonMobil stock split?\nAs of mid-2025, ExxonMobil had not announced an upcoming stock split. However, the company and its predecessors have implemented several stock splits over the years:\n| Split date | Stock split |\n| June 2001 | 2-for-1 |\n| March 1997 | 2-for-1 |\n| August 1987 | 2-for-1 |\n| May 1981 | 2-for-1 |\n| July 1976 | 2-for-1 |\n| February 1956 | 3-for-1 |\n| June 1951 | 2-for-1 |\nExxonMobil last split its stock more than two decades ago. Shares have grown in value since then, hitting an all-time high of $123.25 per share in October 2024 (though they were below that level in mid-2025 at around $100 a share). If the share price keeps rising, ExxonMobil could declare another stock split in the coming years.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on investing in ExxonMobil stock\nExxonMobil is one of the largest oil and gas producers in the world. It can make a lot of money for its investors, especially if energy prices rise in the future. It also has an exceptional track record of paying a high-yielding and growing dividend, making it appealing to income-seeking investors.\nHowever, ExxonMobil stock isn't for everyone. While it provides upside exposure to oil prices, those prices can move to the downside without notice. The energy giant also isn't the most environmentally friendly company on the planet. Given these factors, investors must carefully consider whether they want to own ExxonMobil before buying shares.\nFAQ\nFAQ on investing in ExxonMobil stock\nIs now a good time to buy ExxonMobil stock?\nOil prices have a significant impact on ExxonMobil's earnings and stock price. When oil prices fall, its earnings decline, weighing on shares. Conversely, when oil prices rebound, ExxonMobil's earnings improve, which tends to drive up its shares.\nThe best time to buy ExxonMobil stock is when oil prices are rising. If oil prices are currently on the upswing, and that seems likely to continue, then now would be a good time to buy shares of ExxonMobil.\nWhat is the best way to buy Exxon Mobil stock?\nThe best way to buy ExxonMobil stock is through an online brokerage account. It trades under the stock ticker XOM.\nWhat is Exxon's yearly dividend?\nAs of mid-2025, ExxonMobil made quarterly dividend payments of $0.99 per share, or $3.69 per share each year.\nWill Exxon stock ever split?\nExxonMobil last split its stock in 2001. As of mid-2025, the oil giant hadn't declared an upcoming stock split. While it's possible the company will split its stock again, it's unclear when or if that will occur."

It helps reduce carbon emissions that are harmful to the environment and contribute to climate change. Companies and governments are investing heavily in CCS to make the technology commercially viable so it can contribute to a lower-carbon world.\nUnderstanding carbon capture and storage\nUnderstanding carbon capture and storage\nCarbon capture and storage is a three-step process:\n- Carbon dioxide emissions are captured from a source, such as a chemical or steel plant, or directly from the atmosphere.\n- The captured carbon dioxide gas is transported by pipeline to a sequestration or utilization site.\n- The carbon dioxide is either injected into a deep underground formation for permanent storage or utilized to produce oil or a higher-value product.\nCCS helps reduce carbon emissions by capturing them from the source or the atmosphere. The greenhouse gas is then permanently stored or utilized so that it doesn't cause additional harm to the environment.\nWhat are the types of carbon capture and storage?\nWhat are the types of carbon capture and storage?\nThere are two main types of CCS technology: point-source capture and direct air capture (DAC).\nPoint-source capture involves installing carbon capture technology at the emissions source to capture and separate carbon dioxide from flue gas. The pure stream of carbon dioxide gas will then flow through a pipeline to a sequestration or utilization site.\nA DAC system is a purpose-built facility that extracts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. DAC technology uses an engineered mechanical system that pulls in air and extracts carbon dioxide through a series of chemical reactions.\nIn many ways, DAC is similar to what plants and trees do in photosynthesis, though at a faster pace and with a smaller physical footprint. However, it's a more expensive process than a point-source capture system because carbon dioxide in the air is much more diluted than flue gas from an industrial plant.\nOnce captured, carbon dioxide flows through pipelines to sequestration or utilization sites. Carbon dioxide is commonly used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where oil companies inject carbon dioxide into a legacy oil reservoir to increase pressure and raise production rates.\nThe process stores the carbon dioxide while boosting oil production. Captured carbon dioxide can also be permanently sequestered in a non-oil-producing underground formation or utilized for industrial applications.\nWhy carbon capture and storage is important\nWhy carbon capture and storage is important\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has highlighted the role that CCS could play in reducing carbon emissions and their impact on global warming. The world is investing heavily in renewable energy sources, like wind and solar energy, to help reduce the need for carbon-based fuels.\nHowever, countries will also need to deploy technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to help reduce the impact of hard-to-abate heavy industries, such as steel, cement, chemicals, and other industrial manufacturing.\nEnergy companies believe CCS can provide them with a dual benefit. They believe it could extend the life of fossil fuels usage while also becoming a very lucrative global market. Oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM -0.89%) estimates CCS will grow into a $4 trillion market by 2050. That's about 60% of the global market it sees for oil and gas by that time.\nAn example\nAn example of carbon capture and storage in action\nMany energy companies are investing heavily in CCS technologies. For example, Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.38%) has a long history of using carbon dioxide in EOR. It's leveraging that expertise to become an emerging leader in CCS.\nThe company is building the world's largest DAC site in Texas. It was also an early investor in DAC technology company Carbon Engineering, which it acquired in 2023 for $1.1 billion.\nRelated investing topics\nThe STRATOS facility will be able to capture 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year when it comes online in 2025. Occidental is working to commercialize the project by selling carbon credits to companies seeking to achieve their emission-reduction targets.\nSTRATOS is one of many DAC projects the company hopes to develop. It also plans to license its DAC technology. Occidental believes it could eventually make as much money from CCS as it currently does from its oil and gas production business."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "It\u2019s very common for a business to lease the property it operates in from a private commercial real estate investor or real estate investment trust (REIT). When this happens, tenants sign one of many types of lease, the most common of which is the net lease.\nWhat is a net lease?\nWhat is a net lease?\nSimply put, a net lease is a lease that includes rent plus other fees. Those other fees are determined by the type of lease and the needs of the tenant or demands of the property. So, when a tenant chooses to lease using a net lease, they agree to pay a base rate of rent plus actual expenses related to the agreed-upon terms.\nFor example, a tenant might choose a lease where they\u2019re responsible for the rent plus the taxes and insurance on the property. Although the rent remains fixed with any escalations that are built-in, the insurance may change due to increased risk factors or claims. So, the tenant will pay the base rent plus the actual insurance and taxes to their landlord.\nWhy use a net lease?\nWhy use a net lease?\nNet leases are the most common type of commercial real estate lease right now, and for good reason. Investors love them because a net lease of any sort reduces the expenses that the landlord has to pay to maintain the property they\u2019re leasing, which in turn should create a higher rate of return on their investment.\nLarge tenants accept them, especially when they\u2019re leasing an entire building, because some types of net leases allow them to choose their own vendors and make decisions about the property as if they owned it.\nTypes of net leases\nTypes of net leases\nThere are three types of net leases, which are called single, double, and triple net leases.\nSingle net leases. A single net lease, sometimes just called an \u201cN\u201d or an \u201cN lease,\u201d is a lease where the tenant pays the rent plus one other item, typically property taxes. Although other types of non-net leases have this baked into the price, in a single net lease, the tenant is paying the actual tax amount, either directly to the municipality or to the landlord, separate from the rent.\nDouble net leases. Double net leases, also known as \u201cNN\u201d or \u201cNN leases,\u201d ask the tenant to pay the rent plus insurance and taxes, generally. They may have a smaller base rent than an N lease, but the additional expenses can add up quickly. The landlord will still pay for maintenance and upkeep, however.\nTriple net leases. If you\u2019re a REIT investor, the triple net lease is really what you\u2019re looking for. In an NNN, the tenant pays the rent, plus essentially all costs associated with the structure, from taxes and insurance to upkeep, repairs, and any modifications that may be needed. Again, the base rent may seem very low initially, but these other expenses can make them much more expensive and unpredictable than a single net lease. For the investor or landlord, however, triple net leases reduce overhead substantially.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat type of net lease is best?\nWhat type of net lease is best?\nThe best net lease depends on who you are in the transaction. For a tenant, a single net lease is ideal, though becoming far less common. You might still see them in places like shopping centers with a lot of small stores or office complexes with many small offices. These leases may charge a higher base rent, but monthly costs are fairly consistent, with the tax burden being spread across all the tenants in the building.\nFor a real estate investor, the triple net lease is the holy grail of leases. They\u2019re becoming increasingly common, especially for stand-alone buildings, or structures that only have one tenant, regardless of the initial design. The triple net lease essentially absolves you from paying any expenses related to owning the property until after the tenant has vacated, which can really increase your cash flow if your tenant stays a long time (as the property also appreciates naturally)."
