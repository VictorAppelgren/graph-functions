It\u2019s like this with you every f\u2013king week!\u201d Alt can be heard shouting at the child.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d the girl yells back. \u201cI want to go home!\u201d\n\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Alt angrily replies, then mumbles something as the ambulance doors close.\nThe child\u2019s grandmother, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked and devastated by the way her granddaughter was spoken to.\n\u201cMaybe it was a blessing I wasn\u2019t there because I would have jumped all over this guy,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\u201cWhen you call for help \u2014 the police, the fire department \u2014 they\u2019re supposed to help you. Not treat you like garbage. And curse at a child at that.\u201d\nThe concerned grandmother said her daughter called the police on her granddaughter after she had taken away the child\u2019s phone, causing her to become emotionally distressed.\nShe added that the family has called first responders in the past to deal with the child, but the personnel have always been understanding with her granddaughter.\nNeighbor Mark Simms said the incident left others on the block disturbed by how the chief handled the emotionally distressed child.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a professional way to deal with people,\u201d Simms told NBC New York. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him to speak to my children like that or anyone in my family. I\u2019d be outraged myself.\u201d\nSimms added that police have been called to deal with the child \u201ca few times\u201d this summer, but \u201cnever treated her like that.\u201d\nTown of Babylon officials have also released a statement on Facebook condemning the fire chief\u2019s \u201cappalling\u201d actions.\n\u201cThe use of demeaning and inappropriate language by a first responder during an aided call is appalling and completely at odds with the standards of dignity, respect, and professionalism our residents deserve,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cWe understand that the individual involved has been relieved of duty while a full investigation takes place and we expect a full and transparent review of the incident.\u201d\nThe town stated that it \u201cexpect[s] meaningful steps to strengthen training, policies, and oversight to ensure this does not happen again,\u201d adding that there is \u201cno place in our town for behavior that disrespects or harms the public \u2014 especially when it involves a young person or child.\u201d\n\u201cThe Town of Babylon condemns this conduct in the strongest possible terms and stands with the affected family and all residents who rely on our emergency services in their times of need,\u201d the statement concluded.\nCommenters on both the viral TikTok video and statements released on Facebook have also called for the responders who stood by and allowed Alt to speak to the child in such a way to be investigated.\nThe Post has reached out to the North Babylon Volunteer Fire Company for comment."
