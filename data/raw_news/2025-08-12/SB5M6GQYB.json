Generate Key Takeaways\n\nDanielle Spencer, the actress best known for playing the quick-witted little sister Dee Thomas on the 1970s sitcom \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!\u201d died on Monday at a hospital in Richmond, Va., her brother announced on Instagram. She had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer and undergone a double mastectomy and emergency surgeries. She was 60.\n\nBorn in Trenton, N.J. in 1965, Spencer started acting after her family relocated to New York City early in her life. At the age of 11, she was cast as Dee Thomas in \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!,\u201d an ABC sitcom created by Eric Monte and executive produced by \u201cAll In The Family\u2019s\u201d Bud Yorkin.\n\nBased on of the 1975 coming-of-age film \u201cCooley High,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!\u201d chronicled the lives and teenage antics of Raj Thomas (Ernest Thomas), Dwayne Nelson (Haywood Nelson) and Freddy \u201cRerun\u201d Stubbs (Fred Berry). Dee was Raj\u2019s younger sister with a sharp tongue and even sharper attitude, quick to tattle on her brother and his friends for their adolescent shenanigans. Buoyed by Spencer\u2019s earnest performance, Dee was a consistent fan favorite on the show.\n\nInitially greenlit for a four-episode replacement summer run, \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!\u201d was so well received that ABC renewed it for a full season. The series ran for three seasons total between 1976 and 1979. During production of the second season, Spencer was in a car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway that killed her stepfather. Spencer was in a coma for three weeks following the accident and she underwent physical therapy for the next six months.\n\nAfter \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!\u2019s\u201d cancellation, Spencer and her mother moved to the Ivory Coast for the remainder of her childhood before she returned to the United States for college. Spencer attended the U. of California Davis, where she studied veterinary science.\n\nWhile Spencer was in college, she occasionally reprised her role as Dee Thomas in episodes of the \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening Now!!,\u201d a sequel series which ran for an additional three seasons between 1985 and 1988.\n\nSpencer later went to Tuskegee University Veterinary School, where she earned her doctorate in 1993. During her two-decade career as a veterinarian in the Los Angeles area, she occasionally acted, making brief appearances in James L. Brooks\u2019 \u201cAs Good as It Gets\u201d and the NBC series \u201cDays of Our Lives.\u201d In 2004, she was diagnosed with spinal stenosis and underwent a surgery that left her paralyzed from the waist down for eight months.\n\nIn 2010, Spencer wrote a memoir titled \u201cThrough the Fire \u2026 Journal of a Child Star,\u201d which sparked a resurgence in interest in her career. Following the book, she appeared on \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d and reunited with her \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening!!\u201d cast members on \u201cLife After\u201d and \u201cUnsung Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe moved from Los Angeles to Richmond, Va. in 2014. There, she hosted a regular morning segment on the local CBS affiliate, WTVR-TV about pet care. The same year that she moved, she was also inducted into the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\nSpencer was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014.\n\nSpencer was married twice, first to her marketing manager and publicist Garry Fields between 1999 and their divorce in 2013, and then to fashion designer and entrepreneur David L. David in 2014. Spencer and David co-hosted the podcast \u201cLiving with Danielle and David,\u201d where they discussed love, marriage, and their work in entertainment with guests.\n\nSpencer is survived by her mother, Cheryl Pelt, her brother, Jeremy Pelt, a jazz trumpeter.\n\u2022 None New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.
