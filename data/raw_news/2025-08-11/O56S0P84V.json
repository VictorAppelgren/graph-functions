  "title": "FBI Director Kash Patel backs Trump's DC police takeover: 'When you let good cops be cops, they deliver'",
  "description": "FBI Director Kash Patel spoke to agents as the Trump administration places D.C. Metropolitan Police under federal control and activates National Guard troops amid high crime.",
  "content": "FBI Director Kash Patel endorsed President Donald Trump's plans to take over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington D.C., amid heavy criticism from Democrats and local officials who say the move is part of a power grab. Patel was seen Monday afternoon inside a command post for the first night of the temporary takeover in a show of support for law enforcement. \"Proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women who keep our nation\u2019s capital safe,\" Patel said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"When you let good cops be cops, give them the tools they need, and back them every step of the way, they deliver - every time.\"In photos exclusively provided to Fox News Digital, Patel can be seen speaking Monday to FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel wearing protective vests at a command center at a U.S. Park Police station. TOP DEMOCRATS RIPPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA OVER 'BONKERS' REACTIONS TO TRUMP'S DC CRIME PLAN: 'MASSIVE LIAR'On Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to \"reestablish law, order and public safety\" in the capital. Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\" Bowser said during a news conference. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME ITThe District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. Bowser noted that granting D.C. statehood, an issue local officials have repeatedly advocated for, could have prevented the takeover. \"If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when the Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\" she said. \"So there are things that, when a city is not a state, and not fully autonomous, and doesn\u2019t have senators, that the federal government can do.\"Other Democrats heavily criticized the Trump administration for the move. \"If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\" the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said. \"Sending in the national guard would only serve to destabilize our city and undermine our public safety efforts.\"The Washington, D.C. City Council called the temporary takeover a \"manufactured intrusion on local authority.\"TRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\"Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency,\" the council said in a joint statement. \"Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard\u2019s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.\"The National Capital Region Delegation, a body comprised of several House Democratic lawmakers, accused Trump of personally inciting crime in the capital, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building. \"Trump\u2019s \u2018temporary\u2019 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is not intended to prevent crime, it is a soft launch of authoritarianism,\" the group said in a statement. \"Trump has a longstanding pattern of seeking showy displays of power. As he has shown repeatedly, Trump is working to serve himself and is not concerned with keeping American families safe in cities and towns across our country.\"\"The President\u2019s announcement this morning is an unserious and unacceptable publicity stunt,\" they added. \"If he wants to reduce crime in the District of Columbia, he should focus on getting his Republican allies in Congress to restore the funding they arbitrarily stripped out of the city\u2019s budget, which risks cuts to law enforcement and other public safety measures.\"Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, called Trump's announcement a \"gross overreach, disconnected from actual conditions on the ground.\"\"So, we have to ask: Will the president\u2019s heavy-handed show of force make the average D.C. resident feel safer? Will it create jobs for working people and bring patrons back to downtown businesses?\" she said. \"Will it provide young people a pathway to jobs, skills or other activities that keep them off the streets?\"\"The answer to those questions is \u2018no,\u2019 she added. \"That\u2019s why this move is yet another crass spectacle from a president who cares more about targeting, intimidating and playing king than the safety of D.C. and its residents.\"Trump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Crime in Washington is down 26% this year compared to the same timeframe in 2024, according to the MPD. Assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%, according to police data. In January, the Justice Department said violent crime in 2024 in the district was down 35% from 2023, the lowest it has been in over 30 years.However, Trump disagrees.Metropolitan Police Department data shows that while the homicide rate is falling, the last five years saw the greatest number of murders since 2008.\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"Fox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.",

The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nTrump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to \"take a look at numbers\" as he rattled off the data's findings.\n\"Look at these.

The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,\" he continued.\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\nTrump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said. \"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States.

      "text": "Press Release\nViolent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of Columbia\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc\nContact\nUpdated January 3, 2025\nTopic\nViolent Crime\nComponent"

But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing \"troops on our streets.\"\n\"We have laws for a reason,\" one resident told Fox News Digital.\n\"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,\" another Washington resident added.\nDespite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, \"The city is getting dangerous.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" one resident said of Trump's new plan. \"It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.\"\nAnd another Washington resident said, \"We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,\" telling Fox News Digital that she has to \"make sure to come home before sundown\" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.\n\"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,\" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories.\nBut another D.C. resident said, \"There's no way he should be in control of anything,\" and Washington, D.C., \"should be a state,\" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself.\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" another Washington resident added. \"I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added: \"It needs to be localized.\"\nFox News Digital's Diana Stacy contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump claimed crimes in Washington, D.C., trounce data from notoriously violent cities in nations such as Mexico and Colombia during his Monday morning press conference announcing he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nTrump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to \"take a look at numbers\" as he rattled off the data's findings.\n\"Look at these. Baghdad is \u2026 we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). Number one that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,\" he continued.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nThe White House directed Fox Digital to a pair of graphs published on the White House Rapid Response's X account on Monday when asked for copies of the charts, data and its citations. The graphs published to X show D.C.'s murder rate in 2024 sat at 27.54 per 100,000, according to FBI data \u2013 reportedly higher than the stats in cities such as Bogota and Mexico City.\nThe nation overall saw an uptick in violent crimes in 2020, when protests and riots broke out in cities across the nation at the height of the pandemic. That year notched a nearly 30% increase in murders compared to the year prior, according to FBI data, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\nWASHINGTON, DC IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CAPITALS OF MANY THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES, SENATOR SAYS\nTrump announced Monday that he was federalizing the local police department starting Monday under section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said. \"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States, I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is. And placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. \u2026 In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC. And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\""

  "argos_summary": "FBI Director Kash Patel endorsed President Trump's plan to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., amid significant backlash from local officials and Democrats who view it as an overreach of power. Trump claims that crime rates in D.C. are alarmingly high, asserting that the murder rate exceeds those of notoriously violent cities worldwide, while opponents argue that crime is at a 30-year low. The plan includes deploying the National Guard to restore public safety, but many residents express concerns about federal control and the effectiveness of such measures.",
