  "content": "Losing your job is stressful enough\u2014sky-high health insurance costs shouldn\u2019t make it worse. With Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans averaging more than $500 a month, many newly unemployed Americans may find themselves scrambling to afford coverage once their employer-sponsored plan ends.\n\nWith the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% in July 2025 from 4.1% a month prior, more workers risk losing not just their paychecks but also their health insurance. The rising unemployment rate can signal a cooling economy, making it more urgent for those newly out of work to find replacement coverage quickly.\n\nWhat Happens When You Lose Your Health Insurance?\n\nLosing your job doesn\u2019t just mean a loss of income\u2014it can also leave you without health insurance, which is the last thing you want to worry about in uncertain times. One option people often look at is Continuation of Health Coverage (COBRA), which lets you stay on the same health insurance plan you had through your employer for up to 18 months.\n\nThis might sound tempting, but there\u2019s a big catch: you\u2019re responsible for the full premium. This can easily push your monthly cost into the hundreds or even thousands, which isn\u2019t exactly doable when you\u2019re out of work.\n\nThis is where another option comes in handy: short-term health insurance. Short-term health insurance is designed to fill the gap while you look for your next job. It\u2019s usually much cheaper than COBRA and can start almost immediately. But it comes with some serious trade-offs: Coverage is usually limited, and many don\u2019t include things like preexisting conditions, mental health care or prescription drugs.\n\u2022 Affordability. Short-term plans tend to carry lower monthly premiums than COBRA or ACA marketplace plans, making them a more budget-friendly option when you\u2019re searching for new employment.\n\u2022 Immediate coverage. Unlike ACA plans that may have waiting periods or restricted enrollment windows, short-term plans often activate immediately, even the next day, offering quick protection when you need it most.\n\u2022 Flexibility. You can typically choose the duration of your coverage\u2014up to a few months\u2014and cancel anytime without penalty, helping you tailor it to your specific job-search timeline.\n\u2022 Limited coverage. These plans are exempt from ACA requirements, meaning they often exclude essential health benefits like preventive care, mental health services, maternity coverage and treatment for preexisting conditions.\n\u2022 High out-of-pocket costs. Many short-term policies come with steep deductibles, high coinsurance and coverage caps.\n\u2022 Regulatory restrictions. Recent federal rules limit coverage: plans issued after September 2024 can last only three months, with a possible extension to four. And depending on your state, these plans may even be prohibited, such as in New York, where short-term plans are not allowed due to state regulations that mandate renewability.\n\nIs Short-Term Health Insurance Right for You?\n\nIf you\u2019re in decent health but have recently become unemployed and need coverage to hold you over for a bit, a short-term health plan might be a budget-friendly option. But be sure to read the fine print, as these plans often have exclusions, coverage limits and caps.\n\nWhile short-term coverage can bridge the gap, you may still want to consider an ACA marketplace or COBRA plan for more comprehensive, long-term insurance, especially if you have ongoing or greater health needs.\n\nAs unemployment inches upward\u2014now holding at 4.2%\u2014many Americans find themselves at a crossroads: needing affordable, interim health coverage while seeking stable employment.\n\nShort-term health insurance offers fast, budget-friendly coverage that works well as a temporary bridge. However, it has trade-offs that you should consider before enrolling. Choosing the right healthcare coverage while between jobs can help maintain your peace of mind during an already stressful time.",

      "text": "Employment often means more than a salary. It may also result in benefits like health insurance. But how do you get health insurance if you\u2019re unemployed?\nPeople who are out of work may have multiple options, including private health insurance, COBRA and Affordable Care Act plans. Depending on where you live and your income, Medicaid may also be an option to get low-cost comprehensive health insurance. Another low-cost option, which doesn\u2019t cover as much as standard health insurance, is short-term health insurance. The best option for you may depend on your eligibility, costs and what you want from coverage.\nFeatured Health Insurance Partners\n1\nAetna\nOffers plans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nAbout 1.2 million\n$20\n2\nBlue Cross Blue Shield\nOffers plans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nAbout 1.7 million\n$10\n3\nCigna\nOffers plans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nAbout 1.5 million\n$0\nHealth Insurance Options for the Unemployed\nOptions for getting health insurance if you\u2019re unemployed include both public and private health plans.\nACA Plans\nThe Affordable Care Act marketplace at HealthCare.gov offers health insurance coverage, which allows you to compare options in your area in one place. ACA plans offer comprehensive coverage, including the 10 essential health benefits, such as emergency, doctor visits, outpatient care, maternity, hospitalizations, mental health and prescriptions.\nACA plans provide premium tax credits and subsidies to those who qualify based on household income. If you have a household income that\u2019s under 400% of the federal poverty level, you can save through tax credits to help pay for health insurance. You may also save if your household income is above that threshold. ACA plans are the only health insurance policies that have this advantage.\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for those tax credits, an ACA health insurance marketplace plan can be much more expensive than an employer plan. A 40-year-old with an unsubsidized ACA plan pays $6,108 on average annually for health coverage. That\u2019s just for single coverage. If you cover both you and your spouse, you can expect to pay double that amount.\nAnother option is to buy health insurance coverage directly through a health insurance company. These policies don\u2019t have to offer the same level of coverage found in an ACA plan, so you may find a cheaper plan with limited coverage.\nCOBRA\nAre you uninsured because you lost a job where you had health insurance? You may qualify for COBRA insurance if you recently lost employer-sponsored health insurance, such as getting laid off. COBRA lets you keep the employer\u2019s health coverage, including all of the benefits. There is a significant drawback, though: COBRA is expensive because you\u2019ll pay the full premiums yourself (plus possibly a small administrative fee).\nEmployers typically pay well over half of health insurance premiums for their health plans, but they usually don\u2019t typically contribute to premiums for a COBRA plan.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that single coverage costs $8,435 annually for an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Employers pay slightly more than $7,000 of that premium on average, with employees saying the remaining $1,400.\nCompanies with 20 or more employees that offer health insurance must offer COBRA, but you may also qualify for COBRA if you work for a smaller company. States often require \u201cmini-COBRA\u201d plans for smaller companies.\nA Spouse\u2019s Plan\nIf your spouse gets health insurance through an employer, check with the company\u2019s benefits department about being added to the coverage. Not all employers allow spouses on health plans.\nYou will typically qualify for a special enrollment period on a spouse\u2019s plan if you lose your health insurance. You\u2019re able to sign up for new health insurance during that special enrollment period and don\u2019t have to wait until the plan\u2019s open enrollment period.\nBeing added to a spouse\u2019s plan will generally increase premiums significantly but that is still likely cheaper than buying COBRA coverage. Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that family coverage costs employees an average of $6,575 annually for those with group health insurance.\nCatastrophic Health Insurance\nCatastrophic health insurance is an option for people under 30 and those facing severe financial problems like homelessness. You can buy a catastrophic policy through the ACA marketplace at HealthCare.gov.\nCatastrophic health plans have lower costs than ACA plans while offering similar coverage. One drawback is that catastrophic plans have much higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, so you pay all the costs when you need care until you reach the plan\u2019s deductible.\nCatastrophic health insurance doesn\u2019t have coinsurance, so once you reach your deductible, the plan picks up the rest of the costs for healthcare services for the year.\nCatastrophic coverage costs an average of $3,120 annually for a 27-year-old. If you\u2019re a 40-year-old who qualifies, the average jumps to $3,804 a year.\nMedicaid\nMedicaid is a low-cost option, if you qualify. The federal/state health insurance program for low-income people offers comprehensive health insurance at little to no cost based on your household income.\nEligibility differs by state and situation. The ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion lets states cover people with incomes at up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Not all states have expanded to that level, though.\nStates may also have higher percentages for certain situations. For instance, children and pregnant women may have less strict eligibility requirements than a single adult. An example is California, which has eligibility of 261% of poverty level for children 18 and under; 208% for pregnant women and 138% for other adults.\nSee your state\u2019s Medicaid eligibility rules at Medicaid.gov.\nMedicare\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 and over, those with disabilities and people with end stage renal disease or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS). If you qualify, Medicare can be a low-cost option with excellent coverage.\nShort-Term Health Insurance\nShort-term health insurance is another low-cost option but with much less coverage. The federal government allows people to have short-term health plans for one year with the option of extending coverage to three years. Short-term plans aren\u2019t allowed in all states and some states restrict the length.\nShort-term health insurance isn\u2019t technically health insurance under the ACA, since it doesn\u2019t offer the essential health benefits required for other health plans. Short-term plans come with limited benefits and coverage limits. For instance, you may have trouble finding a short-term health plan that covers prescriptions, mental health and pregnancy.\nShort-term coverage costs slightly over $2,000 annually on average for a 30-year-old. Though these plans have their limitations, you may prefer the low-cost option to help bridge a coverage gap until you can get standard health insurance again.\nHow Much Does Health Insurance Cost Without a Job?\nAn ACA health insurance plan costs an average of $509 a month for a 40-year-old with an unsubsidized plan. There are huge differences in how much health insurance costs depending on how you get coverage.\n| Type of coverage | Average monthly cost |\n|---|---|\n| Spouse\u2019s health plan | $431 |\n| COBRA | $703 and a potential administrative fee |\n| Unsubsidized ACA plan | $509 |\n| Short-term health insurance | $171 |\n| Catastrophic health insurance | $282 |\n| Medicaid | If you qualify, Medicaid premiums are based on your household income. Costs can be as low as zero. |\nEstimates for ACA, short-term and catastrophic health plans are for a 30-year-old. Employer-provided health plans can\u2019t base your rate on age.\nHow to Find Health Insurance Without a Job\nThere are ways to get health insurance without a job. Here are avenues to consider:\n- Check with your spouse\u2019s employer about whether you can be added to your spouse\u2019s plan.\n- If you are uninsured because you recently lost a job, find out about potential COBRA options from your former employer and look closely at costs.\n- Enter your household income information at the ACA health insurance marketplace website at HealthCare.gov to see how much you might pay for an ACA plan.\n- See if you qualify for Medicaid in your state.\n- Look into short-term health insurance, which offers limited coverage at low costs.\n- If you qualify, explore catastrophic health insurance that you can buy through the ACA marketplace.\nFind The Best Health Insurance Companies Of 2025\nHealth Insurance for the Unemployed Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat happens if you can\u2019t afford healthcare?\nBeing unable to afford healthcare can lead to crushing medical debt. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that 22% of Americans have at least $5,000 in medical debt.\nIf you can\u2019t afford healthcare, you may be able to work with healthcare providers to reduce the debt. For instance, you could talk to a hospital\u2019s finance department about negotiating the healthcare bill or see if the provider accepts an interest-free repayment plan.\nCharity care is another potential option that can be offered by your state or healthcare providers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggests that you request a copy of your hospital\u2019s financial assistance policy, fill out an application form for the program and, if your medical debt has gone to collections, notify debt collectors that you\u2019re applying for assistance.\nIs Obamacare free?\nObamacare, which is another name for Affordable Care Act plans, are typically not free, but you may pay discounted costs if you qualify for premium tax credits.\nCosts for Medicaid, a federal/state health insurance program for low-income people, are based on household income, so you may pay little to nothing for a Medicaid plan depending on your income.\nHow long do you have insurance after leaving a job?\nThere is no hard rule about how long a business must cover you after ending employment. It\u2019s up to the business to decide how long you can stay on the group health insurance. Health insurance could be canceled immediately, by the end of the week, the end of the month or after a longer period.\nHowever, if you qualify for COBRA, employers must allow access to those plans for 18 months or longer depending on why you lost employer-sponsored coverage.\nHow does COBRA insurance work if I quit my job?\nCOBRA insurance lets you temporarily keep your former employer\u2019s health insurance plan if you quit, lose your job or qualify for another reason, such as you\u2019re no longer eligible for a company plan because of reduced hours. COBRA lets you keep the same coverage for a period, but the employer typically doesn\u2019t help pay premiums. That makes COBRA coverage expensive.\nEmployers with 20 or more employees with group health coverage must offer COBRA coverage, though many states have \u201cmini-COBRA\u201d laws for smaller employers."

      "text": "Summary: Best Short-Term Health Insurance Companies\nThe Best Short-Term Health Insurance Companies\nWhat Is Short-Term Health Insurance?\nShort-term health insurance offers limited coverage for up to three months in most states, with the chance to extend the plan for another month for a total of four months in a 12-month period. The federal government reduced the previous length of one year with an option of up to three years in September 2024. Some states don\u2019t allow short-term plans or restrict the length of coverage.\nShort-term health insurance plans aren\u2019t regulated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), so you can be denied based on pre-existing conditions. And these plans don\u2019t have to cover the minimum \u201cessential health benefits\u201d mandated by the law. ACA benefits that are standard in regular health insurance include inpatient and outpatient care, mental health services, prescription drug coverage and maternity care. Since short-term plans don\u2019t have to offer this coverage you may have trouble finding a short-term health plan that does.\nShort-term health insurance plans also generally have caps on how much the insurer will pay for certain services or in total.\nWhat Does Short-Term Health Insurance Cover?\nShort-term health insurance plans don\u2019t have to follow ACA rules, which means there can be a significant difference between what one policy covers compared to another.\nShort-term health insurance plans may cover:\n- Doctor visits\n- Emergency care\n- Preventive care\n- Urgent care\nWhat Does Short-Term Health Insurance Not Cover?\nEach company decides what it covers. Make sure to check the policy for lists of exclusions. Examples of typical exclusions are:\n- Maternity\n- Mental health\n- Prescriptions. A short-term plan may offer a discount card so you can get cheaper drugs but the plan doesn\u2019t actually help pay for them\n- Substance abuse\nShort-Term Health Insurance Laws by State\nThe federal government now allows short-term health coverage for three months with the option to increase coverage for one more month in a 12-month period, but some states ban short-term coverage or limit coverage to three months max.\nHow Do You Qualify For Short-Term Health Insurance?\nYou can apply for a short-term health insurance policy at any time of year if your state allows short-term coverage.\nYou can be denied coverage based on your health, unlike standard health insurance. On the application you\u2019ll likely answer yes/no questions about medical conditions.\nA short-term health company could approve a policy but deny covering claims associated with pre-existing health issues. Insurers review claims to check whether the healthcare services were connected to pre-existing conditions. If they find a pre-existing condition is causing health problems, they could reject the claim or even drop your coverage at any time.\nHow Do You Choose a Short-Term Health Insurance Plan?\nHow Much Does Short-Term Health Insurance Cost?\nThe average cost for short-term health insurance is $151 a month, according to our analysis of nine short-term policies.\nWe found costs as low as about $100 a month for barebones coverage to over $200 a month for coverage with prescription drug coverage. Short-term health insurers may promote coverage for under $100 a month, but you want to carefully read the print to understand what is and isn\u2019t covered by cheaper short-term plans.\nWhat you\u2019re charged for short-term health insurance can vary by:\n- Your age, gender and health\n- Tobacco use\n- Where you live\n- Coverage maximum\n- How many people are covered by your plan\n- Out-of-pocket costs, including coinsurance and deductible\nAverage Monthly Short-Term Health Insurance Costs by Plan\n| Company | Policy name | Average monthly short-term health insurance cost |\n|---|---|---|\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Economy | $91 |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Choice | $101 |\n| Everest | Flex Term Health Insurance | $108 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value Direct | $132 |\n| Pivot | Epic Base | $137 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value | $153 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus Elite | $198 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus | $210 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Copay | $231 |\nMethodology\nTo identify the best short-term health insurance companies, we evaluated companies based on average monthly cost, coverage and out-of-pocket costs:\nShort-term health insurance rates (25% of score): We compared quotes for a 30-year-old woman who is a nonsmoker for three cities: Orlando, Florida, Phoenix and El Paso, Texas. We took the three lowest quotes for each plan in each city and came up with an average.\nCoverage maximum (25% of score): Unlike standard health insurance, a short-term health insurance plan has maximum coverage, either lifetime or annual, which is the most the company will pay for an individual\u2019s care.\nDeductible (20% of score): Short-term health insurance companies often offer multiple health insurance deductible levels. Plans with more options got more points in our analysis.\nCoinsurance (15% of score): Coinsurance is the percentage you pay for healthcare services after you reach your plan\u2019s deductible. The insurer picks up the rest of the bill until you reach the coverage limit. Lower coinsurance levels mean less money out of pocket, so we gave those plans more points.\nPrescription drug coverage (15% of score): Many short-term health insurance plans don\u2019t offer prescription drug benefits or only give a discount card for members. We analyzed which short-term plans offer prescription drugs, which ones do not and which have exclusions that only cover prescription drugs for specific reasons, such as only during hospitalizations.\nOther Short-Term Health Insurance Plans We Rated\n| Company | Policy name | Forbes Advisor rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Copay | |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Choice | |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Economy | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value Direct |\nBest Short-Term Health Insurance FAQs\nWhat are the pros and cons of short-term health insurance?\nShort-term health insurance offers low-cost, limited coverage if you have a coverage gap, but detractors often call the plans junk health insurance because they lack many coverage types found in regular health insurance.\nPros of short-term health insurance are its low cost, you can apply for a plan at any time, you can get coverage quickly and you may have more flexibility to decide on your out-of-pocket costs compared to a standard health insurance plan. Cons include that short-term plans don\u2019t typically offer coverage that is in standard health insurance plans, don\u2019t generally cover pre-existing conditions and you can be denied.\nWhat is the difference between COBRA and short-term health insurance?\nCOBRA insurance and short-term health insurance both let you have coverage for a limited time but they differ in many ways.\nThe COBRA law requires insurers to provide a temporary continuation of your same health insurance. There is a major drawback, though: The employer will likely no longer cover part of the monthly premium. You instead have to pay the full premium, plus an administrative fee.\nShort-term health insurance isn\u2019t connected to your employment. Short-term plans also don\u2019t typically cost anywhere near what COBRA does, but you don\u2019t get comprehensive coverage typically found in an employer plan.\nWho needs short-term health insurance?\nA short-term health insurance plan might make sense if you can\u2019t find affordable health insurance anywhere or you will soon have health insurance, such as starting a new job. It could also work as an emergency stopgap if you were recently laid off and can\u2019t afford COBRA insurance.\nHow can I get short-term health insurance?\nYou can get short-term health insurance directly from the company if your state allows those plans.\nUnlike the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace at HealthCare.gov, you\u2019re not able to compare short-term plans available in your area in one location. You instead have to go directly to each company to get details."

Each plan also includes coinsurance, which is the portion an insured is required to pay after the deductible is met.\nIt is important to review the Plan Details and understand full services provided, coinsurance out-of-pocket maximums, exclusions and limitations.\nShort-term health plans are temporary coverage that can offer financial protection for medical services such as doctor office visits, emergency room visits, hospital stays and more. Short term medical plans can be a flexible option for individuals in an employer waiting period, between jobs or individuals who missed the open enrollment period.\nIt is important to know short term medical health plans are not required to meet the essential standards of the Affordable Care Act, and in some states, the length of a policy might be limited according to state-specific rules. Pre-existing conditions are also not initially covered by short term health insurance, and companies are allowed to ask medical questions in order to qualify an individual for coverage.\nIn most states, pre-existing conditions diagnosed within the past 5 years are generally not covered under this plan. However, qualifying conditions you develop throughout the year while insured by a short-term plan could be covered. Certain exclusions apply. See plan details for more information\nDisclaimer:\nThis coverage is not required to comply with certain federal market requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check your Policy/Certificate carefully to make sure you are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting conditions or health benefits (such as hospitalization, emergency services, maternity care, preventive care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder services).\nYour Policy/Certificate might also have lifetime and/or annual dollar limits on health benefits. If this coverage expires or you lose eligibility for this coverage, you might have to wait until an open enrollment period to get other health insurance coverage. Also, this coverage is not \u201cminimum essential coverage.\nThis plan has a pre-existing limitation provision that may prevent coverage from applying to medical conditions that existed prior to the plan effective date.\nPivotHealth.com is the website domain of PivotHealth Holdings, LLC (Pivot Health), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HealthCare, Inc.

      "text": "Summary: Best Short-Term Health Insurance Companies\nThe Best Short-Term Health Insurance Companies\nWhat Is Short-Term Health Insurance?\nShort-term health insurance offers limited coverage for up to three months in most states, with the chance to extend the plan for another month for a total of four months in a 12-month period. The federal government reduced the previous length of one year with an option of up to three years in September 2024. Some states don\u2019t allow short-term plans or restrict the length of coverage.\nShort-term health insurance plans aren\u2019t regulated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), so you can be denied based on pre-existing conditions. And these plans don\u2019t have to cover the minimum \u201cessential health benefits\u201d mandated by the law. ACA benefits that are standard in regular health insurance include inpatient and outpatient care, mental health services, prescription drug coverage and maternity care. Since short-term plans don\u2019t have to offer this coverage you may have trouble finding a short-term health plan that does.\nShort-term health insurance plans also generally have caps on how much the insurer will pay for certain services or in total.\nWhat Does Short-Term Health Insurance Cover?\nShort-term health insurance plans don\u2019t have to follow ACA rules, which means there can be a significant difference between what one policy covers compared to another.\nShort-term health insurance plans may cover:\n- Doctor visits\n- Emergency care\n- Preventive care\n- Urgent care\nWhat Does Short-Term Health Insurance Not Cover?\nEach company decides what it covers. Make sure to check the policy for lists of exclusions. Examples of typical exclusions are:\n- Maternity\n- Mental health\n- Prescriptions. A short-term plan may offer a discount card so you can get cheaper drugs but the plan doesn\u2019t actually help pay for them\n- Substance abuse\nShort-Term Health Insurance Laws by State\nThe federal government now allows short-term health coverage for three months with the option to increase coverage for one more month in a 12-month period, but some states ban short-term coverage or limit coverage to three months max.\nHow Do You Qualify For Short-Term Health Insurance?\nYou can apply for a short-term health insurance policy at any time of year if your state allows short-term coverage.\nYou can be denied coverage based on your health, unlike standard health insurance. On the application you\u2019ll likely answer yes/no questions about medical conditions.\nA short-term health company could approve a policy but deny covering claims associated with pre-existing health issues. Insurers review claims to check whether the healthcare services were connected to pre-existing conditions. If they find a pre-existing condition is causing health problems, they could reject the claim or even drop your coverage at any time.\nHow Do You Choose a Short-Term Health Insurance Plan?\nHow Much Does Short-Term Health Insurance Cost?\nThe average cost for short-term health insurance is $151 a month, according to our analysis of nine short-term policies.\nWe found costs as low as about $100 a month for barebones coverage to over $200 a month for coverage with prescription drug coverage. Short-term health insurers may promote coverage for under $100 a month, but you want to carefully read the print to understand what is and isn\u2019t covered by cheaper short-term plans.\nWhat you\u2019re charged for short-term health insurance can vary by:\n- Your age, gender and health\n- Tobacco use\n- Where you live\n- Coverage maximum\n- How many people are covered by your plan\n- Out-of-pocket costs, including coinsurance and deductible\nAverage Monthly Short-Term Health Insurance Costs by Plan\n| Company | Policy name | Average monthly short-term health insurance cost |\n|---|---|---|\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Economy | $91 |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Choice | $101 |\n| Everest | Flex Term Health Insurance | $108 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value Direct | $132 |\n| Pivot | Epic Base | $137 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value | $153 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus Elite | $198 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus | $210 |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Copay | $231 |\nMethodology\nTo identify the best short-term health insurance companies, we evaluated companies based on average monthly cost, coverage and out-of-pocket costs:\nShort-term health insurance rates (25% of score): We compared quotes for a 30-year-old woman who is a nonsmoker for three cities: Orlando, Florida, Phoenix and El Paso, Texas. We took the three lowest quotes for each plan in each city and came up with an average.\nCoverage maximum (25% of score): Unlike standard health insurance, a short-term health insurance plan has maximum coverage, either lifetime or annual, which is the most the company will pay for an individual\u2019s care.\nDeductible (20% of score): Short-term health insurance companies often offer multiple health insurance deductible levels. Plans with more options got more points in our analysis.\nCoinsurance (15% of score): Coinsurance is the percentage you pay for healthcare services after you reach your plan\u2019s deductible. The insurer picks up the rest of the bill until you reach the coverage limit. Lower coinsurance levels mean less money out of pocket, so we gave those plans more points.\nPrescription drug coverage (15% of score): Many short-term health insurance plans don\u2019t offer prescription drug benefits or only give a discount card for members. We analyzed which short-term plans offer prescription drugs, which ones do not and which have exclusions that only cover prescription drugs for specific reasons, such as only during hospitalizations.\nOther Short-Term Health Insurance Plans We Rated\n| Company | Policy name | Forbes Advisor rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Copay | |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Choice | |\n| Pivot | Pivot Health Economy | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Plus | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value | |\n| UnitedHealthcare | Short Term Medical Value Direct |\nBest Short-Term Health Insurance FAQs\nWhat are the pros and cons of short-term health insurance?\nShort-term health insurance offers low-cost, limited coverage if you have a coverage gap, but detractors often call the plans junk health insurance because they lack many coverage types found in regular health insurance.\nPros of short-term health insurance are its low cost, you can apply for a plan at any time, you can get coverage quickly and you may have more flexibility to decide on your out-of-pocket costs compared to a standard health insurance plan. Cons include that short-term plans don\u2019t typically offer coverage that is in standard health insurance plans, don\u2019t generally cover pre-existing conditions and you can be denied.\nWhat is the difference between COBRA and short-term health insurance?\nCOBRA insurance and short-term health insurance both let you have coverage for a limited time but they differ in many ways.\nThe COBRA law requires insurers to provide a temporary continuation of your same health insurance. There is a major drawback, though: The employer will likely no longer cover part of the monthly premium. You instead have to pay the full premium, plus an administrative fee.\nShort-term health insurance isn\u2019t connected to your employment. Short-term plans also don\u2019t typically cost anywhere near what COBRA does, but you don\u2019t get comprehensive coverage typically found in an employer plan.\nWho needs short-term health insurance?\nA short-term health insurance plan might make sense if you can\u2019t find affordable health insurance anywhere or you will soon have health insurance, such as starting a new job. It could also work as an emergency stopgap if you were recently laid off and can\u2019t afford COBRA insurance.\nHow can I get short-term health insurance?\nYou can get short-term health insurance directly from the company if your state allows those plans.\nUnlike the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace at HealthCare.gov, you\u2019re not able to compare short-term plans available in your area in one location. You instead have to go directly to each company to get details."

  "argos_summary": "As unemployment rises to 4.2%, many Americans face the challenge of securing affordable health insurance after losing their jobs. Options include COBRA, which allows continuation of employer-sponsored plans but at full premium costs, and short-term health insurance, which offers lower premiums but limited coverage and exclusions for preexisting conditions. While short-term plans can provide immediate, budget-friendly coverage, they lack essential benefits and may not be suitable for those with ongoing health needs. Individuals are encouraged to explore various options, including ACA plans and Medicaid, to find the best fit for their circumstances.",
