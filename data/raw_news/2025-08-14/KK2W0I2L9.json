Generate Key Takeaways\n\nNORTH ANDOVER \u2014 The town moderator has appointed a new member to the Finance Committee and reappointed two others to three-year terms.\n\nTown moderator Mark DiSalvo announced the new appointment of Jennifer Watson, a defense industry executive, to the committee. He has additionally reappointed Keith Chaney, president and owner of City Sealcoating Inc., and Jeanne Irwin, a grants manager for Haverhill Public Schools.\n\nThe members will be sworn in by Town Clerk Dawne Warren at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Town Hall, 120 Main. St.\n\nThe Finance Committee has the primary responsibility of advising voters with recommendations at Town Meeting on the annual budget and any other finance-related warrant articles.\n\nThe town moderator has the sole authority to appoint the Finance Committee, according to the town charter.\n\nDiSalvo said his job is to ensure the committee is representative of the community at large and has credibility in the advice it provides.\n\nThe goal is to have the committee be diverse on political views, perspectives and gender. Members do not need to be a finance professional or accountant to sit on the committee.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a breadth of experiences, professional experiences, life experiences and skills on a finance committee,\u201d DiSalvo said. \u201cThese three people really reflect that.\u201d\n\nThe three individuals possess \u201ca wide range of private, municipal, and other public finance, analytical, and operational skills vitally necessary amidst a challenging period of fiscal uncertainty,\u201d DiSalvo said.\n\nWatson has analytical skills that DiSalvo said would be crucial for the committee. She works at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as head of the Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division. In her position, she oversees the development and prototyping of innovative technologies to support national security.\n\nWatson has been in a talent bank kept by DiSalvo. He said he was aware of Watson\u2019s professional credentials and her involvement in past Town Meetings, and especially this past May.\n\nDiSalvo recalled Watson having a \u201cmagical minute\u201d at Town Meeting after he shortened voter discussion time from two minutes to one minute as public comment on the budget was getting long.\n\nShe was the first person to speak limited to one minute. DiSalvo said whether the crowd agreed with her or not, they applauded her after she gave a \u201ccogent, one-minute analysis of the moment that we were in as a community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was just an immediate appreciation for her ability to so cogently craft an argument,\u201d DiSalvo said.\n\nHe added there\u2019s a generational change in how Finance Committees operate to look at the effects of general policy, where a town should be in terms of budgeting and creating revenue.\n\nChaney brings policy and business expertise in the area of budget creation. He is also a member of the Lawrence Leads Program and the Merrimack Valley Chamber of Commerce. Chaney serves as a board member of the Alliance for Business Leadership.\n\nIrwin was appointed to complete the term of member Ken Gray, who died in October 2024 after serving on the committee for more than two years.\n\nWhen she was sworn in as an interim member, the committee needed someone with municipal finance experience and experience with school budgets due to the challenges the school district faced over the past year.\n\nIrwin brings skills as a school business administrator to the committee. She has held director and management titles within public school systems for several towns in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cShe turned out to be an immediately contributing member of the Finance Committee,\u201d DiSalvo said about Irwin.\n\nThe service of five-year committee member Brianna Stetson will also be recognized at the swearing-in ceremony next week. The public is invited to attend.",
