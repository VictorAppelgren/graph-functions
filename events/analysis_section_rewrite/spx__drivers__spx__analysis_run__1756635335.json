      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Canonical mapping & sign** – Explicitly state that the asset is the USD index (DXY), with a *negative* move to ~95.8 (≈ 200 bp decline) by Aug 31, followed by a *positive* 2 % (≈ 200 bp) rebound over the next 3–6 months.  \n2. **Causal chain** – Re‑write the paragraph to read: Fed policy → 2‑yr/10‑yr spread → 10‑yr Treasury yield → term‑premium → DXY, adding a brief note that inflation expectations and tariff‑driven risk sentiment feed the spread. Cite each link: (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV) for the decline, (U21K4ALYQ)(97MD1FHW8) for the spread, (B1KYJ1GPU)(XTQIQRP5K)(NIT6JFIQF)(FAN5RYW6T) for the rebound.  \n3. **Magnitude consistency** – Replace the “0.5–1 %” lift with “≈ 2 % (≈ 200 bp)” to match the source (B1KYJ1GPU).  \n4. **Risk factors** – Add three bullet‑style risk statements, each with a citation:  \n   - Fed rate hike → reverse lift (B1KYJ1GPU)(7XH2DKEKV).  \n   - Spread compression < 30 bp → erode term‑premium (U21K4ALYQ)(97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Tariff rollback → narrow spread, weaken DXY (1DEM6P1Y2).  \n5. **Catalyst window** – List the exact dates: Sep 25 Fed meeting, Aug 6 CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, and daily monitoring of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread.  \n6. **Watch signals** – End with a concise watch list: Fed meeting, CPI, PCE, NFP, spread trend.  \n7. **Citation density** – Ensure every substantive claim (e.g., decline magnitude, rebound magnitude, risk triggers) has an inline citation; remove any uncited generic statements.  \n8. **Avoid drift** – Keep all sentences tied to DXY; delete any mention of other assets or unrelated macro topics.  \n\nImplement these edits to produce a concise, evidence‑driven view that satisfies the acceptance gate and aligns with the section focus.",
