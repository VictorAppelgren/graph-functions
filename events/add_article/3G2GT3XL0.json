The catalyst window is the September 2025 FOMC meeting, where Fed Powell’s hint and a 75‑80% probability of a 25‑bp cut are expected.",

      "summary": "The article argues that the Fed’s recent interest‑rate cuts have failed to lower long‑term market rates, instead pushing Treasury, mortgage and corporate yields higher, breaking the long‑standing positive correlation between the Fed Funds rate and these rates. It attributes the anomaly to simultaneous quantitative tightening, which has removed bond‑demand and offset the easing effect of rate cuts. While market sentiment and FedWatch probabilities suggest a September cut, the author contends that the Fed’s policy lever may have lost its efficacy, raising doubts that any future cut will materially lower borrowing costs. The piece warns that this structural shift could undermine the Fed’s ability to influence the economy and calls for caution in interpreting rate‑cut expectations.",
