      "summary": "Bloomberg’s \"Balance of Power\" highlights the U.S. administration’s ongoing tariff disputes, a recent court ruling declaring many Trump-era tariffs illegal, and the potential for a government shutdown as lawmakers confront a fiscal impasse. The show also covers the President’s attempts to re‑authorise trade restrictions and the strategic implications of China, India, and Russia’s diplomatic engagements. Market reactions include a dip in U.S. equities, rising Treasury yields, and a record high in gold, reflecting heightened uncertainty over policy and fiscal stability.",
