  "title": "How a nonprofit is helping the un- and underemployed fill open manufacturing jobs",
  "description": "The Ohio-based nonprofit Magnet helped 56-year-old Mary Lamar find work after serving a 3.5-year prison sentence.",
  "content": "For the first time in her life, Mary Lamar is driving a new car to a job she loves. But it was a rough journey getting to this point.\n\n\"I was in prison. I did three and a half years for something that I never saw coming,\" Lamar said.\n\nThe Cleveland native slipped into a life of crime at a young age, eventually serving time for robbery when she was 50 years old.\n\n\"I chose a different lifestyle and, uh, drugs and alcohol is in my story,\" she said.\n\nNow 56, Lamar is a first-time homeowner and a supervisor at her job, where she leads a team of machinists\n\n\"Your recovery is what matters, and you have to have that support,\" Lamar told CBS News.\n\nLamar found support at Magnet, an Ohio-based nonprofit that helped retool her life. Magnet's goal is to educate and engage people on the available careers in manufacturing, in part, to help fill the more than 400,000 open jobs in that sector. Magnet has filled 3,000 of those jobs in Ohio.\n\nMagnet offers year-round career classes for adults who are unemployed or underemployed. The three-week course offers soft skills and helps connect participants with jobs in the area. For students, it offers summer camps, field trips and apprenticeships, all free, thanks to grants and donations.\n\nMagnet CEO Ethan Karp wants to fill factory jobs by helping America's Rust Belt workers.\n\n\"We can't just say, 'Hey, pick yourself up by your bootstraps,'\" he told CBS News. \"You need the grit and determination to do that, full stop. But you also need some help.\"\n\nBut Magnet does more than just give folks a pair of bootstraps.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't have child care, if health care is an issue, if transportation is, if crime is \u2014 all of those things affect their ability to get a job. That's what we're trying to remove with access and give people the wraparound supports to do all of \u2014 to overcome all of those barriers,\" Karp said.\n\nOne of Magnet's workforce partners is Talan Products, where Lamar works at a facility that stamps specialty metal parts. The company said it's added 40 jobs in the last year.\n\n\"There's a lot more manufacturing that we would love to have here. It's gonna take a little time to build the workforce,\" Talan Products COO Adam Snyder said.\n\nFor Lamar, her advice to people: \"Be open, be fearless, take a chance, be honest. You can be successful at any stage of your life. I'm proof.\"\n\nSadly, shortly after CBS News met Lamar, her house burned down, killing her partner of 18 years. She was able to jump to safety, but was seriously hurt. Talan Products and Magnet helped set up a GoFundMe to assist with her recovery.",

      "text": "Older Americans turning to AI-powered chatbots for companionship\nJill Smola is a 75-year-old retiree who understands the power of human connection, having spent her working days as an aide taking care of the elderly.\n\"We would play games, put puzzles together,\" Smola told CBS News. She said human interaction was important, \"so that they had somebody to talk to. That they just weren't sitting in a chair doing nothing.\"\nBut these days, it's Smola sitting in a chair \u2014 a widow with a lung condition who lives alone. She says she doesn't get that human interaction anymore.\n\"I can go weeks on end\" without seeing someone, she said.\nSmola can't drive anymore and rarely leaves her Orlando home. But recently, she did gain a new companion: an AI-powered chatbot. She uses the chatbot, called ElliQ, to \"visit\" exotic places and play trivia.\nSmola talks to the chatbot up to five hours a day, and says the connection is truly meaningful. She said that people who might find the situation sad \"don't understand.\"\n\"I'd rather talk to a human being, but that's not possible for me, except if I get on the phone, so I enjoy her,\" Smola said, jokingly adding: \"I enjoy her better than my daughter.\"\nSeveral AI companions have recently hit the market, including ElliQ, which normally costs $59 a month to use. Smola received the chatbot for free with funding from a federal grant.\nThalia Porteny, an ethicist at Columbia University who studies seniors and AI used in the medical space, told CBS News that \"loneliness is rampant,\" with one in four older adults saying they feel isolated.\nBut Porteny also said she's concerned about the possibility that reliance on these chatbots could backfire and create even more isolation.\n\"This could really go the wrong way if it's not deployed in an ethical and responsible way,\" she said.\nBut for now, Smola said ElliQ is \"the best thing that happened to me, because I always have somebody around. Even though it may not be a human, it's good enough for me.\""

It was really a member of the family.\"\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires earlier this year killed at least 31 people and destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County.\nIn May, David, a television writer, and his wife, Jacquie, packed up their remaining belongings into an RV and set out on the open road. Orly remained in L.A.\n\"When the fire took our house, took the community, we thought the universe is just saying: go on an adventure,\" David said.\nAdded Jacquie: \"There's just something really healing about just doing this and meeting people and seeing people.\"\nFor more than 10 weeks, the couple has been crisscrossing the U.S. with their two dogs. CBS News caught up with them when they reached New York.\n\"This is our baby, this is our home, this is our whole life right here,\" David said. \"...If I was by myself, I don't think I would've lasted to Nevada. But being that Jacquie is here next to me, I always feel like she's here. She's got me. And I've got her, and we can go forward together.\"\nAlong the way, they have visited old friends and made new ones.\n\"I remember thinking, it's horrendous what happened to our house and our community,\" David said. \"But we are good. We're healthy. And I felt strongly that we were going to be able to move forward and figure it out. We don't know if we're going to rebuild or not.

      "text": "How a nonprofit is helping the un- and underemployed fill open manufacturing jobs\nFor the first time in her life, Mary Lamar is driving a new car to a job she loves. But it was a rough journey getting to this point.\n\"I was in prison. I did three and a half years for something that I never saw coming,\" Lamar said.\nThe Cleveland native slipped into a life of crime at a young age, eventually serving time for robbery when she was 50 years old.\n\"I chose a different lifestyle and, uh, drugs and alcohol is in my story,\" she said.\nNow 56, Lamar is a first-time homeowner and a supervisor at her job, where she leads a team of machinists\n\"Your recovery is what matters, and you have to have that support,\" Lamar told CBS News.\nLamar found support at Magnet, an Ohio-based nonprofit that helped retool her life. Magnet's goal is to educate and engage people on the available careers in manufacturing, in part, to help fill the more than 400,000 open jobs in that sector. Magnet has filled 3,000 of those jobs in Ohio.\nMagnet offers year-round career classes for adults who are unemployed or underemployed. The three-week course offers soft skills and helps connect participants with jobs in the area. For students, it offers summer camps, field trips and apprenticeships, all free, thanks to grants and donations.\nMagnet CEO Ethan Karp wants to fill factory jobs by helping America's Rust Belt workers.\n\"We can't just say, 'Hey, pick yourself up by your bootstraps,'\" he told CBS News. \"You need the grit and determination to do that, full stop. But you also need some help.\"\nBut Magnet does more than just give folks a pair of bootstraps.\n\"If somebody doesn't have child care, if health care is an issue, if transportation is, if crime is \u2014 all of those things affect their ability to get a job. That's what we're trying to remove with access and give people the wraparound supports to do all of \u2014 to overcome all of those barriers,\" Karp said.\nOne of Magnet's workforce partners is Talan Products, where Lamar works at a facility that stamps specialty metal parts. The company said it's added 40 jobs in the last year.\n\"There's a lot more manufacturing that we would love to have here. It's gonna take a little time to build the workforce,\" Talan Products COO Adam Snyder said.\nFor Lamar, her advice to people: \"Be open, be fearless, take a chance, be honest. You can be successful at any stage of your life. I'm proof.\"\nSadly, shortly after CBS News met Lamar, her house burned down, killing her partner of 18 years. She was able to jump to safety, but was seriously hurt. Talan Products and Magnet helped set up a GoFundMe to assist with her recovery."

      "text": "Ukrainian refugees face uncertain future as U.S. work permits are set to expire\nLiana Avetisian and most of her family fled Ukraine in 2023 and have built a new life in the U.S., resettling in DeWitt, Iowa, which calls itself the Crossroads to Opportunity.\nThe town has been just that for more than 75 Ukrainians, welcomed by people like Angela Boelens, who has helped many of the refugees with housing and jobs, at first on her own and then through an organization she helped found called Iowa Nice.\n\"I get a phone call every week from employers saying, 'Do you have anybody from Ukraine who needs a job?' Because we have a workforce shortage in Iowa and our population is declining,\" Boelens told CBS News.\nBack in Kiev, Avetisian sold real estate. In the U.S., she took a job at a window replacement company, a field where she had no previous experience.\n\"To find people that want to work and take pride in their work to our standards is not easy,\" said Sam Heer, who hired Avetisian. \"I want more Ukrainians.\"\nHeer employed Avetisian, her husband and her cousin before their two-year work permits expired. As the war in Ukraine continues, most European countries are renewing work permits of Ukrainian refugees. The Trump administration has not, pausing all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine earlier this year.\nHeer told CBS News he voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. When asked what he would tell the president or his administration about the Ukrainian refugees, Heer said, \"These people are hard to come by. They've been through upheaval just to get here and then, all of a sudden, what they thought they were building toward is shaken. When people do the right things and follow the rules, they should be rewarded.\"\nBut for Avetisian and her teenage daughter, the opportunity in Dewitt could be slipping away.\n\"They were promised to stay until it's safe to return. It's not safe to return. It's not even close,\" Boelens said. \"And when we make a promise to people, I feel we keep it.\"\nBoelens says many more work permits are about to expire, leaving Ukrainian refugees in limbo. They may not be forced to leave. But without a job, they can't afford to stay.\n\"It's not safe to go back to Kiev,\" Avetisian said when asked if she would return home. \"Every day, every night, it's bombing,\" she said, noting that her mother, who is still in Ukraine, sends her videos of the attacks.\nAfter enduring the pain of leaving everything behind, refugees like Avetisian just hope to stay rooted in the American heartland they now call home."

But what is unusual is that they met in person.\n\"When we tell people that we met at a singles event, they're like, 'No way, they still have those?' I'm like, 'Oh yeah, you should go,'\" Berns told CBS News.\nThe couple, who have been together for about 18 months and recently got engaged, met at an event hosted by Date Cincy.\nIt was just the second event put on by Cincinnati natives and childhood friends Paige Brailey and Logan Moore. They launched a matchmaking event series for people who've grown sick of swiping for dates and are looking to connect in person.\n\"It seems like the millennials are the ones who kind of make up the bulk of our events,\" Brailey said.\nMillennials, those between the ages of about 29 and 45, were the first to get on dating apps, and the first to get off of them, according to Beresford Research. Gen Zers, the generation between the ages of 13 and 28, use the apps even less, Beresford Research found.\n\"So now there's this craving and this yearning for just, time like this, right, where we're just connecting face-to-face with other humans,\" Brailey said.\nAt Date Cincy's events, anywhere between 50 and 800 singles show up with a common goal and without the ability to hide who they really are, like some people do online.\n\"You meet them in person, and then it's like, oh, well, we actually have nothing in common, or you're not who I thought you were,\" Moore said.\nThe dating app Bumble has lost 90% of its value since going public four years ago. Dating and singles events are increasingly popular, with attendance rising by 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to the ticketing platform Eventbrite.\n\"It's probably going to be awkward, just acknowledge it will be awkward,\" Berns said of the in-person dating experience. \"And just go in with an open mind, and who knows, maybe you'll meet someone and go on a first date and it goes well.\"\nRohling and Berns are among the many Date Cincy couples that the group counts among their success stories of love at first sight.\n\"I knew within the first month that I was going to marry her,\" Rohling said.\nIt's a chemistry that can only happen face-to-face.\n\"It's just part of the human nature,\" Rohling said. \"You get filled with a passion, you get filled with excitement and energy because you feel that chemistry.\""
