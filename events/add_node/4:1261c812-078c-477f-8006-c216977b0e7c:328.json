      "importance": 3,
      "rationale": "Middle East sovereign wealth funds (PIF, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Mubadala) are significant macro capital allocators that shape sectoral investment flows and long‑term growth trajectories. Their decisions influence asset prices and sector dynamics over a medium horizon (days to months) rather than generating immediate intraday market moves. Thus they qualify as meaningful drivers with sector/thematic scope, fitting the medium‑importance level (3)."
