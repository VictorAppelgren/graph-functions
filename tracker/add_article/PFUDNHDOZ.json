      "summary": "Anguilla, a tiny Caribbean territory, has turned its .ai country-code top-level domain into a lucrative revenue stream, driven by the AI boom and high-profile purchases such as Dharmesh Shah’s $700,000 you.ai. In 2024 the island earned about $39 million from domain sales—nearly a quarter of its total revenue—while tourism accounts for 37%. The government has partnered with Identity Digital to manage the domain registry, aiming to diversify income and fund infrastructure, including a new airport, to mitigate hurricane‑related tourism losses. The .ai domain market has expanded from 50,000 registrations in 2020 to over 850,000, with recent auctions reaching six‑figure prices, positioning Anguilla as a notable example of a small nation monetizing its digital identity.",
