      "text": "National Marriage Week started Friday and runs through Valentine\u2019s Day. In a society that often makes fun of the institution of marriage, this week is designed to shift the negative narrative and instead celebrate marriage.\nWhile most people want to get married, research indicates they worry that their relationship won\u2019t last. They think marriage is hard. And why wouldn\u2019t they? That\u2019s the message society sends them.\nThis belief is leading to a growing hesitation toward marriage. In 1980, 90% of 35-year-old men were married. Today, according to the Institute for Family Studies, this number has dropped to just 60%.\nYet most of us deeply desire to love and be loved \u2013 to know that love will last. Most of us want a family and a safe, healthy home. So how do we get there?\nWHAT'S THE SECRET TO A HAPPY MARRIAGE? ONE SIMPLE WORD\nAt a time when stress, anxiety and division seem to dominate American culture, people need something positive and hopeful to aspire toward. Our home life affects everything we do and everywhere we go \u2013 from our jobs to our emotional well-being.\nA strong, loving marriage creates stability, not just for the couple but for children, work environments and entire communities. When marriages are loving and steady, families become a source of joy and strength \u2013 creating a society that is not only healthier, but also more compassionate and better equipped to handle life\u2019s challenges.\nmarri\nNational Marriage Week\u2019s spokesperson, Arlene Pellicane, just released a book that speaks directly to this issue. Her book, \"Making Marriage Easier; How To Love (and like) Your Spouse For Life\" launched on Feb. 4. Pellicane says that if couples prioritize four intentional goals, they can build a happier, stronger marriage. By focusing on positive, practical steps, marriage can be the fulfilling and fun relationship so many desire.\nSo what are those four simple goals?\nPlay By the Rules\nWhat\u2019s your goal as a couple? Is it prioritizing church together on Sundays? Avoiding close friendships with the opposite sex? Sitting down for dinner as a family each night? Establish and agree on clear priorities and boundaries together.\nGive Thanks Every Day\nBe grateful for each other and express it! Find things to appreciate about your spouse and say them out loud. Every spouse wants to feel appreciated and valued.\nServe One Another\nShift your mindset from What can they do for me? to What can I do for them? Thoughtful gestures \u2013 big or small \u2013 strengthen the bond. And when both partners serve each other, both feel more connected, respected and treasured.\nI FOUND TRUE LOVE AND A HAPPY MARRIAGE USING THIS 90S-STYLE BLUEPRINT. IT WILL WORK FOR YOU, TOO\nTake Fun Seriously\nFun is what brought you together in the first place! Laughter and shared experiences are vital to a growing and healthy marriage. Don\u2019t let the years dull your sense of playfulness. It can be as simple as making a heart-shaped pancake or trying a new hobby like painting together. Struggling couples often aren\u2019t having fun together.\nLike with anything worthwhile, marriage takes effort. Every couple faces ups and downs. But imagine a nation filled with stronger and happier marriages \u2013 homes where children feel safe and secure, knowing their parents aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nAccording to a study by economists David G. Blanchflower and Andrew J. Oswald (Journal of Public Economics), having a job increases happiness by 50%, and an above average income boosts it by 88%. But marriage? It increases happiness by 151% compared to never being married.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nStronger and happier marriages don\u2019t just benefit couples \u2013 they strengthen cities and communities. Research consistently shows that stable homes lead to lower crime rates, fewer troubled teens and less incarceration.\nWho wouldn\u2019t want that?"
