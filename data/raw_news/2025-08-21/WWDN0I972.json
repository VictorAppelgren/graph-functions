  "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer Said Quantum Computing Could Quench AI\u2019s Thirst For Water As He Discussed These 14 Stocks . Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s shares have reversed their trend as we settle into the year\u2019s second half. While they are up by a modest 6.4% year-to-date, since late June, the stock has gained 22%. A key reason driving Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s share performance is the performance of its cloud computing business. Additionally, not only do the firm\u2019s troubles with the Justice Department appear to have been placed on the back burner, but it has also delivered strong performance with its Search and YouTube business. Cramer discussed Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in terms of quantum computing:\n\n\u201c[When he wondered how many years away are we from scaled quantum and which stocks might be worth it] Well you know then the question is [inaudible] you really want to go after, it\u2019s Google and it\u2019s IBM.\n\nCramer mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and quantum computing in an earlier episode as well. Here is what he said:\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "text": "In this piece, we will look at the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed how small-cap stocks soared after investors became hopeful about interest rate cuts. However, he cautioned about getting too optimistic:\n\u201cYesterday was really an amazing day because people were split about how hot or cool the CPI was. But then suddenly, people just, this wave of people just determined that it was not only cool, but perhaps, perhaps we even could get a 50 basis point, which I think is a fantasy. But, I saw stocks ignite, when I saw the financials go crazy, David, I know it\u2019s a little controversial, but what financial just exploded yesterday?\u201d\nThe conversation then shifted to AI computing infrastructure firm CoreWeave. Cramer believes that the firm could post a higher backlog if it were not constrained by power. AI power consumption is of key interest to investors as high-end chips can consume as much as 3.7 MWh of power annually.\nWhile AI power consumption is concerning, another key concern is its water demand due to cooling requirements. Cramer\u2019s co-host Carl Quintanilla pointed out that water was a key issue as he quoted a report which projected that by 2030, data centers in Texas would account for 7% of the state\u2019s water consumption. The data center water use amounts to 399 billion gallons, and Cramer countered by sharing that building data centers in Washington, where there was ample water, could be one way to accommodate AI\u2019s thirst.\nThe CNBC TV host then admitted that the industry is still struggling to reconcile with the high water and power requirements. According to him:\n\u201cThese things, they haven\u2019t figured out how to do it. Some people feel that\u2019s why quantum has to be involved, because quantum doesn\u2019t burn. . .\u201d\nCramer also believes that nuclear power could be the answer to AI\u2019s power demand as wind and solar power are unreliable. \u201cBut nuclear is the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cWind is great, except for sometimes it\u2019s not winding. And solar\u2019s great, but, jeez the Sun, I mean. I don\u2019t know, sometimes I think is that the Sun? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m new to this town,\u201d Cramer added.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on August 13th.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n14. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2025: 77\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)\u2019s shares have been performing well lately as mergers and acquisitions pick up. They have gained 25.5% year-to-date and are up by 56% since the post-Liberation Day dip in April. Cramer\u2019s previous comments about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) have discussed the bank\u2019s valuation and commented that a price-to-earnings ratio of 16 was too low. The shares are currently trading at a P/E ratio of 15.9, while the CNBC host believes they should trade at least 18. This time, Cramer discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in the context of broader market activity and President Trump\u2019s belief that its top management should switch careers:\n\u201cThe reason I brought it up instead of Rocket Mortgage is because Goldman encapsulates everything, IPOs, right, M&A, trading volume. This is the barometer for this stock market and it took off in a way that I haven\u2019t seen in ages.\n\u201cI just wonder what the President thinks of Kostin. Because Kostin\u2019s very good. . .no, no I think Kostin\u2019s good.\u201d\nHere is what Cramer believes about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)\u2019s valuation:\n\u201cGoldman, Goldman and Morgan. I think that Goldman stock has been elevated because of things I guess. Now see, Goldman\u2019s only at [inaudible] it\u2019s got a parabolic move. But it sells at 16 times earnings. That is a candidate to be revalued up to 18, 19 times earnings.\u201d\n13. CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2025: 36\nCoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is a key player in the AI industry as it hosts and provides computing infrastructure to AI software companies. The shares have gained 132% since their IPO in March but have lost 49% since their peak in June. The day Cramer made these remarks about CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) was key as the stock closed 21% lower. The CNBC TV host commented on the firm in the morning and discussed CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\u2019s earnings call. His comments about waiting were also prescient, given the major share price dip. However, Cramer believes that electricity constraints are preventing CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) from having a higher backlog:\n\u201cBut I do think Carl, when we look at what\u2019s happened with CoreWeave, what we have to focus on, is the lockup. The expiration of the lockup. Cause I don\u2019t want people to get in it. That\u2019s the 15th, tomorrow. I don\u2019t want anyone to see it, it\u2019s after the close tomorrow. I just think that if you people want to be in it, you have to wait till things settle down.\n\u201cThe call was filled with congratulations, and people are very excited about the fact that everybody has to build one of these. David, just for you, I was going over with Michael Intrator, the size of what people have to build. HE\u2019s talking about six San Franciscos. Six San Franciscos. . . .well he felt, well the problem is Mark Zuckerberg was talking about various parts of the map, but didn\u2019t talk about the actual building. Six San Franciscos. . .\n\u201cBut with CoreWeave you\u2019ve gotta understand. If we go to reasoning, the next generation of NVIDIA, Vera Rubin, from Philadelphia by the way, what you will find is that\u2019s reasoning. And that\u2019s what we need in all this. In order to reason you need much more power.\n\u201cI do think that what they did, they\u2019re constrained [in the backlog] by power, you need more power. They could do a much bigger backlog but they don\u2019t have the power.\u201d"

      "text": "On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market\u2019s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy\u2019s progress.\nThe conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA\u2019s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery.\nFirestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market\u2019s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year\u2019s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She\u2019s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is.\nThat being said, we\u2019re here with a list of the 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports and Reddit threads to compile a list of the top 30 stocks that should double in 3 years. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years\n30. Sezzle Inc. (NASDAQ:SEZL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\nSezzle Inc. (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a technology-enabled payments company that offers solutions in-store and at online retail stores. It also provides the Sezzle Platform, which offers a payment solution for consumers that extends credit at the point-of-sale. This allows consumers to purchase and receive the ordered merchandise at the time of sale while paying in installments over time.\nThe company\u2019s On-Demand product is an offering launched in Q4 2024 through a banking partnership with WebBank. This innovative Pay-in-4 solution distinguishes itself by allowing consumers to use Buy Now Pay Later capabilities virtually anywhere Visa is accepted. This convenience is even extended to customers without a Sezzle Premium or Anywhere subscription.\nThe performance of On-Demand is reflected in the surge of Monthly On-Demand & Subscriber Users, which reached 707,000 by the close of December 2024. This represents a 130% increase year-over-year and an addition of 178,000 users sequentially. Furthermore, Sezzle Inc. (NASDAQ:SEZL) successfully onboarded 3 substantial enterprise-level merchants (Backcountry, Bealls, and Rural King) in the same quarter, with GMVs ranging from ~$700 million to over $1.5 billion.\n29. Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\nOpendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) operates a digital platform for residential real estate transactions in the US. It also provides real estate brokerage, title insurance & settlement, escrow services, property & casualty insurance, real estate licenses, and construction services.\nIn 2024, despite macroeconomic headwinds, Opendoor purchased 30% more homes year-over-year. The contribution margin increased to 4.7%, which was an improvement from the negative 3.7% recorded in 2023. Recognizing the slower start to the 2025 spring selling season and persistent market depression, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) also began increasing spreads in January to better manage risk.\nOpendoor is actively enhancing the customer experience to drive higher conversion rates. This includes improvements to its pricing models. Notably, ~70% of the company\u2019s 2024 acquisitions originated from sellers who initially declined an offer but later accepted a refreshed one after re-engagement. For Q1 2025, the company anticipates revenue between $1 billion and $1.075 billion."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play.

      "text": "David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management, joined CNBC on May 1 to discuss the AI-driven demand for data centers and tariff uncertainty. The main concerns regarding tariffs are the potential impact on costs, the resilience of supply chains, and the overall effect on business operations and their expansion. He also shared his perspective on why investors are still confident in the broadband and digital infrastructure sector. He characterized broadband as universally essential and emphasised that the demand for faster connectivity has not slowed, which is why the regulatory support for broadband expansion is globally robust. Grain noted that the administration has also met expectations for lighter regulation in the infrastructure sector, which makes it easier to advance projects and close deals. He described the admin\u2019s stance as pro-growth and supportive of secure and competitive networks. Grain also observed that infrastructure, especially broadband, is an area where there is bipartisan support, given its positive impact on economic growth at both the state and local levels.\nDeepSeek\u2019s announcement was also followed by reports that suggested that some companies might be pulling back on data center spending. However, the latest earnings reports appeared to settle at least this debate and confirmed that the investments in this sector were still ongoing. David Grain elaborated on the current trends in data center investments and also stated that the demand for data centers is rising due to the increasing expansion of AI, as it requires vast amounts of computing power. He explained that while the demand here is not slowing, the feasibility of building new data centers is still influenced by the availability of reliable and high-capacity electricity.\nThat being said, we\u2019re here with a list of the 11 hidden AI stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top hidden AI stocks with AI-related operations and opportunities.
