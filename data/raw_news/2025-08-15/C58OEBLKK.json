  "description": "Brandon Zelman and Harrison Bryan are taking the premise of Pokemon into uncharted territory!",
  "content": "Brandon Zelman and Harrison Bryan are grabbing life by the balls!\n\nMaybe I should back up for a second. Like most millennials, the creative partners grew up on a steady diet of Pok\u00e9mon. From the video games, to the collectable trading cards, to the anime TV series, the wonderful world of Pocket Monsters was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 a cornerstone of their respective identities.\n\n\"I\u2019m a lifelong fan,\u201d Zelman, who hosts a Pok\u00e9mon-centric podcast, declares over Zoom. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re coming up on the 30th year. It\u2019s so crazy to have been a fan of something for that long and for it to have been engaging the whole time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bryan (creator of A Hanukkah Carol) recently attempted to beat the original Pok\u00e9mon Blue with nothing but a roster of Meowths. Pretty hardcore.\n\nGiven the duo\u2019s undying affection for the franchise, it only made sense for them to write \u2014 what else? \u2014 an immersive Pok\u00e9mon parody musical! And given that Pok\u00e9mon trainers catch and store their pugilistic creatures in nifty orbs that fit snugly on one\u2019s belt, the project could only be named \u2014 what else? \u2014 BALLS: The Monster-Catchin\u2019 Musical Comedy, which has enjoyed an extremely limited pop-up run throughout New York City these last few months.\n\n\u201cWe were sort of averse to the typical parody, things that are just a little too one-to-one for us,\u201d Zelman explains. \u201cSo we set off with the intention of playing in this sandbox of a slightly existing world and then subverting it; restructuring it into our own sand castles to create an original story that was as much about our relationship to the video game and anime in the \u201890s as it was about the material itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we developed the piece, as we wrote it, as we created these songs and these scenes, we never lost sight of how excited our 10-year-old [selves] would be that we get to re-examine our childhood through this parody,\u201d echoes Bryan, who also stars in the show as the antagonistic Warlordturtle.\n\nThat\u2019s just one of 151 original \u201cCollectabuddies\" \u2014 all of whom have their own \u201csatiric game cards\u201d and are safe from incurring the wrath of the notoriously litigious Nintendo, which owns stake in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise \u2014 created for BALLS. \u201cIt\u2019s really both a celebration and an evolution of the material,\u201d Zelman affirms. \u201cWe managed to dance our way through where we never actually quite touch any trademarked material. It was an elegant dance around any of that kind of stuff. We're really, really proud of the material and the world that we created out of it.\u201d\n\nThe resultant book and lyrics shine a hilarious spotlight on the dubious premise Pok\u00e9mon presents: encouraging the player to capture wild animals and force them into combat. \u201cThere\u2019s this suspension of disbelief when you\u2019re playing it,\u201d notes Zelman. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re in this magical world, this is how it works. The monsters listen, you tell them what to do, you capture them, you fight them, and all of this is totally kosher. It\u2019s the basis of this whole society.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to capture a wild monster and force it to be my friend and fight other monsters?\u201d muses Bryan. \u201cThese are the ethical and kind of hilarious questions we now get to explore in our 30s when, at 10-years-old, we were just begging for more and never asking.\"\n\nAnother question they both had: \u201cWhat if the non-playable character becomes the hero?\u201d To that end, BALLS imagines a reality where the kindly Professor NPC who offers you a choice of three starter monsters is actually the one who created both the technology and normalized culture of trapping living things in spherical prisons. This plan to make the world safe by rebranding wild animals into \u201cCollectabuddies\u201d eventually blows up in The Professor\u2019s face like a self-destructing Electrode and sparks an adventure that also ropes in the man\u2019s \u201cpiece of sh** \u2014 aka The Rival (Teresa Attridge dialing the insufferable Gary Oak archetype up to eleven).\n\n\u201cThe major relationship in the show is between an older generation and a younger generation fighting over what\u2019s right about this world,\u201d explains Bryan, who doesn\u2019t \u201csee a ton of parody musicals\u201d with messages about defying limitations (both personal and societal) and the critical need for environmental conservation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact and partnership with the New York Marine Rescue Center, and some of our our proceeds have gone to helping these turtles get rehabilitated and returned to the wild. We\u2019ve even adopted a turtle.\u201d\n\nHe later continues: \u201cWe have embraced the interactivity of the raw material and [the fact] that this show is not just a theater experience. This show is also a game. It is also a cartoon \u2026 It\u2019s very rare to experience both a non-scripted narrative and a very precise, timed-out musical to a track. We are so ambitious in how we tell this story that I think traditional theatergoers will be like, \u2018Wow, look at these theatrical conceptions!\u2019 And non-theater goers are going into this and saying, \u2018Wow, what a party!\u2019\"\n\nTo raise money for the multimedia production that involves everything from puppets to video segments, the creators turned to Kickstarter, ultimately netting just over $36,000 out of a $30,000 goal and becoming one of the crowdfunding site\u2019s \u201cProjects We Love.\u201d\n\nFor the music, Zelman and Bryan called on composers like Lena Gabrielle (Emojiland), Pippa Cleary (The Great British Bake Off Musical), Joriah Kwam\u00e9 (Little Miss Perfect), Aaron Kenny (The Little Mermaid), and Grace Yurchuk (Caesar: The Musical), Allan Nalven (\"LSDJ\"), and Matthew Ryan Hunter (NBC) for something in the vein of the \"SpongeBob musical where you have a lot of different musical artists lending their voices to give that sort of eclectic feel,\" Zelman says.\n\nAllan Nalven even went so far as to compose music inside an actual GameBoy console \u201cto create the most authentic music and sound effects that you could achieve,\u201d Zelman adds. And while the show is very much a satire, it never forgets to pay homage to the fandom that led to its existence in the first place. \u201cWe were dedicated to making sure the lyrics were dense with Easter eggs. So you could go back, revisit it, and be like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a reference to that very, very niche memory I have of this very, very peculiar aspect of this thing that was buried in the back recesses of my brain!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to us that we\u2019re celebrating it while we\u2019re lampooning it,\u201d agrees Bryan. \"I think it\u2019s fair to say that in many respects, it shaped so much of our social interactions and friendships. That\u2019s really important to celebrate while lampooning.\"\n\nThe creators also sought input from individuals who aren\u2019t die-hard Pok\u00e9mon fans as a way to combat any rose-colored missteps. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t love the story and characters, they wouldn\u2019t be as on board as they are now with this adventure,\u201d Bryan explains. \u201cSo I think working outside of our own fandom actually proved tremendous in the creative process.\u201d\n\nAbout a month before BALLS was set to debut its first performance, however, the actor playing the Professor dropped out, leaving the entire production in the lurch. With nothing to lose, Zelman and Bryan made a Hail Mary offer to Stuart Zagnit, OG voice of Professor Oak in the English dub of the Pok\u00e9mon anime series, never thinking he\u2019d actually accept.\n\n\u201cIt is a very strange merging of the things that are probably the most important to me,\u201d Zagnit, a veteran of the musical theater scene, says of the meta casting. \u201cHaving been involved with Pok\u00e9mon for the first 10 years of its existence is something I\u2019m very proud of, but I kind of put it in a different side of my life and career. It wasn\u2019t until the anime convention world really emerged that I re-embraced it. So now, to have a vehicle that actually blends both sides of my professional performing career, is kind of like a dream that I never imagined would be realized.\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s for certain: this ain\u2019t the kindly Professor of you remember, with BALLS taking Zagnit to \u201cplaces I have never gone before,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople get to hear me say really off color-things that I would never have said [in the anime]. It\u2019s kind of fun to let go and be in that persona, but also be breaking out of the persona at the same time.\u201d\n\nZelman adds that a lot of the \"crude, rude, and lewd stuff\u201d contained within the show isn\u2019t just for shock value. \"It\u2019s all there because when you\u2019re a little kid and you have the power to name your character, you might just go ahead and call them \u2018Butthead,\u2019\u201d he notes. \u201cThat might be an act of rebellion, [but] you walk around and you get a laugh every single time. We\u2019re trying to really lock into that youthful feeling of picking up a game and entering this world that\u2019s familiar, but different every time.\u201d\n\nBecause of the pop-up rollout, there have only been about a week\u2019s worth of BALLS performances across a period of fourth months, according to Zagnit\u2019s estimate (those wishing to check it out can follow the official Instagram for regular announcements).\n\nBut if the team has its way, this smattering of shows is the start of something much bigger, \u201cthe beginning of a movement,\" Bryan says.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re creating here is really special, and there\u2019s a huge community for it in New York and around the world. There is a renaissance of independent theater-making Off-Broadway that is proving to be a more sustainable model than the large, corporate worlds of the Broadway theaters. If we can help pave a way for more theater makers who are game to think outside the box and include audiences of larger accessibilities, then that would be a very noble endeavor for BALLS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all kinds of dreams,\u201d Zelman finishes. \u201cAs we continue to grow and reach our audience, we\u2019re really trying to find ways to touch people who maybe aren\u2019t so familiar with theater, but are familiar with our inspiration. So we want to go to conventions. We want to take it out on the road and meet people where they are \u2026 I want to be at trading card shows. I want to have \u2018BALLS Fest.\u2019 I\u2019m hungry for it. I want people to meet our monsters, see our show, and celebrate with us.\"\n\nZagnit closes out the discussion by appealing to potential investors, who have a unique opportunity \u201cto get in on the ground floor\" of a project with plenty of room to \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 evolve. \u201cThere\u2019s a big audience out there that just wants to go and have a good time,\" he concludes. \"And we certainly give them a good time.\u201d\n\nThe musical will enjoy a panel at this year\u2019s edition of New York Comic Con with the Q&A discussion moderated by none other than Veronica Taylor, the original voice of Ash Ketchum.
