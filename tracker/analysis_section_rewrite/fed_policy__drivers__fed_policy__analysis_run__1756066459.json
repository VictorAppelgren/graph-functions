      "feedback": "This draft nails the broad regime map and uses credible proxies (Ford, ACMR) and source IDs, but it overreaches with irrelevant material, underdelivers on the causal engine from policy to valuations, and omits explicit, testable scenario logic; tighten by pruning non-material items (Urban Crime Dynamics; Marijuana Rescheduling; the Intel-stake chatter) unless you can tie them to a tangible channels story (regulatory risk, funding access, or supply-chain reconfiguration), and fix the tariff framing where sources clash (choose a single envelope—15% per US Tariffs RHFWI02JT—and treat the 90‑day pause T1QE6JPIX as a near-term shock absorber, not a replacement for the baseline). Strengthen the first-principles causal chain: define how policy reaction functions and tariffs feed input-cost pressure, inflation expectations, and real rates, then how those feed equity multiples and capex allocation (fab/AI data-center). Deepen regime structure with explicit, comparable conditions for A–D (macros, policy stance, flow/positioning, and valuation tilt) and attach a one-line mechanism per regime plus explicit invalidation triggers (e.g., energy-price regime shift, memoized policy pivot, or a surprise acceleration/deceleration in automation pace). Quantify everything with ranges rather than point estimates and connect them to sources: probabilities (50/30/20), energy regimes (Brent mid-60s, WTI low-60s) tied to J99EM2TPZ/T1QE6JPIX, capex signals, and Ford/ACMR metrics (EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; 2025 ACMR revenue ≈ $900m; GM ≈ 4%), ensuring every assertion cites an ID (no uncited numbers). Reconcile conflicts by presenting a single base-case tariff framework with clear transmission channels, then add a near-term catalyst row (tariff pause) and a separate “policy risk” column; upgrade the watch-list to 4–5 decisive signals (policy posture/tariff status; concrete US fab/AI-capex announcements; oil-regime shifts via Brent/WTI; durable dispersion/real-rate impact on multiples; and concrete Intel/semicon policy developments with potential monetization). Finally, improve readability and alignment with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a two-block flow: block one—macro-policy–flows–positioning; block two—valuation/technicals–watchlist–invalidations—with crisp linkage (explicit cause → effect → market signal) and ensure every claim tracks to the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL.",
