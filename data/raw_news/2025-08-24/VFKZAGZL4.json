  "description": "Trump says Intel agreed to give US a stake in its company",
  "content": "The Intel logo is displayed on the exterior of Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Jan. 12, 2011.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday announced the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed just a couple weeks after he was depicting the company\u2019s CEO as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\u201d Trump wrote in a post.\n\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges. All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece \u2014 a discount from Friday\u2019s closing price at $24.80.\n\nThat spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper. The remarkable turn of events makes the U.S. government one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is in the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\n\nIntel\u2019s current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, and earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist.\n\nTrump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\n\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023.\n\nTrump hailed Tan as \u201chighly respected\u201d CEO in his Friday post. In a statement, Tan applauded Trump for \u201cdriving historic investments in a vital industry\u201d and resolved to reward his faith in Intel.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,\u201d Tan said.\n\nIntel\u2019s current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later.\n\nThe company\u2019s market value currently stands at about $108 billion - a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion. The stake is coming primarily through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\n\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n\n\u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201dAbout $7.8 billion had been been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called \u201cSecure Enclave.\u201d\n\nAlthough the U.S. government can\u2019t vote with its shares and won\u2019t have a seat on Intel\u2019s board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\n\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,\u201d Lincicome posted Friday.\n\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel\u2019s stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\n\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,\u201d Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government.,\u201d Tengler said.\n\nAlthough rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nThe government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM. The U.S. government\u2019s stake in Intel coincides with Trump\u2019s push to bring production to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world.\n\nBy lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\n\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",

      "text": "Intel used to be the most valuable U.S. chipmaker. How it fell far behind Nvidia\n- Share via\n- Intel, once the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, is at a pivotal point in its 57-year history as the AI race with rivals such as Nvidia heats up.\n- Intel\u2019s new chief executive is trying to turn around the company. Missed opportunities, manufacturing delays and management missteps slowed down Intel\u2019s growth throughout the years, analysts said.\nEarlier this year, Intel\u2019s new chief executive Lip-Bu Tan made frank remarks about how the Silicon Valley chipmaker keeps coming up short.\n\u201cFor quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation. As a result, we have been too slow to adapt and to meet your needs,\u201d Tan told Intel\u2019s customers and partners at a company event in late March. \u201cYou deserve better, and we need to improve, and we will.\u201d\nIntel, a Santa Clara-based tech behemoth that fueled the rise of personal computers, sits at a major crossroads in the company\u2019s 57-year-old history as the competition to dominate artificial intelligence escalates. Known for making the \u201cbrains\u201d that power computers, Intel used to be the most valuable U.S. chipmaker before Nvidia claimed the top spot. It\u2019s also facing more competition from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Samsung.\nThe AI frenzy has greatly benefited Nvidia, a company that created a specialized computer chip that\u2019s proven valuable not only for gaming but also for AI model training, data centers and robotics. While Nvidia\u2019s worth ballooned to more than $4 trillion, Intel has seen its market value drop to around $87 billion.\nSanta Clara chipmaker Nvidia has ridden the AI revolution to briefly vault over Microsoft and Apple and become the world\u2019s most valuable company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for them,\u201d said Mario Morales, group vice president for enabling technologies and semiconductors at the International Data Corporation. \u201cThey missed a very big shift and they don\u2019t yet have the products in AI to compete \u2014 and that market is growing fast.\u201d\nIn the last five years, Intel\u2019s stock price has plunged more than 58%. It posted a net loss of $18.8 billion in 2024 and plans to slash roughly 25,000 workers this year.\nIntel\u2019s lengthy history has been filled with highs and lows, but a series of big missed opportunities, manufacturing delays and management missteps hampered the growth of a company long synonymous with Silicon Valley\u2019s rise, analysts say. Tan, a 65-year-old tech leader who became Intel\u2019s chief executive in March, is trying to steer the company in the right direction.\nIntel has bet big on its foundry business, taking on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for other companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Reining in costs, Intel has scrapped manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland while slowing construction of its Ohio factories.\n\u201cThere are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,\u201d Tan told employees in a memo last week.\nIntel\u2019s rise and fall\nFounded in 1968, Intel focused heavily on researching and developing new technologies in its early days.\nRobert Noyce and Gordon Moore, already well-known tech figures, left their jobs at Fairchild Semiconductor to launch what would become Intel. Noyce co-invented the integrated circuit, laying the foundation for the development of laptops, smartphones and other modern electronics. Moore was known for making an observation that became a guiding principle for the semiconductor industry.\nThe company grew rapidly in its early years. Intel\u2019s first engineers worked from a conference room in Mountain View, Calif., before the company moved to its own facility in Santa Clara. The company released memory chips before creating the world\u2019s first commercially available microprocessor and other innovations that made it possible for companies to build more affordable computers. As computer sales from Dell, Microsoft and other tech companies rose, Intel saw its market value reach a record $495 billion in 2000 during the dot-com boom, according to Reuters.\nBut the company also made a series of missteps that would haunt it later, analysts said. Intel declined to comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been on a weak footing for so long because of those historical poor decisions,\u201d said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst at eMarketer. \u201cNow it\u2019s at this point where it has to cut all these costs to try and become profitable.\u201d\nOne of Intel\u2019s biggest missed opportunities: supplying chips for the first iPhone in 2007.\nFormer Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini told The Atlantic in 2013 that Apple was interested in paying a certain price for a chip but it was below what Intel forecasted. That prediction turned out to be wrong and Otellini expressed regret for not following his gut.\nApple Inc. is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the plans.\n\u201cWe ended up not winning it \u2014 or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we\u2019d done it,\u201d Otellini said in that interview.\nBut strategic missteps weren\u2019t Intel\u2019s only problems. The company experienced process technology delays, opening the door for its rivals such as AMD that offered powerful and efficient chips to capture customers.\nPat Gelsinger, who served as Intel\u2019s chief technology officer before returning to lead the chipmaker in 2021, focused on an ambitious and costly turnaround plan for the company. He set a goal in which Intel would develop five new semiconductor process nodes within four years.\nThe federal government awarded Intel billions of dollars last year to support its semiconductor manufacturing expansion in the United States but the company\u2019s net losses were also widening. In 2024, Intel\u2019s foundry business reported an operating loss of $13.4 billion, nearly double compared with the previous year\u2018s loss, according to its annual report.\n\u201cGelsinger threw fuel on the fire, because he started spending money like crazy to build out this massive amount of manufacturing capacity for business that they did not have,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein covering U.S. Semiconductors.\nThen the board reportedly forced out Gelsinger, who announced his retirement last year before Tan took over as chief executive.\nAnother turnaround plan\nIntel\u2019s new chief executive has been focused on cutting costs including around the company\u2019s foundry business. He told employees in a note last week the company invested too much money without enough demand.\nAnd Intel said it might pause or discontinue its upcoming chip manufacturing process technology known as 14A if it can\u2019t land a \u201csignificant\u201d customer.\nIntel Corp. is shedding thousands of workers and cutting expenses as its new CEO works to revive the struggling chipmaker\u2019s fortunes.\nWhile Intel has been eclipsed by some of its rivals, the company is still a big player in the semiconductor industry.\nIDC, which analyzed semiconductor revenue, said in 2024 Intel ranked third behind Nvidia and Samsung. It dropped to the fourth spot behind SK Hynix, a South Korean company that supplies memory chips, during the first quarter of this year.\nAnalysts don\u2019t see Intel going away anytime soon. And as tech companies work on rolling out new AI-powered hardware, that could also present another opportunity for Intel.\nAlvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at Forrester, said some of the concerns around Intel being in trouble might be \u201coverstated.\u201d\n\u201cThey may not be at the top like they once were, but they are still, ultimately, very important for all industries because their chips are used virtually everywhere,\u201d he said."

That\u2019s down from 99,500 core employees at the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction.\n\u201cI know the past few months have not been easy. We are making hard but necessary decisions to streamline the organization, drive greater efficiency and increase accountability at every level of the company,\u201d Tan wrote.\nIn addition, Intel will scrap previously planned projects in Germany and Poland and also move assembly and test operations in Costa Rica to larger sites in Vietnam and Malaysia. Costa Rica will remain a \u201chome to key engineering teams and corporate functions,\u201d Tan said in the memo.\nIn the U.S., the company said it will \u201cfurther\u201d slow construction of a semiconductor plant in Ohio.\nFounded in 1968 at the start of the PC revolution, Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple\u2019s 2007 release of the iPhone, and it\u2019s lagged more nimble chipmakers.

Excluding one-time items, the company posted a loss of 10 cents a share.\nRevenue was flat at $12.9 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting adjusted earnings of 1 cent per share on revenue of $12 billion, according to a poll by FactSet."

      "text": "Intel hires former board member as new CEO in struggling chipmaker\u2019s latest comeback attempt\nStruggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.\nTan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel\u2019s previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker\u2019s ability to survive as an independent company.\nThis won\u2019t be Tan\u2019s first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel\u2019s board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel\u2019s board in addition to becoming CEO.\n\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel\u2019s interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.\nIntel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.\nAlthough Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel\u2019s stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.\nMore recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.\nIt was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.\nBut as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple\u2019s 2007 release of the iPhone, and it\u2019s lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel\u2019s troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech\u2019s hottest commodity.\nNvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel\u2019s $90 billion. Intel\u2019s stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday\u2019s extended trading after Tan\u2019s hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company\u2019s fortunes.\nWhile Tan was Cadence Design\u2019s CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company\u2019s stock price increased by 44-fold.\nTan\u2019s past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association\u2019s 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel\u2019s co-founders."

      "text": "Trump says Intel CEO is \u2018highly conflicted,\u2019 calls for his resignation\n- Share via\nChipmaker Intel is the latest tech company facing political pressure from President Trump.\nOn Thursday, Trump called for the immediate resignation of Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March to turn around the beleaguered company.\nThe Silicon Valley tech giant, which has a new leader, has lagged behind its rivals during the AI boom and is slashing costs.\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform.\nTrump didn\u2019t say what the conflicts were in his post, but his remarks came after Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter to Intel\u2019s board, expressing national security concerns about Tan\u2019s reported ties to Chinese companies. Cotton cited a report from Reuters that said Tan has invested in more than 600 Chinese firms and some of them have links to the country\u2019s military.\nTrump\u2019s call for Tan\u2019s resignation adds to a list of issues Intel already has to deal with.\nThe 57-year-old tech company, once the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, is trying to keep up as the race to dominate artificial intelligence escalates. The Santa Clara, Calif., company has been losing money and has seen its stock price plunge while it falls behind rivals such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\nIntel\u2019s share price closed at $19.77 on Thursday, down 3%.\nThe company said in a statement that its board and Tan are \u201cdeeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d\nTrump said Wednesday during an event in which Apple announced an additional $100-billion investment in the United States that he plans to place a tariff on semiconductors, but that there won\u2019t be a charge for companies building in the U.S.\nPresident Trump has criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones outside of the United States.\nAlthough he praised companies such as Apple and Nvidia, he criticized Intel.\n\u201cIntel was just taken over the coals. They were taken to the cleaners, frankly, and moved to other places, in particular Taiwan,\u201d Trump said at the event.\nIntel, known for making the \u201cbrains\u201d that power computers, has been investing heavily in its foundry business, taking on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for companies including Apple and Nvidia. During the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce awarded Intel roughly $8 billion to support manufacturing and advanced packaging projects in the U.S."

      "text": "Say farewell to the AI bubble, and get ready for the crash\n- Share via\nMost people not deeply involved in the artificial intelligence frenzy may not have noticed, but perceptions of AI\u2019s relentless march toward becoming more intelligent than humans, even becoming a threat to humanity, came to a screeching halt Aug. 7.\nThat was the day when the most widely followed AI company, OpenAI, released GPT-5, an advanced product that the firm had long promised would put competitors to shame and launch a new revolution in this purportedly revolutionary technology.\nAs it happened, GPT-5 was a bust. It turned out to be less user-friendly and in many ways less capable than its predecessors in OpenAI\u2019s arsenal. It made the same sort of risible errors in answering users\u2019 prompts, was no better in math (or even worse), and not at all the advance that OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, had been talking up.\nAI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it\u2019s looking very bubble-shaped.\n\u2014 Alex Hanna, co-author, \u201cThe AI Con\u201d\n\u201cThe thought was that this growth would be exponential,\u201d says Alex Hanna, a technology critic and co-author (with Emily M. Bender of the University of Washington) of the indispensable new book \u201cThe AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech\u2019s Hype and Create the Future We Want.\u201d Instead, Hanna says, \u201cWe\u2019re hitting a wall.\u201d\nThe consequences go beyond how so many business leaders and ordinary Americans have been led to expect, even fear, the penetration of AI into our lives. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested by venture capitalists and major corporations such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in OpenAI and its multitude of fellow AI labs, even though none of the AI labs has turned a profit.\nPublic companies have scurried to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices, much as an earlier generation of businesses promoted themselves as \u201cdot-coms\u201d in the 1990s to look more glittery in investors\u2019 eyes.\nNvidia, the maker of a high-powered chip powering AI research, plays almost the same role as a stock market leader that Intel Corp., another chip-maker, played in the 1990s \u2014 helping to prop up the bull market in equities.\nIf the promise of AI turns out to be as much of a mirage as dot-coms did, stock investors may face a painful reckoning.\nAI \u2018hallucinations\u2019 are causing lawyers professional embarrassment, sanctions from judges and lost cases. Why do they keep using it?\nThe cheerless rollout of GPT-5 could bring the day of reckoning closer. \u201cAI companies are really buoying the American economy right now, and it\u2019s looking very bubble-shaped,\u201d Hanna told me.\nThe rollout was so disappointing that it shined a spotlight on the degree that the whole AI industry has been dependent on hype.\nHere\u2019s Altman, speaking just before the unveiling of GPT-5, comparing it with its immediate predecessor, GPT-4o: \u201cGPT-4o maybe it was like talking to a college student,\u201d he said. \u201cWith GPT-5 now it\u2019s like talking to an expert \u2014 a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything any area you need on demand ... whatever your goals are.\u201d\nWell, not so much. When one user asked it to produce a map of the U.S. with all the states labeled, GPT-5 extruded a fantasyland, including states such as Tonnessee, Mississipo and West Wigina. Another prompted the model for a list of the first 12 presidents, with names and pictures. It only came up with nine, including presidents Gearge Washington, John Quincy Adama and Thomason Jefferson.\nExperienced users of the new version\u2019s predecessor models were appalled, not least by OpenAI\u2019s decision to shut down access to its older versions and force users to rely on the new one. \u201cGPT5 is horrible,\u201d wrote a user on Reddit. \u201cShort replies that are insufficient, more obnoxious ai stylized talking, less \u2018personality\u2019 \u2026 and we don\u2019t have the option to just use other models.\u201d (OpenAI quickly relented, reopening access to the older versions.)\nThe tech media was also unimpressed. \u201cA bit of a dud,\u201d judged the website Futurism and Ars Technica termed the rollout \u201ca big mess.\u201d I asked OpenAI to comment on the dismal public reaction to GPT-5, but didn\u2019t hear back.\nNone of this means that the hype machine underpinning most public expectations of AI has taken a breather. Rather, it remains in overdrive.\nA projection of AI\u2019s development over the coming years published by something called the AI Futures Project under the title \u201cAI 2027\u201d states: \u201cWe predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.\u201d\nShares in AI companies have powered a huge runup in the stock market this year, but users are beginning to question whether the craze will fall flat.\nThe rest of the document, mapping a course to late 2027 when an AI agent \u201cfinally understands its own cognition,\u201d is so loopily over the top that I wondered whether it wasn\u2019t meant as a parody of excessive AI hype. I asked its creators if that was so, but haven\u2019t received a reply.\nOne problem underscored by GPT-5\u2019s underwhelming rollout is that it exploded one of the most cherished principles of the AI world, which is that \u201cscaling up\u201d \u2014 endowing the technology with more computing power and more data \u2014 would bring the grail of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, ever closer to reality.\nThat\u2019s the principle undergirding the AI industry\u2019s vast expenditures on data centers and high-performance chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would outstrip the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. But if AI won\u2019t scale up, most if not all that money will be wasted.\nAs Bender and Hanna point out in their book, AI promoters have kept investors and followers enthralled by relying on a vague public understanding of the term \u201cintelligence.\u201d AI bots seem intelligent, because they\u2019ve achieved the ability to seem coherent in their use of language. But that\u2019s different from cognition.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re imagining a mind behind the words,\u201d Hanna says, \u201cand that becomes associated with consciousness or intelligence. But the notion of general intelligence is not really well-defined.\u201d\nIndeed, as long ago as the 1960s, that phenomenon was noticed by Joseph Weizenbaum, the designer of the pioneering chatbot ELIZA, which replicated the responses of a psychotherapist so convincingly that even test subjects who knew they were conversing with a machine thought it displayed emotions and empathy.\n\u201cWhat I had not realized,\u201d Weizenbaum wrote in 1976, \u201cis that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.\u201d Weizenbaum warned that the \u201creckless anthropomorphization of the computer\u201d \u2014 that is, treating it as some sort of thinking companion \u2014 produced a \u201csimpleminded view of intelligence.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s LLaMA chatbot was trained on a database of 200,000 books, including mine, without pay. How should authors like me think about that?\nThat tendency has been exploited by today\u2019s AI promoters. They label the frequent mistakes and fabrications produced by AI bots as \u201challucinations,\u201d which suggests that the bots have perceptions that may have gone slightly awry. But the bots \u201cdon\u2019t have perceptions,\u201d Bender and Hanna write, \u201cand suggesting that they do is yet more unhelpful anthropomorphization.\u201d\nThe general public may finally be cottoning on to the failed promise of AI more generally. Predictions that AI will lead to large-scale job losses in creative and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) might inspire feelings that the whole enterprise was a tech-industry scam from the outset.\nPredictions that AI would yield a burst of increased worker productivity haven\u2019t been fulfilled; in many fields, productivity declines, in part because workers have to be deployed to double-check AI outputs, lest their mistakes or fabrications find their way into mission-critical applications \u2014 legal briefs incorporating nonexistent precedents, medical prescriptions with life-threatening ramifications and so on.\nSome economists are dashing cold water on predictions of economic gains more generally. MIT economist Daron Acemoglu, for example, forecast last year that AI would produce an increase of only about 0.5% in U.S. productivity and an increase of about 1% in gross domestic product over the next 10 years, mere fractions of the AI camp\u2019s projections.\nThe value of Bender\u2019s and Hanna\u2019s book, and the lesson of GPT-5, is that they remind us that \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d isn\u2019t a scientific term or an engineering term. It\u2019s a marketing term. And that\u2019s true of all the chatter about AI eventually taking over the world.\n\u201cClaims around consciousness and sentience are a tactic to sell you on AI,\u201d Bender and Hanna write. So, too, is the talk about the billions, or trillions, to be made in AI. As with any technology, the profits will go to a small cadre, while the rest of us pay the price ... unless we gain a much clearer perception of what AI is, and more importantly, what it isn\u2019t.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

Insights does not appear on any news articles.\nViewpoint\nPerspectives\nThe following AI-generated content is powered by Perplexity. The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe author argues that GPT-5\u2019s launch on August 7 marked a definitive end to perceptions of AI\u2019s relentless advancement, describing the release as \u201ca bust\u201d that was less user-friendly and capable than its predecessors. The model made embarrassing errors, including creating a fantasy map of the U.S. with states like \u201cTonnessee\u201d and \u201cWest Wigina,\u201d and struggled with basic tasks like listing the first 12 presidents.\nAccording to the author\u2019s perspective, the AI industry represents a dangerous bubble reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com era, with hundreds of billions invested in AI companies despite none achieving profitability. The author contends that public companies are frantically announcing AI capabilities merely to inflate their stock prices, while Nvidia plays a similar market-propping role that Intel did during the previous tech bubble.\nThe author maintains that GPT-5\u2019s disappointing performance has shattered the fundamental \u201cscaling up\u201d principle that underpins AI development\u2014the belief that more computing power and data will lead to artificial general intelligence. This principle has justified massive expenditures on data centers and chips, with Morgan Stanley estimating $3 trillion in required capital by 2028, which the author argues will largely be wasted.\nThe piece emphasizes that \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is fundamentally a marketing term rather than a scientific one, arguing that AI promoters exploit public misunderstanding by anthropomorphizing chatbots and labeling their mistakes as \u201challucinations.\u201d The author cites the 1960s ELIZA chatbot experiment to demonstrate how humans have long been susceptible to attributing consciousness to simple computer programs.\nThe author concludes that predictions of AI-driven productivity gains and job displacement have failed to materialize, with some workers actually becoming less productive due to the need to verify AI outputs, while economists like MIT\u2019s Daron Acemoglu project minimal economic benefits from AI advancement.\nDifferent views on the topic\nDespite initial user complaints, industry data suggests GPT-5\u2019s adoption has been successful, with ChatGPT usage actually increasing since the model\u2019s release according to OpenAI\u2019s head of ChatGPT[1]. The model now serves nearly 700 million weekly users, indicating sustained market confidence in AI technology[2].\nOpenAI and industry partners present GPT-5 as representing significant technological advancement, describing it as achieving \u201cstate-of-the-art performance across coding, math, writing, health, visual perception, and more\u201d[4]. Companies like Amgen report that GPT-5 has met their high scientific accuracy standards and demonstrates improved navigation of ambiguous contexts compared to previous models[2].\nTechnology companies and developers offer evidence of GPT-5\u2019s superior capabilities, with Cursor describing it as \u201cthe smartest model [they\u2019ve] used\u201d and Windsurf reporting it has \u201chalf the tool calling error rate over other frontier models\u201d[3]. These assessments suggest meaningful technical progress rather than stagnation.\nIndustry leaders acknowledge implementation challenges while maintaining confidence in the underlying technology\u2019s trajectory, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman quickly responding to user feedback by promising doubled rate limits, restored access to older models, and personality improvements[1]. The company\u2019s rapid response demonstrates adaptability rather than fundamental failure.\nThe business integration of GPT-5 continues expanding across major enterprises including Microsoft platforms, with organizations like BNY, California State University, and T-Mobile already deploying AI systems for operational transformation[2][3]. This widespread adoption indicates sustained corporate belief in AI\u2019s practical value proposition."

Because together we can hold LA28 and the [International Olympic Committee] accountable,\u201d said Victor Sanchez, executive director of advocacy group Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, at the Thursday rally.\nUnion officials noted that world sporting events have often failed to produce lasting benefits for host cities, causing price increases that displace low-income residents and leaving communities indebted.\n\u201cAfter the Games are over, what\u2019s left for L.A.? \u201c said Armando Elenes, secretary-treasurer of United Farm Workers, in an interview.\nOlympic organizers and corporate partners rejected the idea that local residents would be left out of the economic benefits of hosting the Games.\nJacie Prieto Lopez, a spokesperson for LA28, said in a statement that the Olympic and Paralympic Games \u201cwill mean good-paying jobs and real opportunities for working people in Los Angeles, including benefits that reach the neighborhoods and families who keep this city running.\u201d\n\u201cIn collaboration with the City of Los Angeles, we look forward to our partnerships with local unions and remain confident the Games will bring positive economic impact to the region and leave behind a stronger future for working people,\u201d Lopez said.\nThe region\u2019s intractable housing and homelessness crisis is at the core of the union push.\nThe campaign calls for the International Olympic Committee to end its partnership with Airbnb, which it announced in 2019 and is set to last through 2028, covering five Games. Short-term rental companies have been accused of depleting housing stock by removing them from the long-term rental market, thereby driving up rents and exacerbating L.A.\u2019s homelessness crisis.\nAnd it calls on the Olympic committee as well as LA28 to contribute $5 billion to fund housing construction.\nAirbnb representatives pushed back on claims that it hurt housing stock. The company cited a study it published last year that found it had generated $4.4 billion in economic activity in L.A. in 2023, supporting thousands of jobs and bringing in $1.2 billion in tax revenue.\n\u201cAirbnb is focused on ensuring Los Angeles\u2019 visitors have an affordable place to stay, while the city gets the revenue it needs to prevent cuts to public services \u2014 all without taxing Angelenos,\u201d Justin Wesson, a senior public policy manager at Airbnb, said in a statement. \u201cUNITE HERE continues to put hotel special interests ahead of what\u2019s best for locals.\u201d\nThe company said it fills a crucial lodging gap, with the 2028 Olympics expected to draw as many as 2.3 million tourists to the Los Angeles region. Hotels in the Los Angeles area can accommodate approximately 174,000 guests per day, out of the estimated need of accommodating about 575,000 guests per day, according to Airbnb.\nThe International Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11, said that in the early stages LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman had said that if Los Angeles won its bid to host the Olympics, it would build an Olympic Village with 17,000 beds for athletes, coaches and staff that would later be converted into permanent housing. Those plans in L.A. fell through, Petersen said.\n\u201cHousing is the No. 1 problem for everyone,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWe gave [housing construction] up here. and we\u2019re saying \u2018no no no.\u2019 We need to have that vision \u2014 that vision that somehow disappeared.\u201d\nA spokesperson for LA28 said Wasserman\u2019s comments were made before a bid was submitted. The city\u2019s official bid to host the Olympics had named UCLA\u2019s campus as the site for the Olympic and Paralympic Village."

      "text": "US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors.\nThe Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development.\nPresident Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the \u201cobsolete\u201d H20 chip to China. The president credited Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for negotiating him down to 15%.\n\u201cSo we negotiated a little deal. So he\u2019s selling a essentially old chip,\u201d Trump said.\nNvidia did not comment about the specific details of the agreement or its quid pro quo nature, but said they would adhere to the export rules laid out by the administration.\n\u201cWe follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\u201d Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. \u201cAmerica cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America\u2019s AI tech stack can be the world\u2019s standard if we race.\u201d\nAMD did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nRep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern over the deal.\n\u201cThere are questions about the legal basis for doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cExport controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.\u201d\nThe top Democrat on the panel also raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it \u201ca dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.\u201d\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.\n\u201cOur export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,\u201d he said. \u201cChip export controls aren\u2019t bargaining chips, and they\u2019re not casino chips either. We shouldn\u2019t be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.\u201d\nDerek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, reiterated Moolenaar\u2019s point about the constitutionality of the deal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for this, probably because export taxes are unconstitutional, \u201d said Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThey call it a fee, but 15% of sales revenue is about a standard a tax as it comes. For this reason, I don\u2019t think the \u2018arrangement\u2019 is at all durable. \u2018\u2019\n\u201cIf it were to last, it has two possible implications. First, there\u2019s a possible export tax that high-profile companies and goods must consider. Or the tax only applies in exceptional situations, such as changing export controls. Then we\u2019d risk national security for the sake of tax revenue, which is effectively the same as cutting the defense budget,\u201d Scissors said.\nBack in July, Nvidia argued that tight export controls around their chip sales would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. They\u2019ve argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology, and have also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia\u2019s chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.\nRestrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world\u2019s two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead. Meanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes \u2014 and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.\n\u2014-\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Shawn Chen, Didi Tang and Paul Wiseman contributed to the reporting."

      "text": "Graffiti-tarnished towers in downtown L.A. remain in limbo\n- Share via\nEarly last year, vandals breached fencing, climbed dozens of flights of stairs and painted bold, colorful graffiti on the exterior of three unfinished high-rises that make up the abandoned Oceanwide Plaza development.\nThe so-called Graffiti Towers \u2014 visible from great distances on the 110 Freeway and looming over thousands of visitors attending events across the street at Crypto.com Arena \u2014 were expected to be sold in a bankruptcy auction a year ago.\nGraffiti artists made Oceanwide Plaza in downtown Los Angeles infamous. But a far more complex question looms over the real estate catastrophe: Can it be salvaged?\nBut the long-running bankruptcy sale of downtown Los Angeles\u2019 most spectacular eyesore drags on with no clear end in sight. Experts blame a confluence of factors, including high interest rates, rising construction costs and delays in attracting viable bidders.\nConstruction on what would have been one of the city\u2019s most notable landmarks, with high-rise housing, a hotel and a shopping center, halted in 2019 when Beijing-based conglomerate Oceanwide Holdings ran out of money to pay contractors after spending $1.2 billion on the complex that fills a large city block on Figueroa Street.\nBusiness leaders have expressed alarm that the graffiti some find artistic will prove embarrassing when global attention is focused on the World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2028.\nResolution of the Oceanwide Plaza saga also can\u2019t come soon enough for many downtown stakeholders who see the graffitied towers \u2014 rising as high as 49 stories \u2014 as a dark presence besmirching the city and sending a negative message about the neighborhood.\nWith downtown\u2019s office rental market mired in high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are clamoring for more city support to convert high-rises to housing that would help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\n\u201cThe Graffiti Towers have worldwide infamy at this point,\u201d said Cassy Horton, co-founder of the DTLA Residents Assn. \u201cIt\u2019s like this beacon that shines and says, \u2018Come create mischief down here and you won\u2019t get in trouble. This is the spot to do it.\u2019\u201d\nThe graffiti is likely to remain until a new owner takes on the painstaking task of removing it.\nMore than a year ago, a federal judge set a Sept. 17 auction of the property, saying there were several potential bidders. The winner of the auction ultimately wasn\u2019t able to come up with the promised purchase price and negotiations commenced with other bidders.\nThe real estate broker managing the sale, Mark Tarczynski of Colliers, declined to comment on the status of the sale but told real estate publication the Real Deal recently that two real estate development companies, one from the U.S. and one from abroad, are now competing as bidders. He said he anticipates closing the deal by the end of the year.\nThe purchase price, which would be used to pay creditors including general contractor Lendlease and EB-5 visa investors, would just be the beginning of expenses for the new owner. Estimates to complete the project reach $1 billion, even though it is about 60% completed.\nChallenges to get it done include market conditions that are hamstringing other planned real estate developments. Builders complain of high interest rates for borrowing money to finance construction.\nNew tariffs are driving up the cost of imported construction materials while raising uncertainty about how long the tariffs may last or what new ones may arise. Labor costs have also been increasing in recent years, and the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have added a destabilizing effect on the construction labor pool, industry observers have said.\nLos Angeles architect Douglas Hanson, who designed the 35-story Circa apartment complex next to Oceanwide Plaza, has an idea to shield people\u2019s gaze from the graffitied towers and bring in some money.\nHe suggests rolling down vinyl advertising signs that could be seen on the from the freeway on the west side of the complex and lowering other vinyl coverings on the east side that would display a beach scene or some other art.\n\u201cYou can get good money for advertising in that neighborhood,\u201d which allows large commercial displays, Hanson said. Ad revenue would more than pay for the signs, he said.\nThe buildings wouldn\u2019t be fully wrapped like a Christo art project, he said. \u201cJust drape them down and leave a little bit of the history of the building behind them.\u201d\nThe Oceanwide Plaza site was a sprawling asphalt lot used for event parking when Oceanwide Holdings bought it in 2014 with a vision to build a fancy, mixed-use development that was far bigger in scale than what is typically built in the U.S.\nOceanwide set to work on the complex, which was intended to house luxury condominiums, apartments, a five-star Park Hyatt hotel and an indoor mall that would include deluxe shops and restaurants. A massive electronic sign on its facade was to bring a flavor of Times Square to Figueroa Street.\nMany of the residents and visitors were expected to be Chinese citizens, but the country\u2019s government implemented tighter controls on money leaving the country in 2019 and the pool of potential condo buyers shrunk."

      "text": "Here\u2019s why you don\u2019t want the Trump administration to buy stock in Intel\n- Share via\nBack in 1935, the drafters of Social Security told Congress of their plans to build up a government pension reserve that would reach $47 billion.\nThe number shocked lawmakers. It was nearly three times the outstanding federal debt of the time.\n\u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name are you going to do with $47 billion?\u201d Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of Michigan, asked Arthur Altmeyer, one of the drafters.\nIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s rationale for taking stock in Intel (according to Commerce Secretary Lutnick)\n\u201cYou could invest it in U.S. Steel and some of the large corporations,\u201d Altmeyer suggested.\nVandenberg threw up his hands in horror. \u201cThat would be socialism!\u201d he exclaimed.\nYet the idea of federal government investments in public corporation stock has never died. It walks among us like a zombie today, with the Trump administration talking about taking a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker Intel and musing about creating a sovereign wealth fund akin to those established by Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Norway and other countries.\nHere\u2019s what history tells us about the virtues of this idea for the United States: There aren\u2019t any.\nSuch funds \u201cusually reflect the quality of governance of the states that sponsor them,\u201d observed Steven Feldstein and Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April. \u201cConsidering the Trump administration\u2019s self-dealing and erosion of accountability, there is an acute risk that the U.S. SWF could become a source of graft to reward Trump\u2019s friends, coerce political support for his priorities and bring personal enrichment.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the government said second-quarter GDP growth was 3% annualized. On Friday, the government said job growth had cratered, pointing to recession.\nLeaving aside the quality of governance in Trump\u2019s White House or legislators\u2019 fears of \u201csocialism,\u201d the idea of federal investment in public companies has never found lasting favor on Capitol Hill, for it has been almost impossible for lawmakers to overcome the touchy economic, political and philosophical issues.\nA federal fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would be one of the largest and most potent investors in the market. As I wrote in 2005, when the idea of allowing Social Security to invest its trust fund in equities was under consideration again, the potential for conflicts of interest is inescapable.\nThe government might be a major shareholder in a corporation it was prosecuting for criminal activity. The government might end up on one side of an international issue as a member of a coalition of nations, and on the opposite side as a shareholder.\nIts financial interests might stand in opposition to its social interests: In his 1999 State of the Union message, for example, President Clinton simultaneously threatened to sue the tobacco industry over its threat to public health, and advocated allowing Social Security to invest in all equities \u2014 tobacco included.\nIn 1935, Congress addressed the conundrum by mandating that the Social Security Administration invest its reserves only in U.S. Treasury securities, a rule that exists to this day.\nSocial Security\u2019s would-be reformers periodically revive proposals to shift some of the program\u2019s trust fund \u2014 which held more than $2.7 trillion in treasuries at the end of last year \u2014 into equities, pointing to their superior long-term returns compared with bonds. But those efforts have never come to fruition.\nThe federal government taking an equity stake in a public company wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented. In 2009, the Obama administration acquired a 60.8% ownership of General Motors in return for almost $50 billion in bailout funds. The government also acquired a smaller stake in Chrysler, which was subsequently sold to Fiat.\nWith his tariff \u2018deals,\u2019 President Trump leaves international trade relationships even more unsettled than before.\nThe government sold the last of its GM holdings in 2013, booking a direct loss of about $10.5 billion. But its bailout has been deemed a success, given that it saved as many as 1.9 million jobs at GM, Chrysler and their suppliers.\nThe auto bailouts were emergency initiatives, taken to stave off what was shaping up as the auto industry\u2019s imminent collapse. Obama made clear that these were temporary measures and that the government would sell off its stockholdings as soon as that was practicable. The government abjured any control over GM\u2019s day-to-day operations, but it did orchestrate the exit of GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, oversaw the replacement of a majority of its board members and imposed compensation limits on its top executives.\nThe auto bailouts followed numerous examples of U.S. government takeovers, or attempted takeovers, of private businesses. In 1791, Congress authorized the government to take a 20% stake in the Bank of the United States, and in 1816, to take the same stake in the Second Bank of the United States. These are seen today as precursors to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank as a central banking authority.\nDuring the Great Depression, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., a Hoover creation that lived well into Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, took preferred shares in numerous impaired banks in return for capital infusions they needed to survive.\nBy the end of 1935, RFC-owned preferred stock amounted to nearly 40% of total bank common stock in the United States; the RFC\u2019s hard-charging chairman, Texan Jesse Jones, was not shy about imposing \u201creasonable\u201d compensation caps on its executives or replacing them when they faltered, or prodding their managements to make loans to private borrowers, a key element of FDR\u2019s program of economic recovery.\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s remarks about billionaires has the defenders of plutocrats in a tizzy. They should stop whining already.\nThe government also exercises effective control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored mortgage companies, via a conservatorship implemented in 2008, when the housing crash heralded the outset of the Great Recession. Stock in both companies remains in private hands, but warrants allow the government to acquire up to 79.9% of the common stock of each. Those warrants haven\u2019t been exercised, but they equate to firm government authority over the firms\u2019 activities.\nTrump\u2019s proposed Intel investment would occur in a very different economic environment and have very different features from any of those precursors. The terms of the plan have been murky.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed during an appearance on CNBC Tuesday that the government would demand Intel shares in return for the roughly $10 billion in funds allocated to Intel via the Biden-era CHIPS Act, which aimed to shore up America\u2019s position in high-tech hardware.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get equity in return for it.\u201d He quoted Trump as saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.\u201d\nA $10-billion stake would be about 10% of Intel\u2019s shares. That would make the government the company\u2019s largest shareholder, outstripping the stakes held by institutional investors Vanguard and BlackRock. Lutnick said the government wouldn\u2019t exercise voting rights or involve itself in governance. But he didn\u2019t talk about a time-limited ownership, or specify what corporate policies the Trump administration would favor. As it happens, Trump has publicly demanded the resignation Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a Malaysian, over Tan\u2019s ostensible connections to China.\nDespite its stumbles in recent years, Intel doesn\u2019t appear to be facing extinction, as the automakers arguably did in 2008 and 2009. Nor would Intel\u2019s demise have anywhere near the impact on the U.S. economy that a GM collapse might have had amid the Great Recession.\nHiltzik: Crypto was already in bad odor before jumping into bed with Trump. Now it smells worse\nTrump\u2019s cryptocurrency deals have even Republicans getting concerned about the potential \u2014 and possibly the reality \u2014 of conflicts of interest and unconstitutional transactions.\nOnce the linchpin of the high-tech boom of the 1990s, Intel has plainly lost its mojo. As my colleague Queenie Wong reported, its strategic blunders have included missing out on the artificial intelligence investment boom that has made Nvidia, the maker of chips for AI development, a darling of today\u2019s stock market.\nIntel hasn\u2019t commented on the White House\u2019s interest in taking an equity stake, but Intel investors don\u2019t appear to know what to make of the idea. Shares in the company gained about 7% on Aug. 19, after Bloomberg first reported on the possibility, but have since fallen back, despite news that the Japanese investment firm SoftBank would take a $2-billion stake in the company.\nIntel shares fell 7% Wednesday in Nasdaq trading, closing at $23.54, a hair below their price prior to the Bloomberg report.\nWhether Trump could resist jawboning Intel, or any other companies in which the government holds shares, into instituting policies he favors is doubtful. He has frequently tried to exert pressure on CEOs of companies in which the government has no ownership, after all.\nThat concern would be heightened if the administration has control over a sovereign wealth fund. Trump aired that proposal via an executive order in February. The order called on Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to submit a plan by the beginning of May, but none has yet surfaced.\nA U.S. sovereign wealth fund wouldn\u2019t be based on the same principles as those of many other such ventures. \u201cSWFs have traditionally been set up by states rich in natural resources to manage their budgetary surplus, diversify their economies, and protect their wealth for future generations,\u201d observed the Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Feldstein and Vittori. That\u2019s the case with the funds of both Saudi Arabia and Norway. The U.S., however, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have excess funds to put into a SWF,\u201d Feldstein and Vittori write.\nIn a fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump mentioned $5.7 trillion in government assets, including \u201cnatural resource reserves.\u201d He has also talked about profits from crypto investments and the government take from tariffs \u2014 though the latter are essentially a tax on American consumers, who might have different ideas about how to spend the money.\nThe Carnegie researchers note that the most successful sovereign wealth funds such as Norway\u2019s \u201cmaintain operational independence and make investments based on rigorous financial criteria.\u201d Neither quality is a hallmark of the Trump administration.\nFeldstein and Vittori point out that by building a U.S. fund via tariff income or income from Trump\u2019s \u201cgold card\u201d proposal, which would give rich foreigners the right to live in the U.S. for a $5-million fee, might allow Trump to evade Congress\u2019s constitutional monopoly on raising and spending money and even allow him to manage the fund behind closed doors.\nStill, it would be up to Congress to establish the fund and oversee its operations. Will the lawmakers accept their responsibility? If not, Trump\u2019s idea is a dangerous one. \u201cGiving a president who aspires to be a king a potent financial weapon with ill-defined purposes and methods,\u201d Feldstein and Vittori write, \u201cpresents a grave risk to American democracy.\u201d\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe proposal for government equity stakes in companies like Intel creates inherent conflicts of interest, as the federal government could find itself as a major shareholder in corporations it simultaneously prosecutes for criminal activity or opposes on international issues. Historical precedent from Social Security\u2019s design shows lawmakers\u2019 longstanding wariness of such arrangements, with Congress in 1935 mandating investment only in Treasury securities to avoid these complications.\nTrump\u2019s governance record raises particular concerns about potential abuse of a sovereign wealth fund or equity stakes, with risks that such vehicles could become sources of graft to reward political allies, coerce support, and enable personal enrichment rather than serving genuine public interests. The administration\u2019s track record of self-dealing and eroded accountability heightens these risks compared to more professionally managed sovereign wealth funds in other countries.\nUnlike successful government interventions such as the 2009 auto bailouts, which were emergency measures with clear exit strategies during an imminent industry collapse, the Intel investment lacks similar justification since the company does not face extinction and its potential demise would not devastate the broader economy. The auto bailouts were explicitly temporary with defined parameters, while the Intel proposal offers no such limitations or timeframes for divestiture.\nThe proposed sovereign wealth fund differs fundamentally from successful international models, as the United States lacks the budget surpluses from natural resources that typically fund such vehicles, instead relying on tariff revenues that essentially tax American consumers. This structure could potentially allow circumvention of Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over government spending and create opportunities for behind-closed-doors management without proper oversight.\nDifferent views on the topic\nThe Trump administration justifies the equity stake approach as ensuring taxpayers receive value for government investments, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explaining the logic as \u201cIf we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action\u201d regarding the $10 billion in CHIPS Act funding already committed to Intel[1][2]. This transactional approach aims to create direct financial returns for the government rather than simply providing subsidies without equity participation.\nThe Intel equity stake represents a strategic move to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry amid ongoing tensions with China, building on the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act framework while adding an ownership component that could provide ongoing influence over critical technology infrastructure[1][3]. This approach seeks to ensure sustained American leadership in crucial semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\nGovernment equity participation has historical precedents of success, particularly the 2008-2009 auto industry bailouts that saved approximately 1.9 million jobs at General Motors, Chrysler, and their suppliers, demonstrating that temporary government ownership can preserve critical industrial capacity during challenging periods. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Great Depression similarly took preferred shares in banks, helping stabilize the financial system while maintaining private operations.\nThe revenue-sharing model with companies like Nvidia and AMD, where the government takes a 15% cut of China sales in exchange for export licenses, provides a mechanism to monetize strategic trade decisions while maintaining national security controls[2][4]. This approach allows companies to access restricted markets while generating government revenue that could fund broader technological competitiveness initiatives."

      "text": "Congress OKs bill to aid computer chip firms, counter China\nCongress OKs bill to aid computer chip firms, counter China\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a $280 billion package to boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research in a bid to create more high-tech jobs in the United States and help it better compete with international rivals, namely China.\nThe House approved the bill by a solid margin of 243-187, sending the measure to President Joe Biden to be signed into law and providing the White House with a major domestic policy victory. Twenty-four Republicans voted for the legislation.\n\u201cToday, the House passed a bill that will make cars cheaper, appliances cheaper, and computers cheaper,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt will lower the costs of every day goods. And it will create high-paying manufacturing jobs across the country and strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future at the same time.\u201d\nAs the vote was taking place, Biden was discussing the economy with CEOs at the White House. During the event, he was handed a note informing him it was clear the bill would pass \u2014 a development that produced a round of applause before the tally was final.\nRepublicans argued the government should not spend billions to subsidize the semiconductor industry and GOP leadership in the House recommended a vote against the bill, telling members the plan would provide enormous subsidies and tax credits \u201cto a specific industry that does not need additional government handouts.\u201d\nRep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., said the way to help the industry would be through tax cuts and easing federal regulations, \u201cnot by picking winners and losers\u201d with subsidies \u2014 an approach that Rep. Joseph Morelle, D-N.Y., said was too narrow.\n\u201cThis affects every industry in the United States,\u201d Morelle said. \u201cTake, for example, General Motors announcing they have 95,000 automobiles awaiting chips. So, you want to increase the supply of goods to people and help bring down inflation? This is about increasing the supply of goods all over the United States in every single industry.\u201d\nSome Republicans viewed passing the legislation as important for national security. Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was critical to protect semiconductor capacity in the U.S. and that the country was too reliant on Taiwan for the most advanced chips. That could prove to be a major vulnerability should China try to take over the self-governing island that Beijing views as a breakaway province\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a unique insight in this. I get the classified briefing. Not all these members do,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThis is vitally important for our national security.\u201d\nThe bill provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry as well as a 25% tax credit for those companies that invest in chip plants in the U.S. It calls for increased spending on various research programs that would total about $200 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe CBO also projected that the bill would increase deficits by about $79 billion over the coming decade.\nA late development in the Senate \u2014 progress announced by Wednesday night by Democrats on a $739 billion health and climate change package \u2014 threatened to make it harder for supporters to get the semiconductor bill over the finish line, based on concerns about government spending that GOP lawmakers said would fuel inflation.\nRep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the turn of events.\nDespite bipartisan support for the research initiatives, \u201cregrettably, and it\u2019s more regrettably than you can possibly imagine, I will not be casting my vote for the CHIPS and Science Act today,\u201d Lucas said.\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, likened the bill\u2019s spending to \u201ccorporate welfare to be handed out to whoever President Biden wants.\u201d\nLeading into the vote, it was unclear whether any House Democrats would join with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in voting against the bill; in the end, none did.\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo talked to several of the most progressive members of the Democratic caucus in a meeting before the vote, emphasizing that the proposal was a critical part of the president\u2019s agenda and that Democrats needed to step up for him at this important moment.\nSome Republicans criticized the bill as not tough enough on China, and GOP leaders emphasized that point in recommending a \u201cno\u201d vote. Their guidance acknowledged the threat China poses to supply chains in the U.S., but said the package \u201cwill not effectively address that important challenge.\u201d\nBut, as McCaul pointed out, China opposed the measure and worked against it. The bill includes a provision that prohibits any semiconductor company receiving financial help through the bill from supporting the manufacture of advanced chips in China.\nZhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, commenting before the House vote, said the U.S. \u201cshould not put in place obstacles for normal science, technology and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\u201d and \u201cstill less should it take away or undermine China\u2019s legitimate rights to development.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing and AP writer Zeke Miller contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump announced that the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in Intel by converting $11.1\u202fbillion of CHIPS Act funds into 433.3\u202fmillion non\u2011voting shares, giving the government a paper gain of about $1.9\u202fbillion. The move, made while Intel is cutting 20,000 jobs and struggling under CEO Lip\u2011Bu Tan, has drawn criticism for blurring public\u2011private lines and potentially giving the administration leverage over a major tech company. Trump\u2019s action follows a broader push to keep chip manufacturing in the U.S., including a 15% revenue\u2011sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD for sales to China, and contrasts with past government bailouts such as the 2009 GM rescue. The deal has sparked debate over the appropriateness of government equity holdings in private firms and the risks of political influence on corporate strategy.",
