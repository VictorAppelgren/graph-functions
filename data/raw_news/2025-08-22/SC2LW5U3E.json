  "description": "The best way to buy Google's former flagships from the likes of Vodafone and Optus",
  "content": "New Pixels were announced at the recent Made by Google even, including the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel Pro Fold for which preorder deals for these new models are now available. While we have more detailed thoughts on the Google Pixel 9 vs the Google Pixel 10, the older model still offers a top-tier mobile experience that makes it worth buying, especially since it should be considerably cheaper once the 10 series is released on August 28.\n\nWhile the Google Pixel 9a offers a more premium design and better cameras, the entire Pixel 9 series remains one of the best Android phones on the market. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts a better display, dedicated telephoto lens and faster charging compared to the regular Pixel 9. It is essentially the same device as the Pixel 9 Pro XL but with a 6.3-inch display instead of the 6.8-inch screen.\n\nWith the new range coming soon, you can expect some serious Pixel 9 deals from retailers like Amazon and The Good Guys, and prices on plans are also likely to drop. Despite that, the Pixel 9 series remains one of the better value flagship handsets available \u2013 and these are the best plans you can get.\n\nStill want to know what other carriers are offering? Here's a quick look at what you'll pay each month for the 128GB Google Pixel 9 and Google Pixel 9 Pro over a 24-month contract.\n\nWeighing up whether it might be better to just pay more upfront to own your device outright? You can find the best current prices in the widget below.\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 range represented one of the biggest upgrades we've seen from Google. Not only have all devices received a major design refresh and new chipset, but it added two new models to its lineup.\n\nThe Pixel 9 introduced the Pro XL and Pro Fold models, which replaced the Pixel 8 Pro as the most premium device in the range. The Fold, as you'd imagine, boasts a foldable design, whereas the XL is a more like-for-like replacement of the Pixel 8 Pro with a larger display versus the standard model. The latest Pixel 9 Pro sports essentially the same form factor as the standard Pixel 9 with all the features exclusive to the Pro line.\n\nAlongside the new Tensor G4 chipset, the Pixel 9 Pro models have an upgraded 16GB of RAM, a new 42MP front camera, and improved video features (super zoom and 8K). These improvements are available in both the 6.8-inch Pro XL and 6.3-inch Pro models so can you choose between a decently-sized phone and something a little more pocket-friendly.\n\nThe standard Google Pixel 9 comes in at 6.3 inches and includes the new Tensor G4 chipset, a new 48MP ultra-wide lens, and an upgraded display that's 35% brighter. It also features an improved battery that's bigger and supports faster charging. Overall, it's quite a significant upgrade - enough for the standard model to stand on its own as a serious flagship contender.\n\nAll Google Pixel 9 devices include a lengthy seven years of guaranteed updates as well as a focus on AI integration via Google's new Gemini assistant. Gemini can help you do everything from daily planning to translation with a new Pixel 9-exclusive feature called 'Pixel Screenshots' being a particular highlight.",

      "text": "Made by Google showcase recap \u2013 meet the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and more\nGoogle revealed a big refresh of some of its key Pixel products in a star-studded showcase\nAugust 20th's Made by Google showcase was an unexpectedly star-studded affair with TV's Jimmy Fallon hosting the event... with all the oddities that entailed.\nAlongside taking a few cheeky swings at Apple, Google revealed a host of refreshed Pixel products, which we had time to take for an initial spin: check out our hands-on Google Pixel 10 review, hands-on Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL review, hands-on Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold review, hands-on Google Pixel Watch 4 review\u2026 and finally, our ears-and-hands-on Google Pixel Buds 2a review.\nThere's more to chew over here so for a blow-by-blow recap of the showcase, along with the key information you need to know, read on.\nWhat you need to know from the Made by Google showcase\n- 13 things we saw at the wild Google Pixel 10 launch \u2013 including the best Pixel phones yet\n- Not a drill \u2013 Google finally brings MagSafe-style accessories to Android with Pixelsnap\n- The Google Pixel Watch 4 is here \u2013 these are the 4 new features I'm most excited about\n- Google Pixel 10 lineup \u2013 5 key upgrades including Pixelsnap, Tensor G5, and Camera Coach\n- Google Pixel Buds 2a are official, bringing noise cancellation and Gemini AI to your ears for a low price \u2013 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 get some great free upgrades too\n- Jimmy Fallon hosted the Made By Google event live, along with a host of famous guests\n- Hands on: Google Pixel 10 review\n- Hands on: Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold review\n- Hands on: Google Pixel Watch 4 review\n- Hate your smartphone photos? Google\u2019s Pixel 10 could have your back \u2013 here\u2019s how\n- Google Pixel 10 preorders are live \u2013 I've found all the best deals, including free phones and huge trade-in discounts\n- Check out our TechRadar TikTok for videos from Made by Google\nAnd that's a wrap\nWith the music video premiere, that's a wrap on Made by Google 2025. There's a lot to unpack here, and we'll be doing just that both remotely and with our colleagues on the ground at the event in Brooklyn.\nFor now, though, here are some quick links to our early hands-on with the latest and greatest from Pixel:\n- Hands on: The Pixel 10 may look the same as before, but what's inside will change Android forever\n- Hands on: Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn\u2019t a reinvention, but two major upgrades make it a foldable worth considering\n- The Google Pixel Watch 4 might look similar to its predecessor, but the changes under the hood could make a big difference\nRick and Jimmy are back\nWe're nearing the end of Made by Google with Jimmy Fallon and Rick Osterloh now on stage. It's definitely wrap-up time, but the pair is announcing that Stephen Curry is now the performance advisor for Google. Rolling now is a quick video of Curry's 'interview' for the job at Google.\nThen we had a special, live guest, Nick Jonas, to roll the music video the band shot on the Pixel 10 Pro.\nMoving onto the Pixel Watch 4\nIf you've been wondering when Google was going to move onto the Pixel Watch 4, the time is now. Cody Rigsby, a Peloton instructor, is on stage now talking about the 'Morning Brief' feature and the 'readiness score' element that the Pixel Watch will deliver.\nThis feature was available on the Pixel Watch 3, and it remains a highlight of the experience on the fourth-generation as well. Within the Fitbit app, new content from Peloton instructors \u2013 including Cody Rigsby \u2013 is arriving this Fall (think September or October).\nI had the opportunity to spend some time with the new Pixel Watch 4, and beyond its health features, there are two other major upgrades. It features a new, physically curved, domed display that expands the actual screen area. Additionally, thanks to a redesign of the build, the battery and screen are now user-replaceable. That's a huge step, and you can see my early hands-on with the Pixel Watch 4 here.\nPixel 10 can translate your voice in real time on calls\nOne of the neatest exclusive features of Pixel is Live Translate on calls. With this, it can automatically translate your voice to a specific language, and it sounds pretty darn close to the original speaker, including inflections.\nI saw a demo of this with Lance Ulanoff, TechRadar's Editor-at-Large, with his voice being translated to Spanish, and on stage at Made By Google, Jimmy Fallon demoed this live as well.\nIt's certainly impressive, and I think this will be a big hit among users, which might inspire other companies, such as Apple or Google, to work on this tech as well.\nWhile the Jonas Brothers aren't live at the event \u2013 at least as of yet \u2013 the three brothers did shoot a music video in New York City on a Google Pixel 10 Pro for a new track, and we're getting a highlight reel of this process right now.\nTo test the Pixel's camera, there are scenes during the day and at night in lower-lighting conditions.\nNow, Photographer Andre D Wagner is walking through some photos he captured using the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Many of these were taken in Washington Square Park in New York City.\nOf course, there was also a comparison with the iPhone 16 Pro, specifically, low-light performance.\nAlex Cooper just gave us a live demo of Camera Coach with Jimmy Fallon as the subject. This is a new built-in helper that can guide you through taking a shot. It'll recommend the right mode, different angles, and even if you need to adjust the lighting.\nNow, Jimmy Fallon is promising some live demos and is being joined by a few 'Googlers'! We're starting off with a demo of Magic Cue, which can intelligently surface information.\nSo in this example, if you get a text asking when you arrive in the Bay Area, it can surface your flight info and your calendar. This is pretty neat to see in action and really highlights how Google's AI chops are embedded directly into the phone and integrated throughout.\nJimmy Fallon is pretty darn excited about PixelSnap, but he also has some concerns about saying the \"A word\" ... Apple. We tested it, and Google even confirmed moments ago, but PixelSnap does work with Apple MagSafe Accessories.\nWe're now getting a closer look at the features of the Pixel 10 lineup, specifically on the Pixel 10 Pro and its ProRes Zoom functionality. The demo here is zooming in on a car from a very far-away capture point. We're keen to put this to the test, but it's impressive, utilizing an LLM on the device to aid in upscaling and creation.\nThroughout all of this, Google is also throwing plenty of shade at Apple and its products, most notably the iPhone.\nAdrienne Lofton, VP of Consumer Marketing at Google, is now on stage with Jimmy Fallon in front of a table filled with the entire new Pixel family of devices. Eye spy the Pixel 10 in the Indigio shade \u2013 which is a nod to the first ever Pixel \u2013 as well as the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, and even the Pixel Watch 4.\nOne thing to note \u2013 while the conversation with Jimmy and Rick is live, these demos appear to be pre-recorded. It's likely easier than a live demo, especially when it features celebrities and famous athletes. Right now, we're getting a quick dive into Gemini Live, which is especially neat on the Pixel 10.\nTo help you make the most of Google's AI feature suite \u2013 Notebook LM, Gemini, and Veo included \u2013 those who purchase a Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, or 10 Pro Fold will get a year of Google AI Pro at no additional cost.\nRick also showed off a fun demo of Veo animating his family dog, which shared that it wants more treats. As someone with a Bernedoodle at home, I think my pup would agree.\nWe have our first mention of glasses with Gemini, which Google teased and announced several partners with at Google I/O 2025. That doesn't mean we'll see a pair of made-by-Google glasses today, as the conversation between Jimmy and Rick has shifted back to Gemini and Google's vision for it on its own devices.\nJimmy is also highlighting some consumers who own Pixel devices through posts on Reddit. It's a way to highlight some features, starting off with 'Circle to Search' \u2013 Jimmy says he's used it quite a bit.\nNow, after listing off a bunch of celebrities who are in attendance to help unpack the Google Pixel 10, Jimmy's welcomed Rick Osterloh, who leads devices at Google. It's now a sit-down interview format, with the two unpacking what's to come. Osterloh is dubbing this a 'game-changing launch event.\"\nMade by Google kicks off with Jimmy Fallon\nAnd Made by Google is kicking off with a teaser showing how far the Pixel lineup has come, starting with Pixel 1 all the way through \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Pixel 10. And now Google's giving us its trend on TikTok style of passing the phone, starting with Alex Cooper \u2013 of Call Her Daddy fame \u2013 with other celebrities, a fire-breathing dragon, an actual GOAT, and ending with Jimmy Fallon. These digital creations were made with Google's own Veo tech.\nMuch like a live show for a late-night show, Jimmy Fallon is taking the stage to applause. He dubbed this event a 'Taylor Swift album announcement for nerds' and that we're celebrating the tenth Google Pixel.\nWe're just about five minutes from the actual Made by Google event kicking off, and you can watch it live in the video block above and follow along with our live reporting below.\nAs far as what's going on at the venue, a person is hyping up the crowd and giving out swag to those lucky to be in attendance. We'll have to see if Lance and Phil walk away with some. But you can bet we'll be hearing more about the Pixel 10 family, the Pixel Watch 4, and the Pixel Buds 2a shortly ... likely from Jimmy Fallon.\nPixel 10 impressions \u2013 this year\u2019s biggest Pixel upgrade\nWe haven\u2019t spent long with the base Google Pixel 10, but we\u2019ve already seen enough to conclude that it\u2019s this year\u2019s most-improved Pixel phone. Thanks to a new 5x telephoto zoom lens, magnetic Pixelsnap charging and the same cool design we saw last year, it\u2019s now a true rival to the iPhone 16.\nThe standout feature is that 5x zoom camera, which puts it a cut above the iPhone 16 (which has no optical zoom) and Galaxy S25 (3x zoom), in terms of optical reach at least. If that lens combines well with the Pixel 10\u2019s new Tensor G5 chip and image processor, it should take Google\u2019s base model to new photographic heights.\nWe\u2019ll need to spend more time with the AI features (the likes of Camera Coach and Magic Cue weren\u2019t available on our early devices), and the Tensor G5 likely won\u2019t set the benchmark tests ablaze. But as an overall package, the Pixel 10 is a very promising phone indeed.\nRead more: Hands-on Google Pixel 10 review\nNow, we'll take a quick break from our early thoughts on the rest of the lineup \u2013 Pixel 10, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a \u2013 to give you a glimpse at what the event space looks like.\nTechRadar's Lance Ulanoff and Philip Berne are on the ground in Brooklyn, encountering some good-looking food \u2013 a staple for tech events \u2013 and a big screen with some seats.\nOur early Pixel 10 Pro thoughts \u2013 the best Pixels yet?\nLast year, we crowned the Pixel 9 Pro as our 2024 Phone of the Year \u2013 and as our hands-on Pixel 10 Pro review concludes, it could be an equally strong successor.\nOur US Mobiles Editor Philip Berne has spent a few hours with both the 10 Pro and Pro XL and says \u201cthey look like the best Pixel phones yet\u201d. He was particularly impressed by the arrival of Pixelsnap (Google\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s MagSafe), but also the promising camera improvements \u2013 most notably, a new 5x telephoto lens and the prospect of 100x Pro Res zoom.\nWe\u2019ll need to spend a little more time living with the new AI features like Magic Cue. But even if the Pixel 10 Pro is more a refinement than a big leap, it\u2019s still shaping up to be a very compelling flagship phone.\nRead more: Hands-on Google Pixel 10 Pro review\nGoogle's just made its next-gen devices official\nWell, we still have about an hour to go until the official Made by Google event kicks off, but Google's just made its next-generation devices official. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a all just entered the room.\nAnd TechRadar's Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has his early impressions of Google's latest foldable for your reading pleasure here, or in the video below. One of the significant changes with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that it ushers in some mighty durability chops and keeps a working design from the 9 Pro Fold.\nThere is a lot more to unpack, including the Tensor G5 chip, which also powers the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL, new on-device AI features, and upgrades to the Camera courtesy of some software tricks.\nJust a bit over an hour until show time\nHello there, Jacob Krol, TechRadar's Managing Editor for News in the US, stepping in to continue our Made by Google 2025 live blog festivities. While we're still waiting for the official stream to kick off on Google's YouTube channel, we have about an hour and ten minutes to go until the event kicks off.\nWe'll have two of my colleagues \u2013 Lance Ulanoff and Philip Berne \u2013 on the ground at the event in Brooklyn, NY, and it's looking to be a star-studded event. Stick with us!\nAs an aside, don't expect to hear anything about Google Nest today or Home updates, as there's been no hint from Google or outside of it that there'll be any new feature drops or updated for its home-centric tech.\nOver to our Senior Editor of AI, Graham Barlow, with what he'd like to see from Google on the AI side today:\n\"As a regular Gemini user I\u2019m looking for some improvements to my favorite parts of Gemini which make use of any hardware improvements that the new Pixel 10 phones may have. Simply put, the faster and more powerful the phone, the more you can do with AI. Improved speed and smoothness in AI generated responses would be top of my list.\"\nNot seeing much on the last-minute leaks front, so I suspect things could be quiet until the main show.\nAs Phil notes, a focus on AI is what all the Pixel phones are about, and I'm hoping we'll see Google go hard on AI today.\nAfter Apple fumbled the ball a bit with Apple Intelligence, and Samsung hasn't made Galaxy AI as neatly integrated into its phones experience as I'd like, I think Google has a clear opportunity to really set the standard here.\nBack to the Pixel 10, and we've already seen early benchmarks of the phones, but as Senior Editor Philip Berne points out, they don't really matter.\n\"Pixel phones can do everything Google says they can do, unlike some faster phone makers. I\u2019m still waiting for the promised AI features from Apple and Samsung, but I don\u2019t remember Google overpromising Gemini\u2019s ability to make career decisions for me (Siri) or turn out the lights when it detects I\u2019m asleep (Bixby),\" Berne said, pontificating on the benchmarks.\nI should say I always rather liked the older Pixel phone design. I liked the simple, utilitarian look of them. But I do think the design language introduced with the Pixel 6 and then iterated on has been my favourite so far.\nI do miss the innovation that Google used to bring to the Pixel phones, such as the radar sensor found in the Google Pixel 4, and the squeezable sides of the Pixel 3 series.\nI also think the rear fingerprint scanner was also rather neat. But each to their own when it comes to smartphone preferences.\nSo the Pixel phones have evolved a lot since then, but I feel they always tried to put smart features front-and-center, which means their evolution into AI phones seemed logical.\nI also reckon Pixel phones have consistently delivered on impressive cameras, although Samsung and Apple have certainly caught up and often surpassed Google.\nEditor-at-Large, Lance Ulanoff, just pointed out a suite of things he recalls older Pixel phones sporting.\nHe detailed the rear fingerprint reader, how the Google Assistant was front and center to the Pixel experience, how good the cameras were, and how some people shrugged at the design.\nNow over to my Phones Editor Axel Metz, who I've tapped up for what he's looking forward to from Google today:\n\"It feels wrong to say that an accessory announcement is my most anticipated reveal at today's Made by Google showcase, but the Pixel 10 series potentially getting its own MagSafe-style technology is a bigger deal than it sounds. We love Google phones for their clean software, but true Qi2 charging support would give Pixels rare hardware edge over Android competitors.\"\nSo you might ask, what Pixel device am I most looking forwards to?\nEven if you didn't I'm still going to ponder that question. I tend to like the Pixel Pro phones, with the Pixel 9 Pro offering a neat blend of specs and AI smart all in a decently compact package. So the Pixel 10 Pro is sure to appeal to me.\nBut I'm also curious to see what Google does with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which will be the search giant's third stab at a foldable phone. I hope AI is employed to make that extra screen space a lot more usable and helps make the folding phone a productivity powerhouse.\nHowever, the Pixel Buds 2a could bring with them a price hike: where the Pixel Buds A came in at \u20ac99, the Buds 2a will supposedly be \u20ac149. That's a hefty price increase and if it's reflected in other markets would mean $149 / \u00a3149 / AU$195.\nOn the Pixel Buds 2a side, the rumors so far point towards an evolved design, more power, new features like head tracking, and better sound isolation.\nIn terms of hardware upgrades, they could offer the biggest leaps out of all the products Google is set to reveal today.\nI expect boosts in the sensor and performance capabilities on the Pixel Watch 4 could make it a lot more appealing than its rumored design might tip.\nThe same can be said for the Google Pixel Watch 4 which looks a lot like its predecessors.\nNot a bad thing in my opinion as I've always like the design of Google's smartwatch, But I do hope its got snappier performance and a host of AI features to make it feel like an 'AI smartwatch'.\nOne rumor did hint at the standard Google Pixel 10 going for a triple rear-camera system, adding a telephoto snapper into the mix. I've already written how I'd be a fan of that and how it could tackle the looming phone threat of the iPhone 17.\nBut I'm not really all that convince Google will do that, especially given the price leaks, which would suggest Google will still keep the telephoto camera for the Pro Pixels.\nDon't expect major hardware changes\nAs I've mentioned before, a lot of the rumors and claimed leaks so far have all pointed at the Pixel 10 lineup being a minor evolution on its predecessors, rather than bringing in any dramatic upgrades.\nFor me, that's kinda fine, as the Pixel 9 phones are so good, I don't think I'd appreciate Google messing with a winning formula quite yet.\nIn fact, I've already touted how I think the Pixel 10 needs to bring more AI stuff to the table to keep at the top of the AI phones pile.\nTo quote myself: \"with the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 landing with improved AI features, and Apple Intelligence starting to get up to speed and offer a solid suite of features on compatible iPhones, as well as some synchronicity with Macs, Google\u2019s AI phone crown could be up for grabs.\n\"So I feel that for Google to keep ahead and continue to blaze a trail for practical, and hopefully safe, consumer use, it'll need to bring more to the table with the Pixel 10.\"\nSome people might baulk at the idea of paying iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S25 Plus prices for phones with Tensor chips in them. But I feel AI performance, rather than raw silicon horsepower, will be the key to these Pixel phones.\nThe standard Pixel 10 seems to be missing from that price leak, but we expect it to come in around the same price as the Google Pixel 9.\nAnd overall, those prices look reasonable for a flagship range of phones.\nBut there's more too, with serial tipster Evan Blass seemingly leaking the pricing for all the Pixel devices we expect to see.\nPricing. The Buds 2a slot in at $129. Enjoy the launch tomorrow, especially those planning to buy. pic.twitter.com/ZSKwq52LDMAugust 20, 2025\nA big last-minute leak!\nWe've just got another last-minute Pixel 10 leak, with it pointing towards an eSIM only approach by Google for its new phones, and new AI features tipped.\nAnd a promo clip has been shared too.\nBonjour, Pixel 10 pic.twitter.com/KYvJPYpbN8August 19, 2025\nI'm not sure what secret Jimmy could be referring to... maybe it'll be some new AI tool or assistant, or maybe something to do with mixed reality. So far there have been scant rumors on any big surprises from the Google event.\nOne thing that's will be new, is the Made by Google event will be hosted by TV's Jimmy Fallon, which is unusual for Google as it tends to use its own executives and marketing folks to spearhead the showcases.\nCheck out the teaser video below...\nGoing by a rather last-minute rumor, it looks like magnetic accessories will be a big part of the Pixel 10 lineup, with an Apple MagSafe-style system facilitating a magnetic charging stand for the phones.\nI currently use a Pixel Stand from 2021 to charge my phones that support wireless charging, so an upgrade here would be much appreciated, especially if it enables a wider range of accessories ot be used with the new Pixel phones.\nExpect to see four new Pixel phones today: the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This will be a refresh of the whole main Google Pixel phone lineup.\nDon't expect any drastic design changes, at least going by the rumors, but I do expect to see new Tensor chips, perhaps some improvements on the camera side such as new sensors, and a big injection of AI software upgrades.\nIf all the rumors I've seen so far prove to be true, then we could be looking at a big showcase for Google later on today, with new phones, a new Pixel Watch and new earbuds.\nAnd I'll buy a hat and eat it if Google doesn't spend a good amount of time discussing what it's been doing on the AI side for its Pixel devices.\nGood morning. Managing Editor of Mobile Computing Roland Moore-Colyer here to take you through the run up to the Made by Google event."

Beaucoup de possibilit\u00e9s pour retoucher les photos. Les vid\u00e9os sont de tr\u00e8s bonne facture \u00e9galement. La taille du capteur est plus importante que sur la plupart des autres t\u00e9l\u00e9phones mobiles. On ne peut, en effet, esp\u00e9rer faire de bonnes photos et vid\u00e9os avec un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone poss\u00e9dant un capteur riquiqui. Celui du Pixel 9 pro est d'une taille respectable, pour un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Donc, si vous cherchez un smartphone qui fait son job de smartphone correctement, et qui plus est, cr\u00e9e de splendides photos et vid\u00e9os, vous pouvez orienter votre choix vers le Pixel 9 pro. Vous ne serez pas d\u00e9\u00e7us.\nPrenez juste le temps d'explorer tranquillement tout ce qu'il a \u00e0 offrir, et ensuite, vous pourrez en profiter pleinement.\nJe me suis abonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Lightroom, 5.49\u20ac/mois. Comme j'aime sortir les photos dans deux formats (jpeg et raw), Lightroom est parfait pour retoucher le format raw.\nJ'utilise \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ce Google Pixel 9 pro depuis le 2 ao\u00fbt 2025. C'est un excellent smartphone. Son design me fait un peu penser \u00e0 celui d'un iPhone. Mais c'est personnel !\nN\u00e9anmoins, petit point un peu moins rose : la batterie.\nM\u00eame en activant le mode \u00e9conomie d'\u00e9nergie, la batterie se vide assez vite. Enfin, c'est mon avis !\nPremi\u00e8rement, je limite la charge \u00e0 80% dans le but de pr\u00e9server la batterie au niveau de sa long\u00e9vit\u00e9. Donc, je perds d\u00e9j\u00e0 20% de temps d'utilisation d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, apr\u00e8s 80% de charge, il perd assez vite des pourcentages au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l'\u00e9cran reste allum\u00e9. M\u00eame si le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est compl\u00e8tement \u00e9teint, la batterie peut se retrouver \u00e0 79% \u00e0 l'allumage.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je suis convaincu de ne pas pouvoir tenir une journ\u00e9e avec la batterie.\nJe conseille donc l'ajout d'une batterie externe, histoire de ne pas tomber \u00e0 court au moment le moins ad\u00e9quat.\nCe manque de tenue de la batterie pour un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone tel que le Pixel 9 pro est cependant compr\u00e9hensible et explicable par le fait qu'il ait \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'exigences en raison de sa facult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser beaucoup de t\u00e2ches \u00e0 la fois, ainsi que de sa puissance lui permettant d'y parvenir.

Ya veremos despu\u00e9s.\nC\u00c1MARA:\nLa c\u00e1mara principal es excelente. MUY n\u00edtida y que permite hacer cosas bastante buenas con ella y da un sorprendente desenfoque de verdad, sin meterse en modo retrato (que no uso, as\u00ed que no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo va). El angular (anda cerca de un equivalente a un 15mm) es bastante bueno. El tele es decente, no espectacular, pero s\u00ed decente.\nEl programa de c\u00e1mara de Google permite hacer fotos en \"50 megap\u00edxeles\". Hay que entrecomillarlo porque son 50 megap\u00edxeles en una matriz quad-Bayer, no es un sensor de c\u00e1mara digamos normal. Hay que verlo como un sensor de 12 con menos ruido que lo tendr\u00eda normalmente. El resto de programas no permiten hacer fotos en 50mpx, pero s\u00ed he probado un par de ellos y se puede hacer fotos en raw.\nEl raw del gcam tiende a sobreexponer y posteriza las altas luces. Se arregla subexponiendo un pel\u00edn (te deja hacerlo) y metiendo otro perfil en Lightroom que no sea el de Google. Los resultados son como de la noche al d\u00eda. eso s\u00ed: es un DNG de verdad, pero sigue poniendo demasiada reducci\u00f3n de ruido. Recomiendo instalar programas como el MotionCam (gratis, no el de pago) si se van a hacer fotos en raw.\nSi se es una personal \"normal\" y no un aficionado (o profesional) de la fotograf\u00eda, las fotos del m\u00f3vil suelen ser muy buenas: demasiado saturadas y con demasiado contraste, pero eso es lo que le gusta a la gente (a m\u00ed no mucho).\nRESTO DE COSAS\n- Mi caro pixel stand 2 no funciona sin quitarle la carcasa y es un ladrillo blanco que se va a ir a wallapop en breve. Con el reloj-cargador del Rastro que tengo encima de la mesa va bien.\n- El sensor de huella s\u00f3lo trae para meterle 4 dedos. Eso es un problema si te sueles llevar mal con estos chismes como yo. La soluci\u00f3n es meter varias veces el mismo dedo... pero entonces ya solo quedan 3.\n- La carga pod\u00eda ser m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida a estas alturas.\n- La bater\u00eda dura \"poco\". A m\u00ed me dura todo el d\u00eda m\u00e1s o menos y s\u00f3lo lo cargo hasta el 80%, pero por la noche ya est\u00e1 al 20 poco. Es normal para un tel\u00e9fono de este tama\u00f1o.\n-\nPatrickGranskad i Tyskland den 12 juni 2025\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor Das beste Smartphone das ich je hatte\nDas Pixel 9 Pro ist ein hervorragendes Smartphone, das mit seiner Kamera und der fl\u00fcssigen Performance punktet. Akku h\u00e4lt easy \u00fcber den Tag und es bietet eine sehr angenehme Nutzererfahrung. So gut wie alles kann man benutzerdefiniert einstellen. Kostenlose Zusatzoptionen sowie VPN oder Gemini pro+ 2tb Speicher f\u00fcr 1 Jahr runden dieses Gesamtpaket ab. F\u00fcr alle, die ein leistungsstarkes Smartphone suchen, ist das Pixel 9 Pro definitiv eine gute Empfehlung.\n-\nAntoGranskad i Italien den 18 mars 2025\n4,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor Google, \u00e8 la volta buona?\nIl mondo Pixel mi ha sempre affascinato. Venendo da quasi 7 (!) anni con il mio fidato OnePlus 6 era arrivato oramai tempo di cambiare dispositivo. Compito non facile, il mondo Android e degli smartphone in generale ora non \u00e8 lo stesso del 2018.\nAlla fine la mia scelta \u00e8 ricaduta su questo 9 Pro.\nCosa mi \u00e8 piaciuto:\nDesign, form factor, ergonomia; Il dispositivo si tiene benissimo in mano e non \u00e8 ostico da usare con una sola mano. I materiali sono piacevolissimi sia al tatto che alla vista. Nulla da invidiare rispetto ad altri top. Lo scalino della fotocamera non \u00e8 cos\u00ec grande di persona e non comporta fastidio di nessun tipo quando si poggia il dispositivo, tuttavia \u00e8 consigliabile prendere una cover disposta di un piccolo lasco perch\u00e9 a dire di molti la lente risulta facile da graffiare.\nIl sensore di impronte \u00e8 veloce e preciso in tutte le condizioni. Non mi manca affatto il sensore esterno del OnePlus. Non si pu\u00f2 dire lo stesso per il caro alert slider, ahim\u00e8, per i lettori che hanno OnePlus.\nParte multimediale eccellente; audio, vibrazione, haptics, e display sono semplicemente fantastici, l'audio forse pu\u00f2 risultare un filino metallico e freddo rispetto magari agli speaker iPhone, ma non manca assolutamente di qualit\u00e0 e definizione.\nDiffidate da chi non trova processore e prestazioni all'altezza, andranno benissimo per il 99% degli utenti. Tutto \u00e8 ottimizzato, fluido e reattivo. Cos\u00ec come la velocit\u00e0 delle memorie.\nComparto camere, quasi inutile a parlarne, si comportano benissimo in tutte le condizioni. C'\u00e8 molto postprocessing dietro le quinte ed \u00e8 evidente, ma le foto risultano sempre molto naturali, i video sono fluidissimi e stabili, forse i migliori nel mondo Android. Unica pecca sono forse la qualit\u00e0 dei dettagli; ovviamente per un uso social non fa differenza, ma mi aspettavo di meglio.\nNon parler\u00f2 delle feature AI, vi toglierei tutto il gusto di scoprirle da voi. Ce ne sono molte di utili e molte sinceramente abbastanza gimmicky.\nCosa non mi \u00e8 piaciuto:\nNon mi piace la disposizione dei tasti volume sullo stesso lato del tasto d'accensione. Sar\u00e0 una questione di abitudine ma capita spesso di premere involontariamente il tasto d'accensione quando si vuole invece alzare il volume.\nNiente doppio tocco per bloccare lo schermo, tocca usare il pulsante d'accensione. Semplicemente, perch\u00e9??\nTagli di memoria: ho optato per il 128 ma ho capito immediatamente perch\u00e9 la gente lo criticasse tanto. E io sfrutto la memoria abbastanza poco, praticamente solo foto e video. Tuttavia, la differenza di prezzo con il 256 \u00e8 INACCETTABILE e ingiustificata. Non avrei mai pagato in nessun caso questo dispositivo pi\u00f9 di 800 euro.\nLa confezione \u00e8 molto scarna. N\u00e9 blocco caricatore, n\u00e9 cover, neanche una plastica per proteggere il display, solo il cellulare e un cavo USB c - USB c. Male, male, tuttavia i tempi sono cambiati e molti (troppi) brand hanno optato per la via di Apple. Non farei tanto una critica a google per la mancanza del blocco se non fosse che comprato a parte sono 40 euro extra. Decisamente non ci siamo.\nGemini funziona bene ma non ha ancora tutte le funzioni di assistant quindi per assurdo le operazioni pi\u00f9 routinarie risultano pi\u00f9 ostiche. Ah, e ovviamente tutti i vostri dati sono usati per allenare l'AI di Google, che vi piaccia o no. Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio.\nNel complesso il dispositivo \u00e8 un bell'upgrade dal mio precedente smartphone, soprattutto sotto la parte multimediale. Se Google avesse pi\u00f9 considerazione dei suoi clienti Pixel darei tranquillamente 5 stelle.\nProduktsammanfattning presenterar viktig produktinformation\nKortkommando\nskift\n+\nalt\n+\nopt\n+\nD\nProduktsammanfattning: Google Pixel 9 Pro GEC77 Smartphone (6.3\", 16 GB RAM, 128 GB ROM), Obsidian\nFr\u00e5n Google\n4,4 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor, 184 betyg\nKundrecensionerOm den h\u00e4r artikeln\n- Nyaste Android\n- Avancerade AI funktioner\n- Snabb laddning\n- Skickar katastrofvarningar, till exempel n\u00e4r det \u00e4r en brand eller \u00f6versv\u00e4mning i n\u00e4rheten\nProduktbeskrivning\nViktig information\nheader_for_buffet\nRegulatorisk information\nFeedback\nTyckte du att den h\u00e4r produktsammanfattningen var anv\u00e4ndbar?"

Although the 9 doesn't have the telephoto capability of the 8 Pro, I've found the camera on the 9 to be excellent and I don't have any complaints. The only complaint I have with the 9 is that it sometimes glitches when you open the app drawer: pressing home doesn't do anything, so you need to press the back button to return to home, which is a bit unnatural. I'm hoping this is a software kink that gets ironed out.\nRob\nConfirmed purchase 14 July 2025\nPublished on 5 August 2025\nYes, I recommend this product.\nThis customer is a verified purchaser who may have received an incentive in return for providing an authentic review.\nVery happy with this phone, great value, battery is just OK but everything else is 5 stars.\nMacky\nConfirmed purchase 10 July 2025\nPublished on 5 August 2025\nYes, I recommend this product.\nThis customer is a verified purchaser who may have received an incentive in return for providing an authentic review.\nYou've viewed 4 of 4 reviews\nThe Good Guys product reviews are collected from verified purchasers who may have received an incentive in return for providing an authentic review."

      "text": "All the best Google Pixel 10 preorder deals \u2013 where to get free phones, gift cards and huge trade-in discounts\nAll the top offers from retailers, carriers and networks\nRetailers, carriers and networks have all gone live with their Pixel 10 preorder deals following the recent Made By Google 2025 event. Four new handsets are launching on August 28, so if you're interested in the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL or Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I've gathered up all of the best offers right here.\nAs I've come to expect from new phone launches, the best deals I've seen involve trading in your existing device to get a big discount. The amount you save varies depending on the device you hand over, but at some carriers and networks, it allows you to pick up a new Pixel 10 for free.\nLet's take T-Mobile in the US, for example, where you can get a trade-in rebate of up to $800, effectively dropping the price of the standard Pixel 10 to nothing when you also sign up for a new plan. Meanwhile, in the UK, the official Google Store is offering a bonus of \u00a3250 when you trade in a handset, meaning you can get up to \u00a3770 off the Pixel 10 Pro.\nFor more info on these brand new handsets before you lay down a preorder, be sure to have a read of our impressions of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, after our phone experts had some early hands-on time.\nI'll be keeping an eye on retailers, carriers and networks over the coming days for even more of the best Google Pixel 10 preorder deals, so stay tuned for updates.\nGoogle Pixel 10 preorders \u2013 editor's picks\n- Amazon: free gift card up to $300\n- Best Buy: save up to $760 with trade-in\n- T-Mobile: free Pixel 10 with a new line or any trade-in\n- AT&T: free Pixel Watch 3 with any Pixel 10 phone\n- Verizon: save up to $1,200\n- Google Store: up to \u00a3770 off the Pixel 10 Pro with a trade-in\n- Amazon: up to \u00a3250 off, plus a \u00a3100 voucher & free charger\n- EE: save up to \u00a3544, plus a further \u00a3384 with a trade-in\n- Vodafone: from \u00a327.54 per month\n- Three: save up to \u00a3950\n- Sky Mobile: claim an extra \u00a3250 off with a trade-in\n- Currys: up to \u00a3250 off with a trade-in, plus a \u00a3100 gift card\nGoogle Pixel 10 - US preorders\nGoogle Pixel 10: free Pixel 10 with a new line or any trade-in\nT-Mobile has some of the best Google Pixel 10 preorder deals I've seen. There are two options available. The first is a free Pixel 10 (or $800 off other handsets) when you open a new line on any plan. The second is a free Pixel 10 on any plan when you trade in any phone in any condition. That latter offer is particularly strong if you want to upgrade from an old device \u2013 just be sure to take into account the price of the plan, too.\nGoogle Pixel 10: save up to $760 with a trade-in, plus up to $350 in e-gift cards\nBest Buy is offering up to $760 off the Google Pixel 10 Series when you trade in a qualifying device. The retailer is also offering up to $350 in e-gift cards when you preorder Google's latest phone.\nGoogle Pixel 10: get a gift card up to $300\nAmazon is keeping things simple with its Google Pixel 10 preorder deals. Each handset comes with an Amazon gift card of either $100, $200 or $300 in value. The standard Pixel 10 gets the smaller freebie, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro 10 XL get the middle rebate, while the premium Pro 10 Fold gets the full $300 gift card.\nGoogle Pixel 10: trade in and get a free handset \u2013 save up to $1,200\nVerizon is offering big trade-in discounts of up to $1,200 on the Pixel 10 lineup, which means you can score a Pixel 10 Pro for free. The trade-in must be a Google, Apple, Motorola or Samsung phone, and you also need to purchase or upgrade to a smartphone line on the Unlimited Ultimate plan.\nGoogle Pixel 10: save up to $1,200 + free Pixel Watch\nSimilar to Verizon, you can get a discount of up to $1,200 on the Pixel 10 lineup at AT&T. You just need to trade in your existing Pixel handset from any year and in any condition to get the saving, and sign on to a unlimited voice and data plan. You can also add a Pixel Watch 3 to your basket, and you will get the wearable for free through bill credits.\nGoogle Pixel 10 - UK preorders\nGoogle Pixel 10: up to \u00a3770 off with a trade-in at the Google Store\nThe Google Pixel 10 has only just dropped, but if you have some of the latest tech to trade in, then you can save up to \u00a3770 at the official Google Store. That's a fantastic discount, especially if you want to upgrade to the Pixel 10 Pro from the Pixel 9 Pro or switch from the iPhone 16 Pro. Even if you own some old tech, it's still worth seeing how much money you can get off, as there's a flat \u00a3250 bonus applied to all trade-ins for a limited time. You might be surprised by the deal you can get for one of these flagship handsets.\nGoogle Pixel 10: save up to \u00a31,116 with a trade-in, contracts from \u00a327.54 per month\nVodafone's Pixel 10 preorder deals are headlined by the possibility of saving up to \u00a31,116 when you trade in an eligible phone. In terms of contracts, prices for unlimited data start at \u00a327.54 per month for the standard Pixel 10 with a \u00a330 upfront cost.\nGoogle Pixel 10: save up to \u00a3950 when trading in select Pixel handsets\nIf you currently have a Pixel phone and are looking to upgrade to a newer model, then Three will give you up to \u00a3950 for your existing handset when you buy a Pixel 10. Plus, if you pre-order, you get one year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium if you're a new subscriber\nWhat's new with the Google Pixel 10?\nFour new phones are part of the new lineup, including the standard Google Pixel 10, the larger Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and the premium foldable, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. But what are the new worthwhile features, and what are the key differences between all of these handsets? Here's a quick breakdown.\nLet's start with the Tensor G5 chipset that powers the entire range of new Pixel 10 phones. This is a direct upgrade to the previous G4 chip, boasting a 34% faster CPU and a 60% more powerful TPU. In basic terms, that means faster overall performance, a more efficient battery and speedier processing \u2013 especially when it comes to AI features.\nGoogle phones have always been good for photos, too, and that theme continues with the Pixel 10 range. There's a dedicated telephoto camera, which is best on the Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL with its 48MP telephoto sensor that offers up to 100x digital zoom.\nYou also get a Camera Coach feature, which uses AI to offer suggestions for shot composition and shooting modes to help you take better photos. For snaps you've already taken, there's the Edit with Ask Photos feature, which will suggest tweaks to the lightning, sharpness and more to refine your pics even further.\nOne of the most exciting features, though, is Pixelsnap: a built-in, magnetic Qi2 wireless charging technology for the entire Pixel 10 line. This is similar to Apple's MagSafe technology, which means you can snap wireless chargers, stands, grips, and other accessories to the phone and take advantage of 25W wireless charging. It's a convenient addition, so you no longer need magnetic rings or bulky magnetic cases.\nAltogether, there are some impressive upgrades across the new Pixel 10 lineup. Combined with one of these preorder deals, you could come away with an awesome new phone at a great price, too.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJames Pickard is a Deals Editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The best Android phones 2025: top picks for Samsung, Google, and more\nThe best Android phones are true companions for daily life, and offer plenty of variety both between models and in how each handset can be used.

We've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best Android phone\n1. OnePlus 13\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe OnePlus 13 is a phone that can do almost nothing wrong. It tops our charts in performance with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It's also the best phone for battery life, thanks to the gigantic 6,000 mAh battery inside. It helps that you can charge it faster than almost any other phone, even if you're charging wirelessly. It's simply an astonishing phone all around, and it's easily our favorite Android phone.\nIn my review, I noted that every complaint I've had about OnePlus has magically become one of the great strengths of the OnePlus 13. I used to complain that OnePlus phones weren't water resistant, and now the OnePlus 13 is IP69 rated. I watched OnePlus reps wash the phone in a dishwashing machine, including the heat cycle. It's a very durable phone.\nI complain about a lack of wireless charging, and now OnePlus offers 50W wireless AirVOOC charging. A OnePlus 13 can charge wirelessly faster than a wired iPhone. But that doesn't matter, because the battery can easily last for two days.\nI like everything about this phone. I even like the cases that OnePlus sells, because they have magnets that line up my OnePlus 13 perfectly with all my MagSafe accessories. If you're considering a switch from the iPhone, or have friends who might need a push, this is the phone to push them.\nRead our full OnePlus 13 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Don\u2019t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help. You just can\u2019t get one at the Verizon store (try Best Buy). | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A more professional look and an incredible feel with the new vegan microfiber. Every color is unique and outstanding, but the blue is the one to get, and definitely get a OnePlus case. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best display on any smartphone in terms of color, and it also looks great with the curving edges sloping down to the frame. It could be brighter, but it\u2019s a winner. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | The best Android interface software, but I wish there was more to take advantage of all that power. Eventually AI may come along, but for now OnePlus isn\u2019t pushing AI tools too hard. This phone is refreshing to use all around. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | The best cameras for action photos, even at night, and great pics all around. It does more with 3x zoom than some phones managed with 10x zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone, according to our benchmarks. In the real world, it was harder to find the fast lane, but the interface was incredibly snappy and responsive. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | The longest battery life, thanks to a larger battery and the efficient Snapdragon processor, though OnePlus has managed to fit more battery inside without making the phone thicker. Oh, and it charges stupidly fast. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best Android AI\n2. Google Pixel 9 Pro & Pixel 9 Pro XL\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Xl introduced a fresh design to the Pixel, with a sleek camera pill that replaces the bar. Despite this makeover, I still enjoyed using these phones with their signature Pixel strengths: innovative AI, impressive cameras, and a vibrant display that outshines the competition in brightness and color.\nGoogle continues its display reign with the Pixel 9 Pro's Super Actua screen, which I found to be exceptionally bright, and I appreciated the adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate. This display is truly great, even in bright sunlight, making it ideal for outdoor photography.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro delivers fantastic photos and AI-enhanced video with Video Boost, though I found the camera controls to be a bit fidgety. It produced some of the best photos among all of the best camera phones I've tested, and it's probably my second-favorite camera after the iPhone 16 Pro family. Google Photos AI editing beats the current state of iPhone Photos editing by a wide margin.\nIf you want the most advanced smartphone AI, you need to get the Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL, because Google keeps some of its best features exclusive to these phones. You can Circle to Search on any new Android, but if you want an AI to screen your spam calls, you need a Pixel.\nEven features that are on most Android phones, like the recording app that transcribes for you, worked much better on the Pixel 9 Pro in my tests than on competing phones. For everything AI now and into the future, the Pixel 9 Pro is my top choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro review and our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best Android camera\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nYou won't find a phone that does more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but where this phone really pulls away from the pack is in its camera capabilities. If it only had the big 200MP sensor and maybe a single zoom lens, that would be a great camera phone, but the Ultra does more. So. Much. More.\nIn addition to the big sensor, the S25 Ultra offers a 5X optical zoom, as well as a new and improved 50MP sensor for the ultra-wide camera, which should make for great detail on macro shots. Whether you're shooting for the moon or just taking shots of your kids on the field, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is up to the task.\nIn fact, it's up to every task, because it has such an extensive array of lenses. The 5X zoom uses a 50MP sensor, but there is also a 3X zoom lens that uses its own 10MP sensor. Then there's that 50MP sensor for ultra wide shots and super steady videos.\nSamsung isn't letting Google have all the fun with AI editing features, but Samsung also builds AI directly into the camera app. The camera will try to recognize the scene and optimize accordingly. It isn't just the moon that looks better, you'll notice that food shots, monuments, portraits, and tons of other scenes look great when you shoot them with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best premium Android\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus is the upstart middle child of the Galaxy S family. It's a big step up from the Galaxy S25 in all the right ways. Plus, it has all the top performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, without all the features you don't need. It's the top Samsung phone for battery life, and one of the longest-lasting phones I've every tested.\nDo you really need a pen with your phone? The Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly feature-packed, but most people don't need that much. The Ultra is a bigger, heavier, and more expensive phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, without much added benefit.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus has the same sharp display resolution as the S25 Ultra, and the screen is only a hair smaller. It has the same processor and RAM, and it starts with 256GB, twice the storage of the Galaxy S25.\nThe camera specs come close to matching the iPhone 16 Pro, but fall a bit short of the Ultra. That's fine, because it's Samsung's shooting modes and Galaxy AI software that make its camera great, not the specs. The Galaxy S25 Plus is a winner any way you look at it, and if you really need more, the Ultra is next on the list.\nLooking to save money on a Samsung product? Check out our Samsung coupon codes for the latest deals on top-rated tech and gadgets.\nValue | Worth the premium over the Galaxy S25, with a display and battery life that beat the more expensive Ultra. Still expensive, but worth the high price. | 4/5 |\nDesign | A solid, refined look that hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, and strongly resembles its biggest rival. I\u2019m ready for something new, but this design is a classic, with good color options this year. | 3/5 |\nDisplay | A fantastic display that\u2019s bright and colorful, making it easy to use in any situation, even taking photos in bright sunshine. I only wish the fingerprint scanner were more responsive, but it\u2019s still a great screen with minimal bezels. | 5/5 |\nSoftware | Samsung has improved One UI with a refreshed look and brighter colors. The bloatware problem is growing, though, and many of the Galaxy AI features mentioned at launch don\u2019t show up on the phone. | 3/5 |\nCameras | Takes good photos, but you can find much better cameras on competing phones, with bigger sensors and more pixels. It\u2019s time for an Ultra-fied camera upgrade for the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but what will you do with all that power? This Snapdragon wins benchmark tests, but in real-world performance it\u2019s less apparent. Still, it\u2019s the fastest phone around, even if you can\u2019t see it. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life, topping even the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the OnePlus 13 is far more impressive, with longer battery life and much faster charging. It\u2019s time for Samsung to catch up if it wants to remain at the top. | 4/5 |\nThe best Android for everybody\n5. Google Pixel 9\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 is a delightful phone and the easiest Android phone for me to recommend to everybody, especially folks who say 'I just want a phone that works.' The Pixel 9 arrives in Google's striking new Pixel look, with even better color options than the Pro model (hey, Peony!). It takes photos that could be mistaken for Pro, and it has the same Google Tensor G4 processor inside.\nThe biggest difference between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro isn't the zoom camera on the Pro. The Pixel 9 takes great photos that are even better for sharing, since the phone keeps things to a scant 12MP. Videos also look great. The color quality on the photos I took with the Pixel 9 was excellent, and nearly identical to my Pixel 9 Pro shots.\nThe big difference is the year of premium AI that you'll get with the Pixel 9 Pro. That originally meant no Gemini Live for the Pixel 9 (unless you pay up), but Google has made its conversational AI available on every Pixel 9 device for free, so that's not a problem any more.\nGoogle also updated this phone with Android 15, making it one of the first Android phones to get the new system, as it should be. This phone has seven years of updates ahead, presumably taking us to Android 21, so it could get even better with time.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Not a bad price considering all the Pixel 9 Pro features you get, but with its free year of advanced AI, maybe you should just get the Pro instead. Hopefully discounts will come soon. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | The biggest Pixel redesign in years gives us cool new colors, a sleek and modern camera bar, and the most durable Pixel yet. It\u2019s twice as durable as the Pixel 8, but still looks fancy. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | An excellent display is a standout feature on every Pixel, this one is super bright and colorful. The Pro is more versatile, but you can\u2019t tell \u2026 can you? | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | New AI features take some getting used to, and some need to prove their worth, like the fascinating Screenshots app. But if you want the most advanced AI, get a Pixel 9 Pro with its year of free Gemini Advanced and Gemini Live. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Great camera performance looks almost exactly like the Pixel 9 Pro, without the high-resolution files and stuffy Pro controls. You won\u2019t get telephoto zoom, but you will get some of the best pics any smartphone can take, plus the new AI Add Me feature. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The Tensor G4 chipset has fallen far behind rivals and performance is lagging. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019ll notice the drag if you try to run a lot of apps at once and then ask the AI a question. Or do anything with the AI. The AI is slow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Great battery life, especially on a smaller phone. I wish it charged faster (or as fast as Google made it seem), but the Pixel 9 battery beats the iPhone 15 by hours and had no trouble lasting all day in the real world. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best budget Android\n6. Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nThe Pixel 9a is the clear value leader among Android phones. It's an easy recommendation if you want a dependable, uncomplicated Android phone that handles the basics very well. If you need an affordable device that will last for years and, the Pixel 9a is a strong contender.\nI wasn't the biggest fan of the new Pixel 9a design, but there's no denying this is a new Pixel phone, through and through. Helpful features such as AI call screening and superior voice recording transcription proved extremely convenient during my in-depth review time with the Pixel 9a.\nGoogle commits to providing seven full years of significant Android OS and security updates. This offers exceptional software support and ensures longevity rarely seen at this price level. Apple and Samsung won't match that commitment with phones this cheap.\nThe Pixel 9a camera performs particularly well. Colors are accurate. Its most impressive aspect is the highly capable new macro photography feature. The resulting close-up detail truly rivals more expensive phone cameras, and maybe even DSLR cameras.\nUltimately, if you want excellent value, a great camera (with standout macro), useful AI, and lengthy software support, and you can accept owning what might be the least visually appealing Pixel design to date, the Pixel 9a stands out as the best budget choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9a review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates. The cameras are among the best in this price range, even if the look isn\u2019t so premium. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s durable, and the colors are real nice. Otherwise, it\u2019s ugly as sin. Seriously, Google had a winning A-series formula that it ruined when it created this phone. But the design doesn\u2019t get in the way, at least. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | Excellent display that's bright and colorful, better than most phones at this price. Some trouble with Adaptive mode was easily fixed. If only the phone\u2019s performance could keep up with the fast screen. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A polished version of Android that's easier to use, with plenty of features. Some useful AI tools, but also some AI imagery slop that resorts to bigotry and should be removed from this phone. | 2 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid cameras take photos that look like they could have come from the Pro model, if you don\u2019t look too close. Astonishing macro capabilities rival my DSLR camera and make this phone a winner. Too bad about the low resolution and lack of detail, and some zoom would have been nice. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance is adequate for Pixel fans, though it won\u2019t win any races. No problems with my favorite apps and games, but things slowed down when I engaged the AI as it sent requests to and from the cloud. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | A larger battery somehow doesn\u2019t equal more battery life, but the Pixel 9a still lasts a full day with no trouble, and has wireless charging, a rarity at this price. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best Android folding phone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best folding phones, which means it's also the best Android folding phone. In fact, every folding phone you can buy is also an Android phone, and all of them make use of Google's mobile operating system in unique ways. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 comes loaded with One UI 8, based on Android 16, which means its a great choice for those who want access to the latest and greatest software features.\nOf course, the headline feature isn't the operating system, it's that 8-inch folding display. Samsung has made the folding display on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 larger than ever, and with nearly as much screen real estate as an iPad mini there's plenty of room for browsing, productivity, gaming, and whatever else you need to get done. Samsung has jammed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 full of AI tools and software settings, making this a phone that can adapt to the way you do things.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 has the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and either 12GB and 16GB of RAM depending on configuration, giving the phone plenty of power. Our testing found the phone to be an adaptable daily companion with enough battery life to get through a full day's use, which with a battery capacity of just 4,400mAh is pretty impressive.\nAnd when it comes to camera quality, no other folding phone comes close. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 sports a 200MP main camera, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultra-wide. It's the best camera system on any folding phone, and in some situations can hold its own against the dedicated camera phones on this list.\nThe only real downside to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its price. At a starting price of $1,999 / \u00a31,899 / AU$2,899, it's the most expensive phone on the market, period. Whether it's worth such a high price is up to you.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens. The crease is almost gone, but so is support for an S Pen. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Better than the best Qualcomm chip on other Androids, and the performance knocked our socks off. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Android 16! One UI 8! So much AI. It may sound like a lot, but it's a winning combination. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCameras | The 200MP sensor is a major upgrade, and overall photography is excellent. We would have liked a 5x optical zoom. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Really good battery life | 4.5 / 5 |\nFAQs\nWhat is the best Android phone?\nOur pick for the best Android phone for most people is the Pixel 9, because it's an affordable way to get all of Google's best new AI features and Google's refined Pixel interface and software. However, this could soon change as the Pixel 10 is now available, and we're currently testing it for review.\nThe best premium Android phone is the OnePlus 13, because it offers the best battery life, the most refined interface, and the most durable design with IP69 certification.\nWhich Android phone is the best value for money?\nThe best Android phone for people on a budget is the Pixel 9a, which costs $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849. The Pixel A-series phones are a popular discount item when Amazon puts smartphones on sale, so keep an eye on TechRadar for the latest deals.\nIf you want to spend less than that, Samsung's Galaxy A devices are great value. They gives you a great display and Samsung's feature-packed Android software, plus fast networking and good performance for the price.\nIs Android or iOS better?\nAndroid and Apple's iOS each have their fans, and there is very little that iOS can do that Android cannot. There are many more options, features, and oddities available on Android devices than iOS has ever seen, so Android has a reputation for being more complicated and experimental, while also allowing for more customization and more powerful overall features.\nHow we test\nI've only included phones on this list that have been thoroughly tested in Future Labs and in the real world by our expert review editors. I test every feature on a phone, then we dive deeper to discover all of the hidden goodies.\nI test phones rigorously for battery life and charging times, processor speed and performance, and especially for camera and video recording capabilities. I make sure that phones deliver on the promises and claims they make. If Samsung says a phone charges in 30 minutes, I time it to make sure.\nI've seen every phone you can buy, so I know how each model stacks up against one another. I use both iPhone and Android phones all the time, so I know what I'm saying about the phones you buy, no matter what you pay. I make sure the phones deliver what I'd expect for the price.\nOnce I'm done, I never stop. I update our reviews as the phones are updated. Our reviews are always fresh, so check again before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest review on the best phones you'll find.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

La modalit\u00e0 Astro-photography \u00e8 sorprendente: stellate e paesaggi notturni vengono catturati con poca compressione e rumore minimo. Ottimo anche il grandangolo da 12 MP con correzione automatica della distorsione.\n\u2022 Batteria e ricarica:\nCon la batteria da 4.700 mAh arrivo tranquillamente a fine giornata con uso intenso (foto, social, streaming). La ricarica rapida da 30 W (via cavo) e la wireless charging Qi rendono il tutto comodo e veloce.\n\u2022 Software e aggiornamenti:\nAndroid \u201cpuro\u201d con patch di sicurezza mensili e tre major update garantiti fino al Pixel 12. Le feature AI integrate (trascrizione live, traduzione simultanea) sono utilissime e ben ottimizzate.\n\u2022 Design e ergonomia:\nCostruzione in Gorilla Glass Victus e alluminio satinato offrono una sensazione premium. Il sensore di impronte sotto al display \u00e8 rapido e preciso.\nIn sintesi, a 650 \u20ac con l\u2019offerta giusta non troverete di meglio: prestazioni top, fotocamere eccezionali e un software sempre aggiornato.

      "text": "Google Pixel 10 vs Google Pixel 9: all the biggest differences\nThe Google Pixel 10 has landed, but if you\u2019ve already got a Pixel 9, then you might be wondering whether it\u2019s worth upgrading to \u2013 or if you don\u2019t yet have either, you might be considering saving some money by buying the older phone instead.\nWhat you should do in these circumstances ultimately depends on what you value most in a smartphone, but to help you decide, we\u2019ve highlighted the biggest differences between the new Google Pixel 10 and the older Google Pixel 9.\nThese include the chipset, the camera, and other key features. But plenty is staying the same, too, and if you don\u2019t see something significant mentioned below, it has likely remained unchanged for the new model.\nA new chipset\nOne of the biggest \u2013 if perhaps least exciting \u2013 differences between these two phones is their chipsets, as while the Google Pixel 9 has last year\u2019s Tensor G4, the Google Pixel 10 has the brand-new Tensor G5.\nWe say this is a relatively unexciting update because it was an entirely expected upgrade, but it should still be beneficial. The new chipset should be delivering extra power to speed up AI tasks, improve gaming performance, and more.\nSo if you're looking for a phone that feels like a flagship fit for 2025, then the Pixel 10 might be a worthwhile upgrade.\nAn extra camera\nOne difference that we consider more interesting is the cameras, primarily because the Google Pixel 10 has an extra lens. A 10.8MP f/3.1 telephoto camera (offering 5x optical zoom) joins its 48MP f/1.7 wide camera, its 13MP f/2.2 ultra-wide, and its 10.5MP f/2.2 front-facing camera.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Google Pixel 9 doesn\u2019t have a telephoto camera, so the Pixel 10 is a better choice for zoom photography. That said, this isn\u2019t quite as much of a clear-cut upgrade as you might expect, because the Pixel 9 has a 50MP f/1.7 wide camera and a 48MP f/1.7 ultra-wide, along with the same selfie camera as the Pixel 10.\nInterestingly, the Google Pixel 9 actually offers more megapixels in two of its lenses compared to the Pixel 10. We\u2019ll let you know how much difference that makes once we\u2019ve put this new phone through a full review, but this might mean that the Pixel 9 is a better choice for photography if you don\u2019t often take telephoto shots.\nA brighter screen\nThe Google Pixel 9\u2019s display can already get reasonably bright, topping out at 2,700 nits, but the Pixel 10 has it beat, with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits.\nThat could help make the Google Pixel 10\u2019s screen easier to see in bright sunlight, but otherwise the two phones have largely identical displays \u2013 they\u2019re both 6.3-inch OLED screens with a 120Hz refresh rate, a resolution of 1080 x 2424, and a pixel density of 422 pixels per inch. They\u2019re also both protected with Gorilla Glass Victus 2.\nSo, unless you often find that your phone\u2019s screen isn\u2019t bright enough, you probably won\u2019t find the Pixel 9 overly lacking compared to the Pixel 10 on the display front.\nA bigger battery\nA phone is only useful while it has power, so a long-lasting battery is a desirable feature for most people, and on that front, the Google Pixel 10 should have an edge.\nThis phone has a 4,970mAh battery, which Google claims can last upwards of 30 hours between charges, or for up to 100 hours if you enable Extreme Battery Saver mode.\nThe Google Pixel 9, on the other hand, has a smaller 4,700mAh battery, which Google claims should last upwards of 24 hours on a single charge. So, you could be getting around six additional hours of battery life with the Pixel 10. That said, the Pixel 9 is said to offer a similar 100-hour life with Extreme Battery Saver mode turned on.\nDifferent colors\nYou\u2019ll also be able to choose from a different selection of colors depending on which of these phones you buy.\nThe Google Pixel 10 is sold in Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, and Obsidian shades, while the Google Pixel 9 comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, and Peony colors. So, Obsidian is available for both, but the other options differ.\nAside from the colors, though, these are quite similar-looking devices, with a similar weight and dimensions too \u2013 though the Pixel 9 is marginally lighter at 198g to the Pixel 10\u2019s 204g.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

The new models feature the Tensor G5 chipset, improved camera capabilities including a telephoto lens, and a brighter display. The Pixel 9 series remains a strong contender in the market, offering excellent value, especially as prices are expected to drop with the release of the new models. Retailers are providing significant trade-in discounts for the Pixel 10 lineup, making it an attractive option for consumers.",
