  "content": "Banking software provider nCino (NASDAQ:NCNO) will be announcing earnings results this Tuesday after market hours. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nnCino beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 2.7% last quarter, reporting revenues of $144.1 million, up 12.5% year on year. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 billings estimates.\n\nIs nCino a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting nCino\u2019s revenue to grow 8.2% year on year to $143.2 million, slowing from the 12.9% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.14 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. nCino has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at nCino\u2019s peers in the vertical software segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Q2 Holdings delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 12.9%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.8%, and Olo reported revenues up 21.6%, topping estimates by 4.2%. Q2 Holdings traded down 9.9% following the results while Olo\u2019s stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of Q2 Holdings\u2019s results here and Olo\u2019s results here.\n\nQuestions about potential tariffs and corporate tax changes have caused much volatility in 2025. While some of the vertical software stocks have shown solid performance in this choppy environment, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 4.3% on average over the last month. nCino is down 2.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $32 (compared to the current share price of $29.66).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

      "text": "Q2 Holdings (QTWO)\nWe\u2019re skeptical of Q2 Holdings. Its weak sales growth shows demand is soft and its low margins are a cause for concern.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Q2 Holdings Will Underperform\nWith a platform powering digital services for approximately 25 million account holders across America, Q2 Holdings (NYSE:QTWO) provides cloud-based digital solutions that help financial institutions, fintechs, and alternative finance companies deliver modern banking experiences to their customers.\n- Gross margin of 52.6% is way below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D\n- 11.7% annual revenue growth over the last three years was slower than its software peers\n- One positive is that its powerful free cash flow generation enables it to reinvest its profits or return capital to investors consistently\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Q2 Holdings\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Q2 Holdings\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s stock price of $79.50 implies a valuation ratio of 6.7x forward price-to-sales. Q2 Holdings\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among software peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Q2 Holdings (QTWO) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBanking software provider Q2 (NYSE:QTWO) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 12.9% year on year to $195.1 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $198 million at the midpoint, 1.6% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $0.18 per share was 77.5% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nQ2 Holdings (QTWO) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $195.1 million vs analyst estimates of $193.6 million (12.9% year-on-year growth, 0.8% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.18 vs analyst estimates of $0.10 (8c beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $37.76 million vs analyst estimates of $33.34 million (19.3% margin, 13.3% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $785.5 million at the midpoint from $779.5 million\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $179 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $173.5 million\n- Operating Margin: 5%, up from -7.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 21.4%, up from 19.9% in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $5.63 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2004 by Hank Seale, Q2 (NYSE:QTWO) offers software-as-a-service that enables small banks to provide online banking and consumer lending services to their clients.\nSmall, regional and community banks often lack the resources required to manage their own tech infrastructure, making it difficult for them to compete with polished offerings of large national banks. Q2\u2019s cloud-based platform provides them with mobile apps and websites that have the same functionalities big banks offer and allows them to put their own branding on it.\nQ2 then handles all the regulatory compliance and security and provides banks with data-based insights on their customers, allowing them to offer more personalized products and better customer service.\n4. Banking Software\nConsumers these days are accustomed to frictionless digital experiences from online shopping to ordering food or hailing a cab. Financial services firms are notoriously risk averse in adopting modern software, often lacking the resources or competency to develop the digital solutions in-house. That drives demand for software as a service platforms that allows banks and other finance institutions to offer the digital services without having to run or maintain them.\nQ2 and companies like nCino (NASDAQ:NCNO) or Alkami (NASDAQ:ALKT) are offering them a chance to keep up with the bigger players in the market.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last three years, Q2 Holdings grew its sales at a 11.7% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\nThis quarter, Q2 Holdings reported year-on-year revenue growth of 12.9%, and its $195.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 13.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. Still, this projection is above the sector average and indicates the market is forecasting some success for its newer products and services.\n6. Annual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s ARR punched in at $861 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth slightly outpaced the sector as it averaged 12% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth and shows the company is securing longer-term commitments. Its growth also contributes positively to Q2 Holdings\u2019s revenue predictability, a trait long-term investors typically prefer.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nQ2 Holdings is efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 36.3 months this quarter. The company\u2019s relatively fast recovery of its customer acquisition costs means it can attempt to spur growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Q2 Holdings, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s gross margin is substantially worse than most software businesses, signaling it has relatively high infrastructure costs compared to asset-lite businesses like ServiceNow. As you can see below, it averaged a 52.6% gross margin over the last year. That means Q2 Holdings paid its providers a lot of money ($47.38 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nQ2 Holdings produced a 53.6% gross profit margin in Q2, marking a 3.4 percentage point increase from 50.2% in the same quarter last year. Q2 Holdings\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 3.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest better unit economics due to more leverage from its growing sales on the fixed portion of its cost of goods sold (such as servers).\n9. Operating Margin\nWhile many software businesses point investors to their adjusted profits, which exclude stock-based compensation (SBC), we prefer GAAP operating margin because SBC is a legitimate expense used to attract and retain talent. This metric shows how much revenue remains after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to sales and R&D.\nQ2 Holdings was roughly breakeven when averaging the last year of quarterly operating profits, mediocre for a software business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nOn the plus side, Q2 Holdings\u2019s operating margin rose by 10.2 percentage points over the last year, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nThis quarter, Q2 Holdings generated an operating margin profit margin of 5%, up 13 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n10. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nQ2 Holdings has shown robust cash profitability, driven by its cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enables it to invest in new products and services rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 20.4% over the last year, quite impressive for a software business. The divergence from its underwhelming operating margin stems from the add-back of non-cash charges like depreciation and stock-based compensation. GAAP operating profit expenses these line items, but free cash flow does not.\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $41.7 million in Q2, equivalent to a 21.4% margin. This result was good as its margin was 4.7 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Q2 Holdings\u2019s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 20.4% for the last 12 months will decrease to 18.2%.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nQ2 Holdings reported $532.1 million of cash and $539.3 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $156.7 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Q2 Holdings\u2019s 0.0\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $2.75 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Q2 Holdings\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by Q2 Holdings\u2019s optimistic EBITDA guidance for next quarter, which blew past analysts\u2019 expectations. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock remained flat at $91 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Q2 Holdings?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:16 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on Q2 Holdings, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. For starters, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last three years, and analysts don\u2019t see anything changing over the next 12 months. And while its expanding operating margin shows it\u2019s becoming more efficient at building and selling its software, the downside is its gross margins show its business model is much less lucrative than other companies. On top of that, its forecasted free cash flow margin suggests the company will ramp up its investments next year.\nQ2 Holdings\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 6.7x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $104.07 on the company (compared to the current share price of $79.50).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "A Profitable Growth Stock Benefitting From The Rise of AI\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC) has long been one of the most exciting stocks on our watchlist because we think the company is benefitting from the rise of artificial intelligence.\nAs you can see from the chart below, the Lattice Semiconductor stock price dropped suddenly in October 2023. Just days later on 3 November 2023, we chose Lattice Semiconductor as the StockStory Edge stock of the month for November and emailed our detailed buy recommendation to members.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nWhat Does Lattice Semiconductor Do?\nLattice is a leading designer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).\nField Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are like a special kind of computer chip. You could think of them as like a LEGO set for building complex electronic systems. They are used for a variety of complex products like robots that work in distribution centers and cars with self-driving technology.\nNormally, computer chips are set to do one job and can't be changed. But FPGAs are different. After you buy them, you can change how they work to do different jobs. It's like having a LEGO set where you can first build a tiger, then take it apart and build a red panda, then take it apart and build a goldfish, all using the same pieces.\nFPGAs have emerged as a preferred solution for customers in rapidly evolving technological fields because their flexibility gives them significant cost and time advantages over legacy chips that can\u2019t be changed once manufactured. In AI research, for example, FPGAs\u2019 reprogrammable nature allows engineers to quickly change their algorithms without buying a new batch of chips that can cost millions of dollars.\nGiven its chips\u2019 customization abilities, Lattice collaborates intimately with customers to implement designs. The company achieves this through its team of field applications engineers and proprietary software solutions that allow for more user-friendly experiences. We like that it has a software solution because essential software can often earn very high profit margins.\nWe believe the demand for LSCC\u2019s FPGAs is durable. Its chips are critical components for dynamic, high-growth industries such as AI, industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving technology), and 5G wireless infrastructure. We see a bigger role for these technologies in the future, and that means more demand for Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s products.\nRisks\nThe first risk is a potential semiconductor downturn. The industry is cyclical due to the interplay of global economic growth, inventories, and technological obsolescence. We believe Lattice is partially insulated from obsolescence because of the re-programmability of FPGAs, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s tethered to the macro, which is sometimes good, sometimes bad, and sometimes somewhere in between. Investing over the long term by holding high-quality companies over three to five years, however, can meaningfully negate this roller coaster.\nLike many semiconductor companies, Lattice is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip designer, meaning it doesn\u2019t manufacture, assemble, or test its chips in-house. Instead, it outsources these functions to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) so that the company can focus on innovation. This means LSCC\u2019s supply chain could be disrupted if China blockaded Taiwan (or worse).\nFinally, there is competition. The company has a strong grip over the small-range FPGA market. The mid-range market is currently up for grabs, and we think Avant is a strong contender. On the other hand, AMD and Intel could also attack the mid-range market by providing customers with more tailored solutions. Thus far, the two giants have mostly set their sights on large-range FPGAs, which are mostly used for the highest-intensity applications.\nWhy We Like Lattice Semiconductors\nLattice is an exceptionally high-quality business and its best-in-class profit margins have always kept it near the top of our list. Semiconductors are cyclical businesses, so demand fluctuations are normal and temporary. We think Lattice can easily outlast any lulls in demand, thanks to strong free cash flow margins.\nOur view is that LSCC is the leader in a high-growth market, and its total addressable market is about to double.\n1. Lattice is benefitting from the rise of AI\nLattice is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI because its silicon is on almost every new AI server shipped globally today. That rate should increase as servers steadily consume more chips and the total number of servers grows with more businesses, organizations, and people using generative AI and large language models (like ChatGPT).\nAI will also bring an explosion in edge computing. Edge computing describes processing done on a server or device closer to the data source rather than in centralized data centers. Massive amounts of data must be analyzed at low latencies for AI to work at scale, and LSCC\u2019s FPGAs\u2013with their parallel processing capabilities that boost analytical speed and re-programmability that allows for easy adjustments to constantly changing AI algorithms\u2013are must-haves.\n2. Lattice has strong revenue and earnings per share growth\nLSCC is a 40-year-old company that has consistently done one thing well: designing FPGAs. Over the last five years, its revenue has grown from about $400 million to what will be $740+ million this year (13% annualized growth rate), and its EPS rose by almost 500% over the same period.\nAdditionally, Lattice\u2019s unique chips and intellectual property have enabled it to generate a robust 70% gross margin and 40% adjusted operating margin. This has led to heaps of free cash flow that the company has reinvested into product innovation. As of late, LSCC has even had excess cash to return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In 2022, it repurchased $110 million of stock, the highest annual total in its history.\n3. New Product Platform\nFor most of its history, LSCC has focused on the small-range, power-efficient FPGA market for applications requiring simple logic functions. The company\u2019s Nexus product line, released in late 2019, made Lattice the #1 player in the global FPGA market by volume. These chips were so popular because they featured the smallest chip sizes and lowest power consumption in the industry (75% less power consumption than comparable products from AMD and Intel).\nDespite its success, Lattice is not standing still. Less than a year ago, the company entered the mid-range FPGA market with its Avant product line. These chips are leveraged in more rigorous use cases requiring edge computing (the \u201cE\u201d in Avant-E, see below) such as industrial robotics, autonomous vehicle networking, and machine vision (using cameras and computers to inspect and measure).\nWe think Avant is a game-changing development because its FPGAs boast 2x the bandwidth capabilities, 2.5x better power efficiency, and are up to 6x smaller than competing products from AMD and Intel. They are simply superior products.\n4. Experienced Leadership\nLattice is led by CEO James Anderson, who joined the company in September 2018. Luckily for investors, his prior two roles were in key leadership positions at AMD and Intel. Anderson\u2019s hiring was part of the complete turnover of Lattice\u2019s old management team, and seven executives were recruited to join him.\nTwo individuals worth calling out are Stephen Douglass (Chief Technology Officer) and Mark Nelson (SVP of Sales). Douglass joined from Xilinx, which was the largest FPGA company before being acquired by AMD in 2022, while Nelson joined from Intel. We believe the management team\u2019s deep knowledge of the industry and its closest competitors gives it an advantage.\nSumming it all up, our research suggests that LSCC\u2019s $660 million of revenue in 2022 can nearly double to about $1.2 billion in five years, a 13% annualized growth rate. With higher margins from Avant sales, efficiency from selling to existing customers, and continued share buybacks, that revenue growth can translate into nearly 20% EPS growth per annum. We believe this kind of growth should see the stock will reach $90 by the end of 2026.\nWith a bit of luck\u2013and the optimism of a bull market\u2013shareholders may well see a higher price.\nIf you enjoyed this abridged version of our Stock of the Month for November 2023 you\u2019ll love the full version.

      "text": "nCino (NCNO)\nWe\u2019re skeptical of nCino. Its low gross margin indicates weak unit economics, partly explaining why it struggles to generate cash flow.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think nCino Will Underperform\nBorn from the internal technology needs of a community bank in 2011, nCino (NASDAQ:NCNO) provides cloud-based software that helps financial institutions streamline client onboarding, loan origination, and account opening processes.\n- High servicing costs result in a relatively inferior gross margin of 60.1% that must be offset through increased usage\n- Estimated sales growth of 5.9% for the next 12 months implies demand will slow from its three-year trend\n- A consolation is that its average billings growth of 15.8% over the last year enhances its liquidity and shows there is steady demand for its products\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than nCino\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than nCino\nAt $29.66 per share, nCino trades at 5.7x forward price-to-sales. nCino\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among software peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. nCino (NCNO) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nBank software company nCino (NASDAQ:NCNO) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 12.5% year on year to $144.1 million. The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $143 million, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.16 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nnCino (NCNO) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $144.1 million vs analyst estimates of $140.3 million (12.5% year-on-year growth, 2.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.16 vs analyst estimates of $0.16 (in line)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $24.83 million vs analyst estimates of $24.08 million (17.2% margin, 3.1% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $580.5 million at the midpoint from $576.5 million\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $0.71 at the midpoint, a 4.4% increase\n- Operating Margin: -1%, up from -2.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $52.6 million, up from -$10.37 million in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $3.11 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2011 in North Carolina, nCino (NASDAQ:NCNO) makes cloud-based operating systems for banks and provides that software-as-a-service.\nBanks are complex to run, heavily regulated and often lag far behind the curve in adopting cloud technologies, instead relying on decades old on-premise software. nCino offers cloud-based software that promises to replace the functionalities of the banks legacy systems, making it easier and cheaper to operate the bank. The company built its software on top of the Salesforce platform and as a result has a very close partnership with Salesforce (CRM).\nnCino works as a central system for banks and credit unions allowing them to onboard new customers by offering them loans or checking and savings accounts, all online and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The platform becomes the single central location where all the data about customers and decisions are stored, which improves effectiveness of banking operations and allows banks to offer more personalised services to their clients.\n4. Banking Software\nConsumers these days are accustomed to frictionless digital experiences from online shopping to ordering food or hailing a cab. Financial services firms are notoriously risk averse in adopting modern software, often lacking the resources or competency to develop the digital solutions in-house. That drives demand for software as a service platforms that allows banks and other finance institutions to offer the digital services without having to run or maintain them.\nOther players with solutions addressing nCino\u2019s fintech niche include Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Infosys (INFY), and Q2 Holdings (NYSE:QTWO).\n5. Sales Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, nCino\u2019s 22.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was decent. Its growth was slightly above the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nThis quarter, nCino reported year-on-year revenue growth of 12.5%, and its $144.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nnCino\u2019s billings punched in at $156.6 million in Q1, and over the last four quarters, its growth was solid as it averaged 15.8% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew faster than total sales, meaning the company collects cash upfront and then recognizes the revenue over the length of its contracts - a boost for its liquidity and future revenue prospects.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nnCino does a decent job acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 44.1 months this quarter. The company\u2019s relatively fast recovery of its customer acquisition costs gives it the option to accelerate growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like nCino, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nnCino\u2019s gross margin is substantially worse than most software businesses, signaling it has relatively high infrastructure costs compared to asset-lite businesses like ServiceNow. As you can see below, it averaged a 60.1% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, nCino had to pay a chunky $39.95 to its service providers for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, nCino\u2019s gross profit margin was 60%, in line with the same quarter last year. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting its input costs have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n9. Operating Margin\nnCino\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 2.9% over the last year. Unprofitable, high-growth software companies require extra attention because they spend heaps of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast historical revenue growth, this strategy seems to have worked so far, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if nCino reeled back its investments. Wall Street seems to think it will face some obstacles, and we tend to agree.\nOver the last year, nCino\u2019s expanding sales gave it operating leverage as its margin rose by 4.2 percentage points. Still, it will take much more for the company to reach long-term profitability.\nnCino\u2019s operating margin was negative 1% this quarter. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nnCino has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last year, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 9.3%, subpar for a software business.\nnCino\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $52.6 million in Q1, equivalent to a 36.5% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 5.7 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but it\u2019s still above its one-year average. We wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter\u2019s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, causing short-term swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts predict nCino\u2019s cash conversion will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 9.3% for the last 12 months will increase to 14.6%, it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, etc.).\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nnCino is a well-capitalized company with $133.2 million of cash and $17.41 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $115.8 million net cash position is 3.8% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from nCino\u2019s Q1 Results\nIt was great to see nCino raise its full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We were also happy this quarter's revenue and adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $26.85 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy nCino?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:01 PM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nnCino isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our bar. Although its revenue growth was solid over the last three years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its gross margins show its business model is much less lucrative than other companies.\nnCino\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 5.7x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we think the potential downside is too great. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $32 on the company (compared to the current share price of $29.66)."

      "text": "Olo (OLO)\nOlo doesn\u2019t excite us. Its low gross margin indicates poor unit economics, partly explaining why it has posted operating losses.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Olo Is Not Exciting\nProcessing over two million orders daily across 80,000 restaurant locations nationwide, Olo (NYSE:OLO) provides an enterprise-grade SaaS platform that powers digital ordering, delivery, and payment systems for restaurant brands across the United States.\n- Gross margin of 53.3% reflects its high servicing costs\n- Suboptimal cost structure is highlighted by its history of operating margin losses\n- The good news is that its software platform has product-market fit given the rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Olo\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Olo\nOlo is trading at $10.23 per share, or 5.1x forward price-to-sales. Olo\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among software peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Olo (OLO) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nRestaurant software company (NYSE:OLO) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 21.6% year on year to $85.72 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.07 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nOlo (OLO) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $85.72 million vs analyst estimates of $82.26 million (21.6% year-on-year growth, 4.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.07 vs analyst estimates of $0.08 (in line)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $13.09 million vs analyst estimates of $11.55 million (15.3% margin, 13.4% beat)\n- Operating Margin: -3.2%, down from 1.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $24.03 million, up from -$1.90 million in the previous quarter\n- Net Revenue Retention Rate: 114%, up from 111% in the previous quarter\n- Billings: $84.93 million at quarter end, up 21.3% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.76 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by Noah Glass, who wanted to get a cup of coffee faster on his way to work, Olo (NYSE:OLO) provides restaurants and food retailers with software to manage food orders and delivery.\nThe Covid pandemic has made online ordering a necessity for restaurants and food retailers. But fully outsourcing online ordering to the popular food delivery apps drastically reduces a restaurant's margins, and building and maintaining your own online ordering system that can reliably handle peak loads is complicated and expensive.\nOlo provides restaurant chains with software that can power their apps and websites, and makes it easy for them to offer online ordering directly to their customers. The platform provides the backend infrastructure and restaurants can still design their apps to look the way they want. Through the online dashboard managers can update menus, availability and pricing, and Olo integrates with delivery services, whether in-house or outsourced, so it can automate the whole food ordering process, from the purchase to delivery.\n4. Hospitality & Restaurant Software\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) are two of the largest software categories dominated by the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce.com. Today, the secular trend of mass customization is driving vertical software that customizes ERP and CRM functions for specific industry requirements. Restaurants are a prime example where a set of customized software providers have sprung up in recent years to create unique operating systems that blend tax and accounting software, order management and delivery, along with supply chain management. Hotels and other hospitality providers are another example.\nOlo competes with digital ordering platforms like Tillster, Onosys, and NovaDine; restaurant-focused POS platforms including NCR Corporation and Xenial; food-delivery companies such as Grubhub (NASDAQ:GRUB), DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), and UberEats.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Olo grew its sales at a decent 23.8% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth was slightly above the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nThis quarter, Olo reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 21.6%, and its $85.72 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 4.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 17.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Still, this projection is admirable and suggests the market is forecasting success for its products and services.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nOlo\u2019s billings punched in at $84.93 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth was impressive as it averaged 23.2% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth, indicating robust customer demand. The high level of cash collected from customers also enhances liquidity and provides a solid foundation for future investments and growth.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nOlo is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 25.6 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Olo more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Customer Retention\nOne of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why they trade at high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company\u2019s products and services over time.\nOlo\u2019s net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 115% in Q2. This means Olo would\u2019ve grown its revenue by 15% even if it didn\u2019t win any new customers over the last 12 months.\nDespite falling over the last year, Olo still has a good net retention rate, proving that customers are satisfied with its software and getting more value from it over time, which is always great to see.\n9. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Olo, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nOlo\u2019s gross margin is substantially worse than most software businesses, signaling it has relatively high infrastructure costs compared to asset-lite businesses like ServiceNow. As you can see below, it averaged a 53.3% gross margin over the last year. That means Olo paid its providers a lot of money ($46.69 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nOlo\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 51.2% this quarter, down 5.4 percentage points year on year. Olo\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 4.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs.\n10. Operating Margin\nMany software businesses adjust their profits for stock-based compensation (SBC), but we prioritize GAAP operating margin because SBC is a real expense used to attract and retain engineering and sales talent. This is one of the best measures of profitability because it shows how much money a company takes home after developing, marketing, and selling its products.\nOlo\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.8% over the last year. Unprofitable, high-growth software companies require extra attention because they spend heaps of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast historical revenue growth, this strategy seems to have worked so far, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if Olo reeled back its investments. Wall Street seems to be optimistic about its growth, but we have some doubts.\nOver the last year, Olo\u2019s expanding sales gave it operating leverage as its margin rose by 10.9 percentage points. Still, it will take much more for the company to reach long-term profitability.\nThis quarter, Olo generated a negative 3.2% operating margin.\n11. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nOlo has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 10.2% over the last year, slightly better than the broader software sector.\nOlo\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $24.03 million in Q2, equivalent to a 28% margin. This result was good as its margin was 8 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning.\nOver the next year, analysts\u2019 consensus estimates show they\u2019re expecting Olo\u2019s free cash flow margin of 10.2% for the last 12 months to remain the same.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBusinesses that maintain a cash surplus face reduced bankruptcy risk.\nOlo is a well-capitalized company with $377.4 million of cash and $12.73 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $364.7 million net cash position is 20.8% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n13. Key Takeaways from Olo\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Olo beat analysts\u2019 billings expectations this quarter. We were also glad its net revenue retention grew. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock remained flat at $10.35 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Olo?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:15 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on Olo, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nOlo doesn\u2019t top our investment wishlist, but we understand that it\u2019s not a bad business. To kick things off, its revenue growth was solid over the last three years. And while Olo\u2019s gross margins show its business model is much less lucrative than other companies, its expanding operating margin shows it\u2019s becoming more efficient at building and selling its software.\nOlo\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 5.1x. While this valuation is fair, the upside isn\u2019t great compared to the potential downside. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $10.25 on the company (compared to the current share price of $10.23)."

  "argos_summary": "nCino reported Q1 2025 revenue of $144.1\u202fmillion, beating estimates and posting a 12.5% YoY increase, but analysts still see growth slowing to about 8% next quarter and a modest $0.14 EPS. The bank\u2011software firm\u2019s 60% gross margin and negative operating margin highlight weak unit economics, and its free\u2011cash\u2011flow margin has only modestly improved.
