  "title": "US blocks Kyiv from firing long-range missiles deep inside Russia",
  "description": "Drone strike cause a brief fire at Russia\u2019s Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, reducing output of a reactor to 50 per cent",
  "content": "The US has been blocking Ukraine from firing long-range missiles into Russian territory for several months, according to new reports.\n\nThe move came after a fresh review mechanism brought in by the Pentagon in late spring, which effectively limits Kyiv\u2019s operational capabilities, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt has prevented Ukraine from striking using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms), or British-produced Storm Shadows, both of which need US targeting data to be effective.\n\nThe approvals policy means US defence secretary ultimate decision-making capabilities for Ukrainian strikes, which two American officials told the WSJ had been rejected on at least one occasion.\n\nZelensky has responded to the reports saying Ukraine has recently been using its own weapons and not consulting Washington over its strikes.\n\nAs Ukraine celebrates its Independence Day, Russian officials reported that a Ukrainian drone strike hit a Russian nuclear plant causing a brief fire.\n\nThe strike at Russia\u2019s Kursk Nuclear Power Plant damaged an auxiliary transformer and reduced output at one reactor to 50 per cent, according to Moscow. No injuries were reported and radiation levels remained normal.\n\nUS president Donald Trump has given Moscow a two-week deadline to agree to peace talks with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky, warning he will take further action if no progress is made.\n\u2022 Pentagon restricts Ukraine's use of US missiles against Russia, WSJ reports Russian troops have taken control of the settlements of Seredne and Kleban-Byk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday. The Independent could not independently confirm the battlefield report. A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a short-lived fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, damaged an auxiliary transformer and led to reduction in the operating capacity at one of the plant's units, the plant's press service reported early on Sunday. \"A combat unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) belonging to the Armed Forces of Ukraine was shot down by air defence systems near the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant,\" the press service said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. \"Upon impact, the drone detonated, resulting in damage to an auxiliary transformer.\" The press service added that there were no injuries, but as a result of the detonation, unit three of the plant was reduced to 50 per cent capacity. The destroyed drone also sparked a fire that has since been extinguished, the press service said. Radiation levels at the site and in the surrounding area have not exceeded normal limits, the press service added. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Kyiv has said its strikes inside Russia are in response to Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine and are aimed at destroying infrastructure deemed crucial to Moscow's overall military efforts. What has Russia said about a peace meeting? President Zelensky has said a peace meeting between Moscow and Kyiv is key to ending the war - but earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told NBC there was no agenda for such a summit. \"Putin is ready to meet with Zelensky when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all,\" he said. Zelensky has condemned a Russian attack on a US-owned electronics plant in Ukraine, saying the act proved proved that Putin is trying to avoid peace talks. The attack took place on Friday and left six people injured. Ukrainian President Zelensky said it was carried out \u201cas if nothing were changing at all\u201d. \u201cThe signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent,\u201d he told Ukrainians in his nightly presidential address. RECAP: Putin says Trump could be 'light at the end of the tunnel' Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said US President Donald Trump may be the \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for poor US-Russia relations. You can watch everything he had to say following the pair\u2019s meeting in the video below. Putin fawns over Trump as 'light at the end of tunnel' RECAP: Trump gives Putin two weeks to agree Zelensky meeting US President Donald Trump has floated the idea of \u201cmassive sanctions\u201d if Putin does not sit down to peace talks with Zelensky. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said he would wait and see \u201cwhose fault it is\u201d before taking another move after his high-stakes summit with Putin ended with little to say. He said he would know in \u201caround two weeks\u201d whether to impose sanctions on Russia or decide \u201cit\u2019s your fight\u201d and do nothing. Healey: 'Britain and Ukraine are growing closer than ever before' The UK has announced it is \"ramping up\" its support for Ukrainian forces by extending the Operation Interflex programme. To mark Ukrainian independence day on August 24, defence secretary John Healey said: \"We will continue to step up our support alongside allies, so that Ukraine can defend today and deter tomorrow. \"In the face of ongoing Russian attacks, we must put Ukraine's armed forces in the strongest possible position. \"And as the push for peace continues, we must make the Ukrainians into the strongest possible deterrent to secure that future peace. \"On this special day for the freedom and democracy of the Ukrainian people, we are ramping up and evolving our world-leading training support that has given more than 50,000 Ukrainians vital combat skills. \"This matters to Ukraine and it matters to Britain. A secure Ukraine is a secure Europe. \"From learning lessons from the battlefield to strengthen our own armed forces, to deepening our military industrial collaboration supporting jobs across the nation, Britain and Ukraine are growing closer than ever before.\" Ukrainian flags will fly above Downing Street and several Whitehall buildings to mark 34 years since Ukraine left the Soviet Union, the Government has announced. Zelensky: 'Russia is showing no intention of peace' Moscow is showing \u201cno intention of peace,\u201d Zelensky has said, as he continues calls with European leaders. Posting on X about a call with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof Zelensky said there was a \u201creal chance\u201d to end the war. \u201cUkraine is ready for constructive steps that can bring true peace closer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, Russia is showing no intention of peace on its side and continues shelling our cities. \u201cWe interpret all signals coming from Moscow these days in the same way. Pressure is needed to change their position, as well as a meeting at the highest level to discuss all issues.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky took to social media to celebrate his country\u2019s National Flag Day on Saturday. \u201cThis flag represents everything dearest to hundreds of thousands of our warriors \u2013 men and women from all over Ukraine, who are defending not just one particular direction, not only Vovchansk or Dobropillia, but our entire Ukraine, and who are risking their lives to win the right to life for our entire state,\u201d he wrote.",

  "summary": "The US has reportedly blocked Ukraine from launching long-range missiles into Russian territory for several months, following a new review mechanism brought in by the Pentagon in late spring. The move effectively limits Kyiv's operational capabilities and prevents Ukraine from using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms), or British-produced Storm Shadows, which need US targeting data to be effective. This policy means US defence secretary has ultimate decision-making capabilities for Ukrainian strikes. Russian officials reported that a Ukrainian drone strike hit a Russian nuclear plant, causing a brief fire and reducing output at one reactor to 50%. US President Donald Trump has given Moscow a two-week deadline to agree to peace talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, warning he will take further action if no progress is made.

      "text": "Trump\u2019s ceasefire deal is dead \u2013 and Ukraine should count its blessings\nEditorial: With the White House all but abandoning its efforts to bring Vladimir Putin to heel, the people of Ukraine at least survive to fight another day \u2013 strengthened by the certainty that a bad peace is worse than no peace at all\nAlthough he is far too proud to admit it, Donald Trump\u2019s quest for peace in Ukraine is over \u2013 at least for the time being. It seems to be slowly dawning on the US president that the man he was honouring with lavish affection only a week ago in Alaska may not be quite as trustworthy and reliable a partner as Mr Trump would like.\nThe awakening has been a long time coming, and it remains partial. The realisation that Vladimir Putin might be \u201ctapping me along\u201d was raised as early as April, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr Trump indulging his counterpart. When the first lady apparently suggested that President Putin \u201ctalks nice\u201d but then bombs civilians in Ukraine, Mr Trump\u2019s reluctant scepticism notched up a little more. Then he told the BBC he was \u201cnot done\u201d with Putin, but was \u201cdisappointed\u201d.\nStill, though, President Trump persisted with this vision of a superpower summit after which the peace process in Ukraine would at least begin.\nOne week on, and with Russia\u2019s cynicism as palpable as ever, Mr Trump seems to have decided to expend no more political capital on the war in Ukraine. He has discerned that \u201cmaybe [Putin] doesn\u2019t want to make a deal\u201d. A standard, Nobel Prize-winning deal in Ukraine is not clearly not going to materialise for Mr Trump \u2013 just as it won\u2019t in Gaza.\nConveniently discarding the multiple promises that he could deliver a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire in a day, the White House now says that Mr Trump is simply going to wait until Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin are ready to talk before wading into the intractable conflict again. Maybe then he\u2019ll convene the trilateral meeting that seemed imminent last week.\nIt will be a long wait \u2013 but, on balance, this is just as well. The basic contours of an agreement did become clearer in recent weeks, and they were problematic. The terms could be summarised as Ukraine giving up significant amounts of its sovereign lands, and thus defensive capability, in return for very little. Mr Zelensky did not fancy a \u201cconstitutional\u201d commitment from Russia, nor some equally woolly \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from the US and, tragically, from the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d, thus far united only in timidity.\nAs Kaja Kallas, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, points out, the Putin-Trump peace deal was a \u201ctrap\u201d set by the Kremlin for Mr Zelensky. Had the Ukrainian leader carried on with his tactic of constructively engaging with the peace initiative sponsored by Mr Trump, he might well have found himself under irresistible pressure to capitulate and \u201cswap territories\u201d, a euphemism for surrendering millions of free Ukrainians to their grisly fate of brutal Russification. That, at least, has been avoided.\nMs Kallas is right to point out some salient basic facts about the war and the recent moves to end it: \u201cWe are forgetting that Russia has not made one single concession, and they are the ones who are the aggressor here. Putin is just laughing \u2013 not stopping the killing, but increasing the killing.\u201d\nSo the war in Ukraine goes on; if anything, with more intensity. As if to show open contempt for his interlocutors, Putin\u2019s forces bombed civilian targets as far west as Lviv, close to Poland, and destroyed a US-owned factory in the area. There\u2019s been no let-up in the activities of Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d, ferrying contraband oil and conducting espionage \u2013 hardly the acts of a nation intent on peaceful cohabitation.\nOne hopeful sign is that President Trump is openly criticising his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to \u201cfight back\u201d by striking targets in the Russian Federation. He also, in typical Trump style, took to social media to talk up Ukraine\u2019s military prospects: \u201cIt is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader\u2019s country. It\u2019s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. How did that work out? \u2026 Interesting times ahead!\u201d\nInteresting indeed \u2013 and while Mr Trump has not quite switched sides again to the extent that he will send hi-tech weaponry directly to Ukraine, he is content for the coalition of the willing to buy arms and pass them on to Kyiv\u2019s forces. Mr Trump has also shown himself ready to sanction countries such as India, who are propping up the Russian war machine by buying Putin\u2019s oil \u2013 and there may be some more pressure in that respect to come with China.\nThrough bitter experience, Ukraine has itself already emerged as a formidable military player, pioneering the use of battlefield drones, for example, and missile strikes on strategic Russian infrastructure. The new, improbably named Flamingo cruise missile developed by Ukrainian engineers is said to have a range of 3,000km (1,900 miles) and will soon be in mass production.\nAlso on Mr Zelensky\u2019s side is the parlous state of the Russian economy. In such a secretive state, no one knows for sure how long Russia can support such a hungry war machine. Much depends on the world price of oil, Russia\u2019s ability to dodge sanctions, and the willingness of China to lend it money. But some sort of financial crisis feels more likely than not, and particularly if Mr Trump turns frostier with the Kremlin.\nThere may be months of stalemate ahead, especially as winter draws in. But the failure of the Trump peace initiative is certainly not bad news for the people of Ukraine. They survive to fight another day, strengthened by the certainty that a bad peace is worse than no peace.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "What is the Storm Shadow cruise missile? Ukraine hits Russia with British weapon for first time\nThe missile has a range of around 155 miles and is designed to evade detection by flying low after being launched\nUkraine is believed to have used British-made Storm Shdaow long-range missiles inside Russia for the first time.\nIt comes days after Joe Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to use US-made long-range missiles to target Vlasimir Putin\u2019s forces deep inside Russia, the first such missiles were used on Tuesday. That opened the door for Britain to do the same, with the UK missiles relying on US targeting programmes.\nIn a major policy shift just weeks before his tenure in office ends, the US president signed off on Ukraine\u2019s use of ATACMS missiles outside its own borders. This comes after months of refusing Kyiv\u2019s requests, which it said was crucial for its defences against Russia\u2019s invasion. Photographs circulating on Ukrainian and Russian social media suggest the UK missiles were inside the Kursk region near Russia\u2019s border, where Russian troops have been massing to try and reclaim territory Kyiv\u2019s forces took in a daring assault in the summer.\nStorm Shadow is an Anglo-French cruise missile with a maximum range of around 155 miles (250km). The French call it Scalp. After launch, the weapon, equipped with its navigation system, descends to a low altitude to avoid detection before locking on to its target using an infra-red seeker. On the final approach, the missile climbs to a higher altitude to maximise the chances of hitting the target.\nOn impact, it penetrates the target before a delayed fuse detonates the main warhead. Powered by a turbo-jet engine, the 1,300kg Storm Shadow travels at speeds of more than 600mph, is just over five metres long and has a wingspan of three metres.\nThe UK first confirmed it would supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles in May last year, for use on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Then defence secretary Ben Wallace had touted that the weapons would give Ukraine the \u201cbest chance\u201d of defending itself. Ukraine has deployed Storm Shadow missiles on several occasions during the war. In June last year, the then-defence secretary Ben Wallace told parliament that the missiles were already having a \u201csignificant impact on the battlefield\u201d.\nStorm Shadow missiles have also been used by British and French air forces in the Gulf, Iraq and Libya.\nCondemning president Mr Biden\u2019s decision, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated earlier warnings from Russian president Vladimir Putin saying that any strikes on Russian soil using US weapons would be interpreted as direct Nato involvement.\nAccording to Russia\u2019s Tass news agency, he said: \u201cIf such a decision has indeed been formulated and communicated to the Kyiv regime, then, of course, this is a qualitatively new round of escalation of tensions and a qualitatively new situation in terms of the involvement of the United States in this conflict.\u201d\nUntil now, long-range missiles have been limited to Russian targets operating inside Ukraine, as well as in occupied Crimea. The missiles were likely used in the largest Ukrainian attack on the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol in Crimea last year.\nThe US, which has provided Ukraine with the longest-range version of the ATACMS, a ballistic missile capable of travelling 190 miles, has been cautious to fire long-range missiles into Russia for fear of a reaction from Moscow that would intensify the conflict. They are believed to be especially apprehensive that Russia may respond by deploying nuclear weapons.\nMr Biden changed his mind, US officials told The New York Times, after North Korea sent troops to support Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not reference Mr Biden\u2019s decisions but denounced Western involvement in Ukraine and warned of the potential for \u201cWorld War III.\u201d\nVladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house\u2019s international affairs committee, also said Washington\u2019s decision could lead to world war.\nWashington\u2019s ATACMS decision is framed as being restricted to defending Ukrainian forces inside the Kursk region of Russia. In a surprise invasion in August, Ukraine took control of several communities in the Kursk border region, which it is currently defending against Russian counterattacks.\nThe shift in the final months of the Biden administration comes as Kyiv and Western allies prepare for a possible shift in US position under Donald Trump, who has said that he could terminate the war \u201cin a day\u201d.\nThe US has been the largest supplier of armaments to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research agency, it delivered or committed to deploy $55.5 billion (\u00a341.5 billion) in weaponry and equipment between the start of the war and the end of June 2024. Germany is Ukraine's second-largest military aid contributor behind the United States.\nThe decision will also put pressure on Germany to relent from its resistance to providing Ukraine with its long-range Taurus missiles, which Mr Zelensky has requested on numerous occasions. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has opposed such a move amid fears it could provoke a response from Russia.\nA spokesman for the German government said on Monday that Germany is continuing to hold to its decision to not send long-range missiles to Ukraine. The spokeswoman said, \"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" during a routine news conference in Berlin.\nFrance, which has given Ukraine its version of the Storm Shadow, indicated on Monday that it was open to letting Kyiv hit military targets within Russia.\n\"We openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side,\" foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot told journalists ahead of an EU ministers' meeting in Brussels.\nKyiv has long lobbied for permission to hit deep inside Russian soil via western long-range missiles, given their ability to travel 150 miles and beyond. By contrast, the US-supplied Himars missiles currently used by Ukraine only have a range of around 50 miles."

      "text": "Inside the Ukrainian factory building drones and cruise missiles to strike Russia\nWith limited military assistance from Western allies, Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation\nA Ukrainian-made drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot last September demonstrated Kyiv\u2019s ability to strike deep behind enemy lines, a feat particularly gratifying for Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.\nHer company manufactured the drones that flew over 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), subsequently curtailing Russia\u2019s devastating glide bomb attacks on her native city of Kharkiv.\nIryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point, highlighted aerial warfare for Ukraine, stating: \"Fighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have.\"\nHer comments came as she surveyed dozens of \"deep-strike drones\" from the assembly line, destined for Ukrainian forces to target Russian military and economic sites.\nDriven by its existential struggle against Russia and constrained Western aid, Ukraine has rapidly become a global hub for defence innovation. The nation aims to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities, with Fire Point leading the way.\nThe Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories.\nIn a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles).\nThey also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.\nEven as US President Donald Trump presses for an end to the war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of US support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.\n\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.\nUkraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.\nDrone innovation grew out of necessity\nLike most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.\nThat's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.\nThe company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.\nBy pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market.\nTheir long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.\nWhen Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.\nThe FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.\nBut the FP-1 has been extremely effective on the battlefield.\nWith a payload of explosives weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), it is responsible for 60 per cent of strikes deep inside Russian territory, including hits on oil refineries and weapons depots, according to Terekh.\nThese strikes have helped to slow Russia\u2019s advance along the 1,000 kilometer-long (620 mile-long) front line in eastern Ukraine, where army units have reported a sharp decline in artillery fire.\n\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d\nUkraine is becoming the \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 of defense\nFire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight.\nThe Ukrainian government incentivised innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.\nPatriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones.\nThe ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.\n\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d\nA case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.\nBecause defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection.\nAlthough they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk.\nMany Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.\nSupplies of drones don't last long\nOn the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.\nThe Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.\nThe company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said.\nBecause initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.\nFire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.\nEven as Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d"

      "text": "ATACMS: The US-made long-range missiles Ukraine could use to strike Russia after Biden\u2019s green light\nShould Putin be afraid of Kyiv using Army Tactical Missile System rockets?\nJoe Biden has sensationally granted Kyiv permission to use \u201clong-range \u201c missiles to strike targets deep within Russia, despite Vladimir Putin describing such a move as an act of war.\nThe weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea\u2019s decision to send thousands of troops to Russia in support of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and comes after months of pressure from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\nHe argued the US ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.\nWe look closer at the weapons that could mark a turning point in the war.\nArmy Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets\nThe first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets, which have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), according to sources who revealed Biden\u2019s policy.\nATACMS are a long-range guided missile that gives operational commanders the \u201cimmediate firepower to win the deep battle\u201d.\nProduced by US global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin, the missiles carry a 500lb (227kg) class blast fragmentation warhead.\nThese missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are tough to intercept due to their high speed.\nThe weapons are fitted with a specialised GPS system and carry cluster munitions.\nWhen fired, the clusters open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead.\nStorm Shadow\nUntil now the Storm Shadow missiles have been limited to Russian targets operating inside Ukraine, as well as in occupied Crimea. The missiles were likely used in the largest Ukrainian attack on the headquarters ofRussia\u2019s Black Sea fleet last year at Sevastopol.\nThe other missile being touted the British/French made Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG missile has a much longer estimated range of up to 550 km (340 miles).\nThe UK has supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadows, but hasn\u2019t allowed Ukraine to use them against Russian territory.\nManufacturer MBDA has said that the missile, which is fired from an aircraft, is designed to evade detection despite flying low after being launched.\nPowered by a turbo-jet engine, the 1,300kg Storm Shadow travels at speeds of more than 600mph, is just over five metres long and has a wingspan of three metres.\nAfter launch, the weapon, equipped with its own navigation system, descends to a low altitude to avoid detection before locking on to its target using an infra-red seeker.\nOn final approach the missile climbs to a higher altitude to maximise the chances of hitting the target.\nWhat did Putin warn if West let Ukraine use long-range missiles\nWashington\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with long-range U.S. missiles could lead to World War Three and will receive a swift response, Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house\u2019s international affairs committee, said on Sunday, according to the TASS news agency.\nIf Ukraine is allowed to use long-range Western-provided missiles against targets inside Russia, it would mean the direct participation of Nato countries in the conflict, Vladimir Putin said on Thursday 12 September.\nWestern long-range precision weapons can only be used with intelligence data from Nato satellites and flight assignments entered by Nato military personnel, he claimed.\n\u201cTherefore, we are not talking about allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not. We are talking about making a decision about whether NATO countries are directly involved in the military conflict or not,\u201d Mr Putin said.\nHe added that the decision would change \u201cthe very nature of the conflict\u201d.\n\u201cThis will mean that Nato countries, the United States, and European countries are fighting against Russia.\u201d\nWill long-range missile strikes on Russia change the tide of war?\n\u201cThis is a very important decision for us,\u201d Serhii Kuzan, Chairman of the Kyiv-based think tank, the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, told the BBC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that will change the course of the war, but I think it will make our forces more equal.\u201d\nMr Kuzan said the decision had come just in time to counter the expected start of a major assault by Russian and Korean troops, designed to dislodge Ukrainian forces from the Russian Kursk region.\nThe assault is expected within days.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this decision comes just in time. There are two days left,\u201d he tells me, adding that much depended on what quantities of missiles have already been provided to Ukraine and whether the US shares intelligence information to enable the missiles to be used to the greatest effect.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Putin may be invited to World Cup in America next year, says Trump\nThe US President told reporters Putin wanted to come to the competition \u2018very badly\u2019\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin could be invited to next year\u2019s World Cup in North America, US President Donald Trump has suggested.\nSpeaking at a press conference announcing the date and draw of the 2026 tournament on Friday, he told reporters Putin wants to be there \u201cvery badly\u201d as he held up a picture of the two from their recent summit in Alaska.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming depending on what happens,\u201d he said as he showed reporters the image. \u201cHe may be coming and he may not.\u201d\nThe upcoming World Cup will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.\nRussia hosted the World Cup in 2018, but has since been banned from all Fifa and Uefa competitions because of the war in Ukraine, including the most recent World Cup in Qatar.\nBut Trump appeared to offer an invitation to Putin, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s been very respectful of me and my country.\u201d\nThe two leaders last met on 15 August in a high-stakes summit over the situation in Ukraine, but the conference ended with no clear resolution. But during a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday, Putin said Trump's leadership qualities would help restore US-Russia relations.\n\"With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,\" the Russian leader said.\nAsked by reporters at the World Cup announcement whether he was willing to do nothing if Putin refused to come to the table for peace talks, Trump said he would wait and see \u201cwhose fault it is\u201d before making further efforts to strike a deal for peace in the region.\nHe added he would know \u201cin about two weeks\u201d whether to impose sanctions on Russia or step away and say \u201cit\u2019s your fight\u201d.\n\"I'm not happy about it, and I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war,\" he told reporters at the White House when asked about Russia's deadly strike on a factory in Ukraine this week.\nHe was accompanied by Fifa president Gianni Infantino as he announced the draw for the World Cup 2026 would take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Centre in Washington.\nThe US President appeared pleased to have been offered the chance to hold the trophy by Infantino, commenting: \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful piece of gold\u201d and joking \u201cCan I keep it?\u201d.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

Zelensky condemns \u2018indecent\u2019 Russian attack as American-owned Ukraine factory is hit Putin launches huge aerial assault just days after Alaska peace summit\nRussia's drone strikes spark huge fire at energy facility in Ukraine\nOn The Ground newsletter: Get a weekly dispatch from our international correspondents Get a weekly dispatch from our international correspondents Get a weekly international news dispatch A drone and missile attack on western Ukraine overnight that hit targets including a US-owned electronics plant proved that Vladimir Putin is trying to avoid peace talks, warned Kyiv.\nThe aerial assault was one of Russia's biggest this year and came as Moscow objected to key aspects of proposals that could end the war it started in February 2022.\nVolodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, saying it was carried out \u201cas if nothing were changing at all\u201d.\n\u201cThe signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent,\u201d he told Ukrainians in his nightly presidential address.\nopen image in gallery\nFirefighters in Lviv on Thursday (AP) A US electronics plant near the Hungarian border was struck, according to Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. The Flex factory is one of the biggest American investments in Ukraine.\nAt the moment of impact, 600 night-shift workers were on the premises, and six were injured, Mr Hunder added. Russian attacks on Ukraine since it launched its invasion have damaged property belonging to more than half of the chamber's roughly 600 members, he said.\n\u201cThe message is clear: Russia is not looking for peace. Russia is attacking American business in Ukraine, humiliating American business,\u201d Mr Hunder said.\nRussia's defence ministry said the strikes targeted \u201centerprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex\u201d. It claimed the attack hit drone factories, storage depots and missile launch sites, as well as areas where Ukrainian troops were gathered. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas of Ukraine.\nIn Lviv, one person was killed and three were injured as the attack damaged 26 residential buildings, a nursery school and administrative buildings, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram. The regional prosecutor's office said three Russian cruise missiles with cluster munitions struck the city.\nMoscow has shown no signs of pursuing meaningful negotiations to end the war, Mr Zelensky said. He urged the international community to respond with stronger pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and tariffs.\nPlans for security guarantees will become clearer by the end of next week, Mr Zelensky said, by which time he expects to be ready to hold direct talks with Mr Putin for the first time since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.\nDonald Trump discussed the war with Putin in Alaska last week before hosting Mr Zelensky and European leaders at the White House on Monday.\nopen image in gallery\nA damaged residential building in Lviv (Reuters) Mr Trump questioned Putin's commitment to ending the war, saying the Russian leader \u201ctalks nice and then he bombs everybody\u201d.\nRussia has fired nearly 1,000 long-range drones and missiles at Ukraine since Monday's White House talks, according to Ukrainian tallies.\nEuropean countries are discussing how they can deploy military assets to deter any post-war Russian assault on Ukraine, but the Kremlin will not accept the deployment of any troops from Nato countries, and Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that making security arrangements for Ukraine without Moscow's involvement was pointless.\nPutin is ready to meet with Mr Zelensky to discuss peace terms, Mr Lavrov said on Thursday, but only after key issues have been worked out by senior officials in what could be a protracted negotiating process because the two sides remain far apart.\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio, who also serves as Mr Trump's national security adviser, held a conference call on Thursday with his European counterparts to discuss the options.\nFinal details must still be worked out, but European countries would provide \"the lion's share\" of any forces involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, a source familiar with the matter said. That echoed vice-president JD Vance's comment on Wednesday that Europe would need to shoulder \"the lion's share\" of the costs of the operation.\nMr Trump has said he will not deploy US troops in Ukraine but has left the door open to other US military involvement, including air support.\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. has imposed a new Pentagon review that limits Ukraine\u2019s use of U.S.-made long\u2011range missiles, blocking ATACMS and Storm Shadow strikes against Russia while Ukraine claims it is using its own weapons. A Ukrainian drone attack briefly set fire to Russia\u2019s Kursk nuclear plant, damaging a transformer but causing no injuries or radiation release. Amid escalating tensions, President Trump has urged Moscow to agree to peace talks with Zelensky within two weeks, while Russia continues to capture settlements and deny any willingness to negotiate. The UK and other allies are stepping up support, but the conflict remains unresolved and the war\u2019s future direction uncertain.",
