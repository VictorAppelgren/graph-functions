  "description": "A local staple in North Las Vegas is shuttering its doors permanently in the fall, marking another hit to the city's declining tourism.",
  "content": "A mom-and-pop casino in Las Vegas is set to close in the fall, after Sin City's rip-off prices sent tourism into freefall.\n\nPoker Palace, a casino in North Las Vegas situated on the Las Vegas Boulevard, notified its 126 employees on July 29 that layoffs were set for September 30, with a final closing date of October 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification.\n\nWARN notices are required by federal law to inform employees of closings and mass layoffs at least 60 days in advance.\n\nThe casino was sold, impacting all of the employees' jobs, but it's unclear what the future holds for the local spot.\n\nNo reason for the closure has been given. Las Vegas saw tourist numbers fall by 11 percent in June compared to the same time last year\n\nSoaring prices and viral complaints about rip-offs have put some prospective visitors off. Canadian tourists - who are particularly important to the local economy - are also shunning Las Vegas and the US after President Trump threatened to turn their country into the 51st state.\n\nAnd while Poker Palace doesn't sit in a tourist hotspot, the citywide slump has seen many locals losing their jobs and falling behind on mortgage repayments, giving them less to spend at the city's off-the-beaten-track spots.\n\nPoker Palace has served the community of North Las Vegas since 1974, when the casino was simply a blackjack table, eight slot machines, and two pool tables.\n\nThe entire casino was the size of a studio apartment at a measly 700 square feet. Poker Palace grew over four decades to a 25,000 square foot casino with over 250 slots, seven table games, eight poker tables, and a bingo room.\n\nPoker Palace prides itself on being the 'Locals' Casino'. They've advertised as a place where residents of Las Vegas can 'Come, relax & experience for yourself the \"neighborly\" hospitality that we have to offer'.\n\nThe casino also has a restaurant called Maddy's Cafe that's open late on the weekends and was branded 'one of North Las Vegas\u2019 favorite restaurants'.\n\nThe closure of a North Las Vegas staple marks a troubling trend for the city as tourism declines.\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, tourism dropped by 11.3 percent in June compared to last summer.\n\nVisitors checking in at local hotels have declined 7.3 percent, and consumer spending in the city is down.\n\nBrian Gordon, a consultant with a Las Vegas-based firm, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that there's been a 'pullback' in the market.\n\nThe combination of increased tariffs, inflation rates, and high prices has prevented people from traveling to the notorious spending city.\n\nLas Vegas has also shifted its reputation from a gambler's paradise to a luxury enclave with soaring resort costs and expensive prices.\n\nMichael Schoenberger, a professor of hospitality management, echoed this sentiment to Business Insider.\n\n'You're starting to change the mentality of the visitor where they're thinking, \"Well, I could go to Las Vegas, but it's going to be a pain in my neck, or I could go to Canc\u00fan\"'.\n\n'It's a cumulative effect that's just now starting to show up'.\n\nAndrew Woods, the director of the University of Las Vegas's Center for Business and Economic Research, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the city's reliance on discretionary spending means it often gets hit the hardest before other markets.\n\nWoods told the publication that if the US economy struggles, Sin City often gets the brunt of economic downturn first and recovers last.\n\nThe city continues to rake in cash from gamblers, but other sectors, such as restaurants and retailers, have experienced a slump due to fewer tourists visiting Sin City.\n\nDaily Mail reached out to Poker Palace for comment on the casino's closure.",

      "text": "Despite what you may have seen on the internet lately, Las Vegas is not dead. The casinos are not empty. The streets aren't bare. If I'm being honest here, I wouldn't have minded a little less crowding during my little mid-August gals' jaunt to Sin City in an ill-fated attempt to see Kelly Clarkson, who canceled her residency there this month. But the vibe in Vegas is different. It's a slow summer, and it shows.\nTouristically speaking, this has been an unfun year for Vegas. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority says visitor volume to the city fell by 11.3% in June compared to the prior year. Convention attendance and hotel occupancy declined, too. The total number of visitors is down 7.3% over the first half of 2025. Gaming revenue is up, a signal that the people who are going are still gambling. But consumer spending, including at restaurants and bars and apparel and jewelry retailers, is down millions of dollars over the last 11 months compared to the prior stretch. Some casinos have laid off workers.\nWhy this is happening doesn't have one straight answer. A lot of factors are in play \u2014 the rocky state of the economy, tighter US immigration policies, hangover effects from the California wildfires that have some would-be visitors staying home. The tentpole events that drew in scads of visitors in recent years, such as March Madness and the Super Bowl, aren't around this year for a 2025 boost. There are still Formula 1, the Raiders, and whatever is going on with the Sphere, which is hosting the Backstreet Boys, but those attractions are extra pricey in a moment when many travelers are feeling extra price sensitive.\nLas Vegas has relatively recently developed a reputation for being expensive and for nickel-and-diming people at every opportunity. The costs of plane tickets, hotel rooms, food, drinks, and even parking have skyrocketed. The nature of the city has changed, too. Instead of existing as America's slightly seedy city of vice, Vegas has gotten a sort of glow-up in an attempt to broaden its appeal. The upside: A broader audience might be up for a trip to Vegas than in the past. The downside: Vegas now resembles so many other destinations that it loses out to similarly priced (or even cheaper) competitors, especially if visitors aren't having a bang-up time.\n\"You're starting to change the mentality of the visitor where they're thinking, 'Well, I could go to Las Vegas, but it's going to be a pain in my neck, or I could go to Canc\u00fan,'\" says Michael Schoenberger, a professor of hospitality management at the College of Southern Nevada. \"It's a cumulative effect that's just now starting to show up.\"\nWhile the \"what's wrong in Las Vegas\" conversation is peaking right now, things have been shaky for a while, says Amanda Berlarmino, an assistant professor of hospitality at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"To be honest, we've struggled with visitation since the pandemic,\" she says.\nAsian tourism has not recovered, she says, and this year, there's been a decline in other international visitors, including, importantly, Canadian tourism, thanks in part to President Donald Trump's antagonism towards America's neighbors to the north. International visitors tend to do longer stints than domestic visitors, who might just pop down for a weekend, which makes their pullback cut a little deeper.\nWe are a more expensive market now than we've ever been before.\nThe domestic picture isn't especially pretty, either. Worries about the economy may be keeping Americans at home. A disproportionate amount of Las Vegas visitors tend to come from California, but the number of vehicles crossing the California-Nevada border on Interstate 15 declined by 4.3% in June compared to the same month last year. Berlarmino chalks much of it up to the fires that hit Southern California at the start of the year. Schoenberger notes that disruptions from highway construction have been a problem, too.\nSteve Hill, the president and CEO of the LVCVA, says while these issues are not ideal, Las Vegas has seen worse in the recent past. \"It is not the crisis situation like we've seen through Covid or the extended downturn through the Great Recession,\" he says.\nBeyond some of these more acute issues, one major complication that's gradually been growing may finally be reaching an inflection point: pricing. To put it plainly, Las Vegas is hella expensive.\nThe longtime proposition of Las Vegas was that it was relatively cheap to get there and stay there, because once people got there, the amount they spent on gambling at the casinos and resorts more than made up for it. But that's no longer the case. Flights to the city may still be slightly less expensive than some destinations, but they're not that far from trips to New Orleans, Miami, or Washington, DC. The same goes for hotels, though prices can vary widely. The typical clientele has also shifted. While Las Vegas' traditional market was people over 60 who tended to be value-conscious, now more people are coming in their prime earning years and demanding more premium services and experiences. Resort economics have changed, too. Gambling is no longer so important as a revenue driver \u2014 it's hotel rooms, food and beverage, and events. Combine all of that with inflation and consumer wallets being squeezed, and you can see why some visitors may shorten trips or just scrap them altogether.\n\"We are a more expensive market now than we've ever been before,\" Berlarmino says.\nMany Las Vegas casinos and hotels started charging for parking in the mid-2010s, and they're piling on resort fees, too. My recent four-night stay at the Cosmopolitan Hotel included $249.44 in resort fees and associated taxes. While there are ways to do Las Vegas that aren't so costly \u2014 staying in budget or value hotels away from the Strip, buying food and alcohol at a store, or abstaining from drinking entirely \u2014 all the little add-on fees can make people feel like they're being ripped off.\n\"Since starting right before the pandemic and then continuing after the pandemic, we've introduced a lot of pain points to the visitors that historically were not present,\" Schoenberger says. \"Why we charge people to drink what drinks cost in New York City, I have no idea.\"\nHill says that the narrative around the cost of Vegas is \"overblown,\" and says there are \"all kinds of ways\" to achieve a budget-friendly experience. \"We've got 150,000 rooms and they, right this minute, run from $9 probably to $600,\" he says. The slowdown in visitors has led some hotels to cut their prices, he adds.\nWhy we charge people to drink what drinks cost in New York City, I have no idea.\nGambling being more widely available around the US is both a blessing and a curse for Las Vegas, which used to be one of two major places in the states, along with Atlantic City, where you could legally bet. On the one hand, people who have the gambling itch can probably find a place to scratch it within a couple of hours from their homes. On the other hand, the proliferation of gambling may also mean more people get the itch.\nChris Grove, a sports-gambling-industry investor at Acies Investments, tells me the growth of sports betting has been \"nothing but a net positive for Vegas.\" It's given people a taste of betting, and if they like it, it might inspire them to go to the biggest place in America there is to do it.\nGrove compared it to the poker boom of the early 2000s. \"Online poker got really popular, and you ask the question: Did that do anything to dissuade people from coming to Vegas to play poker? And the answer is no,\" Grove says.\nPlus, summer is a slow time for sports gambling. If people were sitting home on their couches on sports betting apps instead of going to Vegas, they'd be doing so during the NFL season and March Madness.\nOther Vegas developments have been a mixed bag. Formula 1, back in Vegas since 2023, is an attraction, but preparing for it has caused transit disruptions, Schoenberger says. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle said that Las Vegas remains \"fundamentally solid\" and blamed the company's 9% drop in earnings from its Strip resorts on a \"uniquely disruptive remodel\" at its MGM Grand and slow mid-week bookings at two of its value operations. Caesars said in its second-quarter earnings that it had seen decent gaming results in Las Vegas during the period, even in the face of weaker demand for its hospitality offerings.\n\"The top third-ish of the market is still doing exceptionally well,\" Hill, of the Convention and Visitors Authority, says. It's when you get into the middle third that \"it becomes more acute, the more budget-conscious the visitor needs to be.\"\nIt's tempting to ascribe to Las Vegas' slowdown some greater meaning. Maybe it's just a temporary blip, but what if it's a recession indicator? Or a sign of the times and proof that Las Vegas is over?\nDeclaring that the slow summer is the end of Sin City as we know it would be a bit premature. The same goes for calling it a surefire sign of a recession. But it does seem like Vegas is in a sort of weird limbo, even if it's only temporary. It's a place that feels stuck in time \u2014 besides some of the outfits and what's on the TV, you might not know if you're in a casino in 2010 or 2025. After all, DJ Pauly D of \"Jersey Shore\" fame is playing. Where it is getting more modern, like the additions of the Sphere and the NFL's Raiders, it's still figuring out the logistics. It's responding to consumer demand for a higher-end experience, but still faces with consumers who may not be prepared to pay such high-end prices. If a trip to Vegas is going to run you the same as a vacation to New York, San Francisco, Miami, or even Mexico, you might think twice about how much of a premium you actually put on the Sin City experience, especially when the main differentiator is that in Vegas, you're surrounded by tables and machines designed to suck money out of you.\nTo be clear, Las Vegas is lovely. Gambling is fun, as long as it is done responsibly. The shows are great, the hotels are comfy. Its nightlife offers a good amount of (responsible) debauchery, and its daylife is fairly family-friendly. When it's not sweltering hot out, the outdoor stuff is really great, too. Despite the videos, pictures, and memes floating around online, it was far from empty. (Also, anywhere could be painted as bare if you go at the right time of day.)\nThe city might just be in the midst of a slight pivot moment \u2014 not that it's changing its identity, but it's finding an identity in a culture and economy that are changing around it.\n\"Las Vegas is still attractive to people,\" Schoenberger says, \"because it's a place where you can go and no matter where you're from in the world, it looks different.\"\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "\u2018The whole town is slower\u2019: Las Vegas economy hits the brakes\nUpdated August 22, 2025 - 5:31 pm\nWhen Mike Tafoya opened a dessert shop along the Strip, he was banking on strong foot traffic to drive sales.\nHe\u2019s near the Las Vegas Convention Center and gets a boost when conferences are in town. But he normally isn\u2019t too busy on weekdays, and neighboring shops also are grappling with a slowdown.\nOverall, business hasn\u2019t been terrible this year at his store, Lost Sweets, \u201cbut it hasn\u2019t been great,\u201d Tafoya said.\nLas Vegas\u2019 tourism-dependent economy is hitting the brakes. Visitor volume and consumer spending are tumbling in America\u2019s casino capital, and the local unemployment rate is hovering among the highest in the country for big metro areas.\n\u201cThe whole town is slower,\u201d said Crazy Horse 3 owner Nando Sostilio, whose strip club recently announced a slate of specials to draw more customers.\nSouthern Nevada relies heavily on outsiders traveling here to spend big eating, drinking, gambling, partying and going to shows and conventions to fuel the economy. But amid a series of financial headwinds \u2014 and as President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars spark widespread economic anxiety \u2014 fewer people are taking Vegas vacations this year.\nSostilio, for one, said this is the slowest summer in Las Vegas he\u2019s seen in a long time.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see some pullback in the Las Vegas market, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Brian Gordon, a principal with Las Vegas consulting firm Applied Analysis.\n\u2018Thinking twice about how they\u2019re spending money\u2019\nGordon said the downshift \u201cfeels painful,\u201d but he contends the economy is heading toward more normal levels that were seen before the pandemic.\nGovernment stimulus checks helped fuel consumer spending after the public health crisis shut off much of the economy overnight. That extra cash stopped coming years ago, but after a stretch of high inflation, people still face elevated prices on everyday goods, credit card balances have climbed and consumer confidence has weakened, all while higher tariffs on imports could push up prices yet again.\n\u201cAll of those things are hitting all at once and contributing to how people are responding in their daily lives,\u201d Gordon said.\nThis includes pulling back on discretionary spending, such as trips to Las Vegas and other destinations, he added.\nAndrew Woods, director of UNLV\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research, said that he hasn\u2019t seen any major layoffs lately and that while the economy is slowing, it seems to be holding up.\nBut he noted the region can be a bellwether for consumer habits because of its heavy reliance on discretionary spending.\nThere is also growing frustration over resort fees, parking costs and other expenses that can make Las Vegas a pricey place to visit. Casino operators and others have rolled out price breaks this summer to boost business, but if someone feels less secure in their finances or future job prospects, not taking a trip to Vegas can be an easy way to save cash.\nWoods noted that people are thinking twice about how they\u2019re spending money and where they\u2019re traveling. He also said that Las Vegas\u2019 economy tends to get hit before other markets.\nIf the U.S. economy weakens a lot, Las Vegas will feel it first and recover last, he said.\nTourism jobs\nLas Vegas\u2019 economy, which has a history of booms and busts, is looking bruised.\nThe local unemployment rate in June, 5.8 percent, was third highest among the 50-plus metro areas with at least a million people, federal data shows.\nAround 19.5 million people visited Las Vegas this year through June, down 7.3 percent from the same six-month stretch last year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\nIn June alone, visitor volume tumbled more than 11 percent from June of last year.\nThe leisure and hospitality sector accounts for 27 percent of Las Vegas\u2019 workforce \u2014 compared with 11 percent nationally \u2014 and employment remains high.\nLocally, more than 308,000 people worked in the industry as of June, well above pre-pandemic levels, federal data shows.\nHowever, the unemployment rate consists of more than just layoffs, according to David Schmidt, chief economist with the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation.\nNevada has a high share of people who are out of work for other reasons, including people who quit their jobs, or entered the labor pool for the first time and are trying to find a job, or weren\u2019t working for a while and are now looking again, he explained.\nStill, he noted that Las Vegas\u2019 economy overall is \u201ca lot flatter\u201d than it used to be and that when economic uncertainty rises, it\u2019s harder to make any long-term plans.\n\u201cIf you are less secure in your finances, you\u2019re probably a little bit more defensive in your mindset,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\u2018Less money to go around\u2019\nThe Las Vegas area had nearly 2.4 million residents as of last summer and welcomes millions of visitors monthly. However, consumer spending has tumbled amid the tourism slump.\nSuch purchases aren\u2019t down across the board, but the data points to a pullback at restaurants, clothing stores and other shops in Southern Nevada.\nSales at food and beverage outlets; car and auto parts dealers; clothing, shoe and jewelry retailers; and furniture, electronics and appliance stores in Clark County all fell in a recent 11-month period as compared with the prior same stretch, according to the Nevada Department of Taxation.\nSome categories encompass locals and tourists alike. Food service and drinking outlets, for instance, logged nearly $11.7 billion in sales from July 2024 through May 2025, down 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier.\nThe percentage drop looks small but amounts to a huge pile of money: a decline of almost $191.5 million.\nThere are essentially fewer consumers in the Las Vegas area because of its sliding visitor volume, which itself could lead to cutbacks in local workers\u2019 hours and paychecks, according to Bryan Wachter, president of the Retail Association of Nevada.\nHe also cited ongoing inflationary pressures and noted that when households pay more for essentials, they often pull back on discretionary spending.\nGordon, the consultant, said consumers\u2019 finances are getting squeezed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just less money to go around,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Trump slump\u2019\nIt\u2019s still too early to gauge the full impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs. But the U.S. economy has been on a roller coaster this year as the president\u2019s ever-shifting trade wars threaten to push up prices for businesses and consumers alike.\nBryon Watkins of Las Vegas, who said he has been driving a taxi for several years, stated that business was great the past few years and that he used to pay many of his bills from tips alone.\nHowever, business fell \u201calmost instantly\u201d after Trump started threatening higher tariffs, he said.\n\u201cTourism slumped quickly,\u201d Watkins said.\nTed Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of Las Vegas\u2019 powerful Culinary union, argues that the \u201cTrump slump\u201d has arrived in Southern Nevada.\nTrump has bred plenty of resentment in Canada, for instance, with his rising tariffs and calls for turning America\u2019s northern neighbor into the 51st state.\nCanada has long been a key source of tourists for Las Vegas, but visitation from the country is falling fast.\nCanada\u2019s WestJet, the biggest international carrier to Las Vegas, flew 344,250 passengers in and out of Harry Reid International Airport this year through June \u2014 down 21.5 percent from the same stretch in 2024, according to airport data.\nAir Canada, the second-biggest international carrier to Las Vegas, flew 290,461 passengers in and out of Reid International this year through June \u2014 down 13 percent from the same period last year.\nInternational visitors comprise a much smaller share of Las Vegas\u2019 tourist base than domestic travelers. But compared with U.S. visitors, they typically stay longer and spend more money here.\nWhen you tell the rest of the world that they\u2019re not welcome, they may go somewhere else, said Pappageorge, whose union includes resort workers on the Strip and downtown.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to piss off Canadians, but this administration has managed to do that,\u201d he said.\nLas Vegas consultant John Restrepo, founder of RCG Economics, said that as the prospect of higher tariffs hangs over the economy, there have been ups and downs in the stock market and weakness in business and consumer confidence.\nThe final outcome remains to be seen, he noted, \u201cbut it\u2019s not heading in a good direction at this point.\u201d\n\u2018Just have to push through\u2019\nTafoya, the dessert shop owner, serves taiyaki, or warm fish-shaped pastries with fillings, as well as soft serve and other treats.\nHis shop is in a retail plaza on Las Vegas Boulevard at Convention Center Drive, and he figured that with massive properties such as Resorts World Las Vegas and the Convention Center nearby, there would be plenty of customers walking around.\nHe said he opened in the plaza early this year and wanted to hire employees. But so far, he can\u2019t afford to take on staff and works the counter himself.\nThe way things are looking now, he won\u2019t be able to hire anyone soon, he noted. Still, Tafoya said he isn\u2019t disappointed in the location and is hopeful business will pick up in the coming months.\n\u201cWe just have to push through,\u201d he said.\nContact Eli Segall at esegall@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0342."

      "text": "Las Vegas sees fall in tourists - prices could be to blame\nLas Vegas's high prices could be putting off potential tourists, according to new visitor figures. Tourist numbers have fallen every month this year with 6.5 percent fewer visitors than in 2024, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\nInternational arrivals at Harry Reid Airport were 8.7 percent lower in May than the same month in 2024. It is thought that Sin City's soaring prices could be to blame for its falling visitor numbers.\nA visitor recently shared her shock after she was charged $26/\u00a319.11 for a bottle of Fiji water from the minibar in her room at the Aria Resort & Casino. And a British magician was also left outraged after he was billed $74.31/\u00a354.63 for two drinks at Sphere in Las Vegas.\nAnthony Curtis, publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor website, told The Times : 'On the Strip, people get taken for a ride. 'Once they get here they're like, \"I've had enough of this crap, I'm tired of being treated like this. I'm tired of having to pay these ridiculous prices\".'\nThe Vegas expert explained that many casinos have 'turned their back on the middle market' in order to focus on more affluent tourists. A 2024 study found that the average income of Las Vegas holidaymakers is now $93,000/\u00a368,365, with many budget travelers priced out of the gambling capital.\nIn a Reddit post, a person who recently visited Vegas describes the city as 'amazing' but 'absurdly priced'. The user writes: 'Walking around the different themed casinos was like a fever dream. Sadly I felt like a spectator instead of a participant. I have honestly never been to a place that was more absurdly priced.'\nThey claim they had to spend $30/\u00a322 on a glass of house wine and were charged $50/\u00a336 for two bottles of water from the minibar. On another Reddit thread, a user says Las Vegas is 'extortionately expensive'. They wrote: 'I live in a very high cost of living area.\n'Vegas is extortionately expensive. Shows. Restaurants. Everything is far more expensive in Vegas than here.' Meanwhile, another commenter says: 'I used to love going Vegas, but the last few times I had sticker shock on everything.\n'It doesn't feel like a relaxing, exciting vacation when you're price gouged up to your ears and come home feeling robbed.' However, another traveller claims it is still possible to enjoy Vegas on a budget. They said: 'People come to Vegas expecting champagne on a beer budget.\n'You can have an amazing time in Vegas on any budget, but if your budget is on the lower end, then you may have to forego some experiences and types of restaurants.' And another user writes: 'Yes Vegas is expensive, but it's a high end destination in a tourist area and you're getting some of the best food and service in the world.'"
