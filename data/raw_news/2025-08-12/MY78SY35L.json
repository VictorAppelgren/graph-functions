  "content": "General Motors is collaborating with a Chinese military company that supplies batteries used in People\u2019s Liberation Army submarines, according to a senior House leader.\n\nThe partnership between GM and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, was called out by Rep. John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cThis is disappointing to not only its customers and employees, but also to the American people who supported the company during its financial crisis,\u201d he said Monday on X. \u201cAmerican auto companies need to build secure, resilient supply chains that are not dependent on our nation\u2019s largest adversary.\u201d\n\nMr. Moolenaar, Michigan Republican, did not elaborate on CATL\u2019s role in supplying batteries to Chinese submarines.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported in November 2022 that China planned to upgrade its conventional submarines with lithium-ion batteries, an action that could significantly increase the underwater fleet\u2019s combat and survival capabilities.\n\nThe report was based on a People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy study that noted China manufactures 75% of the world\u2019s EV batteries. The lithium-ion batteries, while prone to fires, will replace lead-acid batteries currently used in 60 to 70 conventionally powered submarines.\n\nMr. Moolenaar criticized GM after reports that the company will import electric vehicle batteries from CATL, which is on the Pentagon\u2019s list of Chinese military companies.\n\nThe designation as a military company is a U.S. government signal that American businesses should not support them. However, it does not bar CATL from doing business with civilian U.S. companies but does prevent the defense contractors from using its products.\n\nThe military company designation also could lead to additional blacklisting, such as the Commerce Department\u2019s entity list that limits business activities of individuals and companies determined to be a national security concern.\n\nGM said in a statement that, for several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for lithium iron phosphate battery sourcing and licensing.\n\n\u201cTo stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model,\u201d the statement said, referring to the second-generation Chevrolet Bolt scheduled to be produced later this year.\n\nThe current trade war with China will result in GM paying high tariffs, around 80%, for Chinese EV batteries.\n\nCATL is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of EV batteries. Its customers also include Ford and Tesla.\n\nIn 2024, Mr. Moolenaar and then-Sen. Marco Rubio, now the secretary of state, called on the Pentagon to blacklist CATL as a military company and urged the removal of CATL storage batteries from the Marine Corps base at Camp Lejeune over concerns about CATL\u2019s military ties.\n\nThe company \u201cis an electric vehicle battery company with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party and its armed wing, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA),\u201d the two lawmakers stated.\n\nThey noted that CATL is a key contributor to China\u2019s military-civil fusion policy that uses advanced technology to bolster Chinese military capabilities.\n\nCATL energy storage batteries are being decommissioned from Camp Lejeune starting in February 2024. The move follows the Select Committee writing to then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin demanding the removal.\n\nThe Select Committee has also identified CATL and another Chinese company, Gotion High Tech, as linked by panel investigators to Uyghur slave labor in western China.\n\nCATL said in a statement on its website in January that the company has never engaged in any military-related business or activities and that the designation is a mistake.\n\nIn July, Mr. Moolenaar sent subpoenas to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan seeking documents and information for their role in underwriting the initial public offering of CATL.\n\n\u201cCATL\u2019s industry-leading role in battery manufacturing \u2014 a sector explicitly targeted by China\u2019s state-driven military-civil fusion policy \u2014 poses significant U.S. investor and national security risks,\u201d the subpoenas stated.\n\n\u201cCongress has a duty to ensure U.S. capital isn\u2019t funding the Chinese military,\u201d Mr. Moolenaar said of the subpoenas. \u201cWe asked for answers months ago. They stonewalled. Wall Street shouldn\u2019t be underwriting Chinese military companies \u2014 and the American people deserve transparency.\u201d\n\nThe Select Committee has long pushed U.S. companies to decouple from China.\n\nIn June 2023, the committee\u2019s then-Chairman Mike Gallagher, Wisconsin Republican, and ranking member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Illinois Democrat, met with CEOs of GM and Ford to urge both automakers to reduce their reliance on Chinese supply chains that pose national security risks.\n\n\u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve ignored the CCP\u2019s blatant violation of trade agreements, intellectual property theft, [and] its economic coercion that disadvantages American workers and does not allow us to compete on a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said at the time.",
