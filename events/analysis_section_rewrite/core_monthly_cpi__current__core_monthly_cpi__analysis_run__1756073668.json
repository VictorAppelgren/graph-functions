      "feedback": "This draft can become world-class by tightening structure, grounding the logic in first-principles, and quantifying the near-term dynamics using only the provided source. Actionable edits: 1) clearly state a 0–3 week horizon up front and present a crisp causal chain: pricing/news/policy signals (e.g., Diet Coke $15, water $26, nachos $40, parking and early check-in fees) reduce discretionary spending and visitation, which curtails spend and international feeder demand, prompting operators to adjust pricing or re‑offer value; reference the specific figures from 6OOEK8TUR after each claim. 2) split reasoning into immediate drivers (price level, comp-culture erosion, political headwinds affecting international travelers), near-term catalysts (promotions, price-rollbacks, or value-led experiences being trialed by Strip operators), and the expected reaction function (elastic response: volume backed by perceived value vs revenue per guest shifts; potential substitution to other destinations). 3) harden the first-principles grounding with a minimal macro view: frame as price sensitivity and perceived value under post-pandemic pricing power, with a substitute-risk channel to international visitors and locals, citing the same source. 4) codify near-term catalysts with explicit triggers and invalidation points: trigger events could include concrete price reductions or revivals of free perks; invalidation if prices stay high without value restoration and international arrivals fail to rebound within the window; 5) quantify and constrain prose: instead of qualitative “the cusp of a turn,” specify observable thresholds (e.g., any reversal in average spend per guest, any reintroduction of free/perk-based entitlements, or a measurable uptick in international visitors) and tie them to the 0–3 week window; 6) monitor and report the key metrics mentioned in the piece (pricing on ARIA/Strip venues, changes to perks like diamond lounges, parking/early-check-in fees, and any signals Perez notes as industry indicators) with direct links or quotes to 6OOEK8TUR; 7) address bias and coverage gaps by noting the sole-source nature (an anecdotal account from Perez) and propose a plan to reconcile with hard data if/when available. These edits will yield a tight, testable near-term narrative that adheres to the horizon, uses the cited numbers to anchor every causal link, and delivers explicit watchpoints for the 0–3 week window.",
