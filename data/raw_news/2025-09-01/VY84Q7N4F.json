  "title": "Taco Bell Rethinks Drive-Thru Voice AI After Prank Order Requests 18,000 Water Cups - Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)",
  "description": "Taco Bell reassesses AI drive-through system after viral ordering flubs. McDonald's and Wendy's also adjusting AI usage.",
  "content": "Taco Bell is rethinking how it uses artificial intelligence at drive-throughs after a spate of viral ordering flubs, even as the company says the technology has successfully handled millions of orders.\n\nThe chain rolled out a voice AI system to more than 500 U.S. drive-throughs beginning in 2023 to cut errors and speed service. But customer videos showing the bot looping prompts or accepting prank orders, like a request for 18,000 water cups, have triggered a reassessment, executives said.\n\n\"I think like everybody, sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me,\" Taco Bell Chief Digital and Technology Officer Dane Mathews told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last week. \"We're learning a lot, I'm going to be honest with you,\" and \"We'll help coach teams on when to use voice AI and when it's better to monitor or step in,\" he added.\n\nMathews said Taco Bell will tailor usage by restaurant, keeping humans squarely \"in the loop,\" especially at peak times, while it studies \"more than two million\" AI-handled orders to refine where the tool helps and where it hinders.\n\nSee Also: Nvidia Is \u2018Going To $5 Trillion\u2019 Says Dan Ives, But This Expert Says If \u2018AI Turns Out To Be Just A Bubble,\u2019 NVDA May Collapse\n\nThat mirrors a broader industry course correction. McDonald's Corp. MCD ended a high-profile voice-ordering pilot with IBM last year before shifting to a new Google Cloud effort and Wendy\u2019s Co. WEN plans to expand its Google-built \"FreshAI\" to hundreds more locations after tests in company stores.\n\nYum! Brands Is Doubling Down On AI As Consumers Demand Accuracy\n\nTaco Bell's parent, Yum! Brands Inc. YUM has signaled it will keep investing in automation and data tools, announcing an AI collaboration with Nvidia earlier this year, even as front-line deployments get fine-tuned.\n\nCompetitors see upside if the kinks get worked out. Wendy's says its bot can autonomously take most orders and shave drive-through times, an efficiency pitch that resonates with franchisees juggling labor costs and busy lanes. But the recent backlash shows consumers expect these systems to match, or beat human accuracy, not add friction.\n\nPrice Action: YUM shares traded higher by 1.03% to $146.97 on Friday at market close.\n\nBenzinga Edge Stock Rankings indicate Yum! Brands\u2019 stock offers poor value, with an unfavorable price trend in the short term. Check here to see how YUM positions itself against its peers.",

      "text": "Earlier this year, The Wendy\u2019s Company WEN partnered with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Cloud and introduced an AI chatbot, Wendy\u2019s FreshAI, that can take orders at its drive-thru. Now, the company has announced its expansion.\nWhat Happened: On Monday, through a blog post, the company\u2019s senior vice president and global chief technology officer, Matt Spessard, announced that Wendy\u2019s FreshAI, powered by Google Cloud\u2019s AI software, is active across four company-operated restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio market.\nMore locations may start using the tool by the end of this year or early 2024. Moreover, Wendy\u2019s has also received interest from its franchises and will begin offering them the product to test next year.\nSee Also: Wendy\u2019s Wants To Kiss Queues Goodbye With Underground AI-Powered Robot Deliveries\n\u201cWe\u2019re also offering opportunities for franchisees to pilot Wendy\u2019s FreshAI in 2024, as we continue to receive interest from many who are eager to evolve their own restaurant experiences with this innovative technology,\u201d stated Spessard in the blog post.\nAdditionally, as per the company, Wendy\u2019s FreshAI has autonomously handled approximately 86% of orders. At its launch in May, Wendy\u2019s had said up to 80% of its customers prefer ordering via drive-thrus.\n\u201cThe benefits of speed of service continue throughout the time a customer is in the drive-thru, with one test site showing service times 22 seconds faster than the Columbus market average,\u201d the blog post stated, adding, \u201cThe technology is allowing restaurant teams to focus on preparing and completing orders to serve up quality and speed.\u201d\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Wendy\u2019s FreshAI was introduced to reduce customer wait times. It was also aimed at navigating increased labor expenses and the sustained demand for drive-thru services, according to Bloomberg.\nEarlier this month, McDonald\u2019s also announced a partnership with Google. The fast food giant intends to integrate generative AI into its operations.\nPhoto by QualityHD on Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\nRead Next: Fast Food Chain Wendy\u2019s Misses On Topline: Holds On To Long-Term Outlook Amid Expanding Pipeline\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Brands YUM, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill, announced today that it is partnering with NVIDIA to accelerate the development of innovative AI technologies for Yum! restaurants around the globe. Yum! Brands, the world's largest restaurant company with over 61,000 locations, is NVIDIA's first AI restaurant partner. This collaboration brings the two powerhouses together to integrate AI into the restaurant and retail industry at an unprecedented scale.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250318283808/en/\nYum! Brands YUM, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill, announced today that it is partnering with NVIDIA to accelerate the development of innovative AI technologies for Yum! restaurants around the globe.\n\"At Yum, we have a bold vision to deliver leading-edge, AI-powered technology capabilities to our customers and team members globally,\" said Joe Park, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc. and President, Byte by Yum! \"We are thrilled to partner with a pioneering company like NVIDIA to help us accelerate this ambition. This partnership will enable us to harness the rich consumer and operational data sets on our Byte by Yum! integrated platform to build smarter AI engines that will create easier experiences for our customers and team members.\"\nYum! and NVIDIA are planning to transform the future of dining by unlocking scalable AI applications quickly, reliably and affordably. The technology will power and scale Yum!'s existing proprietary Byte by Yum!\u2122 platform. Through a direct collaboration at the developer level, Yum! was able to deploy NVIDIA AI-powered voice AI agents within three months. This partnership will harness easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM microservices, part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise and available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), to optimize and create efficiencies in restaurant operations, enhancing team member and customer experiences. The AI solutions will be instrumental in three key areas across Yum! Brands:\n- Voice Automated Order-Taking AI Agents: Advancing drive-thru and call center operations with conversational AI, powered by NVIDIA Riva and NVIDIA NIM microservices, that adapts to human speech patterns, understands complex menus and customer preferences, and enables a more natural, seamless ordering experience.\n- Computer Vision Enhanced Operations: Deploying NVIDIA-powered computer vision to optimize drive-thru efficiency and back-of-house labor management through real-time analytics and alerts.\n- Accelerated Restaurant Intelligence: Utilizing AI-driven analytics and agents to assess restaurant performance, generating personalized action plans for restaurant managers based on best practices from top-performing locations.\nYum! Brands has already begun piloting multiple AI solutions in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations in the United States using NVIDIA technology. Following a successful pilot, a broader rollout of this technology targeting 500 restaurants across Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC and Habit Burger is planned for the second quarter of this year. The partnership highlights the importance of NVIDIA technology to optimize inference costs at scale (the ability to run machine learning models on large volumes of data rapidly and efficiently) and enable AI to tackle increasingly complex tasks, enhancing operational efficiency and customer engagement. The goal of Yum!'s digital and technology strategy is to better serve its franchisees, providing them with better, faster, cheaper and safer technology while delighting consumers and maximizing shareholder returns.\n\"NVIDIA's software makes it affordable for even the largest restaurant company to improve operations and customer experiences, proving AI can pay off at every location,\" said Andrew Sun, Global Director of Retail, CPG and QSR Business Development, NVIDIA. \"Working with Yum! Brands' best-in-class Digital & Technology team and proprietary Byte by Yum! platform to integrate NVIDIA AI software breaks barriers to AI innovation in the restaurant industry - delivering real-time, context-aware intelligence, powered by a scalable inference platform.\"\nLooking ahead, Yum! is expanding AI to help team members manage complex tasks, including AI agents that plan, reason and act to assist across restaurants. The intelligence built with the latest NVIDIA software will be proprietary to Yum!, giving the company full ownership to customize and evolve its technology stack. This will enable Yum! to integrate more advanced AI models, such as large language models, into its operations, and pave the way for innovative applications, including sentiment analysis and personalized customer interactions.\nThe technology will be integrated into Byte by Yum!\u2122, a proprietary AI-driven SaaS platform that consolidates essential restaurant systems ranging from ordering and delivery optimization to inventory and labor management. The NVIDIA partnership strengthens Yum! Brands' leadership in restaurant technology, as a company with proprietary platforms and talent to address industry challenges at scale. Leveraging NVIDIA's advanced AI and accelerated computing, Yum! Brands aims to become the leader in integrating technology into every touch point, across every restaurant, around the world.\nThe terms of the strategic partnership are subject to mutually agreeable definitive agreements.\nAbout Yum! Brands\nYum! Brands, Inc., based in Louisville, Kentucky, and its subsidiaries franchise or operate a system of over 61,000 restaurants in more than 155 countries and territories under the company's concepts \u2013 KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger & Grill.

      "text": "- Restaurants are looking for ways to use AI to boost operations and improve efficiencies.\n- McDonald's and several restaurant chains have experimented with voice AI for drive-thru orders.\n- Get Discounted Real-Time Trade Alerts For a Volatile Market (Labor Day Special)\nLeading fast food chain McDonald's Corp MCD is ending a drive-thru test that utilized artificial intelligence technology.\nWhat Happened: With the growth in artificial intelligence use cases, the restaurant sector is looking for ways it can use the technology to boost productivity, help with job shortages and improve the customer experience.\nCustomers who order fast food often want it quick, with the right items and at the proper temperature. Upset customers who have experienced trouble with correct orders from the drive-thru may find out that AI couldn't get their order correct.\nMcDonald's is ending a test of AI in its drive-thrus, according to a report from Restaurant Business. The partnership with International Business Machines IBM used AI to test automated order-taking at more than 100 locations.\nThe report said McDonald's did not explain why it was ending the test and emailed franchisees last week.\n\"While there have been successes to date, we feel there is an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly,\" McDonald's USA Chief Restaurant Officer Mason Smoot said in the email viewed by Restaurant Business. \"After a thoughtful review, McDonald's has decided to end our current partnership with IBM on AOT and the technology will be shut off in all restaurants currently testing it no later than July 26, 2024.\"\nMcDonald's may not be done with future AI use cases in its drive-thrus with Smoot saying the company would look to make \"an informed decision on a future voice ordering solution by the end of the year.\"\nThe restaurant company has been testing AI drive-thru voice technology since 2021, according to the report.\nMcDonald's told Restaurant Business the goal of the drive-thru tests was to see if automated voice ordering could help speed up service.\nRelated Link: AI Gunning For Fast Food Jobs Next? KFC, Taco Bell Operator Yum Brands Planning ChatGPT-Like Bots To Boost Operations\nWhat's Next: The restaurant company said IBM will remain a \"trusted partner\" with several products from the technology giant utilized in its global systems.\n\"As we move forward, our work with IBM has given us the confidence that a voice-ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants' future,\" McDonald's said. \"We see tremendous opportunity in advancing our restaurant technology.\"\nIBM said it is talking to other fast food companies about the potential use of the drive-thru technology.\n\"This technology is proven to have some of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate in some of the most demanding conditions,\" IBM said in a statement.\nMcDonald's is not the only company that had been testing or using drive-thru AI technology. Restaurant Business names Checkers, Hardee's, Carl's Jr., Wendy's, Dunkin\u2019 and Taco Johns as companies that are using or testing AI technology in drive-thrus.\nThe Verge reported that White Castle was testing AI technology from publicly traded SoundHound AI Inc SOUN.\nMcDonald's announced a deal with Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL owned Google in December for a chatbot named \"Ask Pickles.\" The technology was expected to help with hardware and software enhancements to improve operations.\nGoogle also partnered with Wendy's on drive-thru AI technology.\nMcDonad's doesn't appear to be shying away from using AI in its drive-thrus, but perhaps looking for a new partner like Google. Future details could point to why McDonald's moved on from IBM and who they chose next.\nRead Next: Terminator In Real Life?

      "text": "Following a strong second-quarter earnings report, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives projects a monumental rise in the AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp.\u2018s NVDA market capitalization, while others, like B2PRIME Group\u2019s Alex Tsepaev, warn of a potential collapse if the artificial intelligence boom fails to deliver on its revolutionary promise.\nThe Bull Case: A Path to $5 Trillion\nSpeaking to CNBC, the widely followed tech analyst Ives dismissed the market\u2019s lukewarm reaction to Nvidia's earnings as a \u201cknee jerk.\u201d\nHe believes the company\u2019s fundamentals are stronger than perceived, noting that even without factoring in sales to China, earnings estimates are likely to climb.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s noise\u2026 And I think this is a stock going to $5 trillion,\u201d Ives stated, forecasting a significant upside from its current $4.4 trillion market capitalization.\nHe views the recent financial results as the \u201cvalidation point\u201d for the AI trade, adding that demand for Nvidia's AI chips is \u201cmassive and not slowing down.\u201d\nThe Bear Case: An AI Bubble?\nOffering a more cautious perspective to Benzinga, Tsepaev acknowledged Nvidia\u2019s near-term strength. \u201cTheir chips are the workhorses behind AI training and deployment, and demand from data centers and cloud providers is showing no signs of slowing down,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Tsepaev warned that the market might be overlooking a critical risk: the AI revolution has not yet materialized into a \u201ctotal breakthrough.\u201d\nHe cautioned that the technology appears to be stagnating, posing a direct threat to Nvidia\u2019s future. \u201cIf AI turns out to be just a bubble, it can be a collapse for the whole market, and Nvidia in particular,\u201d Tsepaev warned.\nSee Also: Nvidia Q2 Earnings Highlights: Double Beat, $60B Share Buyback, Huang Says \u2018AI Race Is On\u2019\nNvidia Q2 Earnings Snapshot\nThe debate follows Nvidia\u2019s latest quarterly report, where it posted revenue of $46.74 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share, beating Wall Street estimates.\nThe company\u2019s guidance for the next quarter, which met expectations but did not include contributions from China, may have tempered investor enthusiasm, setting the stage for the divergent outlooks on its long-term trajectory.\nPrice Action\nNvidia\u2019s shares closed 3.34% lower on Friday. It dropped 2.36% over the last five sessions in the previous week. The stock was up 25.88% year-to-date and 61.21% over the year.\nBenzinga\u2019s Edge Stock Rankings indicate that NVDA maintains a stronger price trend in the short, medium, and long terms. However, the stock scores poorly on value and growth rankings.

      "text": "The Trump administration has withdrawn $679 million in federal funding for twelve infrastructure projects supporting offshore wind power in the United States.\nDoT Halts $427 Million Offshore Wind Funds, Hits Projects\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) announced the cancellation of federal funding on Friday, reported CNBC. This move is the latest in President Donald Trump\u2018s ongoing efforts to impede the progress of renewable energy in the country.\nThe DOT\u2019s decision to pull the funding, which was intended for the development of offshore wind power, is part of the administration\u2019s broader strategy to redirect resources to other areas. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the funds will be redirected toward upgrading ports and other infrastructure projects across the United States.\nSeveral projects have been affected by this decision, including staging areas for offshore wind turbine construction. The most significant withdrawal is the $427 million federal support for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind project in northern California.\nTrump\u2019s administration has been targeting the wind industry since he took office, with the latest move following a series of escalations. Last week, the U.S. Department of the Interior directed Denmark's Orsted A/S to suspend work on the Revolution Wind project off New England's coast, sending Orsted shares to a record low.\nTrump's Actions Heighten Renewable Energy Concerns\nThis decision is a continuation of Trump\u2019s anti-renewable energy stance. Earlier in August, the administration halted the approval of new solar and wind power projects. This move has sparked concerns within the renewable energy industry, with executives warning of potential spikes in power prices.\nThis decision is in stark contrast to the recent actions of the renewable energy industry. Companies like Enphase Energy Inc. ENPH have been strengthening their roles in the renewable energy sector, securing new revenue streams and safeguarding projects from potential policy shifts.\nInterestingly, just a week before the funding withdrawal, the Treasury Department and IRS released new guidance on tax credits for clean energy projects, which had led to a surge in shares of companies like First Solar Inc. FSLR.\nREAD MORE:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
