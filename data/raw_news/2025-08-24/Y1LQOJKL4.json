  "title": "Investors in Venture (SGX:V03) have unfortunately lost 14% over the last five years",

  "content": "While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the Venture Corporation Limited (SGX:V03) share price up 21% in a single quarter. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 32% in that half decade.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nLooking back five years, both Venture's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 5.5% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 7% per year, over the period. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nThis free interactive report on Venture's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Venture, it has a TSR of -14% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nVenture provided a TSR of 0.9% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 3% endured over half a decade. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Venture better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Venture you should know about.",

  "summary": "The share price of Venture Corporation Limited (SGX:V03) has risen by 21% in a single quarter, but the company's overall performance over the last five years has been poor, with investors losing 14% over the period. The company's earnings per share (EPS) has declined at a rate of 5.5% per year, indicating that the market is more cautious about the business. This is not the first time Venture's share price and EPS have fallen, but this gain is seen as a sign of stability for the company. The article also highlights that Venture's total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return have been significantly higher than the share price returns for the past five years.",
  "shortSummary": "Venture Corporation Limited's share price rose 21% in Q4, despite past losses of 14% and ongoing market risks, with long-term returns still below market expectations.",
