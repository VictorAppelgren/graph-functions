      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid foundation but requires enhancements in several areas to achieve world-class quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking immigration policy changes to specific economic indicators, such as GDP growth or sector-specific wage trends, rather than general statements about labor markets. Clarify the coherence of the argument by structuring it around first-principles, such as the impact of immigration on productivity and terms of trade. Ensure adherence to the multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term economic scenarios resulting from current policies. Increase specificity by quantifying potential labor market impacts, such as projected wage increases or job vacancies in key sectors. Improve citation density by integrating more direct references to the source material, particularly when discussing the implications of political endorsements and legal challenges. Finally, conclude with a more defined base case and articulate key risks with specific triggers that could invalidate the current outlook, enhancing the actionable insights for investors.",
