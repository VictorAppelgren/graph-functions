  "content": "Credence Clearwater Revival\u2019s John Fogerty heaped praise on legendary musician Bruce Springsteen for calling out President Donald Trump in a Rolling Stone interview published Monday.\n\nFogerty praised Springsteen for speaking out against Trump and defending his values.\n\n\"I\u2019m really proud of Bruce for just sticking up for his values and, and not being afraid to voice them,\" said the \"Down on the Corner\" singer.\n\nKID ROCK CALLS OUT BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S ANTI-TRUMP RANT ON EUROPEAN TOUR, SAYS IT WAS A 'PUNK MOVE'\n\nSpringsteen has been a vocal critic of President Trump for almost a decade now. During his latest world tour, the \"Born To Run\" singer has incorporated a brief anti-Trump speech into his sets where he implores audiences to recognize the president as a threat to civilization that must be resisted.\n\n\"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,\" he said in between songs at his Manchester show in May.\n\n\"Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,\" he continued, elsewhere during the set adding, \"There's some very weird, strange and dangerous s--- going on out there right now.\"\n\nTrump responded to Springsteen several days later in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\n\"I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.

      "text": "Bruce Springsteen is opening up about why he believes President Donald Trump has \"no interest in uniting the country\" despite wanting to make America great again.\nIn a new interview for the December issue of Esquire, the famed rock and roller explained why Trump's presidency is \"unforgivable.\"\n\u201c[He] has no interest in uniting the country and actually has an interest in doing the opposite and dividing us, which he does on an almost daily basis. That\u2019s simply a crime against humanity, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\" he said. \"It\u2019s an awful, awful message to send out into the world. You are intentionally trying to disenfranchise a large portion of Americans. That\u2019s unforgivable. These are folks who are invested in denying the idea of a united America and an America for all. It\u2019s a critical moment. It\u2019s a scary moment for any conscientious American, I think.\u201d\nThe singer-turned-Broadway star went on to explain how his famous song, \u201cThe Ties That Bind\u201d exemplifies how no one, especially the president, should abandon ties with the community or fellow citizens.\n\u201cEverybody carries those things with them. It\u2019s a line that always penetrates. It still penetrates for me when I sing it each night,\" he explained. \u201cThe bonds of your personal family, but also the ties you can\u2019t break among your community and your fellow citizens. You can\u2019t forsake those things. It\u2019ll rot your core at the end of the day. If you want to see someone who\u2019s\u2014look at Trump. He has forsaken a lot of these things, and it\u2019s affected him. He\u2019s deeply damaged at his core.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAnyone in that position who doesn\u2019t deeply feel those ties that bind is a dangerous man, and it\u2019s very pitiful.\u201d\nSpringsteen went on to express that while he does have some hope for the future of America, he still worries about the impact of Trump's polarizing politics on the country.\n\"I do believe we\u2019ll survive Trump. But I don\u2019t know if I see a unifying figure on the horizon,\" he said. \"That worries me. Because the partisanship and the country being split down the middle is something that\u2019s gravely dangerous. Let people view themselves as Americans first. Let people give each other a chance.\u201d\nFinally, the singer opened up about raising his two sons in today's America and how it differs from the generation he grew up in.\n\u201cI do have two good men. And I would say their qualities are, they\u2019re sensitive. They\u2019re respectful of others. They are not locked into a 1950s sensibility of manhood, which I had to contend with,\" he admitted. \"Consequently, their attitudes toward women and the world are free of those archetypes, and that frees them to be who they are and have deeper and more meaningful relationships. They know\u2014and can show\u2014love. And they know how to receive love. I think they have a sense of process as to how to work on themselves, which is something that I certainly didn\u2019t have at twenty-five. These are the things that I\u2019m proud of my boys for. They are quite different from my generation.\u201d"

Tim Walz in November for \"one of the most consequential elections in our nation\u2019s history.\"\n\"Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,\" Springsteen said in an Instagram video Thursday. \"The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good, guiding their hearts.\"\nThe \"Born in the USA\" singer attacked former President Trump as \"the most dangerous candidate for President in my lifetime\" with a \"disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power.\"\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, BARACK OBAMA LAUNCH PODCAST TOGETHER\n\"On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That's the vision of America I\u2019ve been consistently writing about for 55 years now,\" Springsteen said.\nSpringsteen acknowledged \"everybody sees things different\" and that he respects other choices but stood by his.\n\"That's why come November 5th, I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\" he closed.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nHe joined several other singers such as Taylor Swift who have publicly supported Harris ahead of the November election.\nSpringsteen has been openly supportive of Democratic candidates in the past and frequently attacked Trump.\nIn 2020, he said, \"I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don\u2019t know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.\"\nSpringsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song \"My Hometown\" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.\n\"We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others,\" Springsteen said in the 2020 ad. \"The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it. The challenges and the triumph that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for. We are lost. We\u2019ve lost so much in so short a time. On Nov. 3, vote them out.\""

      "text": "John Fogerty on Creedence: \u2018I Did What the Beatles Did, All By Myself\u2019\n\u201cI knew I had done something remarkable,\u201d John Fogerty says of his years with Creedence Clearwater Revival in the new episode of Rolling Stone Music Now. \u201cIn a sense, I did what the Beatles did, but I did it all by myself. I didn\u2019t have two other guys to write songs with me.\u201d\nFor his new album, Aug. 22\u2019s Legacy: the Creedence Clearwater Revival years, Fogerty re-recorded classics (from \u201cBorn On the Bayou\u201d to \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d) with his sons Shane and Tyler filing in for the long-since-split band. In our new podcast interview, Fogerty dives into Creedence\u2019s roots, gives his former bandmates a bit of praise, and much more. (To hear the whole episode, go here for the podcast provider of your choice, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above.) Some highlights follow:\nFogerty is glad his friend Bruce Springsteen spoke out against Trump, and thinks the president made a tactical error even Richard Nixon would\u2019ve avoided in calling out Bruce by name. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of Bruce for just sticking up for his values and, and not being afraid to voice them,\u201d Fogerty says. \u201cEven though they\u2019re very similar, President Nixon would\u2019ve realized not to give the other side publicity by acknowledging and talking about it. \u2018Cause you just make it more famous when you do that.\u201d\nFogerty is deeply unimpressed with AI music, even as the fake-band likes of Velvet Sundown attempt a vaguely Creedence-like sound. \u201cAll of that is elevator music,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of it. That elevator can go many more stories high than the Empire State Building, and it would just still be elevator music. It\u2019s a machine. It\u2019s created artificially and fake and for all the wrong reasons. There\u2019s no actual angst. There\u2019s no real experience in there, so of course I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nThe swampy guitar sound highlighted in \u201cBorn in the Bayou\u201d was Fogerty\u2019s version of the tremolo Staples Singers guitarist Pops Staples used. \u201cThat was Pop\u2019s very unusual sound,\u201d Fogerty says. \u201cI think the first record I remember was [1956\u2019s] \u2018Uncloudy Day.\u2019 I would use vibrato mixed with tremolo [on a Kustom amp] and that was just the killer effect.\u201d\nEven after decades of bad blood, Fogerty acknowledges the unique chemistry of the original CCR lineup. \u201cThose are the four people that made those records,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t particularly happen again in history. So obviously those four human beings are unique human beings. I still give a lot of credit to the way something like \u2018Proud Mary\u2019 feels or \u2018Born on the Bayou.\u2019 And there is mystery in that \u2014 there\u2019s a mysterious aura or ingredient that I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say was in my pocket.\u201d\nFogerty\u2019s incredible output in 1969 \u2014 the year Creedence somehow released three classic albums \u2014 came from desperation. \u201cI said, well, basically I\u2019m now a one-hit wonder,\u201d he says of the moment after the band\u2019s cover of \u201cSuzie Q\u201d hit the charts. And I also realized, \u2018It took us so long to get here. Now you only get five minutes to do the next step because the spotlight will move on to Led Zeppelin or somebody. It\u2019ll just be over for you if you don\u2019t come up with it now.\u201d\nDownload and subscribe to Rolling Stone\u2018s weekly podcast, Rolling Stone Music Now, hosted by Brian Hiatt, on Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever you get your podcasts).
