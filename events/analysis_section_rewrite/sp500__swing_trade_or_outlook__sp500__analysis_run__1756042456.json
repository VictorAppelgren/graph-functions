      "feedback": "This draft largely follows the material but fails the exact format and leaves room for sharper, first-principles clarity; key edits: 1) restrict Movers/Scenarios to exactly 4 lines, two Up and two Down, with 0–3 months and 3–6 months timeframes only (remove the 0–3 weeks and Disney/NBA-level macro digressions); anchor each line to a single, testable regime mechanism (Regime A persistence vs. potential shocks) and 1–2 concrete data points from the sources for “Driver/Mechanism” (e.g., Up 0–3m: MSFT Azure/AI 39% YoY; 0G3A676BP; Up 3–6m: Shopify +31% rev, FCF ~$422M; 0G3A676BP; IGP1Q4ZEJ); Down 0–3m: DOJ risk on UnitedHealth and earnings visibility concerns (IGP1Q4ZEJ); Down 3–6m: regime-shock/geo-energy/capital-return tilts with explicit citations (5S9GJV2O3, NBX9RA9WX, 9X7XOLXMH); 2) in “What to watch” flag precise, observable signals (e.g., MSFT/Azure cloud growth rate, UNH FCF yield, SHOP GMV growth), and add explicit invalidation triggers per line (e.g., if cloud growth slows below a stated cadence or if DOJ outcome materially alters earnings visibility, invalidate); 3) restructure the Regime-based causal chain so the Up/Down lines clearly translate into price implications via discounted growth/multiples, not generic defensiveness; 4) move the long-form narratives (Disney, ETF/Small-cap handoff, Basel/regime maps) out of Movers into a concise, sourced backdrop note or omit them to avoid dilution; 5) for the Trade/Outlook Plan, pick tradable assets (MSFT, SHOP) and produce 1–2 Swing Trade lines only, with: Direction, Horizon, Entry (trigger-based, not arbitrary price), Stop, Target (avoid vague or unsupported 25% targets unless clearly sourced), R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability %, Confidence; ensure each factual claim or numeric in the plan is tied to a source ID; avoid multiple, conflicting targets and keep the plan to 1–2 lines max; 6) ensure probabilities are justifiable from the material (evidence-backed 60–65% ranges for Up lines and 35–40% for Down lines with explicit citations) and that every number used has an ID; 7) tighten language to remove filler and ensure the content reads as a cohesive, first-principles, scenario-driven Swing Outlook rather than a collage of assertions; 8) check consistency across lines so the same regime signals drive both movers and the plan, and explicitly reconcile any conflicts (e.g., cloud momentum vs. regulatory risk) in a single base-case sentence with citations.",
