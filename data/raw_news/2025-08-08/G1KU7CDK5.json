  "title": "Fortnite players do Helldivers 2 grunts proud, squash 100 million of the new season's bugs in 12 hours even without a Major Order propelling them: \"An incredible start to repelling this invasion\"",
  "description": "Super Earth would be proud",
  "content": "'s not-actually- season is here, and battle royale players have already fully thrown themselves into the chaos of the \"anti-bug military defense force\" (not sponsored by Super Earth) by splatting 100 million of the creepy-crawlies in just 12 hours.\n\nWith an infestation of alien-like bugs to fight off with a whole host of explosive weapons, of Chapter 6 may look like Helldivers, and it may sound like Helldivers, but it , despite how perfect the setting would be for a crossover. Even so, Fortnite players haven't needed Super Earth's General Brasch or the motivation of a Major Order to spur them on to fight valiantly against the bugs.\n\nIn a tweet shared 12 hours after the Fortnite servers went back up yesterday, Epic Games announces that players have \"squashed 100,000,000 Bugs as of today. An incredible start to repelling this invasion.\n\n\"But yanno what's better than a hundred million? A billion... Keep fighting!\"\n\nUnlike in a Helldivers 2 Major Order, this number isn't one that players can keep an eye on independently, and it's not like we've been explicitly set a goal to hit, either, although I'm wondering if something might happen if we hit a billion given that Epic has now suggested it. At this rate, I'm sure it won't take long to find out.\n\nEven if Super Earth isn't endorsing this battle, you can't help but feel that High Command would be proud. Loyal Helldivers have pulled off many similar feats before for the sake of Managed Democracy, which have only sometimes been tainted by the fear of their efforts being tracked incorrectly . I just hope that we do see a collaboration at some point this season \u2013 it'd fit so well.\n\nWhile you're here, be sure to check out our guide on how to complete Fortnite Quests in Chapter 6 Season 4 to level up quickly.",

Prepare to stomp and smash the swarm with the O.X.R., the Island's anti-bug military defense force.\"\nThere are three different sizes of bugs to take on \u2013 Swarmers, Bombers (which, as Epic describes, are \"chonkers\"), and the enormous Queens. They even look a bit like Helldivers 2's Terminids, with the small ones looking a bit like Hunters, and the Bombers being rather akin to the Chargers.\nJust in case that wasn't evoking the Helldivers 2 vibes, the official Fortnite Twitter account has also shared footage of a new \"precision air strike\" you can launch against your foes. \"Eat THIS, bugs,\" it writes, demonstrating what looks like Fortnite's take on Arrowhead's explosive stratagems.\nBLAM! BOP! ZONK! Eat THIS, bugs.Ready to try out the new CH6S4 weapons? pic.twitter.com/a10kaOUbh7August 6, 2025\nConsidering Fortnite is full of collaborations between different games, TV series, and more, you'd think this would be a perfect opportunity to add some Helldivers cosmetics or even some official crossover weapons to the battle royale. However, according to prominent Fortnite leaker Shiina, this isn't the case.\n\"Everything about this season screams Helldivers collab, but there's literally no sign of it anywhere,\" Shiina writes, sharing a battle pass emote that makes the player salute by the flag of the aforementioned \"anti-bug military defense force.\"\nEverything about this season screams Helldivers collab, but there's literally no sign of it anywhere pic.twitter.com/ADtEoiTKqxAugust 7, 2025\nThat's not to say that some form of Helldivers crossover couldn't be added in the future, of course. This is set to be a very long season, running all the way to November 1, so there's plenty of time for something to happen while the fight against the bugs is still ongoing. There's no doubt it'd be popular, but for now, it sounds like Super Earth's soldiers are stuck fighting their own Galactic War for a while longer.

      "text": "Helldivers 2 finally gives bugdivers something to do now the Illuminate and Automaton attacks are over, as \"massive Terminid outbreaks have erupted simultaneously\" across 5 planets\nBugdivers, it's your time to shine\nThe latest Helldivers 2 Major Order sees us switching focus from bots to bugs, as the Terminids invade multiple cities around the galaxy. We have to hold five different planets when the clock runs out, which is going to be tricky.\nJust like the last Major Order, which was to liberate four different planets from the Automatons, this latest decree will see us split across the stars, fighting on multiple fronts. It's an effective way to divide our attention and make these battles harder to win. After all, the Galactic War is no fun if we're winning it all the time.\nConfusingly, the Helldivers 2 Twitter account makes it sound like Super Earth itself has been invaded again. \"Massive Terminid outbreaks erupted simultaneously across multiple Super Earth cities,\" it reads.\nMAJOR ORDER: The remnant Illuminate forces have evaded Justice. Some of their remote bases endure. The unprovoked Illuminate assault on Super Earth will never be forgotten. Justice for the Illuminate atrocities has not been averted\u2014merely postponed, for a greater and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WY24mVg21yJune 10, 2025\nThe cities in question are actually on planets colonized by Super Earth, not the bastion of Managed Democracy itself. Still, \"this unprecedented assault of Fascism into highly-populated areas puts millions of citizens in grave danger,\" and we must fight to rid these worlds of the bug menace.\nThat means it's time for the bugdivers to shine. Bugdivers are players who prefer to fight the Terminids because they're the most fun enemy to face. They helped out against the Illuminate invasion by defending a planet that could hack the squid fleet, brokering peace between bugdivers and other players.\nOver on Twitter, people are replying with GIFs from Starship Troopers and seem happy that this means bugs are \"back on the menu.\" Others are glad we have \"a special MO for the bugdivers.\"\nI'm enjoying these new Major Orders after the invasion. The war brought everyone together, and now we need to be spread thin to give our enemies a chance at actually winning.

      "text": "The Helldivers 2 guide to managing democracy\nOur Helldivers 2 guides are all here, with gear, enemies, missions more\nOur Helldivers 2 guide hub contains all the info that a loyal soldier of Super Earth would ever need, with information on weapons, enemies, challenges, missions, tier lists and plenty, plenty more. It's worth keeping an eye on GamesRadar's guides content - Helldivers 2 is constantly in flux, with updates and balances changing what you can expect, but we're always keeping on track of things, with the most essential guides laid out below.\nBasic Helldivers 2 guides\nTo start with, let's cover the real fundamental technicals, and the sorts of things that even prospective players might want to check before buying the game.\n- Can I play Helldivers 2?\n- Developers Arrowhead famously live by the mantra that \"A game for everyone is a game for no one\" - but does that include you? If you have specific needs from your games, we'll explain if there's Helldivers 2 crossplay and cross-platform compatibility, as well as answering the important question for lovers of Single Player: can you play Helldivers 2 Solo?\n- Before the fighting starts\u2026\n- There are a few things you might want to be clear on before you start shooting down Terminids. Our Helldivers 2 tips should help you out as you go into your first few operations, but you may also be wonderinder where the Helldivers 2 rename ship function is, if you're not thrilled with the first title you christened it with. And if you want to be selective with your dialogue, where's the Helldivers 2 push to talk button?\nServer Problems, Error Codes and Glitches\nHelldivers 2 has not had the most stable reputation so far. Oh sure, the game itself is superb, at least when it's working. Unfortunately, what with server overload and a few other problems, there are moments where it isn't - and that's where our Helldivers 2 errors and server status page will help you out. One server error that has thankfully now been fixed involved Helldivers 2 not giving rewards after missions, and while it's no longer an issue, it might be good to know how to handle it in case similar issues occur in the future.\nWeapons, Armor, Stratagems and Loadouts\nKnowing what weapons, armor and equipment to bring into Helldivers 2 is essential, as your choice of guns and Stratagems will definitely mean the difference between success and annihilation.\n- Weapons and Guns\n- To start with, we'll explain how to unlock weapons in Helldivers 2, as it's not the most obvious process and all the great guns will require some work to obtain first. But once you do, our Helldivers 2 best weapons page comes with a full tier list for every firearm in the game and more besides, even breaking down the best weapons for fighting specific kinds of enemies! As you up the difficulty of your missions Helldivers 2 armor-piercing weapons become even more important too, so it's good to know exactly how punching through armor works.\n- Armor, Stratagems and Equipment\n- Beyond that, there's plenty more to choose. Make sure you're dressed up in the Helldivers 2 best armor, for one thing, as well as equipping all the Helldivers 2 best stratagems, allowing you to call in superweapons or rain death about those damn automatons! Finally, you might've noticed all the Helldivers 2 Boosters, special perks you can equip - but how do they work, and are they worth the high investment price?\nEnemies and bosses\nThe enemies of Helldivers 2 are all lethal in different ways, with some trying to swarm the player in hordes, while others unleash deadly barrages of ranged attacks - or even just soaking up damage before they club you into the floor with barely a scratch on them. Let's cover your foes, and how you can take them down.\n- Bestiary and factions\n- Yes, we went to the effort of assembling a full Helldivers 2 enemies list, with every foe and how to beat them explained here. Not only that, but we've also got the Helldivers 2 factions explained here, including theories about a future third faction!\n- Bosses and specific enemies\n- There's plenty of enemies either tough enough to warrant their own guide on how to beat them, or who have been tied to challenges where hunting them down earns you rewards. Here you can find out how to kill\u2026\nProgression, XP, and Samples\nThe Helldivers 2 progression system is a bit confusing at first, largely because it's essentially made up of several smaller systems that link in some ways. Earning XP by completing missions and objectives during operations is how you'll level up, unlocking new Stratagems and titles as you climb. However it's a slow process, so you might want to know how to level up fast in Helldivers 2 to get the best Stratagems ASAP.\nAs you unlock more Stratagems, you'll want to start upgrading these with Ship Modules, which you pay for with varying amounts of Common, Rare, and Super Samples. Learning how to farm Samples in Helldivers 2 can really speed up the process of unlocking these Ship Modules, as they're by far the hardest things to unlock the in game.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMissions and objectives\nFinally, once you're in the field - what do you do? How do you complete your objectives successfully? There's no shortage of challenges and missions to complete in the name of Super Earth, and we've explained all the ones that have given players the biggest problems.\nIf you're trying to do some industrial sabotage, knowing how to destroy Fuel Silos in Helldivers 2 is crucial. If you've got to carry information across enemy lines, then you need to know how to Transport the Hard Drive in Helldivers 2. Finally, learning how to rescue science teams in Helldivers 2 and evacuate civilians will help you tackle one of the most infamously hard mission types in the whole game!\nIf you're also caught in the midst of a multi-week battle to save planets from encroaching enemies, you need to know what to how to beat these time-sensitive Helldivers 2 Defend Campaigns.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Helldivers 2 players think they've squished 2 billion Terminids in 12 hours, but some are worried the latest Major Order was tracking kills wrong\nWas the tracking data flawed?\nThe new Helldivers 2 Major Order was smashed through in under a day, but some players are concerned the game wasn't tracking Terminid kills correctly.\nYesterday, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead issued a new Major Order to slay two billion Terminids in right around six days - and players got off to a flying start, squashing 100 million of them in an hour. Players would've had to collectively obliterate roughly 400 million Terminids every day for six days to complete the Major Order.\nIt turns out all Super Earth's soldiers needed was 12 hours. The tweet below claims that Helldivers 2 players vanquished the two billion Terminid troopers in approximately 12 hours, a resounding victory for Super Earth. It's hard to tell whether developer Arrowhead saw this coming, but six days for the task always seemed like a lot of time for players.\nWe did it in 12 hours lmao !!! pic.twitter.com/Ww1ezyOMJUApril 19, 2024\nHowever, some players are concerned that Helldivers 2 wasn't correctly tracking player kills throughout the Major Order. The player below, for example, claims to have run some calculations while monitoring real-time tracking data in Helldivers 2, and claims that the shooter was incorrectly counting three Terminid kills, when it should've only counted one kill instead.\nThe Current MO is triple counting kills. from r/Helldivers\nA commenter points out that it could be similar to 'Personal Orders' in Helldivers 2. If a squad kills 1,000 Terminids collectively, the Personal Order allegedly multiplies that kill count for every member of the squad, as if they'd all killed 1,000 Terminids individually instead.\nThere's a slight lack of game data to back up any of this claim, although it's fairly reasonable. Right now, there hasn't been any comment from Arrowhead on the matter, although given how its developers frequently interact with players via Discord and Twitter, we'd expect a statement on the matter sooner rather than later.\nCheck out our Helldivers 2 Terminids guide for a list of best weapons to slay as many bugs as possible.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nHirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K. After earning a degree in American History specializing in journalism, cinema, literature, and history, he stepped into the games writing world, with a focus on shooters, indie games, and RPGs, and has since been the recipient of the MCV 30 Under 30 award for 2021.

Currently, around half of the island is covered in snow and ice, running in a curve from the northwest through the northeast and down to the southeast \u2013 it will be interesting to see if this melts as we progress through the seasons in 2024.\nQuests\nFortnite quests can still be accessed through the menu, where you'll find the usual daily Match Quests, Weekly Quests, and Milestones Quests with significant targets to hit which should keep you occupied throughout the season.\nCharacters\nThe island is populated by a cast of Fortnite characters, who are NPCs you can interact with to initiate a variety of activities. Fortnite gold bars can be spent with them, to purchase items and services offered by the characters. Characters no longer offer Fortnite bounties, so you'll need to get those from bounty boards.\nWeapons\nThe pool of weapons available in Chapter 5 has been revised once again, but we've got details of all the Fortnite new weapons you can pick up in the game, including any returning from the vault. You can also purchase weapons from certain Fortnite vending machines, and once you have them you can improve them using Fortnite Weapon Mods benches and find already upgraded guns by opening a Fortnite Weapon Case.\nAugments\nFortnite Augments can give you a significant boost during a match, by unlocking special powers or providing you with bonus weapons and items. At the time of writing in Chapter 5 Augments are currently disabled, but they are marked as \"coming soon!\" so they should be back in the near future.\nVictory Crown\nThere are two ways to get hold of a Fortnite Victory Crown \u2013 either win a Victory Royale, or eliminate another player who is wearing one. Carrying the Crown makes it easier for your enemies to spot you, but if you win with it in your possession then you'll secure a Crowned Victory Royale and receive a special emote to show off your achievement.\nSurvivor Medals\nFortnite Survivor Medals are awarded for outlasting a set number of players during the battle royale, while also getting at least one elimination along the way. As you work your way up through the challenges, you'll unlock special Prized Llama back blings that you can equip to show off your achievements.\nLlamas\nIf you're lucky enough to spot a llama pi\u00f1ata during a match then make a beeline to grab it, as they're super rare and contain lots of useful items and resources. They've also come to life now, so you'll have to chase them and deal as much damage as possible before they teleport away! For more information on these elusive llamas and what they contain, visit our Fortnite llamas locations guide.\n2FA Two-Factor Authentication\nIt's a sad fact of life on the internet that there will always be bad people trying to steal your information, and Fortnite is not immune from this. If you want to keep your Epic account (and your V-Bucks) safe then make sure you enable Fortnite 2FA \u2013 turning on Two-Factor Authentication will also reward you with the epic Boogie Down emote, so it's a win-win situation.\nHow to enable cross platform matches\nIf you're wondering how to enable cross platform Fortnite matches, then we can help. Did you know it's possible to play with absolutely anyone else on Fortnite, no matter what platform they're on? Xbox can play with PlayStation, PC can play with Android, and everything in-between. Our guide explains how you can make that happen.\nHow to link game and Twitch accounts\nIf you want to earn special items for your locker by watching certain streamed events then you'll need to know how to link Fortnite and Twitch accounts, and we've got all the information on what you need to do.\nHow to level up fast\nIf you want to keep unlocking rewards from the Battle Pass, then knowing how to level up fast in Fortnite will help you get the required XP quicker.\nHow many people play?\nIt's one of life's biggest mysteries, but we've actually got an answer to how many people play Fortnite. You'll have to read the full article to find out, but spoiler: there's a lot of them.\nHow to get free V-Bucks\nEveryone wants to know how to get free Fortnite V-Bucks, as the in-game currency will unlock new emotes, outfits, wraps, and more. If you're looking for a route to some cheap V-Bucks as well, then the latest Fortnite Starter Pack offers the best value for money.\nSimilar games\nPerhaps after all of that you're starting to feel a bit of Fortnite fatigue, and are looking for a different challenge? If that's case, we've picked out a selection of games like Fortnite you could try instead.\nFortnite Save the World guide\nWith all the hype surrounding Fortnite Battle Royale, it's easy to forget that there's a whole other PvE game available in Fortnite Save The World. Although Epic have repeatedly stated that this mode will become free to play at some point, for the time being you'll have to invest in a Founder's Pack if you want early access. For those playing right now, here's some help for fighting off the zombie hordes.\nSave The World Tips\nFortnite Save the World features a whole host of layered menus, systems, and meta-game content, which aren't fully explained by the in-game tutorials and can seem overwhelming, so we've broken things down to make it more manageable. If you're playing the PvE mode then you should check out our Fortnite Save the World tips for hints on how to survive, thrive, and win.\nIain originally joined Future in 2012 to write guides for CVG, PSM3, and Xbox World, before moving on to join GamesRadar in 2013 as Guides Editor.

      "text": "How to complete Fortnite Quests in Chapter 6 Season 4\nWe've got the lowdown on beating all of the Fortnite Quests in the Shock 'N Awesome season\n- Fortnite Blitz Founders Quests\n- Fortnite Kickstart Quests\n- Fortnite Story Quests\n- Fortnite Expertise Quests\n- Fortnite Weekly Quests\n- Fortnite Daily Quests\n- Fortnite Milestones Quests\n- Fortnite Ranked Quests\n- Fortnite Blitz Royale Kickstart Quests\n- Fortnite OG Season 5 Greatest Hits Quests\n- Fortnite OG Weekly Quests\n- Fortnite Reload: Squid Grounds Quests\nThe Fortnite quests have had their slate wiped clean once again for the new season, which means we have a fresh supply of assignments for Shock 'N Awesome that mainly center around fighting off the bug invasion. As well as getting an updated set of Kickstart quests to introduce the new concepts in Season 4, there has also been a significant overhaul made to the Expertise quests, which now offer daily challenges of varying difficulties for points that can be used to unlock sales at vending machines.\nWith such a variety of tasks available now it can be difficult to keep on top of everything, so don't forget that you can track up to 25 quests by tagging them through the menu. In addition to the tasks linked to the main battle royale, there are certain quests that are exclusive to Fortnite OG and Fortnite Reload, so check out all of the modes to maximize the XP available.\nAs always, there's plenty more going on outside of the battle royale as well, so make sure you check out the separate experiences of Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival to see what else is available. Don't overlook these assignments, as they provide a significant amount of additional XP during Fortnite Season 4 of Chapter 6 to speed up progress through the Battle Pass.\nThe Launch Week quests involve searching 15 chests at The Hive or Ranger's Ruin, so have a good look around those new POIs. Watch out for Hive Stashes while you're there, as you'll need to collect ten items from them, and if you can clear the swarm then take down the Queen that emerges then you'll have the opportunity to eliminate or revive two players while holding a Queen's medallion. Try to use different rides while exploring the fresh additions to the island so you can rack up travelling 1,000m distance in vehicles, and great shotguns or assault rifles so you can deal 1,000 damage to players with them.\nThere are certain Fortnite quests that will get ticked off through natural gameplay and don't require attention, but we're here to help with the ones that need specific knowledge or actions to clear. Completing quests is a lot easier these days now we no longer rely on Fortnite characters to distribute them, so if you want to know what you need to do for that sweet XP boost, then check out the quests section of the main menu \u2013 or the pause menu \u2013 and you'll find them all clearly laid out, with the option to track your progress on specific challenges. Keep completing quests and you'll earn massive amounts of XP across the entire Fortnite season so you can unlock fresh rewards \u2013 and who doesn't want that? Here's everything we know about the latest Fortnite quests.\nFortnite Quests - Blitz Founders\nFortnite Blitz Founders quests are offering a bonus goal reward of Blitz Wings for players who are successful in Blitz Royale matches, though you can also earn this cosmetic item by levelling up in any of the Fortnite experiences.

      "text": "Helldivers 2 players no longer think the bugdivers are threatening the chances of saving Super Earth as the latest Major Order is finally brokering peace with the squiddivers\nFinally, time to kill some bugs\nBugdivers rejoice! The recent Helldivers 2 Major Orders have all been focused on fighting the Illuminate on Super Earth or scrapping the Automatons across the galaxy. The Terminids have been left to the wayside \u2013 until now.\nThe latest Major Order is to hold the planet Fort Union in the wake of a cowardly bug attack. We need to hold it so that it can continue to transmit \"malware capable of disabling Illuminate technology\" at the invading Illuminate fleet.\nAs noted by VG247, this might be the chance for the Helldivers community to heal a wound that threatens to divide us. I recently reported on the ongoing feud between those of us that focus on the Major Orders and those of us that prefer to fight the bugs or farm super credits on low-level Terminid operations.\nNow, the people who prefer to fight off the bug menace can do so with a clear conscience, knowing they're also valiantly contributing to the war effort. What would be funny, though, is if they now decide to fight the Automatons instead.\nBUGDIVERS IT\u2019S FINALLY YOUR TURN from r/Helldivers\nHelldivers 2 players are now celebrating the bugdivers, saying \"it's your time\" and \"well, bugdivers, do what you do best.\"\nThe current series of Major Orders have all been focused on staving off the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth for as long as possible. Their fleet strength is drastically lower than when it first attacked, but I'm not convinced this will be the end of it.\nIt's been a wonderful series of events that has made Helldivers 2 more intense than ever. It would be hard for Arrowhead to keep up the momentum forever, but I reckon we'll see more invasions in the future so that we don't waste all the new maps and missions.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIf you've already finished your tour of Super Earth, check out our list of the best online games you can play today.\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar. I've always had a passion for playing games, but I learned how to write about them while doing my Film and TV degrees at the University of Warwick and contributing to the student paper, The Boar. After university I worked at TheGamer before heading up the news section at Dot Esports. Now you'll find me freelancing for Rolling Stone, NME, Inverse, and many more places. I love all things horror, narrative-driven, and indie, and I mainly play on my PS5.

      "text": "What are the biggest changes for Fortnite Season 4 in Chapter 6?\nFortnite Season 4 of Chapter 6 launched on August 7 with a Bug Invasion theme, and these are the biggest changes\nFortnite Season 4 is here, and it's time to lock and load so you can deal with the insect invasion spreading across the island. The Shock 'N Awesome season has begun, which means it's time to join forces with the Onimorph eXtermination Rangers (OXR) and head out on a bug extermination mission. New weapons and powers have been deployed to help you with this, so if you want to know more then here are the biggest changes for Season 4 of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.\nThere are new bug-filled POIs\nIn addition to the recent changes made to Demon's Domain following the latest Fortnite live event, there are now four new POIs to visit on the map:\n- The Hive\n- OXR HQ\n- Ranger's Ruin\n- Swarmy Stash\nUnsurprisingly, The Hive is teeming with insect activity and you'll definitely run into a swarm there, so make sure you're appropriately armed before heading into this nest. OXR HQ is home to the commanders and the location of the OXR Armory, where you can purchase weapons and items in exchange for Bars. The once bustling Ranger's Ruin weapons lab has now fallen to the bugs, but if you're prepared to fight your way in then you may find some top tier loot.\nOXR Ranks unlock Drop Pods\nReplacing the Hero Ranks from last season, your OXR Rank can be increased by wiping out bugs, eliminating opponents, and looting chests. OXR Rank is shared across all members of a party, and every time you rank up an OXR Drop Pod full of loot will be sent to your location. From Rank A you can also access OXR Bunkers, containing Exotic weapons to add to your arsenal.\nFresh weapons have been deployed\nAs per usual, a fresh selection of Fortnite new weapons has dropped for the new season, and these are squarely focused on blasting bugs. Watch out for the Bug Blaster that can fire plasma projectiles or be charged up for a more powerful shot, alongside the ferocious Leadspitter 3000 minigun and the multi-rocket Swarmstrike launcher.\nThere are swarms of bugs to defeat\nIn keeping with the insect invasion theme of the season, there are three different types of bugs you need to fight off. Swarmers are your basic enemies that are easy to take down individually, but make sure they don't assemble in large numbers or you could get overwhelmed. Bombers appear near nests and have a habit of burrowing underground before popping up behind you and launching a glob of goop, which you should avoid at all costs. Finally, the giant Queens emerge in certain locations once they're cleared of bugs, and while they put up a difficult fight the rewards for defeating them can be great.\nNew Boons give you an edge on the battlefield\nThese new Boons can be looted from OXR Chests, Hive Sacs, and Drop Pods, or are awarded for completing certain in-game objectives such as clearing swarms. They provide the following benefits:\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n- Agile Aiming Boon reduces recoil and spread while maintaining more movement speed as you aim down sights\n- Extended Magazine Boon increases the ammo clip size for all weapons\n- Storm Forecast Boon always reveals the next Storm circle\n- Super Soldier Ranked Boons (only available in OXR Drop Pods):\n- Rank B reduces Energy consumption when sprinting\n- Rank A also increases reload speed\n- Rank S also reduces weapon recoil and spread\n- Rank S+ also increases sprint speed and gives you unlimited Energy\nThe Battle Pass brings new skins including UNSC Spartan\nAs always, there are a number of premium reward skins available for those who purchase the Battle Pass to earn, with the UNSC Spartan unlocked instantly. However, for this season all non-Battle Pass holders who reach Level 100 will also receive the UNSC Spartan Outfit for free, and this will be available to them from August 26. Other premium Battle Pass skins include:\n- Yoo-mi\n- Agent Patch\n- Battle Gamer Mae\n- Lt. Ripp Slade\n- Onyx Winter\n- Green Ranger\nThe Shock 'N Awesome Fortnite Season 4 in Chapter 6 will run until November 1, 2025, so you have plenty of time to check out all of these new additions.\n\u00a9 GamesRadar+.
