  "title": "Picking Crystal Palace\u2019s 2025-26 breakout player: Caleb Kporha",
  "description": "The winger turned wing-back was once at Brighton's academy. Now this season offers hope of first-team minutes either for Glasner or on loan",
  "content": "If things had turned out differently, Caleb Kporha might well be wearing a Brighton & Hove Albion shirt these days.\n\nInstead, the teenager has made a Premier League debut for their dear friends Crystal Palace, and also started in a Carabao Cup quarter-final. There were two other appearances last season too, offering fans a glimpse of his talent.\n\nKporha, who turned 19 a month ago, is our choice as the Palace player most likely to make a first-team breakthrough this season. A right wing-back who can play on the left but is also more than adept as a winger, there are certainly plenty more games to come on top of the handful he got last term.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that breakthrough will come with his parent club or out on loan in the EFL, perhaps at Championship level. Should a more experienced wing-back than Kporha be signed over the remainder of the summer window, a temporary move to speed his development will almost certainly be sanctioned.\n\nRegular matches in senior football at a lower level would offer him the chance to progress more than he might by only training with manager Oliver Glasner\u2019s first-team group at Palace, as he has done for the past year.\n\nHis journey with Palace began when he came in for a trial at age 10, but Kporha first experienced academy life at their arch-rivals Brighton. After several years on the south coast, he joined non-League side Welling United \u2014 whose south-east London location was a more tolerable commute from his home in Rochester, Kent.\n\nKporha thrived there for three years before being recommended by a Palace scout, who also worked in Welling\u2019s academy, which led to him joining their under-16s setup.\n\nA quiet, private person but well-liked and highly regarded \u2014 particularly by former sporting director Dougie Freedman \u2014 Kporha is viewed as attentive and dependable. His parents moved to the UK from Ghana more than 20 years ago, and he was born in Rochester to a church-going family.\n\nHe is a winger by trade, having played in several attacking positions in his academy career before converting to wing-back.\n\nThere are echoes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, whose transition from right-winger to right-back thrust his career forward and ultimately led to a \u00a350million ($67.3m at the current rate) move from Palace to Manchester United in June 2019 at age 21. Kporha is some way from that calibre at present, but there has been plenty of excitement around his potential for some time.\n\nA hamstring injury in April 2023 hindered his progress, though he recovered sufficiently to make the under-21s\u2019 pre-season tour to the United States that summer. He was then out again from the September until last year\u2019s pre-season, when he again travelled to America, on that occasion with the first team.\n\nHe can play on both the right and the left, and although some close to him consider his ability still more suited to that of a winger, he has nevertheless thrived as a wing-back, marauding up the pitch and being particularly dangerous in the opposition half. It is his defensive work that needs improvement before he is ready for sustained first-team appearances, but it\u2019s felt that will come. In any case, in Glasner\u2019s system, his attacking instincts are more valuable.\n\nThe manager handed him a Premier League debut in November, as a late substitute in a 2-0 home defeat by Fulham. A first start arrived in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals the following month. He played the first half of that 3-2 away loss at Arsenal before being replaced with Nathaniel Clyne.\n\nThat night at the Emirates Stadium remains his only senior start to date, but obviously he is still young, especially for a defender, and first-choice right wing-back Daniel Munoz has yet to succumb to any prolonged absence through injury since joining Palace last summer. Clyne has significant experience as the backup, too. With Palace competing in the UEFA Conference League this season, though, there may be more opportunity for Kporha to advance his career.\n\nIt will not be optimal for Munoz to feature every midweek if Palace go deep into the tournament on their European journey, and the level of competition in the continent\u2019s third-tier club competition would make it easier for Glasner to turn to Kporha, even if only in the earlier stages of the six-match league phase should the FA Cup and Community Shield holders make it through this month\u2019s qualification play-off.\n\nThe youngster signed a new four-year contract in April, which will extend his stay at the club until 2029. There has been international recognition at youth level with England at under-17s and under-19s level, including starting two of the latter\u2019s three matches at their European Championship finals in Romania this summer.\n\nKporha\u2019s opportunity to make an immediate mark in the first team this pre-season was hampered by a back injury which ruled him out of their warm-up games, but he is now back in training and will be available in due course either for the first team or to go out on loan.\n\nWhat happens next for him will likely be determined by Palace\u2019s recruitment over the remainder of the summer window. The fear would be the pathway with them getting further obstructed by a new arrival in his position, but such a signing would surely guarantee a loan move, which could be more beneficial for him in terms of first-team game time than staying put.\n\nEither way, this has the potential to be an important season for Kporha. He is a player ready to kick on with his development.",

      "text": "Will the return of Rodri propel Manchester City back to the top of the table? Is this the year Manchester United finally regain their status as a genuine Premier League power? How will a tragic summer affect Liverpool on the pitch? Can the promoted teams break the pattern of recent seasons and stay up?\nAdvertisement\nThe 2025-26 season kicks off on Friday and what better way to start the week than by looking ahead to what might be in store over the coming months.\nWe asked all of our writers to submit their predicted Premier League table \u2014 you can see that a little further down this article. (We won\u2019t name the person who had Manchester United finishing in the relegation places \u2014 for now, at least.)\nWe also asked Oliver Kay, Adam Crafton, Tim Spiers, Nick Miller, Simon Hughes, Stuart James, The Athletic FC podcast host Ayo Akinwolere and Cerys Jones to gaze into their crystal balls and go a little deeper on some of the key topics.\nLet us know if you agree in the comments and we definitely won\u2019t be holding the writers to their predictions come May. Honest.\nWho will be much better than last season?\nKay: Manchester United simply have to be, but I\u2019ll look across the city and say Phil Foden, who had such a difficult time last season. I\u2019m always wary of that \u201cclass is permanent\u201d maxim because there are so many cases that suggest the opposite, but I hope and believe Foden will be energised by a summer\u2019s break, even if it was shorter than would have been ideal.\nCrafton: Strange to say about a team who finished second, but I found Arsenal frustratingly sloppy at times last season. They look a much more complete squad this time around, with additions in key positions, and perhaps Eberechi Eze still to come. There really doesn\u2019t look to be a gap in their armour, so Mikel Arteta must have his team firing from the very start to secure the silverware his reign merits.\nSpiers: Manchester City\u2019s biggest problems last season were rooted in their creaky, Rodri-less midfield. With Rodri back and the dynamic Tijjani Reijnders on board, plus some fine additions in the two Rayans \u2014 Cherki and Ait-Nouri \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be much improved.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Tottenham. Which admittedly isn\u2019t saying much, considering they lost more than half their games and finished 17th last season. But if any team needs a manager who will fashion some square holes for their square pegs, rather than trying to ram them into round ones, it\u2019s Spurs: hello, Thomas Frank.\nHughes: Spurs. Otherwise, they might be relegated.\nJames: The bar\u2019s not set very high for Manchester United and Spurs to be \u201cmuch better\u201d than last season. The temptation is to say that Spurs, under Frank, will be the biggest climber. But I\u2019m going to roll the dice and suggest United, with no European football, will be around the top six.\nAkinwolere: Crystal Palace, assuming they\u2019re able to keep Eze. I really like Oliver Glasner as a coach. I\u2019ve watched some of their pre-season games and they have been impressive.\nJones: Manchester United, surely, if only because the bar is so low. I have been saying this since I was studying for my GCSEs and should probably know better by now. Joking aside, this Europe-less season and the new-look front line feel like fertile ground for a rebuild.\nWho will be worse than last season?\nKay: Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Brentford could all be excused a slight drop-off after exceeding expectations last season, particularly as the first two will have European commitments to contend with. Brentford are the ones at risk of a steep drop-off. Frank is such a hard act to follow for Keith Andrews.\nCrafton: I am a little worried about Bournemouth, who have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga, Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen, and seem to be losing Illia Zabarnyi and Dango Ouattara. Andoni Iraola is a super coach, but that\u2019s a hefty rebuild and replacements may not be through the door until the season starts. I\u2019d also expect a substantial drop-off at Nottingham Forest towards mid-table.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Recent history tells us Manchester United take very good/promising players and turn them into disasters (Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana, Mason Mount etc). All the best, then, to xG overachievers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Team-wise, it has to be PSR botherers Aston Villa, who look chaotic.\nMiller: Newcastle. At the time of writing, they don\u2019t have a striker who actually wants to play for them, have strengthened in a couple of positions they were already fine in, and their transfer targets are all picking other teams. Not ideal when you have the Champions League to deal with, too.\nHughes: Brentford. Yes, they\u2019re a well-run club, but they\u2019ve replaced the manager who got them into the Premier League for the first time and kept them there for years with someone who, not so long ago, was a talking head on Sky\u2019s EFL coverage. He has made a huge jump.\nJames: Nottingham Forest (seventh) and Chris Wood (20 Premier League goals) have got their work cut out to maintain the same level. But it\u2019s hard to look beyond Brentford, who have lost their manager, their top goalscorer, and their captain. Fair play to Andrews if he proves us all wrong.\nAkinwolere: You have to worry for Brentford, with many key components missing in the team. Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Norgaard and possibly Yoane Wissa. It feels like an uphill struggle if they\u2019re not able to replace the quality they\u2019ve lost.\nJones: Brentford, for all the reasons mentioned above. If Wissa leaves, too, their attack will look very thin and a top-half finish could be tough.\nWho will win the title?\nKay: The least controversial answer is Liverpool, but there are various unknowns: how the new signings will adapt, whether they\u2019re light in certain areas, and, of course, how the loss of Diogo Jota in such tragic circumstances might affect them.\nI\u2019ll say Liverpool, cautiously, but I wouldn\u2019t discount Arsenal, Manchester City, or \u2014 if they can somehow harden up a bit \u2014 Chelsea, all of whom should be stronger.\nCrafton: Arsenal. It\u2019s about time. He\u2019s almost been forgotten in the blur of the summer, but Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s departure to Real Madrid will be big for Liverpool.\nSpiers: Manchester City had a disastrous 2024-25 season and still only finished 13 points behind Liverpool. They undoubtedly have the best manager, striker and possibly squad in the league, and I think they\u2019ll probably overhaul Liverpool again.\nMiller: Oh god, I\u2019m falling for it again: Arsenal. Broadly because they seem to have actually addressed their problems this summer, rather than Arteta looking at their squad and saying \u201cNo, we just need one more beefy centre-half to play at full-back\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nHughes: Liverpool. I\u2019m not convinced their eye-catching summer in the transfer market results in eye-catching performances straight away because it will probably take time for the team to gel, but they have recruited proven quality and upgrades in most positions.\nJames: It\u2019s been such a traumatic summer for Liverpool that nobody can be quite sure how they will respond. But my instinct tells me that Arne Slot and his players will develop an even closer bond in the wake of the Jota tragedy and, with the help of some outstanding signings, retain the title.\nAkinwolere: I really want to say Arsenal! Oh, go on then\u2026 Arsenal. As you can tell, I\u2019m not fully convinced, but I have to believe all the pain of consecutive second-place finishes has shown Arteta what he needs to add to this team.\nJones: Liverpool. Arsenal and City\u2019s problems helped them last season, but they have not stood still at the top. Slot\u2019s squad has got even stronger and I don\u2019t feel anyone else has added enough to keep up.\nResults in full: Where our writers think teams will finish\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n45% | 38% | 14% | 3% | |||||||||||||||||\n31% | 31% | 31% | 7% | |||||||||||||||||\n21% | 21% | 45% | 13% | |||||||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 74% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n3% | 45% | 17% | 24% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n28% | 41% | 14% | 7% | 10% | ||||||||||||||||\n24% | 21% | 41% | 10% | 3% | ||||||||||||||||\n18% | 14% | 18% | 17% | 10% | 3% | 10% | 3% | 3% | 3% | |||||||||||\n3% | 28% | 31% | 10% | 10% | 7% | 3% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 14% | 17% | 21% | 7% | 17% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 21% | 3% | 7% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 3% | 21% | 21% | 10% | 7% | 28% | 3% | ||||||||||||\n3% | 10% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 14% | 7% | 10% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 3% | 7% | 21% | 17% | 17% | 17% | 7% | ||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 7% | 17% | 21% | 24% | 10% | 7% | |||||||||||||\n3% | 3% | 7% | 24% | 14% | 28% | 17% | 3% | |||||||||||||\n7% | 3% | 10% | 21% | 24% | 34% | |||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 10% | 17% | 7% | 34% | 21% | ||||||||||||||\n3% | 7% | 14% | 21% | 28% | 24% | 3% | ||||||||||||||\n7% | 7% | 10% | 76% |\nWho is the best signing so far?\nKay: I\u2019ve been less than enthusiastic about Chelsea\u2019s approach in the transfer market in recent years, but looking at Jorrel Hato for \u00a335m and an initial \u00a329.1m for Estevao \u2014 and possibly a \u00a340m deal for Alejandro Garnacho \u2014 the potential upside of those deals is enormous (I stress potential because there are still aspects of Chelsea\u2019s approach that leave me sceptical).\nCrafton: There have been some great signings by big Premier League clubs plucking from the middle class of the top flight. Joao Pedro to Chelsea and Kerkez to Liverpool seem surefire bets.\nSpiers: You can have your flair players, your tricky flickers and your goalscorers all you like, but the best hairy-arsed tackler in the Premier League in recent seasons was Fulham\u2019s Joao Palhinha \u2014 and Tottenham have brought him back to England for peanuts. He could transform their team at both ends of the pitch. Shoutout for Sunderland signing Granit Xhaka, too.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Fair play to whoever is persuading players to join Sunderland, because Xhaka is a hell of a get. Viktor Gyokeres is very \u2018final piece in the jigsaw puzzle\u2019 at Arsenal. Florian Wirtz could turn out to be a sort of super deluxe utility man for Liverpool, and wherever he plays, I think he\u2019ll be magic.\nHughes: Joao Pedro. Chelsea needed a top-class striker and now they have one.\nJames: Wirtz would be an obvious answer. But I\u2019ll throw a left-field name into the mix, purely because I said at the Copa America last summer that Colombia\u2019s Jhon Arias \u201cmust surely be on the radar of top European teams\u201d. It disappoints me that Wolves, 12 months later, haven\u2019t even offered a word of thanks.\nAkinwolere: Gyokeres \u2014 is he really the elite striker Arsenal have been looking for? How will he fit their system? His hunger for goals and his tireless work rate should bode well for a team that struggled to bury key chances last season. I\u2019m not expecting 40 goals, but I am expecting some top-bins bangers.\nJones: Gyokeres. 54 goals in one season speaks for itself. He might need a bit of time to slot into Arsenal and the Premier League, but once he does, he can be the focal point they sorely need. Considering what strikers seem to cost these days, an initial \u00a355m isn\u2019t bad either.\nWhich player are you most looking forward to watching?\nKay: In addition to Wirtz, who is mesmerising, there\u2019s Arias, who enthralled me during the Club World Cup, Cherki at Manchester City, Estevao at Chelsea, and, if the opportunity arises and they\u2019ve done their homework on time, the precocious Max Dowman at Arsenal and Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool.\nCrafton: Cunha at Manchester United. Some players grow a few inches in that jersey, and many more are weighed down by the history and scrutiny. He strikes me as someone who will relish the expectation.\nSpiers: It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if Gyokeres solves Arsenal\u2019s striker conundrum. His uncontrollable, lusty desire for scoring goals is tangible and his numbers are ridiculous, but most of the Portuguese league would be the equivalent of Championship standard and below. Also, Arias at Wolves promises to be high on the fun scale.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Wirtz. I don\u2019t especially care how many goals he scores or assists he gets or chances he makes. He just moves in such a slinky, elegant way that I\u2019ll be paying attention to him and only him when Liverpool play. I also like the cut of El Hadji Malick Diouf\u2019s gib, although West Ham will probably ruin him somehow.\nHughes: Wirtz. No Liverpool signing has excited me more since the arrival of Fernando Torres.\nJames: Players (plural), if you don\u2019t mind. Wirtz \u2014 what a signing. The incredibly gifted Cherki \u2014 intrigued as to how Pep Guardiola uses him (and, in particular, how much the City manager trusts him off the ball). Last but not least, 15-year-old Dowman. A sensational talent.\nAkinwolere: Joao Pedro in this Chelsea setup looks tasty. If the Club World Cup appearances are anything to go by, \u00a350m could be money well spent.\nJones: I\u2019m always wary of overhyping teenage \u2018prodigies\u2019, but Chelsea\u2019s Estevao is very exciting. He is an unapologetic entertainer and his dribbling, especially for someone so young, is ludicrous. Romantic or naive as it sounds, it\u2019s always intriguing to hear an incoming player describe football as a \u201cspectacle\u201d.\nWhich manager is under the most pressure?\nKay: Not to say his job is under immediate threat, but the pressure on Ruben Amorim to show he can turn Manchester United around is huge nonetheless. They won just seven of his 27 Premier League games last season. The pressure will lift very quickly if his new-look team can hit the ground running. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it is far from a gentle start fixture-wise \u2014 it\u2019s going to intensify.\nCrafton: The answer to this is always the Manchester United manager, but Daniel Farke has plenty to prove at the highest level at Leeds, while Eddie Howe is coming through a turbulent summer, and I\u2019m curious to see how and if the dynamics at St James\u2019 Park resolve themselves. Oh, and England head coach Thomas Tuchel. There\u2019s a pretty big tournament coming up.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Not necessarily to save his job, but there will be pressure on Frank in what is, after 12 years in management, a huge step up for his first big job. Patience may be in short supply on the back of the enormous high of Spurs ending their trophy drought.\nMiller: No need to overthink this: it\u2019s Amorim. That said, Brentford promoting Andrews from set-piece coach to top man in a summer when they\u2019ve lost two of their best players and a third might go is enough to cause a \u2018mechanic regarding a leaky engine\u2019 sharp intake of breath.\nHughes: Amorim. If United are occupying roughly the same position they finished in last season come November, he\u2019ll be gone.\nJames: Farke could be gone very early in the season \u2014 I don\u2019t see Leeds hanging around if they start poorly. There\u2019s potential for Brentford to make a quick change, too. But, realistically, Amorim goes straight in at No 1. It can\u2019t go on like this, Ruben.\nAkinwolere: Amorim. The buffer of arriving mid-season can only last so long. They have spent a lot of money in attacking areas, but there is still a fair amount of work to do. The fans are impatient and rightly so.\nJones: Amorim. Last season, he had the caveat of arriving earlier than he wanted, and Manchester United\u2019s top brass and supporters have shown him a lot of goodwill. In a campaign with no European football, after being backed so heavily, he has to deliver European qualification at least.\nWho will be top and bottom at Christmas?\nKay: I\u2019m struggling with this one. I know Crystal Palace will finish somewhere between 10th and 15th, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where they or anyone else will be at Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t have predicted this time last year that Liverpool would be four points clear at Christmas with a game in hand. It\u2019s a less predictable league right now and it\u2019s more appealing for that.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Arsenal top, Burnley bottom. Burnley\u2019s opening seven games are brutal and threaten to immediately undermine whatever Scott Parker is seeking to build.\nSpiers: Liverpool have the best XI but it may take some time for their signings to gel, so Manchester City will be top. Burnley\u2019s promotion was built on an insanely good defensive record but they\u2019ve lost a couple of key players and \u2014 call me crazy \u2014 but Armando Broja (two goals in 43 Premier League appearances) might not fire them to safety.\nMiller: Arsenal top, Brentford bottom. Gyokeres has quite a \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 vibe to him, so I think Arsenal will be strong in the first half at least. Brentford will have sacked Andrews in around November, but the revival under Sean Dyche won\u2019t have quite started by Christmas.\nHughes: Arsenal (I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll win it) and Leeds, who will have a new manager by that point if this is the case.\nJames: I\u2019ll answer this in reverse order because I feel slightly more confident of that part of the prediction: Burnley. Top? Realistically, it\u2019s one of four: Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Donald Trump\u2019s Chelsea. Liverpool it is.\nAkinwolere: Liverpool have done a lot of their business early and I think Arsenal and Manchester City will take time to find their flow this time around. It\u2019s hard to look past the newly promoted teams at the bottom. But I\u2019ll go for Brentford.\nJones: Liverpool have given themselves plenty of time to bed in new signings, so they should start strongly; I agree with Ayo that Arsenal and Manchester City will need longer to settle. Sunderland have spent a lot, but not on their defence, which could see them fall behind the pack quickly.\nWill any of the three promoted teams survive?\nKay: Yes. It\u2019s been alarming to see the three promoted clubs go straight back down again in the past two seasons, but I\u2019ll be the cheery voice for once and say I can see two or perhaps even all three of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland surviving this time. How \u2014 and at whose expense \u2014 I\u2019m less confident about. Unlike some, I think it\u2019s a dauntingly strong league.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: I do think the Premier League is better with Leeds and Sunderland in it \u2014 and more clubs from the north in general \u2014 so I would love to see it. But it\u2019s such a big gap. The promoted clubs should remember that teams like Brentford, Brighton and Bournemouth began their Premier League journeys playing very pragmatic football to earn their right to stay in the division.\nSpiers: Sunderland have done the best summer business, although they also had the most ground to make up. Leeds probably have the best chance and there are obvious vulnerable prey to catch, including Brentford post-Frank and also Wolves, who have been circling the drain for three years and not done much about it.\nMiller: I would have said Burnley, on the basis of their extraordinary defence last season, but selling James Trafford will kick a hole in that. Sunderland have spent a fair bit, but they need essentially all of those moves to go right for them. Leeds are interesting, but at the time of writing, probably don\u2019t have quite enough. That said, Brentford and Wolves will probably be bad, and I think Fulham could regress, so one of the new lot will probably stay up\u2026 I\u2019m just not going to commit to one! Sorry!\nHughes: No, but Burnley have the best chance if they are able to defend as they did last season and perform generally as uncompromisingly as they did when Dyche was there.\nJames: Leeds and Sunderland have the potential to be more competitive than Ipswich Town, Leicester City and Southampton last season. Leeds on the basis of\u2026 well, just being Leeds and making Elland Road a bit of a fortress. Sunderland, on the face of it, have done some very good transfer business. If I had to pick one\u2026 see my final answer, mate.\nAkinwolere: Sunderland have spent a lot of money, but that often doesn\u2019t equal survival. I\u2019m excited by the signings of Simon Adingra and Xhaka, though. Parker struggled at the helm with both Fulham and Bournemouth last time he managed in the Premier League, as did Farke with Norwich City. With Manchester United and Tottenham having such bad seasons and still surviving last time out, you worry about the financial and quality gap already created by the established teams.\nJones: Leeds and Burnley haven\u2019t added enough quality, and while I would love to believe Sunderland\u2019s record spending could save them, the jump in quality after eight years away feels insurmountable and they haven\u2019t reinforced their defence enough. A Cunha-less Wolves could fall far enough to give one side a lifeline, though.\nThe Manchester City case has still not been resolved. What does that mean for the season?\nKay: I don\u2019t know what it means for the season. I think the repercussions are felt more widely in the sense that people doubt English football\u2019s ability and authority to implement its rules and regulate its clubs. That\u2019s not a new story, but it\u2019s a worrying one because, whether you like the rules or not, the alternative is anarchy.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: The players who may have benefited from some of the earliest alleged breaches have now retired, while the charges begin to feel so drawn-out, so historic, that anyone who continues to bang on about City or scrutinise the club is depicted as being very boring or having a vendetta. But when this thing ever gets resolved, in whichever direction, it will be humongous.\nSpiers: Well, certainly nothing for City, who have spent money in 2025 like it\u2019s going out of fashion. It\u2019ll hang over the season like a Manchester raincloud and, frankly, it\u2019s ludicrous that it\u2019s gone on this long.\nMiller: That we\u2019ll have even more weak banter centred around the number 115, and news stories roughly every three weeks that say \u2018Manchester City\u2019s case could be resolved this week\u2019. I suggest nobody engages with this until it\u2019s actually done: your life will be much more pleasant.\nHughes: Nothing. Life will continue as it has ever since the investigation started.\nJames: More regular questions over the fence from my (lovely and retired) Manchester City-supporting neighbour as to whether I\u2019ve heard anything. The whole saga is tiresome (the case, that is, not talking to my neighbour).\nAkinwolere: That I\u2019ll try my best to show enthusiasm for the subject on the podcast, and Matt Slater will try his best to be enthused by the fact that nothing has changed.\nJones: That we will be answering \u2018The outcome of Manchester City\u2019s case is still under appeal, so what does that mean for the season?\u2019 this time next year \u2014 that is, if it\u2019s even got that far.\nWhich game in the opening weeks will tell us a lot about the season to come?\nKay: There are some big games early on, but Liverpool versus Arsenal on August 31 jumps out. Both will have had a tough-looking away game by then (at Newcastle and Manchester United respectively), so either of them could come out of that game looking like champions-elect or seeming vulnerable, whether that is fair or (as I suspect) not.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Newcastle versus Liverpool in the second week. And, sorry Eddie, I am not available to play up front.\nSpiers: August 24, Everton versus Brighton. Will Hill Dickinson Stadium be a shiny modern fortress for Everton, or was it the tight, thunderously atmospheric Goodison Park that was keeping them afloat all these years? More importantly, will the acoustics at the new stadium reverberate boos like Goodison did?\nMiller: There have been plenty of positive noises coming from those who have watched Manchester United in pre-season, and a front three of Cunha, Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko is potentially quite sexy. But if they get bulldozed by Arsenal on the first weekend\u2026 cue the beleaguered Portuguese man in the hoodie declaring they should just be relegated now.\nHughes: It will be interesting to see how the Club World Cup impacts the performances and results of the teams that competed in it. On one hand, they might be better prepared at the start and tire later. On the other, they might not be as fresh.\nJames: Opening weekend, never mind opening weeks. Manchester United versus Arsenal. Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha \u2014 let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got. As for Arsenal, are they finally going to win the title again, and is Gyokeres the missing piece? (A sentence I never thought I\u2019d type when I watched him score a long overdue first Swansea goal in January 2021).\nAkinwolere: It all starts on the opening weekend for me, and Manchester United versus Arsenal is big for both clubs. Arteta needs to win big this season, as does Amorim. These two need to hit the ground running and both have fanbases that want to see improvement.\nJones: Week five looks fun: Manchester United versus Chelsea will test Champions League ambitions and Wolves versus Leeds hints at whether we can expect a proper relegation battle. Most of all, Arsenal versus Manchester City helps establish if either will emerge as a clear challenger to Liverpool, or if they will just fight each other for second.\nThe thing we\u2019ll all be saying in May is\u2026\nKay: What next for Marcus Rashford/Jack Grealish/Raheem Sterling as he heads back to Manchester United/Manchester City/Chelsea after his loan spell?\nCrafton: The tickets for the World Cup are HOW MUCH?\nSpiers: Will Manchester City\u2019s 115 charges case be resolved this week?\nMiller: I wish I hadn\u2019t fallen for the Arsenal thing, again\u2026\nHughes: Time to put your feet up, Pep.\nAdvertisement\nJames: Fair play to you, Ange Postecoglou, for keeping Leeds up.\nAkinwolere: Chelsea have got their eye on another 10 players to bolster the squad ahead of next season, with more outgoings still to come.\nJones: With Premier League Golden Boot winner Harry Maguire up front, nothing can stop England. It\u2019s coming home.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)"
