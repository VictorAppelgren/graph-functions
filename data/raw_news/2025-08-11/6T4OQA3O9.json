That puts the potential size of the IPO at $990 million.\n\nThe exchange, which also owns the crypto-focused news outlet CoinDesk, initially planned to sell 20.3 million shares for $28 to $31 each. The company was targeting a valuation of up to $4.23 billion, but this new price range would give it a market value of about $4.8 billion.\n\nBullish tried to go public in 2021 through a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Far Peak. However, the two firms called off the plan in late 2022, citing a series of regulatory obstacles.\n\n\u201cBut that was under a different administration,\u201d PYMNTS wrote in June. \u201cWith crypto-friendly President Donald Trump in office, investors have grown much more enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. The administration\u2019s pro-crypto stance has helped bring the price of bitcoin to record levels and inspired other digital asset firms to seek public listings.\u201d\n\nThose companies include Circle, which raised $1.1 billion with its IPO in June, more than twice the stablecoin creator\u2019s expectations.\n\nAnother digital asset company, Figure Technology Solutions, announced last week that it is preparing to go public. The company, which uses blockchain technology for home loans and offers crypto-backed loans, said it filed confidentially for an IPO with the SEC.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance decided last week that \u2014 under a specific set of facts \u2014 liquid staking arrangements, and the \u201cstaking receipt tokens\u201d they generate, do not involve the offer or sale of securities.\n\nThis distinction matters as more than 154 public companies have committed $98.4 billion of their treasury dollars for crypto purchases just this year.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s allowance here applies to a strictly controlled set of assumptions. Beyond that, companies could be in regulatory gray areas.",

      "text": "On Thursday (June 5), Circle Internet Financial, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol \u201cCRCL,\u201d and did so with a bang, tripling in price by the day\u2019s close and making its founder a paper billionaire.\nAfter pricing its initial public offering (IPO) at $31 per share, above the expected range, the stock opened at $69.50 and soared 168% during its first day of trading. Market interest caused the stock to surge so much that it was paused for volatility shortly after being listed. CRCL\u2019s share price ultimately closed at $83.23, pushing the company\u2019s value north of $18 billion.\nThe stablecoin issuer\u2019s direct listing sees it join other firms such as Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S.\nBut Circle\u2019s debut represents more than a successful fundraising event. It marks a broader cultural and economic shift. For years, cryptocurrencies have lived at the margins of institutional finance, oscillating between hype cycles and regulatory crackdowns.\nWith Circle\u2019s entry into the public market, a new chapter looks set to begin.\nWith blue-chip banks underwriting the deal and retail investors clamoring for shares, the traditional finance world appears more open than ever to embracing digital assets.\nOr, at least, the potentially regulated and transparent kind of digital assets.\nRead more: Circle\u2019s IPO Goals Aimed at Becoming Digital Money\u2019s Infrastructure Layer\nCircle and Future of Stablecoins\nCircle issues the world\u2019s second-largest stablecoin, USDC (or USD Coin), which boasts a market capitalization of about $61 billion and plays second fiddle to the more embattled USDT stablecoin issued by Tether.\nOver $25 trillion in transaction volume has been processed using the token, according to the company. While USDC\u2019s scale is still dwarfed by Tether\u2019s USDT, USDC is widely regarded as the more transparent and regulation-friendly option. That reputation has helped Circle build deep relationships with both FinTech upstarts and legacy institutions.\n\u201cOur transformation into being a public company is a significant and powerful milestone \u2014 the world is ready to start upgrading and moving to the internet financial system,\u201d said Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.\n\u201cFrom inception, we have been deeply focused on being trusted, transparent, compliant, ethical and well governed. Holding ourselves to the high standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and regulations further deepens those attributes.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s revenue model largely centers around interest earned on its reserve holdings. In 2024 alone, Circle reported $1.7 billion in revenue \u2014 a number driven by rising interest rates, increased adoption of USDC in global payments, and growing use among institutional clients.\nThe implications of Circle\u2019s IPO are far-reaching. First, it lends unprecedented credibility to the stablecoin market. By successfully listing on the NYSE and attracting underwriters such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup, Circle has sent a strong signal to Wall Street: Stablecoins are not only here to stay, but they are also investable, scalable financial products with real-world utility.\nThis public listing offers increased transparency into Circle\u2019s operations, governance and financials, which may set a new industry standard. Investors now have the ability to scrutinize Circle through quarterly reports, SEC filings and earnings calls \u2014 levels of visibility previously unavailable in the stablecoin space.\nRead more: Crypto Rulemaking Has FinTech Rushing in, TradFi Waiting to See\nInstitutional Confidence\nOne of the key advantages of going public is the enhanced regulatory clarity it affords. By becoming a publicly traded company, Circle must comply with a higher standard of regulatory oversight, including audits, disclosures, and governance practices. This alignment with U.S. financial norms could make Circle a preferred partner for banks, FinTechs and governments exploring stablecoin use cases.\nDespite the fanfare, Circle faces several challenges. First, the stablecoin market is becoming competitive. Those very same blue chip banks that helped take Circle public are themselves considering becoming stablecoin issuers. PYMNTS covered last month how JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BofA), Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.\nThat could be why Circle is hedging its bets by expanding its product offerings. Late last month, it was announced that the Circle Payments Network (CPN) is now live, enabling stablecoin-powered cross-border payments.\nAt the same time, the integration of stablecoins into the mainstream financial system is not without friction. Issues around consumer protection, systemic risk, and monetary policy remain unresolved.\nUltimately, however, Circle\u2019s IPO is not just a financial milestone; it\u2019s a statement of intent. It tells the world that stablecoins have graduated from the experimental phase and are ready to play a central role in the future of money."

The big banks that helped take Circle public are also weighing the idea of issuing stablecoins of their own.

      "text": "Opportunities and risks tend to present themselves in equal measure for CFOs and treasury teams \u2014 and that becomes infinitely more so when it relates to crypto.\nParticularly as the movement of cryptocurrency markets from fringe speculation, bordering on untouchable, to the present day landscape of widening corporate embrace is being hastened along by an unlikely ally: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) corporate finance division.\nIn a recent detailed statement, the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance concluded that under a very specific set of facts liquid staking arrangements, and the \u201cstaking receipt tokens\u201d they produce, do not involve the offer or sale of securities. Securities classification triggers a host of registration, disclosure, and compliance obligations.\nUpwards of 154 public companies have committed $98.4 billion of their treasury dollars for crypto purchases just this year alone. For chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasury managers weighing whether, or how, to put idle crypto assets to work, that distinction over staking from the SEC matters.\n\u201cIt is the Division\u2019s view that participants in Liquid Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act, or fall within one of the Securities Act\u2019s exemptions from registration in connection with these Liquid Staking Activities,\u201d the SEC wrote.\nBut the catch is that the SEC\u2019s green light applies only under a highly controlled set of assumptions. Step outside those parameters, and you may be in regulatory gray, or even red, territory.\nAfter all, for finance teams, and as SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw wrote in a dissenting opinion, a truer reality may be \u201ccaveat liquid staker.\u201d\nRead more: 4 Questions CFOs Need to Ask as Wall Street Embraces Stablecoins\nWhat the SEC Actually Said and Why It Matters to Finance Teams\nLiquid staking has exploded in popularity since Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake and the subsequent unlocking of staked ether in 2023. It offers token holders a way to participate in network staking rewards while maintaining liquidity. Instead of locking up assets for months, participants deposit their tokens with a \u201cliquid staking provider\u201d and receive a newly minted \u201cstaking receipt token\u201d in return.\nThe SEC\u2019s Aug. 5 statement defines two core models, protocol-based providers and third-party custodians or service providers.\nProtocol-based providers are ecosystems where smart contracts automatically handle custody, staking and receipt-token issuance, with no human intermediary; while third-party custodians or service providers represent entities that hold the assets, arrange for staking (directly or via a node operator) and issue the receipt tokens themselves.\nFrom a corporate perspective, the key takeaway is that under either model, if the provider\u2019s role is strictly \u201cadministrative or ministerial\u201d and not managerial, the arrangement likely falls outside the definition of a security.\nStill, for CFOs, that translates to heightened due diligence: you can\u2019t just take a provider\u2019s word that their service is \u201ccompliant with the SEC\u2019s view.\u201d You need independent verification of their operational model against the Division\u2019s fact pattern. Risk-focused assessments, for example, can include things like code audit reviews, capital adequacy analysis, operational resilience, regulatory posture, custody model details, insurance layers (e.g., to cover loss from bugs or hacks) and historical uptime.\nUltimately, any highly interconnected financial infrastructure can carry compounding risks. Unlike traditional assets, crypto systems, once thought to be relatively siloed, are increasingly webbed via staking aggregators, synthetic token markets, cross-chain bridges and lending desks. A shock to one node could propagate across counterparties, protocols and liquidity pools, impacting treasury liquidity just as it might in legacy systems.\nSee also: Stablecoin Sandwiches? Here\u2019s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon\nSetting the Table for Strategic Experimentation\nAt its essence, liquid staking permits crypto holders to deposit their tokens (for example, Ethereum) with a staking provider. In return, they receive synthetic derivatives, often ERC-20 tokens, that represent a claim on the staked assets plus accrued rewards.\nUsers continue earning staking yields while retaining market exposure via the synthetic variant. In practical terms, liquid staking combines two traditionally opposed functions: earning staking rewards (normally requiring lockups) and maintaining liquidity for trading, lending or other corporate purposes.\nFor CFOs and treasurers, liquid staking need not be a leap of faith. It can be a calibrated experiment.\n\u201cEthereum isn\u2019t a static asset. It\u2019s programmable infrastructure,\u201d Dave Merin, co-founder and CEO of The Ether Machine, told PYMNTS. \u201cEthereum is the largest proof-of-stake network by a wide margin. That scale means more yield opportunities, a broader security moat, and a stronger economic flywheel.\u201d\n\u201cWe think we can generate 2x the yield of an ETF, conservatively,\u201d Merin added. \u201cAnd when you layer on things like restaking or engaging in DeFi, we think we can deliver a vastly superior product. Our team knows these protocols intimately. We\u2019re not guessing, we\u2019re building the infrastructure that others will later follow.\u201d"

The offering is subject to market and other conditions, as well as the completion of the SEC\u2019s review process,\u201d the company said in a news release.\nBloomberg News had reported in 2023 that the company was preparing for an IPO after its lending division recorded a record $900 million in quarterly volume.\nThe company\u2019s new IPO plans are happening amid a rebound in digital asset lending, as PYMNTS reported last month.\nA July 26 report on the topic by the Financial Times (FT) points to the example of San Francisco lender Divine Research, which had made roughly 30,000 unbacked short-term loans since December, teaming with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman\u2019s iris-scanning company World to identify borrowers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re loaning to average folks like high school teachers, fruit vendors \u2026 basically anyone with access to the internet can get access to our funds,\u201d Divine\u2019s founder Diego Estevez said in an interview with the FT. \u201cThis is microfinance on steroids.\u201d\nThat report added that Divine offers loans of under $1,000 worth of Circle\u2019s stablecoin USDC to cash-strapped customers, most of whom are underserved by \u201ctraditional institutions,\u201d as the company puts it.\nWriting about the crypto lending space early this summer, PYMNTS pointed to an April report from data center infrastructure and digital assets company Galaxy, which estimated that the crypto lending market, including crypto collateral debt, had reached $36.5 billion by the end of last year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s down significantly from a peak of more than $64.4 billion in 2021, as several lenders had gone out of business,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cBut in the current environment, where the runway is being built via legislation and regulatory rollbacks to bring cryptos more fully into banking, the lending activity is poised to accelerate.\u201d\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in March issued a letter that revoked earlier guidelines on crypto and paved a path for banks and lenders to permit digital holdings to be part of secured lending activity."

      "text": "The operator of the regulated cryptocurrency trading platform Bullish exchange and the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Far Peak Acquisition said in a Thursday (Dec. 22) press release that they have mutually agreed to terminate their proposed business combination.\n\u201cOur quest to become a public company is taking longer than expected, but we respect the SEC\u2019s [Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s] ongoing work to lay new digital asset frameworks and clarify industry-specific disclosure and accounting complexities,\u201d Bullish Chairman and CEO Brendan Blumer said in the release.\nAfter 18 months of work since announcing their business combination agreement in July 2021, the firms determined that they would be unable to have Bullish\u2019s registration statement on Form F-4 declared effective in time for Far Peak to have its shareholders vote on the proposed business combination before Dec. 31, the date on which they had agreed that both companies could terminate the agreement if it hadn\u2019t been consummated, according to the press release.\n\u201cWe are disappointed that we were unable to present the Bullish transaction to our Far Peak shareholders,\u201d Far Peak Chairman and CEO Thomas Farley said in the release. \u201cBullish\u2019s accomplishments since its launch have lived up to our expectations, and their daily trading volumes highlight their remarkable growth.\u201d\nBullish exchange is available in 50 jurisdictions, works within regulatory compliance frameworks and gives institutional and retail traders access to deep liquidity and low-cost transactions, according to the press release.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the dedicated team of Bullish employees and advisers who have devoted countless hours to ensure Bullish operates with the highest standards of transparency and responsibility,\u201d Blumer said. \u201cThis work has formed the operating foundation required to service our customers in the best and safest possible way.\u201d\nPYMNTS research has found that pace of SPAC deals involving FinTech companies has slowed to the low single digits in most verticals.\nAs PYMNTS reported Monday (Dec. 19), SPACs, facing increased regulatory scrutiny, are pressured to rein in optimistic forecasts that used to lure investors. Not only that, but increased scrutiny leads to higher operating costs, which leads to lower margins, and thus, lower returns for the investors."

  "argos_summary": "Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has increased its initial public offering (IPO) size, now planning to offer 30 million shares at $32 to $33 each, potentially raising $990 million and valuing the company at approximately $4.8 billion. This follows a previous attempt to go public via a merger with SPAC Far Peak, which was halted due to regulatory challenges. The IPO comes amid a growing interest in cryptocurrency, particularly after Circle's successful IPO, which raised $1.1 billion and significantly boosted the credibility of stablecoins in the financial market.",
