  "title": "New Mini SSD Standard Offers PCIe Speeds in MicroSD-Like Form Factor",
  "description": "IP68 water and dust proofing makes this drive super durable, too.",
  "content": "Biwin, a Chinese SSD manufacturer, has introduced a new storage device form factor called a Mini SSD. These tiny storage drives are more akin in size to a microSD card, measuring just 15 millimeters by 17 millimeters, but offer capacities and performance much more familiar to NVMe SSDs. There aren't many devices that can use these yet, but the first is the new GPD Win 5 handheld gaming device.\n\nIf you have a small device and want additional storage space, your conventional options are microSD cards or 2230 M.2 SSDs. The former are tiny, but their performance and storage capacities aren't that great, while the latter are much faster but bigger and require a larger interface, too. The Mini SSD is a way to combine the benefits of both these standards into a single, durable design.\n\nBiwin's Mini SSD design is available in capacities up to 2TB, with sustained read/write speeds of 3,700 MBps and 3,400 MBps, respectively. It uses the PCIe 4 x2 interface (not quite the latest PCIe 5) and NVMe 1.4 protocol. Built around 3D TLC NAND, it leverages a bespoke slot similar to the smartphone SIM tray. As VideoCardz explains, you use a pin to eject the tray, making it possible to swap different drives in and out.\n\nIf accurate, these drives would perform around three times faster than even the quickest microSD cards. They're also entirely dust-proof and waterproof and durable against drops, which could make them particularly useful in more rugged portable laptops, tablets, and gaming systems. They could also be used in more industrial and enterprise settings, where extreme environments can be more common.\n\nHow about a fully waterproof Steam Deck? Gaming in the bath sounds sublime.\n\nBiwin hasn't announced retail pricing or availability of these new drives just yet, but the GPD Win 5 and OneXPlayer Super X tablet will use them, which means the drives will make it to market in the near future.\n\nInterested in a more traditional SSD? Here are the best deals we can find in August.",

      "text": "GPD WIN 5 \u2013 Everything We Know So Far\nFollowing our initial scoop last week, the floodgates have opened with official information on the GPD WIN 5. The details confirm what many suspected: this device is not just an incremental update but a complete redefinition of what a portable gaming PC can be. Get ready for a deep dive into the specifications of this powerhouse.\nGPD WIN 5 Teaser Video\n[UPDATE 14th August 2025]\nWe now have a lot more official information on the forthcoming GPD WIN 5 which we have added below.\nThe GPD WIN 5 is being introduced as the world\u2019s most powerful handheld game console, built upon a foundation of several industry-first technologies. It stands alone as the only handheld powered by the new AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor. This raw power can be paired with an unprecedented amount of memory and storage, offering configurations with up to 128GB of LPDDR5x 8000MT/s RAM and a 4TB M.2 NVMe SSD.\nThe innovation continues with several unique hardware features. The GPD WIN 5 is the first handheld to incorporate a capacitive joystick designed for esports-level first-person shooters, promising zero dead zone, zero drift, and pixel-level aiming correction. It also debuts Hall effect triggers that support dual-mode switching between long and short thread pulls, providing 0.1mm trigger accuracy and a response delay of less than 0.1ms to cover all gaming scenarios. Furthermore, its unique 80Wh external removable battery, weighing just 565 grams, is governed by GPD\u2019s FlexPower technology, allowing seamless switching between a backpack-mounted system and a fully detachable, cable-free mode.\nGPD WIN 5 vs. Steam Deck: A Clear Advantage\nWhen placed side-by-side with the Steam Deck, the GPD WIN 5 showcases clear advantages in both portability and power. Despite being the largest handheld in GPD\u2019s x86 lineup, its overall footprint is still significantly smaller and more compact than Valve\u2019s device, making it easier to transport and handle.\nThe most dramatic difference, however, lies in performance. The GPD WIN 5 is engineered to be the most powerful handheld on the market, with a processor and graphics architecture that leaves current-generation devices far behind. Its CPU and GPU performance is claimed to be an incredible five times that of the Steam Deck\u2019s custom APU. Combined with software like Bazzite, the GPD WIN 5 has the potential to become the most powerful Steam game console ever created.\nNext-Generation Processing and Graphics\nThe core of the WIN 5 is the cutting-edge AMD Ryzen\u2122 AI Max+ 395 processor. Built on a 16-core ZEN 5 architecture using chiplet technology, its multi-core performance is so potent that it reportedly surpasses the benchmark scores of a 219W Intel Core i9 14900 desktop processor. This powerful CPU is integrated with a new XDNA 2 NPU for AI tasks and the Radeon 8060S GPU.\nThe AMD Radeon 8060S integrated graphics are built on the latest RDNA 3.5 architecture, featuring 40 Compute Units (2560 SUs), a 2.9GHz acceleration frequency, and support for FSR 3.1. Its performance is comparable to a discrete NVIDIA RTX 4060 mobile graphics card, enabling high-frame-rate gameplay in demanding AAA titles. This leap in performance is thanks to architectural improvements in the RDNA 3.5 design, a more efficient 256-bit quad-channel memory interface, and the power efficiency of TSMC\u2019s 4nm process. In tests, the 8060S showed a 35% higher frame rate in \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d than the previous-generation 890M, for only an 18% increase in power consumption.\nMassive Memory for Gaming and AI\nThe GPD WIN 5 employs a unified memory architecture with up to 128GB of LPDDR5x 8000MT/s RAM. This design creates a shared memory pool that the CPU, GPU, and NPU can access directly, eliminating the data migration bottlenecks found in traditional architectures and significantly reducing latency. This allows an astonishing 96GB of system RAM to be allocated as video memory (VRAM), completely removing video memory as a performance concern for any game or professional creative application like 8K video rendering.\nThis massive memory pool also turns the GPD WIN 5 into a portable AI powerhouse. The processor\u2019s 126 TOPS of computing power, combined with the vast memory, allows the device to smoothly run large language models with up to 70 billion parameters (at Q8 precision). In testing, the device achieved an inference speed of over 10 tokens/s on a massive 235 billion parameter model, creating a local supercomputing centre in the palm of your hand.\nA Display Built for Victory\nAll this power is channelled into a stunning 7-inch gaming screen. It features a native landscape orientation to prevent screen tearing issues and boasts a high refresh rate of 120Hz for a silky-smooth gaming experience. The display supports AMD FreeSync\u2122 Premium for tear-free, low-latency visuals and has a swift 6ms response time. A full 100% sRGB colour gamut ensures that games are presented with a vibrant, rich, and immersive colour palette.\nAdvanced Cooling for Peak Performance\nTo ensure the high-end components can perform without thermal throttling, GPD has implemented its new \u201cFrostwind Cooling\u201d architecture. This system is a defiant challenge to thermodynamics, designed to truly tame the flagship hardware.\nThe core of the system is a pair of second-generation PC-grade large turbo fans, featuring aerospace-grade titanium-aluminum alloy blades. These fans increase wind pressure by 500% while maintaining a noise level under 30dB(A). These are paired with a nano-scale matrix of four heat pipes, built with a superconducting copper-based structure that has a thermal conductivity exceeding 8,000W/(m\u22c5K). This allows the system to handle instantaneous heat shocks of up to 120W with minimal temperature fluctuation. The design is completed by a large-displacement side-blowing air duct, which increases airflow efficiency to 92.4% and reduces system pressure loss by 40%.\nRevolutionary Storage Solutions\nThe GPD WIN 5 provides ample high-speed storage, starting with an onboard M.2 2280 slot that supports single-sided PCIe Gen4 SSDs, offered in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB models with no capacity limit. A standard microSD card reader is also included, supporting speeds up to 160MB/s.\nIn a groundbreaking move, the WIN 5 is the first digital product in the world to integrate a Mini SSD card slot. This new storage format, developed by BIWIN, is a technological revolution. The Mini SSD card measures just 15\u00d717mm\u2014about half the size of a standard microSD card\u2014but its performance is on par with a PC SSD.\nUsing a PCIe Gen4x1 interface, the Mini SSD offers sequential read and write speeds of 1600MB/s, which is five times faster than high-speed SDXC cards. This allows the Mini SSD to be used as a high-performance secondary disk, a dedicated drive for an alternative OS like SteamOS, or even as the primary boot disk for the entire system, offering unparalleled storage flexibility in a handheld device.\nWe\u2019re keen to hear your opinion on this gaming beast. Is the GPD WIN 5 the future of portable gaming? What are your thoughts on the external battery? Do you think GPD will release newer models based on their existing range?

To manage the immense power within, GPD has integrated a \u201cPC-level\u201d thermal solution with dual fans and a large vapor chamber, essential for cooling the APU\u2019s potential 100W output. Notably, this model foregoes the physical keyboard seen in previous generations, a deliberate choice to maximize resources for what is purely a high-performance compact gaming PC. The device itself weighs 820 grams, increasing to 1190 grams with its battery attached.\nThe Dawn of Desktop-Caliber Mobile Gaming\nThe true heart of the GPD WIN 5 is AMD\u2019s groundbreaking \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU, a chip that catapults integrated graphics into a new stratosphere. This portable gaming computer will be available in two variants. The premier model features the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, a behemoth with 16 Zen 5 cores and 32 threads, paired with a Radeon 8060S GPU containing 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units. A second version will house the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385, with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a 32 CU Radeon 8050S GPU.\nThe performance uplift is staggering. Compared to the previous generation\u2019s top-tier Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, the new Radeon 8060S is reported to be over 50% faster at the same wattage. Incredibly, its performance is on par with a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU, making this the first mobile gaming PC to offer truly high-end, no-compromise AAA gaming without an eGPU.\nNext-Generation Memory and Storage\nTo keep the monstrous APU supplied with data, the GPD WIN 5 utilizes incredibly fast memory and storage.

This provides the massive bandwidth necessary for the Strix Halo chip to flex its full graphical muscle. For storage, users get a primary M.2 2280 slot with a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, supporting NVMe SSDs of up to 4TB for near-instantaneous game loads.\nGPD WIN 4 2025 Gaming Handheld PC\nA Hub of Connectivity\nThe GPD WIN 5 boasts a generous selection of I/O ports that would be respectable on a full-sized laptop. The top of the unit houses a 40Gbps USB4 port, a secondary USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a dedicated 180W DC power input. The bottom of the device features a much-appreciated USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, a microSD card slot for simple storage expansion, and a standard 3.5mm audio jack, providing comprehensive connectivity for all your peripherals.\nPrecision Controls for Competitive Play\nGPD has equipped the WIN 5 with a suite of high-end controls suitable for serious gaming. It features drift-free Hall effect joysticks and analog triggers, ensuring durability and accuracy. Two programmable back paddles offer a competitive edge, while navigation of the Windows OS is simplified by a built-in optical finger mouse. A fingerprint reader is integrated into the power button for security, and immersion is heightened by dual haptic motors and a 6-axis gyroscope, making this a truly premium handheld gaming computer.\nThe Unconventional External Battery\nIn a radical departure from convention, the GPD WIN 5 has no internal battery. Power on the move is provided by a detachable 80Wh \u201cbackpack\u201d battery, which will be sold both separately and in bundles. This modular design allows the core unit to be significantly lighter for those who play primarily while connected to its 180W power adapter. While this offers new flexibility, it also means that to use the device as a truly portable system, the external battery is an essential purchase.\nThe Desktop Transformation Dock\nAn optional docking station is planned to effortlessly convert the WIN 5 into a full desktop setup. This compact stand dramatically expands the I/O, offering an HDMI 2.1 output, a DisplayPort 1.4a connection, and a 2.5G Ethernet port for ultra-fast networking. The dock also adds three more USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports and a dedicated USB-C port for data, with power pass-through to run the entire setup.\nThe New Handheld Benchmark\nThe GPD WIN 5 is poised to become the new benchmark against which all other handhelds are measured. Its combination of a desktop-class APU, a high-refresh-rate display, and a comprehensive feature set makes it the most powerful handheld gaming PC announced to date. The modular battery system is a bold innovation that prioritizes performance and flexibility.\n7 cm more than the Win 4 it is still compact, I read a lot of comments on the small size of the screen, but that is the whole point of a portable console otherwise it is a micro PC that you need, I have a Win4 and it is precisely its small size compared to the competition which guided my choice, the fact that the battery of the Win 5 will be removable is a good choice with 2 batteries we will be able to play non stop being connected to the wire, the only problem is the ergonomics the battery seems quite bulky and heavy and the charger quite bulky but you can\u2019t have everything\nWe updated the blog with the dimensions compared with the Steam Deck, its a bit larger than the Win 4 but still definitely portable.\nthey should go to the design like legion go 2 z2 extreme 8.8 will be amazing. i dont like small screen\nPerhaps we will see a larger screen model after the Win 5.\nhonestly everyone says they want bigger screens until they actually get one like me and get to feel how bulky and non portable the devices start to become once you go over 8inchs in display size!!! My onexplayer x1 is 11 inchs just about and they call it a portable handheld but i think a more appropriate classification would be a tablet or 3in1 or even ultra portable laptop. Its far to big and heavy to hold comfortably without leaning it on something which isnt a huge deal for some but if getting a handheld most the time portability is going to be the main important thing and a big screen just goes against the grain on that idea.\nYeah for a gaming handheld the size is fine. There will no doubt be a GPD WIN MAX 3 or similar named device with a 10\u2033 screen if you want to play games on something larger.\nI can\u2019t wait for this I was going to upgrade my ally for the xbox ally but the performance difference doesn\u2019t warrant the cost this gpd win 5 sounds like the one for me\nWe cant wait etiher, there is going to be fights in the office who gets their hands on it first \ud83d\ude42\nAs someone who was considering a Z2 Extreme handheld the win 5 is now my preferred option. Just wondering when can I buy one in Australia\nOnce we get a final price for the GPD WIN 5 we will be able to take pre-orders. Keep an eye on our blog here for more news.\nI for one think that\u2019s an excellent idea and not having a battery in there good job you guys and the thing just looks cool I would definitely like to know as soon as I could put an order in it\u2019s gonna be expensive, but hopefully I can get one.\nNo details on the prices yet, as soon as we know we will be able to take pre-orders. Hopefully not too long a wait!"
