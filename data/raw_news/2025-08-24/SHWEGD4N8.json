  "description": "The Dallas Mavericks are reportedly preparing to make an expensive decision.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have been one of the most interesting teams to monitor over the last six months. First, they traded Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers back at the NBA trade deadline. Then, they won the draft lottery. To put the cherry on top, they nabbed Duke phenom Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nSo, yeah: things have been pretty fluid in Dallas, and the Mavericks will unquestionably be one of the most intriguing clubs to follow next season.\n\nMore news: Milwaukee Bucks Connected to Big Trade With Boston Celtics\n\nDallas' core is rather unique, as aging veterans Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving represent its two best players. However, the Mavs also boast some compelling role players, and P.J. Washington is one of them.\n\nWashington has emerged as a terrific glue guy since being acquired by the Mavericks from the Charlotte Hornets midway through the 2023-24 campaign, and apparently, he is on his way to getting paid.\n\nNBA insider Marc Stein has revealed that Dallas will \"likely\" extend Washington, who becomes eligible for a four-year, $90 million contract this Friday.\n\nYou would think Washington would be a rather awkward fit for the Mavericks now that Flagg is in tow. After all, both players are small forwards. However, Dallas is planning on using Flagg as a point guard, which should allow the Mavs to comfortably keep the versatile Washington on the roster.\n\nWashington played in 57 games this past season, averaging 14.7 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.1 blocks and 1.1 steals over 32.2 minutes a night on 45.3/38.1/72.2 shooting splits.\n\nMore news: Report: Celtics Have 2 Potential Trade Partners Emerging for Major Deal\n\nCapable of guarding multiple positions defensively, the 27-year-old was always a decent role players in Charlotte, but was never able to realize his full potential until he joined a contending Mavericks team two seasons ago.\n\nWashington played a pivotal role in Dallas' run to the NBA Finals in 2024, posting 13 points and 6.6 rebounds per game during the playoffs. He may not be the most efficient scorer in the world, but his ability to space the floor definitely pays dividends for the Mavs' offense.\n\nFor more on the Dallas Mavericks and general NBA news, head on over to Newsweek Sports.",

There were 74 such extensions across six seasons in the previous labor deal, per Marks' math, but 44 of those 74 extensions took place during the final two seasons of that deal (2021-22 and 2022-23).\nSo make it 87 veteran extensions over the past half-decade.\nSee? Counterintuitive as it sounds: Free agency, as one wise veteran agent so often likes to remind me, is no longer a desired status. Which is pretty wild to say out loud.\nHowever \u2026"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Boston Celtics have apparently been trying to rehome Anfernee Simons ever since they acquired him in the trade that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers earlier this offseason. And now, they could be closing in on a deal.\nSam Amico of Hoopswire has reported that both the Denver Nuggets and Philadelphia 76ers have expressed interest in a trade for Simons, who has one year remaining on his contract and is slated to earn $27.7 million in 2025-26.\nMore news: Lakers Icon Magic Johnson Sends Touching Kobe Bryant Message\nHowever, the Celtics are not guaranteed to move Simons. Amico notes that Boston is not \"opposed to the idea of keeping Simons,\" who averaged 19.3 points, 4.8 assists and 2.7 rebounds over 32.7 minutes per game on 42.6/36.3/90.2 splits last season.\nThe C's have had quite the tumultuous offseason. Due to salary cap constraints, the Celtics were forced to trade both Kristaps Porzingis and Holiday this summer, and they have also allowed Al Horford and Luke Kornet to walk in free agency.\nJayson Tatum's Achilles injury has also certainly played a role in Boston's decision-making process over the last couple of months. The C's certainly won't be contending for a championship with Tatum on the shelf next season, so getting their finances in order has been priority No. 1 for the Celtics, especially considering that a new ownership group has purchased the franchise.\nSimons is just 25 years old and could potentially become a part of Boston's future depending on how he plays this coming campaign (if the C's keep him for that long). He did average over 20 points per game in back-to-back seasons in 2022-23 and 2023-24, so he clearly has microwave scoring ability.\nMore news: Insider Exposes Glaring Concern for Kevin Durant, Rockets\nThat being said, the former first-round pick is not the greatest defender in the world, and his efficiency leaves a lot to be desired.\nStill, the Celtics are known for transforming the careers of players, much like they did with Derrick White. Perhaps they can do the same for Simons.\nFor more on the Boston Celtics and general NBA news, head on over to Newsweek Sports.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Schmidt is a sportswriter who covers NFL, MLB, NBA and college football and basketball.

Three straight first-round playoff exits have taken a whole lot of the shine off the Bucks following their 2021 championship victory, and now, they are in flux.\nHowever, Milwaukee added Myles Turner in free agency, giving the Bucks a rather fearsome defensive duo along with Giannis Antetokounmpo.
