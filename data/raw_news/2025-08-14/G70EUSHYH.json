  "description": "Why the smartest creators are building studios",
  "content": "We\u2019re entering the era of the creator-led studio. It\u2019s already happening. Creators are turning themselves into multi-dimensional entertainment businesses. They\u2019re not just building content pipelines; they\u2019re building worlds, structuring teams, developing IP, launching products, and curating and hosting IRL experiences. They\u2019re weaving content, community, and commerce into something bigger with the mindset of founders and the ambition of studio executives. Not in the traditional sense\u2026not high rises, backlots, or broadcast slots, but in a way that\u2019s native to the internet and modern-day technologies: fast-moving, audience-first, built around trust and consistency.\n\nMoreover, the creators who scale aren\u2019t just building content engines; they\u2019re building emotional frameworks. Call it voice, POV, or DNA, it\u2019s what everything else ladders up to. And at the very bleeding edge, those doing it the best are expanding those frameworks beyond content into commerce, community, courses, products, and live experiences. They are building full-stack media businesses, looking to own the audience, the formats, and the infrastructure. Creators who have the desire to go after this opportunity are no longer solo acts. They\u2019re founders. They\u2019re hiring. Building teams. Thinking in pipelines, product-market fit, and distribution economics. They\u2019re not chasing virality, they are building staying power, and it\u2019s working. I explored this previously, when I discussed the shift from creator to entrepreneur.\n\nNow, it\u2019s evolving again, from entrepreneur to studio builder. One important callout, though. This isn\u2019t for every creator and isn\u2019t to diminish the incredible value to come from remaining small and mighty. There will be a thriving segment of creators who stick to what they\u2019re doing. However, I believe that the biggest share of audience and money will be held in the relatively few who become studio builders 2. Trust is becoming the most valuable signal As AI floods platforms with synthetic content, trust becomes the premium.\n\nAs Doug Shapiro put it: \u201cTrust is the new oil.\u201d Audiences won\u2019t just want content; they\u2019ll want curation, context, and a point of view. The creators who earn and sustain that trust won\u2019t just be personalities. They\u2019ll be institutions. We\u2019re now in an era where consistency is currency. People want formats they can return to. They want creators they can rely on. They want editorial judgment, recurring presence, and recognizable rhythms.\n\nThat\u2019s not just a creative instinct; it\u2019s reinforced by platform algorithms and audience psychology. Recurring formats increase watch time, retention, and subscriber loyalty. When content appears reliably and feels familiar, audiences are more likely to form habits around it. Creators who think in seasons, franchises, and formats won\u2019t just gain attention, they\u2019ll earn mindshare. The traditional media and advertising worlds, in their obsession with hyperperformance, data precision, and efficiency, left behind something essential: emotional connection. In that creative and cultural vacuum, creators stepped in. Not with metrics, but with meaning.\n\nCreators are value driven. They\u2019re plugged into the nuances of pop culture. And they\u2019re intimately connected to their communities through access, respect, and trust. They didn\u2019t just inherit the audience. They earned it. Not just as content creators, but creative directors of a new era. Bringing the kind of relevance, emotion, and resonance that modern culture wants. We\u2019re still in the early stages of this movement. But this shift is real. The creator economy isn\u2019t just growing faster, it\u2019s growing up.",

      "text": "The New Creator Economy & Why You Should Care\nIn the 7 years since we launched Whalar there has been an unbelievable level of transformation in 'Influencer Marketing'.\nBack then only 15% of the creators we worked with were full time, for the other 85% content creation was a side hustle and all of them were typically on one platform.\nThe stats couldn't be more different now:\nIt's a mind blowing rate of growth for just 7 years.\nHOWEVER, what is probably not as clear (and I say since the scale and speed of what's already happening wasn't even fully clear to me) is that there is an even more significant transformation taking place and it will likely be one of the most prominent characteristics of the next phase of our industry.\nCREATORS ARE THE NEXT BIG WAVE OF ENTREPRENEURS, OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF ECONOMIES AND EVEN OF HUGE CATEGORY DISRUPTING COMPANIES.\nIn a way it's totally obvious!\nIt's emblematic of why the industry is now called the 'Creator Economy'.\nYou've very likely come across the incredible examples set by the likes of Mr Beast with Feastables & Beast Burger or Logan Paul and KSI with Prime Energy Drink or Emma Chamberlain with Chamberlain Coffee, who've all built incredible businesses through their communities.\nBUT, what has blown me away is the scale of what's happening the next proverbial next step down the ladder.\nBubbling away below the surface is an ocean full of creators who have been inspired and empowered to start building their own businesses, matched with a growing ecosystem of professionals, companies and financing that's helping enable creators more than ever before.\nIt's a theme that was well captured at a talk during SXSW by my good friends Harley Finkelstein and Colin Rosenblum & Samir Chaudry which you can watch here.\nMy bet, if I come to write a follow up post in another 7 years time I'll be saying that the majority of creators we now work with have companies that are employing lots of people and are seen as an essential part of driving the economy.\nAnd if reading this as a non-creator what should your take away be? Aside from just an understanding of this exciting transformation, know that it's also representative of countless job opportunities to bring your experience to the table to support creators AND it's a whole new ecosystem of opportunities and challenges for businesses to be created to support creators AND it's also going to provide exciting new opportunities for existing brands to collaborate with creators in new and really significant ways.\nTo give a taste for what we are seeing at Whalar, below I'm sharing just 10 examples to demonstrate variety from the over 100 brilliant suggestions that came to me when I asked our team. This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it meant to reflect an opinion on a top 10, there were so so so many that were all worthy of being included.\nWhen you check these 10 out be sure to take in the level of creativity, the level of quality and the level of professionalism that has gone into building these creator first businesses made possible because of their unique communities.\n10 Example Creator Led Businesses\n(1) GOOD GOOD GOLF\nFrom the age of nine Garrett Clark had his own YouTube channel and dreams of becoming a successful YouTuber. As an accomplished junior golfer he started filming and uploading trickshots to Instagram in 2016. In 2019, following his freshman year, he started uploading longer form golf videos to YouTube and had 150k subscribers and sponsorship deals coming in. Fast forward to the summer of 2020 and Garrett had dropped out of college and founded Good Good Golf along with five, soon to be six, close friends.\nAlmost three years later and Good Good is a behemoth;\n> The YouTube Channel has over 1m subscribers, over 238m views on over 300 videos which are on average 40 minutes long but can go for more than 2 hours!\n> The Good Good Golf clothing and apparel brand is HUGE.\n> They have just done a huge partnership deal with Callaway spanning not just a content partnership but also co-branded & limited edition equipment.\n> And they have started being recognised and embraced by the traditional golf bodies, such as the DP World Tour and are considered to be a positive force that's helping redefine golf entertainment.\n(2) CASSEY HO\nCassey Ho\u2019s passion for fitness and nutrition began as a teenager when she discovered pilates. In 2009, at this point a certified fitness instructor, Cassey launched her YouTube channel and website Blogilates to share her workouts with a larger audience. What started as a YouTube channel eventually transformed into an entire brand with a Blogilates fitness app and products like water bottles, dumbbells, and protein powder all being sold at Target.\nRecommended by LinkedIn\nFollowing Blogilates\u2019 success, Cassey launched another brand in 2016 called POPFLEX, which offers women\u2019s fitness apparel; she designs 95% of the products. Over the nearly 15 years since starting Blogilates, Cassey has leveraged her social media success to amass a global following and continues to remain highly relevant in the health and wellness industry in which she aspires to become the 'number 1 in fit'.\n(3) ALI ABDAAL\nAli Abdaal is a YouTuber and entrepreneur known for his content around productivity, education, tech, and personal development. In 2017, after graduating from medical school, he began working as a doctor and simultaneously started his YouTube channel. Ali\u2019s early videos focused on his experiences in the medical field, but his channel really took off once he began sharing productivity and study tips and tricks. This led Ali to quit his job as a doctor, instead focusing full time on content creation.\nToday Ali's YouTube channel has 4m subscribers, but more than that he's completely diversified his business across all different channels as well as formats. From his podcast, to his newsletter to courses he sells via Skillshare (one of which has been taken by 98,320 paying students) and he's now writing a book. His website is the heart of the operation and Ali is very transparent in taking his audience on the journey with him. Here you can watch a video where he explains why and what the 12 full time staff he has do and here is a video where he explains the 10+ different revenue streams that saw his business generate c. $5m last year alone.\n(4) CORRIDOR DIGITAL\nFounded in 2010 by Sam Gorski and Niko Pueringer, Corridor Digital is a production studio and YouTube channel known for high quality short films, VFX, and video game-related content. Initially begun as a hobby, the duo\u2019s technical expertise and unique style often inspired by video gaming quickly gained them a dedicated YouTube following with Corridor hosting all of their completed video content, while CorridorCrew offers a BTS look into the making of their content. The two channels have amassed a combined 16.5 million+ subscribers and 3.3 billion+ views.\nThrough their Corridor Digital Platform they have a paid membership to join and operates by the \u201cGreenlight\u201d system. This means every subscriber receives points based on their subscription type which can be used towards voting for an idea or project that they\u2019d like to see \u201cgreenlit\u201d into a longer form piece of content, such as a show or series, of which 9 have been done so far.\n(5) DAVID SUH\nDuring lockdown in 2020, David Suh went viral for his captivating portraits and empowering content, educating his followers on how to confidently pose for a photo. He hasn\u2019t slowed down since.\nNow, with a TikTok audience of over 4.4 million, David is a full-time content creator, portrait photographer, and he\u2019s been able to monetize his educational content, launching an extremely successful paid online course in 2022 called \u201cHow to be Photogenic in 30 Days.\u201d\nEven more recently, he had the exciting opportunity to photograph Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, for his new profile picture. In just a few years, David\u2019s genuine kindness and passion for photography has transformed into a lucrative business, inspiring millions and becoming one of the most sought-after photographers in the industry.\n(6) MARK ROBER\nMark Rober\u2019s love for science and technology has been a constant in his life. After college, he worked for NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and it was also around this time that he began to create original video content. Mark posted his first YouTube video in 2011 which received 1.5m views in ONE day and his following ballooned from that point on. But, Mark\u2019s impact extends far beyond YouTube.\nMark has started multiple ventures and is even teaming up with Jimmy Kimmel to develop and star in an engineering-themed television show for the Discovery Channel. Most recently, Mark founded CrunchLabs, a self-described \u201cWilly Wonka-style factory of creativity\u201d where he and his team create YouTube videos and children\u2019s engineering toys known as Build Boxes. The CrunchLabs team sold out five months-worth of Build Box inventory in less than a week!\nAnd as if that all wasn't enough, Mark partnered with Mr Beast to launch the charity TeamSeas through which over $30m has been raised and over 33m pounds of trash has been removed from the oceans.\n(7) JAMIE GENEVIEVE\nIn 2013, Jamie Genevieve was working at a department store makeup counter when she began posting makeup tutorial videos to her social channels. Jamie\u2019s popularity skyrocketed after a Halloween makeup tutorial she posted went viral, and customers began to visit her counter IRL asking for makeovers that mirrored the look and style they saw on her Instagram, an early indicator of her influence.\nIn 2020, amidst a global pandemic, she launched her own makeup brand \u2013 VIEVE \u2013 which offers a wide range of products that are cruelty-free, 100% vegan, and made for a variety of skin tones. The brand\u2019s success was evident with the release of Jamie\u2019s eyeshadow palette selling out in just one day. In 2022, VIEVE announced a $6.2 million Series A, followed by Jamie\u2019s sale of a minority stake in the brand for $6.7 million later that year.\n(8) MOLLY BAZ\nMolly Baz has come a long way since her early days as a line cook in New York City. Today, she is a successful chef, New York Times Bestselling author, and popular Instagram personality. Prior to publishing her first cookbook in 2021, Molly leveraged her recognizability as a senior food editor at Bon App\u00e9tit to launch a $5/month subscription called \u201cRecipe Club.\u201d Fast forward to 2023 and in addition to her Recipe Club, she now has a white-labeled affiliate shop for cookware, her own merch store, and she co-created a wine company.\nIn addition to her current projects, Molly\u2019s second cookbook More Is More will be released this fall and she has plans to expand her wine company. Her vibrant personality, out-of-the-box branding, and creative, but simple approach to cooking has allowed her to continuously surprise and delight her fanbase.\n(9) MARQUES BROWNLEE\n29 year old Marques Brownlee has been a prominent figure in the tech industry since his teenage years. His insightful reviews and tutorials of video games, smartphones, and other gadgets, has helped him amass over 28 million followers and billions of views across his platforms. In addition to his gigantic social media presence, Marques has interviewed the likes of Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg, he hosts his own tech podcast, and he has courses available on Skillshare and Masterclass.\nMore recently, Marques expanded his business ventures by launching a paid premium Discord subscription for his superfans and he was a featured guest on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show where he teamed up with comedian Hasan Minhaj for a custom technology segment.\n(10) ROSANNA PANSINO\nCreator Rosanna Pansino always considered baking to be a hobby. In 2010, upon encouragement from friends, she began a YouTube channel to showcase her baking skills and followed up a year later with her own internet baking show, Nerdy Nummies. This would be the rocket ship that launched her into full-fledged social media superstardom, earning her multiple awards and making her one of the highest paid content creators on YouTube. 10+ years later, it\u2019s also still the #1 baking show on the internet.\nRosanna has since written two cookbooks \u2013 one a New York Times bestseller, partnered with cookware company Wilton on a Nerdy Nummies-themed bakeware line, hosted reality television cooking shows on HBO Max and Food Network, and only three months into this year has partnerships live with Nintendo, Amazon Fresh, Blue Buffalo, Neutrogena, and The Container Store.\nChief Executive Officer and Co-founder at 044.ai Lab\n10moNeil, thanks for sharing! How are you today?\nGeneral Manager at Devox\n1yNeil, glad you shared this! \ud83d\ude04\nCo-CEO Whalar\n2yBeautifully put Neil Waller \ud83d\udc33!

      "text": "A few weeks ago, I floated a half-baked idea during a presentation: \u201cin the age of AI, trust is the new oil.\u201d The more I bake it, the more I believe this phrase captures the possibility that AI will re-order the media economy as we know it. In many ways, it also points to a hopeful future, even for traditional media.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll explain why.\nTl;dr:\nFor the last 25 years, the foundation of the web economy has been the monetization of attention.\nThat has funded a vast amount of content, but the zero-sum competition for our finite attention has a dark side too: sponsored links that are a diversion or a tax; apps and sites that manipulate our neurophysiology to hook us; content that is clickbait, ragebait, polarizing, and false; and unwelcome surveillance online.\nThere are also signs we are in the late stages of strip-mining attention and nearing a breaking point.\nHere comes AI. It will likely devalue raw attention for two reasons: as creation costs fall, increasing noise will drown out signal on open platforms, such as the open web and social networks (despite platforms\u2019 attempts to counteract it); and consumers will increasingly use agents and bots to manage it.\nIn turn, this will likely weigh on digital advertising. All that noise will degrade the value of impressions and the quality of data, especially at the top of the funnel. The rise of agents and bots may render many ads worthless\u2014and not just on the open web, but even some social impressions and retail media traffic.\nThe big question: how does the web economy adjust? It will likely shift from an attention economy to an action economy, from one built on potential energy to kinetic energy.\nThe declining value of attention will be accompanied by increasing value of trust. Consumers are far more likely to act\u2014or, eventually, empower their agents to act\u2014when they trust the source. Just as data was the oil that fueled the attention economy, trust will be the oil that fuels the action economy.\nThere are two kinds of trust online: signal-based trust and earned trust. The former is easy to game, but the latter must be established and reinforced over time.\nA web economy built on earned trust would look very different from what exists today. Among the implications: the value of human curation would rise as algorithms struggle to manage the noise; discovery would shift back from algorithmically-curated feeds to trusted follows; similarly, consumers would lean more on institutions with trusted brands; it would be harder for new creators and brands to establish trust; and advertisers would shift from paying for attention to paying for outcomes.\nThe fight for attention won\u2019t ever fully go away and, with it, its negative consequences. But, on the margin, attention alone will become less profitable. That could shift both incentives and the balance of power online.\nWhy Attention Became the Primary Currency\nWe\u2019re so accustomed to paying for content with our attention that we don\u2019t think about it. But it didn\u2019t have to be this way.\nThe web was built on open protocols. TCP/IP for routing and delivery of packets, HTML for rendering web pages, HTTP for links between pages, SMTP for delivering mail between servers, etc. For a variety of reasons, however, there weren\u2019t protocols for things that, in hindsight, would\u2019ve been very useful, like payments or verified identity. Perhaps that\u2019s because the web wasn\u2019t initially intended to support commercial activity (the National Science Foundation (NSFNET) initially prohibited it) and the early web community prioritized privacy and anonymity over verified identity. The reasons don\u2019t matter much.\nIn the absence of \u201crails\u201d for native payments and identity\u2014what Ethan Zuckerman called the \u201coriginal sin of the internet\u201d over a decade ago\u2014the only viable model to support content creation was advertising: capture consumers\u2019 attention and charge advertisers for the right to access some of it.\nToday, while the internet supports subscriptions and commerce, almost every site and app is either partially or entirely advertising supported. Globally, digital advertising is a ~$750 billion business, representing 70% of all advertising spend\u2014which is to say that it is more than twice as large as TV, print, radio, outdoor, and every other type of advertising combined (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Digital Dominates Global Advertising\nSource: WPP, The Mediator.\nThe Problem With Attention\nIn some ways, advertising serves the public interest. It finances a vast amount of content that is available for \u201cfree.\u201d When video and audio streaming services, games, and podcasts offer consumers the option of receiving ads in exchange for paying less or nothing (i.e., by offering ad-supported and more expensive ad-free tiers), many happily take the ad-supported choice.\nIt is increasingly clear that the battle for a finite amount of attention is at odds with consumer welfare.\nIt is increasingly clear, however, that this zero-sum competition to capture a finite amount of consumer attention\u2014the so-called \u201cattention economy\u201d\u2014puts the interests of ad-supported platforms and content creators at odds with public welfare.\nSponsored results are either a diversion or a tax. Consumers go to Google Search to find the best sources of information. Google\u2019s interests are misaligned with that goal. It makes money by inserting sponsored search ads that often displace the most relevant organic results. When these sponsored results are the best source, that\u2019s because the advertiser felt compelled to purchase the relevant keyword(s) to pre-empt competitors, which effectively raises costs for consumers. The same principle applies to sponsored results on Amazon or any retail media.\nProduct design is often manipulative. Social platforms hack our neurophysiology to increase time spent, often at the expense of consumers\u2019 well being. They use tactics like variable reward schedules (so-called \u201cdopamine loops\u201d), gamification, notifications to draw consumers back in, infinite scroll, etc.\nThe monetization of attention rewards sensational, enraging, polarizing, false content. This battle for attention encourages creators (professionals and otherwise) to produce sensational, polarizing, false, and clickbait content. And since this kind of emotion-baiting stuff tends to draw more attention, the platforms\u2019 algorithms amplify it.\nPrivacy is collateral damage. To facilitate all this advertising, platforms and publishers collect all kinds of data about users: clickstream, location, behavioral, demographic, and economic\u2014giving rise to another pejorative description of the web, \u201cthe surveillance economy.\u201d Technically, users usually consent to this data collection, but it is often buried in massive terms and conditions that are onerous to read. Many feel that this \u201csurveillance\u201d is a violation of privacy that they had little practical ability to refuse.\nWhether you call it the attention economy or the surveillance economy, many agree that this state of affairs is not good. It arguably isn\u2019t good for mental health (especially young people); public civility; political discourse; and trust in information ecosystems.\nIt may also be unsustainable. Culturally, there are already signs that we are being pushed to the brink. You can see evidence of backlash everywhere: \u201cdigital detox\u201d movements; the rise of minimalist phones and digital hacks to limit screen time; memes about digital burnout and doom-scrolling; subtle rejection of modernity by younger consumers (who are embracing vinyl, film cameras, and vintage shopping); and, thanks to efforts by people like social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, a broader push to ban phones in school.\nKeep reading with a 7-day free trial\nSubscribe to The Mediator to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives."
