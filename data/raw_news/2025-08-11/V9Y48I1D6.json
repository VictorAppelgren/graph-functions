  "description": "The new deal is worth less than the initial $100 million agreement between the streamer and Archewell Productions.",
  "content": "Netflix on Monday announced it renewed its creative partnership with Harry and Meghan (after reports the relationship was ending) with a multi-year, first-look deal that will give the streamer the right of first refusal for all Archewell film and television projects The new deal is structured differently than the $100 million, five-year agreement struck in 2020 in which Netflix paid Herry and Meghan for the exclusive rights to all Archewell content. Under the new agreement, which the New York Times reported is worth less, Netflix has the first option to stream Archewell content. The new deal comes with less commitment from Netflix and reflects the streamer\u2019s move away from all-encompassing agreements (a deal with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground that was similar to the initial exclusivity arrangement with Archewell transitioned into a first-look deal last year). Netflix also invested in As Ever, the lifestyle brand Markle launched with the streamer last year that sells products like jam, wine and baking mixes, producing some of the products through its consumer product group and sharing in the revenue, according to the Times.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

The explosive 2022 \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d docuseries was by far the most successful to come out of the deal and still holds the record for the most viewing time of any Netflix documentary in its debut week. It\u2019s still drawing interest and was watched another 7.3 million hours in the first half of 2025. The deal also produced \u201cHeart of Invictus,\u201d a documentary following athletes participating in the Prince Harry-founded sporting event for wounded veterans; \u201cLive to Lead,\u201d a docuseries on impactful world leaders, \"Polo\" about the professional sport; and the lifestyle series \u201cWith Love, Meghan.\u201d \u201cWith Love\u201d spent one week on Netflix\u2019s global top 10 list, at No. 10, with 12.6 million hours viewed in its first week.\n\nWhat Is As Ever?\n\nMarkle launched a brand called American Riviera Orchard via Instagram on March 14, 2024 with a short video that showed the duchess arranging flowers, baking and standing in a stone walkway wearing a floor-length gown. Company registration documents revealed plans to create an online retail store selling tableware, cutlery, cookbooks, stationary, party decorations and other similar items, but no products were ever sold under the name. A trademark request for the brand was rejected and there were several reports no CEO had been found to run the business. In February, she partnered with Netflix and re-branded the company to be called \"As Ever.\u201d A handful of products were released, including two jams, three teas and honey, all of which sold out almost immediately. Since then, As Ever has released a Napa Valley ros\u00e9, which is available in a three-bottle pack for $90. The brand was featured in the first season of \u201cWith Love, Meghan.\u201d",

      "text": "Topline\nCookbooks, servingware, home decor, stationary, yoga gear and pet food could all be coming soon from Meghan Markle\u2019s new lifestyle brand, launched via Instagram Thursday night, amid a photoshopping scandal at Kensington Palace that has all eyes on her sister-in-law Kate Middleton.\nKey Facts\nMarkle announced the creation of a new brand, called American Riviera Orchard, via a nine-post grid on Instagram and a short video that shows the duchess arranging flowers, baking and standing in a covered walkway while wearing a floor-length black ball gown.\nThe logo for the venture seems to be a new crest featuring the letters A and R, which she has been speculated to have been involved in designing, and includes the word \u201cMontecito\u201d under the brand name\u2019s sprawling cursive (Markle has lived in California with her husband, Prince Harry, and two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, since 2020).\nWhile the Instagram launch provided little details on the venture (but did score 358,000 followers for the brand overnight), trademark filing applications show Markle's new company could be headed in the direction of those owned by Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba or HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines.\nA filing from February shows the company registered as an LLC in Delaware with plans to create an online retail store selling tableware, cutlery, cookbooks, servingware, coffee and tea services, kitchen textiles, jams and jellies, oils and other foods.\nA second set of documents, filed in March, suggests the brand could also venture into gardening items, lighting, stationary, party decorations, gift wrapping, tote bags, pet gear, kitchen items and home decor like pillows, curtains, linens and picture frames.\nWhether the goods would be manufactured and produced by the American Riviera Orchard brand or simply curated and re-sold under the brand name was not clear in the filings.\nSurprising Fact\nThis isn't Markle's first lifestyle brand. Before she was engaged to Prince Harry in 2017, she ran a lifestyle blog called The Tig on which she interviewed celebrities, talked fashion and revealed personal details of her early life and career as an actress. She closed the site in 2017.\nKey Background\nAfter minor roles in projects like \"Get Him to the Greek\" and \"Horrible Bosses,\" Markle shot to fame in 2011 as a main character in the TV series \"Suits,\" on which she starred until 2017. Shortly after her departure from the show was announced, she was engaged to Prince Harry, the youngest of two sons of Princess Diana and King Charles III. They were married in May 2018 and Markle gave birth to Prince Archie of Sussex in May 2019. In January 2020, the couple announced they would be stepping down as senior royals, citing bullying from the British media, racism within the family and general mistreatment. They moved to California in June 2020. Since their departure, Harry and Markle have launched several business ventures. The couple created a charity organization and an audio and video production company using the name Archewell and signed deals with Netflix and Spotify worth $100 million and $20 million, respectively. \u201cHarry & Meghan,\u201d a multipart docuseries discussing Harry and Markle\u2019s tenure as royals, debuted in 2022. The same year, Netflix reportedly cut a children's show called \"Pearl\" that was created by Meghan Markle and would have been Archewell Productions' first animated series. Last year, the couple's Spotify partnership ended after they reportedly failed to meet \u201cproductivity benchmarks\" and Markle in February said her podcast, \"Archetypes,\" will now be made with Lemonada Media.\nTangent\nMarkle\u2019s announcement comes amid a scandal at Kensington Palace that has had all eyes on her former in-laws: Prince William and Princess Kate. Kensington Palace in January announced Kate had been hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery and would postpone all of her upcoming engagements while she recovered. Before the announcement, the Princess of Wales had not been seen or heard from since Christmas Day. In the months after the surgery, public speculation arose and time went on without a sighting of the princess. On Sunday, Kensington Palace released a photo of Kate and her three children to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day in the United Kingdom. The photo, which was said to have been taken by Prince William, was immediately the subject of ire for seemingly major edits. That same day, agencies like AFP and the Associated Press issued kill notices, asking news agencies to stop circulating the photo because it \u201cappeared the source had manipulated the image.\" The next day, Monday, Kate took the fall for the botched photo and said she occasionally experiments with editing images like \u201cmany amateur photographers.\u201d Since then, the global news director of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's biggest news agencies, has said the palace is no longer a \"trusted source\" of information. Middleton was photographed in the backseat of a car leaving Windsor Castle earlier this week. Photo agency Goff Photos has denied doctoring the photo. Kate has not been seen in public since."

      "text": "Topline\nSpotify has ended its podcast deal with Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle, the two sides announced Thursday, ending the multi-million-dollar partnership after it produced only one season of Markle\u2019s Archetypes podcast and as Spotify restructures its podcast division, which resulted in layoffs at the company earlier this month.\nKey Facts\nSpotify and Archewell Audio, Harry and Markle\u2019s audio production company, said in a statement the two sides had \u201cmutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series we made together.\u201d\nHarry and Markle, known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, originally signed with Spotify in December 2020, in a deal that Spotify said would \u201celevate underrepresented voices.\u201d\nThe podcasting deal resulted in only one series, Markle\u2019s podcast, Archetypes, which ran for one season starting in August 2022, featuring interviews with such guests as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey, Mindy Kaling, Paris Hilton and Trevor Noah.\nArchetypes became the top podcast on Spotify following its debut and won a People\u2019s Choice Award in December, but sources cited by Variety said Spotify expected more content from the podcast deal.\nOther sources cited by Variety said Harry and Markle wanted to \u201cfind a new home\u201d for their audio content, and a representative for Markle\u2019s talent agency, WME, told the Wall Street Journal the Duchess of Sussex \u201cis continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\u201d\nThe announcement comes days after Spotify announced it would lay off approximately 200 people as it restructures its podcasting division, though sources cited by Variety said ending the deal with Harry and Markle was unrelated to the realignment.\nBig Number\nApproximately $20 million. That\u2019s how much Archewell Audio\u2019s podcasting deal with Spotify was worth, according to the Journal. The exact figure is unclear, with industry sources cited by Forbes previously valuing it at closer to $15 million to $18 million, and other reports putting it as high as $25 million. The Sussexes did not meet the \u201cproductivity benchmarks\u201d needed to get the full payout from the deal by the time it ended, according to sources cited by the Journal.\nTangent\nSpotify ended another high-profile podcasting deal with former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama\u2019s Higher Ground media company in April 2022. Sources cited by Variety said at the time that Spotify was the one to decline to renew the agreement, and the Obamas reportedly wanted its content to not be exclusive to the platform. Higher Ground has since signed a new deal with Audible.\nKey Background\nThe Sussexes stepped down as working members of the royal family in early 2020 following clashes with the Palace and ongoing concerns about their privacy, relocating to California. The Spotify deal was part of the couple\u2019s broader pivot to media content in their post-royals life, which has also included a $100 million contract with Netflix and the publication of Harry\u2019s controversial memoir, Spare. The end of Archewell\u2019s Spotify deal comes as the podcasting industry faces a moment of reckoning after a surge of interest, with Chartr data released in February finding the number of new podcasts dropped by 80% over the past year compared with the two years before. The number of U.S. podcast listeners only increased by 5% in 2022, according to Insider Intelligence. Spotify\u2019s recent round of layoffs came after the audio company previously canceled ten of its original podcasts in October 2022 and laid off a reported 38 podcast employees that month.\nFurther Reading\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Spotify End Podcasting Deal (Wall Street Journal)\nMeghan Markle\u2019s \u2018Archetypes\u2019 Podcast Unseats Joe Rogan For Top Spot On Spotify (Forbes)\nHere\u2019s What We Know About Prince Harry And Meghan Markle\u2019s $135 Million Deals (Forbes)\nHow Much Are Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Worth?

      "text": "Topline\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have been fast at work unveiling a slew of ventures since they shocked the world by stepping down as working royals three years ago, launching into books\u2014with Harry\u2019s bestselling Spare shattering records\u2014along with movies, television and podcasts that have an estimated value of more than $135 million.\nKey Facts\nHarry is rumored to have received a $20 million advance for his latest venture, controversial tell-all Spare, which debuted earlier this month and sold more than 1.4 million copies on its release day, surpassing the 887,000 first-day copies shifted by former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2020 memoir to become the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time, according to Guinness World Records.\nStill perhaps their most lucrative deal yet, the couple signed a five-year, $100 million contract with Netflix in September 2020 to produce documentaries, docuseries, feature films, scripted shows and children\u2019s programming.\nIn 2020, the couple splurged on a $14.7 million home in the posh seaside town of Montecito, California, cozying up alongside moguls and celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande in a leafy residential area blocked to the public.\nIn December 2020, the former working royals penned a three-year podcasting deal with Spotify worth between $15 million to $18 million, according to industry sources, but some reports indicate it could be as much as $25 million.\nBooks\nIn the U.S. alone, Spare sold 629,300 print copies its first week on shelves (falling short of Obama\u2019s record, with 831,300 copies), according to figures compiled by NPD Bookscan, which monitors roughly 85% of the domestic print market. Spare\u2019s publisher, Penguin Random House, said Harry planned to support British charities with donations from the book\u2019s proceeds, including roughly $671,000 to nonprofit WellChild and $1.5 million already given to Sentebale, an organization he cofounded to help children in Southern Africa at risk of HIV.\nMarkle, too, has dabbled in publishing, though the works have netted much less: In 2021, she released a children's picture book entitled The Bench that reportedly landed her an advance of up to $618,000 (500,000 British pounds). The 167-word book, which features an illustration of the couple\u2019s then newborn daughter, Lilibet Diana, landed on the New York Times bestsellers list, but it\u2019s unclear how much it ultimately sold. In 2018, Markle also published a cookbook, and donated all the proceeds to a West London community's cooking group.\nTv & Entertainment\nSo far under their Netflix deal, Harry and Markle have released two docuseries, Live to Lead, which features interviews with world leaders and celebrities including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Gloria Steinem, as well as Harry & Meghan, the buzzy tell-all that shattered Netflix documentary viewership records upon its release in December, but also garnered waves of criticism, with some reviewers calling the series a \"tedious, narcissistic wallow.\u201d An animated kids show, named Pearl, was announced but then scrapped in May before release, but Heart of Invictus, a docuseries following a group of injured service members preparing for the Invictus Games, is slated for release later this year. Meanwhile, the couple\u2019s first Spotify podcast, Markle\u2019s Archetypes, briefly surpassed The Joe Rogan Experience as Spotify\u2019s top podcast when it was released in August.\nBefore stepping down as a working royal, Harry announced in 2019 he would executive produce a mental health series for Apple TV+ alongside Oprah Winfrey. Because of pandemic delays, the show didn\u2019t premiere until May 2021. Nevertheless, it\u2019s unclear if Harry made any profit from the series, given that senior working members of the royal family cannot accept money from commercial projects.\nReal Estate\nDespite its steep $14.7 million price tag, the couple\u2019s Montecito home seems a steal compared to the $25.3 million its former owner, Russian magnate Sergey Grishin, paid in 2009. They took out a $10 million mortgage for the home, but it\u2019s unclear, based on available records, whether the loan has been paid off. According to the Santa Barbara assessors\u2019 office, the 14,500-square-foot estate sits on more than 5 acres and comes with seven bedrooms and 13.5 bathrooms.\nRoyal Inheritance\nAfter stepping down as working royals, Harry and Markle largely relied on Harry\u2019s inheritance from his late mother, Princess Diana, estimated at $10 million. Representatives told Forbes in 2021 that Harry was not a beneficiary of any of the $100 million left to the royal family by his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It\u2019s unclear if Harry was left any money from his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II, whose will is expected to stay sealed for at least 90 years.\nKey Background\nHarry and Markle no longer receive money from Harry\u2019s royal relatives. The pair announced in early 2020 they would step down as working members of the royal family, and they no longer receive money from the royal family. Previously, the vast majority of the couple\u2019s expenses\u2014which Forbes estimated to be about $800,000 annually\u2014were paid for by Harry\u2019s father, now King Charles III, through the Duchy of Cornwall, which last year netted Charles some $27 million. (After Charles became king, the Prince of Wales title and the duchy were passed to Harry\u2019s older brother, Prince William). As the new monarch after Elizabeth II\u2019s death last year, Charles assumed ownership of institutions that manage an estimated $42 billion in assets on behalf of the kingdom, including famous landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Tower of London. However, many of those assets aren\u2019t his to sell, as they\u2019re held \u201cin trust\u201d and must be passed on to his successors.\nUpon stepping down, Harry and Markle dropped their HRH titles\u2014short for His and Her Royal Highness\u2014and voluntarily repaid more than $3 million to the Sovereign Grant for renovations at Frogmore Cottage, their family home in the U.K., which had previously been covered by taxpayers. Before marrying Harry in 2018, Forbes estimated Markle netted an estimated $2 million from her previous career as an actress, most notably as a star in the legal drama Suits for seven seasons.\nSurprising Fact\nHarry and Markle are responsible for covering costs for their own security detail, which security experts in 2021 told Forbes could reach up to $3 million a year. A British court ruled in July that Harry can proceed to challenge a British government committee\u2019s decision to rule his family ineligible for police protection during visits to the U.K., even if he and Markle foot the bill. The Metropolitan Police\u2019s former head of counterterrorism Neil Basu revealed in November that Meghan was the target of \u201cdisgusting and very real\u201d threats from the far right. \u201cIf you\u2019d seen the stuff that was written and you were receiving it . . . you would feel under threat all of the time,\u201d Basu told Channel 4.\nTangent\nHarry and Markle founded their foundation Archewell in 2020. In October, the foundation announced it would distribute $1 million in grants to women who \u201cserve as inspiration to young individuals\u201d in partnership with the VING Project, which is funded by Groupon billionaire Eric Lefkofsky\u2019s family foundation.\nLisette Voytko contributed reporting.\nFurther Reading\nInside \u2018The Firm\u2019: How The Royal Family\u2019s $28 Billion Money Machine Really Works (Forbes)\nHow Much Are Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Worth?

A trademark filing from September shows the company registered as an LLC in Delaware with plans to sell several products online, including soaps, shampoos, gardening tools, jewelry, furniture, kitchenware, wallpaper, yoga gear, sauces, coffee, alcoholic beverages and stationary, among others. The filing also suggests the company will sell streaming content, in addition to films, TV series, newsletters and books. It\u2019s unclear whether goods sold by As Ever will be manufactured and produced by the company.\nWhat Is The Tig?\nMarkle launched her lifestyle blog The Tig\u2014a reference to the wine label Tignanello\u2014in 2014, on which she interviewed celebrities, talked about fashion and revealed details of her early life and career as an actress. She closed the site in April 2017, months before her engagement to Prince Harry.\nKey Background\nMarkle rose to fame as an actress with roles in \u201cGet Him to the Greek\u201d and \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d before starring in the TV series \u201cSuits\u201d through 2017. An engagement between Markle and Harry\u2014the youngest of two sons of Princess Diana and King Charles III\u2014was announced shortly after Markle departed the show in 2017. They married in May 2018 and Markle gave birth to Prince Archie of Sussex in May 2019. The royal couple announced in January 2020 they would step down as senior royals, citing mistreatment by the British media and racism within the Royal Family. Since then, Harry and Markle launched the audio and video production company Archewell and signed $100 million and $20 million deals with Netflix and Spotify, respectively."
