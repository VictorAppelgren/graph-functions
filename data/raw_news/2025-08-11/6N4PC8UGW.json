  "description": "Zelenskyy seeks inclusion in Trump-Putin summit amid concerns for Ukraine's sovereignty.",
  "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked European leaders for backing his push to join the upcoming summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy and European Union officials are warning that cutting Ukraine out of the talks could jeopardize the country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told Reuters on Sunday, \"The U.S. has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously. Any deal between the U.S. and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine\u2019s and the whole of Europe\u2019s security,\"\n\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland, and the European Commission released a joint statement expressing that any solution brokered by Trump and Putin must protect the security and interests of both Ukraine and Europe, according to Fox News.\n\n\"The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nBoth the White House and the Kremlin acknowledged the request by Zelenskyy to be included in the summit, but no formal invitation has been issued.\n\nWhen asked on Monday about the summit and whether the Ukrainian President would be included, the President said: \"He's been there for three and a half years, and he's done nothing.\"\n\nThe summit on August 15th is set to hopefully be a step in ending the war between Ukraine and Russia that started in 2022. President Trump has issued ultimatums to Russia in an attempt to force President Putin to the table for negotiations. So far, the Kremlin has brushed off the threats as \"theatrical\" and even went so far as to call the demands of President Trump a step towards war.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this summit \"will be about testing Putin.\"\n\nPresident Trump initially put most of his political pressure on Zelenskyy, but in recent weeks has become increasingly frustrated with President Putin, who promises to take steps towards ending the war, but then continues to escalate it.\n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is leading America into the \"Golden Age\" as Democrats try desperately to stop it.\n\nHelp us continue to report on President Trump's successes.

Meanwhile, former Russian President and current Deputy Chair of Russia\u2019s security council took to X to call Trump's threat \"theatrical.\"\nTrump issued a theatrical ultimatum to the Kremlin.\n\u2014 Dmitry Medvedev (@MedvedevRussiaE) July 15, 2025\nThe world shuddered, expecting the consequences.\nBelligerent Europe was disappointed.\nRussia didn\u2019t care.\nHowever, Trump reinforced his threat today on the White House lawn, telling reporters that if Russia and Ukraine don't come to a deal, \"it's gonna be too bad.\" He added that Russia will face not only 100 percent tariffs, but also further sanctions.\nPrior to Trump's comments Tuesday afternoon, officials from the European Union also seemed to think the president's threat lacked any teeth, according to Fox News.\nThe EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters in Brussels:\nOn the one hand, it is very positive that President Trump is taking a strong stance on Russia. On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians, also every day. It is clear that we all need to put more pressure on Russia so that they would also want peace. It is good that the Americans are making the steps, and I hope that they are also giving military aid like Europeans are giving.\nRecommended\nBut again, from the White House lawn, President Trump responded in force. He said 50 days was not a long time, and if the EU had an issue with civilians dying, they should be blaming former President Joe Biden's policy, which he says both started the war and did little to bring it to a close.\nTrump SLAMS reporter who questioned his 50-day ultimatum to Putin:\n\u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 15, 2025\n\"I don't think 50 days is very long. You should've asked that same question to Biden. Why did he get us into this war?....You know why he got us in? Because he's a dummy...he's incompetent. It would've NEVER\u2026 pic.twitter.com/skuEJn8RMH\nEditor\u2019s Note: Thanks to President Trump and his administration\u2019s bold leadership, we are respected on the world stage, and our enemies are being put on notice.\nHelp us continue to report on the administration\u2019s peace through strength foreign policy and its successes.

But, of course, juveniles are not acting as 'kids' while committing historically high rates of murder, armed robbery, theft while armed, and carjackings.\"\nTrump also vowed to go after illegal aliens in the city who work with \"homegrown criminals.\" Gang task forces will begin work to remove them from the streets immediately.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nEditor\u2019s Note: President Donald Trump is returning Washington D.C. to the American people by locking up violent criminals and restoring order.\nWe've covered D.C.'s decay for years.
