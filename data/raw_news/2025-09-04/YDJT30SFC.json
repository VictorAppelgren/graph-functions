  "title": "Times reporter demands the details from Trump's immigration team",
  "description": "Your morning catch-up: Jousting between L.A. Times and Trump's ICE, wildfire burns into historic Gold Rush town and more big stories.",
  "content": "For many Angelenos, this will be recalled as the summer ICE came to town. Platoons of camouflaged and masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have become the leitmotif of the Summer of \u201925.\n\nSo have media efforts to report exactly who is being arrested, and why. And there hasn\u2019t been a reporter more dogged and on target on that subject than Brittny Mejia of The Times. Sure, she\u2019s my colleague, but she\u2019s also a Pulitzer Prize finalist, for writing (along with Jack Dolan) about poor healthcare for the most vulnerable people in L.A.\n\nMejia doesn\u2019t accept the Official Story. From anyone. Precision has never been more important than in this time, when ICE and other federal agencies have been trafficking in generalities. They claim to solely target \u201cthe worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nAt times, yes. But at many other times, the facts have shown ICE and its sister agencies have swept up others. Some led away in handcuffs merely overstayed their visas, or made the \u201cmistake\u201d of showing up for court hearings to try to comply with immigration laws.\n\nMejia and other Times stalwarts \u2014 such as Rachel Uranga, Ruben Vives and Melissa Gomez \u2014 know that specifics matter, not only to the people whose faces have been splashed across the mediaverse, but also to everyone who wants to know the truth about what our government is doing.\n\nMany will recall the case of Brian Gavidia, one of those detained by federal agents in Montebello just a week after the raids began in early June. Video rocketed across the internet, showing the East L.A. native protesting as agents held him against a fence.\n\nA day after Mejia reported on Gavidia\u2019s protests (\u201cI\u2019m American, bro!\u201d he screamed at a camo-clad agent) the Department of Homeland Security still pumped out misleading information, saying, \u201cThe facts are a U.S. citizens was [sic] arrested because they ASSAULTED U.S. Border Patrol Agents.\u201d\n\nMejia peppered Homeland Security media boss Tricia McLaughlin with messages, insisting the agency provide specifics about Gavidia, not others. \u201dWhen I got that statement, I immediately questioned it,\u201d Mejia told me, \u201cbecause I interviewed Gavidia and he had not been arrested and also did not have any charges that I could find in the federal court system.\u201d\n\nOnly later did the immigration agency leadership acknowledge that it was Gavidia\u2019s friend, Javier Ramirez, who had been arrested. Authorities charged Ramirez with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. The case has since been dismissed, though it remains in a legal limbo that could end with charges being filed.\n\nGavidia, meanwhile, has joined a federal lawsuit over the tactics used against him and others. That case is still winding its way through the courts, where Mejia is following along closely. A federal judge has temporarily blocked agents from using racial profiling to make indiscriminate immigration arrests.\n\nThough top spokesperson McLaughlin acknowledged fairly quickly that Gavidia was an American, that didn\u2019t mean the agency issued an apology. It did proceed to suggest on X that The Times had posted \u201cFALSE headlines,\u201d adding, \u201cDHS targets have nothing to do with an individual\u2019s skin color.\u201d But all The Times had reported was that some citizens had expressed concern about racial profiling. An indisputable fact. (Remember those?)\n\n\u201cI had people writing to me and telling me that I lied, all based on the DHS post,\u201d Mejia said, referring to a social media offering that didn\u2019t bother to make clear that Gavidia had committed no crime.\n\nTwo months later, Trump\u2019s immigration agents were at it again. Near an downtown L.A. event where Gov. Gavin Newsom was speaking, they arrested two men separately. Yet in their messaging about the busts, the feds didn\u2019t bother differentiating between the \u201ctwo illegal aliens,\u201d saying they included \u201can alleged Tren de Aragua gang member and narcotics trafficker.\u201d\n\nMejia got the authorities to acknowledge that one of those arrested, Angel Rodrigo Minguela Palacios, had committed no crime. He had never been connected to a gang. Minguela \u2014 who had been delivering strawberries that August day to a downtown cafe \u2014 merely had overstayed his visa. That\u2019s a civil offense, not a crime, a fact Mejia told the public, something immigration authorities hadn\u2019t bothered to say.\n\n\u201cWe work hard to get the full picture of what unfolds during these raids and who ends up arrested,\u201d said Mejia, who grew up in a military family and tends to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you,\u201d even when she\u2019s pushing hard. \u201cWhen DHS or ICE has asked for more time in order to get details of an operation or arrest, we have given it to them. That\u2019s all done to provide a full picture of what occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request in for body camera footage of the Gavidia arrest and have yet to receive it,\u201d Mejia said. \u201cI still have a lot of outstanding questions that remain. Among them is, which Border Patrol agent took Gavidia\u2019s Real ID? Also, why was it never returned to him?\u201d\n\nMinguela, a father of three, has been moved to Arizona and is due to make a court appearance Tuesday. You can be sure \u2014 in this summer of fire and ICE \u2014 that Mejia and my other colleagues will remain on that story, and all the others.\n\u2022 California, Oregon and Washington are joining forces to insulate vaccine guidance and other public health recommendations from political interference.\n\u2022 Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Tina Kotek of Oregon and Bob Ferguson of Washington announced Wednesday the creation of the West Coast Health Alliance, a pact that aims to keep their states\u2019 health policies unified and grounded in scientific expertise.\n\u2022 The move comes as the nation\u2019s top public health agency is being reshaped by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his vaccine-skeptic allies, with key leadership fired and the agency in turmoil.\n\nUC warns of billions in funding losses beyond UCLA in Trump battle\n\u2022 The University of California\u2019s top leader has raised the \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that financial losses due to the Trump administration\u2019s funding cuts could amount to billions of dollars and extend beyond UCLA to the entire 10-campus system.\n\u2022 Already, more than $500 million in federal grants have been suspended at UCLA. The government is asking for $1.2 billion to restore them.\n\u2022 In the last couple of weeks, the case of missing 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro has been a clarion call for independent journalists, online sleuths, and criminal case followers, some traveling across the country to California to chronicle developments.\n\u2022 Online internet sleuths often pick apart the trickle of information being released by authorities, often filling in the holes with rumor, speculation and innuendo.\n\u2022 It\u2019s gotten so bad that at a recent news conference, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco called out so-called keyboard warriors who are following the case and sharing unverified updates or spreading misinformation.\n\nHumanity is rapidly depleting water and much of the world is getting drier\n\u2022 New research based on 22 years of satellite data shows vast areas of the world are losing fresh water and getting drier.\n\u2022 Scientists are seeing \u201cmega-drying\u201d regions that are immense and expanding \u2014 one stretching from the western United States through Mexico to Central America, and another from Morocco to France, across the entire Middle East to northern China.\n\u2022 There are two primary causes: rising temperatures unleashed by using oil and gas, and widespread overpumping of water that took millennia to accumulate underground.\n\nWhat else is going on\n\u2022 Wildfire burns into the historic California Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp.\n\u2022 Homelessness has declined in L.A.

Egyptian law enforcement and ACE shut down the service Aug. 24 following a yearlong investigation.\nStreameast had 80 associated domains and amassed more than 1.6 billion visits during the past year. It offered access to sports\u2019 biggest events, including Europe\u2019s football championships, the NFL, NBA, MLB, pay-per-view boxing and F1 races. It garnered an average of 136 million monthly visitors, primarily based in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., the Philippines and Germany.\n\u201cWith this landmark action, we have put more points on the board for sports leagues, entertainment companies, and fans worldwide \u2014 and our global alliance will stay on the field as long as it takes to identify and target the biggest piracy rings across the globe,\u201d said Charles Rivkin, chairman of ACE and head of the Motion Picture Assn., in a press release.\nTwo men were arrested about 20 miles outside of Cairo under suspicion of copyright infringement. Authorities confiscated devices, including laptops and smartphones thought to be operating the site, cash and several credit cards. Investigators also identified a shell company possibly used to launder the advertising revenue, which totaled to around $6.2 million, and an investment of $200,000 in cryptocurrency. Several properties in Egypt were also allegedly purchased with these funds.\nIn addition to working with local Egyptian authorities, ACE\u2019s investigation was aided by Europol, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Centre, according to the Athletic\u2019s reporting.\nAll sites previously associated with Streameast will be redirected to ACE\u2019s \u201cwatch legally\u201d page, which provides links to authorized streaming video providers. This announcement comes a day before the NFL\u2019s regular season kicks off."

      "text": "- Share via\nThe NFL is a quarterback-driven league, but it\u2019s a quarterback hunter who made the most dramatic offseason splash.\nAll-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, traded from the Dallas to Green Bay, should command a big share of the spotlight as the NFL kicks off the 2025 season this weekend with a slew of intriguing matchups, including Parson\u2019s Packers playing host to the Detroit Lions, who have gone from league laughingstock to vogue Super Bowl pick.\nCowboys fans are still agonizing over the Parsons trade, even though their team got two first-round draft picks and Pro Bowl defensive lineman Kenny Clark in the deal, and shellshocked quarterback Dak Prescott responded to the news with a Texas-sized understatement: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re better.\u201d\nMatthew Stafford is one of several reasons why the Rams offense could be one of the most fearsome in the NFL, but has the 37-year-old QB overcome his back issues?\nNo time to lament now, as Dallas faces Super Bowl champion Philadelphia on Thursday night in the annual kickoff opener. It\u2019s one of eight divisional matchups in Week 1, with another being the Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs squaring off Friday night in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. That\u2019s the first of seven international games this season, the most ever for the NFL. Gone are the days when the league simply staged a few games in London. This season also features games in Germany, Ireland, Spain and, for the second consecutive year, Brazil.\nNot only do the Chargers open with the defending AFC champions, but they will play three consecutive AFC West games in the first three weeks \u2014 at Las Vegas in Week 2, and home against Denver in Week 3. It\u2019s a rollicking ramp-up in a division of Mount Rushmore-type head coaches \u2014 Andy Reid of Kansas City, Sean Payton of Denver, Pete Carroll of Las Vegas and Jim Harbaugh of the Chargers.\nThe Rams, meanwhile, open at home Sunday against the Houston Texans, the team that nine months ago delivered an opening-round knockout of the Chargers in the playoffs.\nThe most pressing issue for the Rams? The health status of quarterback Matthew Stafford, who missed much of summer practices with back problems.\nThe 37-year-old quarterback recently told reporters he\u2019s doing whatever he can to ensure he\u2019s ready to play.\n\u201cDone a ton of research just trying to help myself out,\u201d Stafford said.\nAs usual, quarterbacks will be a focal point again this season, with Aaron Rodgers now in Pittsburgh, Sam Darnold in Seattle and two more familiar players taking snaps for the New York teams, Justin Fields with the Jets and Russell Wilson with the Giants.\nPittsburgh opens at the Jets, meaning Rodgers returns to the place he called home the past two seasons. He downplayed that reunion recently in a conversation with Mad Dog Sports Radio\u2019s Adam Schein, saying, \u201cA lot has changed over there, coaching staff\u2011wise, player\u2011wise.

In Minnesota, former Michigan standout J.J. McCarthy assumes the helm after sitting out his rookie season with a knee injury.\nMike Vrabel returns to coach New England, where he was a defensive star with the Patriots, and Ben Johnson takes over in Chicago after helping draw up so much success for Jared Goff and the Lions as Detroit\u2019s offensive coordinator. The Bears play host to Minnesota in the first Monday night game of the season.\nEvery season, either records are broken or players move up the charts. Some to watch include Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, who needs five touchdown passes to reach 250 in the fewest games, and career completions by Rodgers, who likely will move into the top five in the first month of the season. Keep an eye on Jacksonville kicker Cam Little, who made a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game; the record long is 66 yards by Justin Tucker in a 2021 game.\nAlso in 2021, Pittsburgh\u2019s T.J. Watt got to quarterbacks 22\u00bd times to tie the single-season sack record set by Michael Strahan 20 years earlier. Could that mark fall this season? Watt is still around, as are elite pass rushers such as Aidan Hutchinson of Detroit, Myles Garrett of Cleveland and Jared Verse of the Rams.\nOh, and a new guy in Green Bay.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be traded,\u201d said Parsons, who collected 52\u00bd sacks in four seasons with the Cowboys.

      "text": "Homelessness has declined in L.A. County, but progress is at risk: \u2018We are digressing\u2019\n- Share via\n- Unsheltered homelessness has declined by 14% over two years in L.A. County, but recent and future budget cuts could threaten that progress.\n- Amid a slowing economy, the county and state have cut funding for some homeless services, which providers now say is backing up the system and making it difficult to house people.\n- More budget cuts, including from the federal government, are expected in the future.\nThere\u2019s a long way to go, but the Los Angeles area appears to be making progress in its fight against homelessness.\nIn the city, data show homeless people are moving into new permanent supportive housing faster. Countywide, there were 14% fewer people living on the streets than two years earlier, according to the 2025 count.\nFuture progress could be much tougher, due in large part to a slowing economy that is reducing funding for homeless-services and programs.\n\u201cHomelessness is an issue that responds well to strategic investment over time,\u201d said John Maceri, chief executive of the nonprofit The People Concern. \u201cAnd what we are seeing now is we are digressing.\u201d\nThe current funding picture comes after years of increased public investment that officials have attributed to recent declines in homelessness. And surprisingly, it comes nearly a year after L.A. County residents voted to significantly increase their contribution to the cause.\nIn November, voters approved Measure A, a half-cent tax to fight homelessness, which was an increase from the previous quarter-cent levy.\nBut much of the additional tax hike is dedicated to building affordable housing, which takes time, while the sales tax percentage flowing to the county for core homeless services has remained largely the same.\nAs a result, officials have said that although more total money is being raised, the county has less funds available for things such as job training, outreach and landlord incentives as the economy slows and consumers spend less. Add on top of that state budget cuts and expected reductions from the federal government, and officials and nonprofit providers say you have a perfect storm.\n\u201cWe are seeing a cliff,\u201d said Maceri, whose organization has laid off 22 workers because of the reductions.\nIn a June report, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a joint city-county agency, highlighted nearly $92.7 million in budget cuts this fiscal year that included reductions for rental subsidies and drop-in centers that help homeless people access services.\nTax revenue collected for homeless services is expected to fall again next year, all the while the cost of providing those services increases.\nOn Tuesday, Sarah Mahin, the director of a new county homelessness department that will take over many of LAHSA\u2019s responsibilities next year, told the Board of Supervisors that, given the combination of cuts, the \u201cregion must make very hard choices about how we invest our limited resources\u201d and the department is working \u201chard with our partners to identify the best path forward.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s reduction in funding is already having an effect, according to providers.\nAmong the major programs hit is a program called time-limited subsidies, which is designed to pay rental subsidies for up to two years so that formerly homeless people can live in an apartment while working to find a job or more permanent subsidy program.\nDue to a reduction in state money, nonprofits that use the subsidies to house people cannot accept new applicants.\nSome service providers have reported that the decision is backing up the system, with people staying in shelters longer. With less room in shelters, others must stay on the streets longer.\nSo far, the county is on track to meet one its major goals for Measure A, which is for unsheltered homelessness to fall 30% from 2024 to 2030.\nNonprofit leaders said funding cuts will make meeting that metric difficult.\n\u201cThe likelihood we are going to be able to house you at this moment is challenging,\u201d said Ryan J. Smith, chief executive of the St. Joseph Center.\nMaceri said the additional Measure A funding that is flowing to build new permanent, affordable housing is crucial in the long run, but so is investment in services that help move people off the street in the near term and eventually into that permanent housing.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep driving huge numbers in reduction when the resources that drive that reduction are substantially diminished,\u201d Maceri said.\nTo fix that, Maceri called for more funding from the state or federal government, but getting it could be a long shot.\nThe state government has cut homelessness spending amid budget constraints in recent years, while there\u2019s been growing concern among the public \u2014 and some elected officials \u2014 that the money that has been spent hasn\u2019t translated into enough progress.\nOn the federal level, the Trump administration wants to end funding for homeless-specific programs that seek to house people first and then address other issues such as drug addiction or mental health, a policy the county considers a cornerstone of its approach and one first adopted federally by President George W. Bush.\nIn addition, the administration is seeking to reduce funding that local governments receive for public housing and to administer the nation\u2019s general housing voucher program, which helps millions of Americans afford the rent to private landlords.\n\u201cI have been in this industry for over 35 years and certainly have seen my share of challenges as it relates to funding or policy shifts,\u201d Emilio Salas, executive director of the county department that oversees public housing and vouchers, told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never experienced this level of impact as it relates to pressures coming from all sides of the housing ecosystem.\u201d"

Here\u2019s your chance to weigh in on a rescue plan\n- Share via\n- A months-long study was posted online Tuesday, explaining the long history of decline and laying out strategies for turning things around.\n- Nearly two-thirds of survey respondents would support a bond, tax or levy for additional park funding.\nIt\u2019s been said many times before.\nIn Los Angeles, for many people, the neighborhood park is their frontyard and backyard.\nIt\u2019s where tables are staked out early and birthdays are celebrated.\nIt\u2019s where kids learn how to swim and all ages play soccer, baseball and basketball.\nIt\u2019s where neighbors gather to beat the heat, hike, catch a concert, slow down, escape the madness.\nBut as I said in my last column, L.A.\u2019s roughly 500 parks and 100 rec centers, occupying 16,000 acres, are generally in bad shape and not easily accessible to many residents. In fact, in the latest annual ranking by the Trust for Public Land, they fell to 90th out of the 100 largest recreation and parks systems in the nation on the basis of access, acreage, amenities, investment and equity.\nThat\u2019s shameful and inexcusable, especially for a city prepping to host World Cup soccer championships and the Olympics. But in every corner of Los Angeles, residents now have a chance to weigh in on what they like or don\u2019t like about parks, what went wrong and what to do about it.\nA months-long study, commissioned by the city and compiled by landscape design company OLIN with input from multiple urban planners, community groups and thousands of residents, was posted online Tuesday, explaining the long history of decline and laying out strategies for turning things around.\nL.A. is 90th on a list of 100 big-city parks. But unlocking school playgrounds on weekends and holidays could help.\nResidents have 45 days to weigh in online or at community meetings (details below). The final report will be delivered to the recreation and parks board of commissioners and then, in a perfect world, someone at City Hall will lead the way and restore pride in an essential but neglected community asset.\nAmong the key findings of the nearly 500-page needs-assessment study:\nFewer than half of survey respondents said there are enough parks and rec centers within walking distance of their homes.\nFewer than 40% said parks are in either excellent or good condition.\nL.A. invests less per capita in parks ($92 annually) than many other large cities, including Chicago ($182), Dallas ($232), Washington, D.C. ($407) and San Francisco ($583).\nThe department\u2019s maintenance and operations budget has been stagnant for years and its staff has been shrinking, with more trouble on the horizon as temporary funding sources dry up in the next few years.\nNearly two-thirds of survey respondents would support a bond, tax or levy for additional funding.\n\u201cI think it validated what we already knew,\u201d Department of Recreation and Parks general manager Jimmy Kim said of the needs assessment study, adding that it provided a framework for making smarter use of existing resources while going after new sources of revenue. \u201cMy message to Los Angeles [is] please participate in this process.\u201d\nKim told me last week that the current workforce is half what it once was, and basic park maintenance is like a \u201cgame of whack-a-mole.\u201d The department\u2019s budget has grown in the last 15 years, but lagged way behind growth of the citywide budget. In that time, it\u2019s been hit by inflation, the citywide budget deficit and the rising cost of maintaining aging facilities (the deferred maintenance tab is greater than $2 billion).\nThe department is also hamstrung by a Charter-mandated, per-capita funding formula that hasn\u2019t been tweaked since the 1930s. And because it\u2019s a proprietary department, meaning that it raises some money through programs and concessions, it\u2019s required to pay its own utility bills and reimburse the city for employee benefits, two expenses that swallow 40% of its budget.\n\u201cFor the last century,\u201d said Jessica Henson, of OLIN, \u201cthe same percentage of the city budget has been allocated to parks, but they\u2019re doing a lot more today, and are on the front lines of so many critical public services like COVID response and fire response. They\u2019re doing more with less over the last 15 years.\u201d\nIn my last column, I laid out one of the easiest and quickest ways to add more park space \u2014 unlock the gates of L.A. Unified schoolyards. Ten have been opened so far, and a new agreement between the city and school district paves the way for more, although two major obstacles are funding and the need to replace blacktop with greenery.\nTo calculate how to make better use of existing resources, the study used an approach developed in part by UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. The PerSquareMile tool broke the city into tiny grids and identified two dozen park sites where improved facilities could impact the largest number of people, and three dozen sites where conversion of schools and other public spaces into parks would serve hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe drug addiction and homelessness plaguing MacArthur Park are there not because politicians failed, but because all of society has.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the most efficient way,\u201d said Jon Christensen, of the UCLA institute.\nBut transforming the system will take more than that, said Guillermo Rodriguez, a member of the study\u2019s steering committee and California state director of the Trust for Public Land, the nonprofit that ranked L.A. near the bottom of the 100 largest park systems.\n\u201cCities have made investments across the board, and L.A. is lagging,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nThe study cited several revenue-generating options, including a charter amendment to increase the percentage of funding that goes to parks, expanded nonprofit partnerships, extending Proposition K, the 1996 park improvement measure that is about to expire, and putting a new fundraising initiative on the ballot in the fall of 2026.\n\u201cIn every administration since [Mayor] Tom Bradley, the park system was taken for granted,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere\u2019s no more tape, no more paint, no more magic tricks that they can use to fix the parks. It really requires leadership and a significant investment, and I think Angelenos are ready to step up.\u201d\nThat leadership is going to have to come from Mayor Karen Bass and each member of the City Council. So if you\u2019d like to get their attention, two public meetings are coming up:\nThursday from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Bellevue Recreation Center in Silver Lake, and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon at the Westwood Recreation Center.\nFor a schedule of future virtual meetings, and to read an online copy of the needs assessment study, go to needs.parks.lacity.gov."

      "text": "L.A. cracks down on Hollywood party houses and illegal short-term rentals. Violators to pay hefty fines\n- Share via\n- The city of Los Angeles has settled several lawsuits against operators of illegal short-term rentals and party houses in Hollywood.\n- The lawsuit includes the settlement over allegations that a rent-stabilized building on Franklin Avenue was illegally used for short-term rentals.\nThe city of Los Angeles is expected to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines after settling multiple lawsuits against the owners of illegal short-term rentals and party houses in the Hollywood area who were accused of creating chaos for neighboring residents.\n\u201cWith excessive noise, disruptive behavior, obstruction of the public right of way, litter and vandalism, party houses are well-known to impact neighborhood quality and threaten public safety,\u201d L.A. City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto said in a news release Tuesday.\nAmong the buildings mentioned in the settlement were the Franklin Apartments, a rent-stabilized building with 30 units located at 6871 Franklin Ave. The city attorney\u2019s office accused the building\u2019s owner and manager of removing 10 long-term rental units for use as illegal short-term rentals.\nIn 2020, the 10 units were turned into an underground hotel, which \u201cresulted in increased nuisance activity and complaints from other neighbors,\u201d Feldstein Soto said.\nThe law requires short-term rental properties to register with the city under the Home-Sharing Ordinance, or HSO. Rent-stabilized units, which limit a landlord on rent increases each year, are prohibited from being used for short-term rentals.\nAccording to the city attorney, the property owners failed to register the units under the HSO, and were taken off the market for extended periods of time.\nThe building\u2019s owner and manager \u2014 MC Pico Properties LLC and Monem Corp. \u2014 were ordered to pay $150,000 in civil penalties, according to the city attorney\u2019s office. As part of the settlement, the property managers must post signs acknowledging that short-term rentals are prohibited at that property and to return the 10 units to the long-term rental market.\nA spokesperson for MC Pico Properties and Monem Corp. said in a statement that the short-term unit rentals were immediately cleared as word of the violation was brought to their attention, adding that \u201cby the time any settlement was finalized with the City\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, those units had already been vacated and re-released in compliance with the City\u2019s RSO.\u201d\n\u201cRather than focus on the parties actually profiting from short-term rentals \u2014 namely, Airbnb and tenants who unlawfully sublet their units \u2014 the City Attorney targeted a property owner that had no knowledge of the violations, had received no complaints about the units and acted swiftly to correct them once discovered,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis time, however, the City Attorney threatened millions of dollars in fines, even though the only beneficiaries of the rentals were Airbnb, the tenants, and the City itself, which collected fees from those stays.\u201d\nFires, government restrictions and interest in mid-term rentals are thought to be driving the decline in have in short-term rental licenses.\n\u201cWe will not tolerate party houses that disrupt our neighborhoods and threaten public safety, or sit back while our laws are violated and rent-stabilized housing is ripped off the market,\u201d Feldstein Soto said in a statement. \u201cThese actions send a clear message that we will hold those who violate our laws accountable for their violations.\u201d\nFeldstein Soto also announced the settlement of a 2023 lawsuit filed by the city against Ultimate Host, a high-end home hosting business known as the Nightfall Group. According to the lawsuit, police were called 250 times in a span of two years to multiple Hollywood properties operated illegally by Ultimate Host as party houses. Feldstein Soto accused the Nightfall Group of being an alleged driver of the city\u2019s party house problem.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the owner, Mokhtar Jabli, operated the business illegally by renting out his main residence in violation of the city\u2019s short-term-rental laws. Other property owners working with the Nightfall Group also leased their long-term rentals as short-term rentals for use as party houses, Feldstein Soto said.\nAt least three defendants in this case settled \u2014 Kirill \u201cKirk\u201d Ayzenberg, 5554 Green Oak, and Jungle Kerry \u2014 and were ordered to pay $215,000, $45,000 and $20,000, respectively, in civil penalties, according to the city attorney\u2019s office. As part of the settlement, they must tell all guests that loud and unruly parties are prohibited.\nThe city attorney\u2019s office said litigation with other defendants is pending.\n\u201cWe look forward to the City Attorney\u2019s office directing its resources toward holding accountable those who actually profit from and perpetuate illegal short-term rental activity, rather than unfairly targeting responsible housing providers,\u201d the MC Pico Properties and Monem Corp. said."

Then she noticed that the restaurant also served some of her favorite Mediterranean dishes.\nAfter she placed her order, she started reading the colorful signs on the walls, one of which mentioned an Oklahoma onion burger.\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, a burger? What is this place?\u2019\u201d Yevin wondered.\nLocal Kitchens is a fast-casual restaurant with five distinct menus from five different chefs. The catch is that there aren\u2019t five kitchens operating separately. Rather, the five partnering chefs \u2014 a mix of restaurateurs, cookbook authors and chef-influencers \u2014 worked with Local Kitchens\u2019 in-house culinary team to design the menus. The food is prepared from scratch by a single team of on-site cooks, ghost-kitchen-style.\nBut unlike many ghost kitchens, customers can eat on site. Diners are greeted by screens where they can scroll the five menus, then mix and match items as they build their order. When ready, servers deliver the food to the table all at once \u2014 not in disposable containers but on white ceramic plates. It\u2019s a touch of restaurant-style service combined with the choice of a food hall and fast-casual convenience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a valuable proposition,\u201d said cookbook author and content creator Rick Mart\u00ednez, who for his first restaurant venture has partnered with Local Kitchens to offer a Sonoran-style Mexican menu. \u201cA lot of my friends are either vegan or pescatarian, or have some kind of allergy. It\u2019s like no one can agree on any one place, right?\u201d\nA Jalape\u00f1o Ranch Wedge Salad from Chef Rick Martinez\u2019s Mexican menu offerings at Local Kitchen surrounded by other dishes. Chef Rick Martinez\u2019s book \u201cSalsa Daddy.\u201d (Emil Ravelo / For The Times)\nFrom a $900 parking lot pop-up to a $1-billion valuation: Here\u2019s how Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken and its four founders built a worldwide fried chicken empire.\nLocal Kitchens and similar ventures, such as Neighborly at the Promenade at Westlake in Thousand Oaks, are part of a new field of fast-casual dining descended from the online ordering boom of the pandemic when convenience and choice became paramount for diners and ghost kitchens, such as takeout titan Wonder on the East Coast, proliferated.\nWhile still rooted in the ease of screen technology, Local Kitchens and Neighborly are betting on customers\u2019 renewed desire for social connection, while also recognizing their demand for high-quality food. Diners get convenience and variety; chefs get the financial backing to scale with minimal risk.\nFrom ghost kitchen to social gathering space\nLocal Kitchens, launched in 2020 by former DoorDash co-founders Jon Goldsmith and Andrew Munday, along with Jordan Bramble, began as a ghost kitchen servicing Bay Area favorites such as Boba Guys and Humphry Slocombe. By 2021, Local Kitchens had begun offering diners the chance to eat on site.\nWith time, however, there was a growing awareness, said Chief Executive Jay Gentile, that Local Kitchens was expanding other companies\u2019 brands without cementing its own. Some locations, including the company\u2019s first Southern California outpost in Huntington Beach, have shuttered.\n\u201cHow do we move away from being this tech platform that does food, and become a restaurant brand that partners with great chefs, that creates menus, that scratch-cooks in our own kitchen, and delivers at a really high level at a fast-casual pace, at a price point that makes sense for people?\u201d posed Gentile, who stepped into the CEO position in March as the company approached its five-year anniversary.\nFor Gentile, a large part of the answer is teaming up with individual chefs instead of established restaurant brands. On Local Kitchens\u2019 initial chef-partner lineup are Eggslut and Amboy founder Alvin Cailan, who devised the aforementioned Oklahoma onion burger; Einat Admony, the chef-owner of New York\u2019s Israeli restaurant Balaboosta; Ari Feingold, chef and co-founder of San Francisco\u2019s Proposition Chicken; Tu\u1ec7 Nguy\u1ec5n, better known among Gen Z audiences as @twaydabae on social media and partner in the currently closed Vietnamese restaurant DiDi in West Hollywood, and Mart\u00ednez, who took some of the company\u2019s employees to Sonora, Mexico, to help them nail his menu.\nWhile delivery and takeout still comprise a healthy amount of the company\u2019s revenue, the restaurant is dedicated more than ever to a dine-in experience, with front-of-house staff available to guide customers through the touch screen menu or to take their order directly and the addition of ceramic dishware in Studio City and soon in other locations. Think Tender Greens but with a variety of cuisines.\nGetting Neighborly\nOver at Neighborly, the latest project from DOM Food Group, which previously worked with Gwyneth Paltrow to scale Goop Kitchen, customers at the Promenade at Westlake also order from a screen or they can speak to a front-of-house staff member to build a meal across six menus. As at Local Kitchens, one kitchen prepares the food, which is delivered as a single meal.\nBut Neighborly largely works with established restaurants and personality-driven businesses. Customers can choose Armenian cooking from Glendale\u2019s Mini Kabob; chicken sandwiches and no-beef burgers from Questlove\u2019s Mixtape; pizza and pasta from the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills; California-inspired salads, bowls and sandwiches from chef-influencer Gaby Dalkin; cookies from Amirah Kassem\u2018s Flour Shop and the pan-Asian-focused Social Monk, started in 2019 by the Cheesecake Factory in the same Westlake space that now houses Neighborly.\nGoing a step further, Neighborly\u2019s physical space doubles as a superette, where customers can pick up spreads from Jessica Koslow\u2019s Sqirl, frozen meals from Burritos La Palma and Katie\u2019s Pizza, or any number of clean pantry essentials labeled \u201cwoman-owned,\u201d \u201ckid-friendly,\u201d \u201cbetter for you snacks\u201d or \u201cbespoke local merch.\u201d\nTaking its inspiration from Erewhon, founding partner Mario del Pero, known for co-founding Mendocino Farms with his wife, Ellen Chen, said Neighborly\u2019s core customer is the \u201ctime poor\u201d suburban mom, who wants to have a nice meal with friends and also grab prepared meals to take home.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re best in class in every genre then we\u2019re gonna win the pizza person, we\u2019re gonna win the bowl person, we\u2019re gonna win the Mediterranean person,\u201d said Del Pero, from Neighborly\u2019s ocean-blue patio, bustling with customers.\nA lifeline for chefs\nFor chefs, Local Kitchens and Neighborly offer a place to incubate menus and spread their brands without the risks associated with scaling a small business on their own.\nThis opportunity is particularly exciting for those who have never dabbled in the restaurant space, yet have sizable online presences, such as Dalkin and Mart\u00ednez.\nBut the same can be said for established restaurateurs.\nTake Cailan for example, who is largely uninvolved in the international expansion of Eggslut but still personally operates Amboy and says that facing rent in Studio City would have been \u201c100%\u201d impossible.\n\u201cHaving the yin and yang of having a business like Amboy and being a part of a business like Local Kitchens makes everything work,\u201d said Cailan. \u201cI could still be chef Alvin Cailan smiling and shaking hands with my customers every single day, and also really trying to be a business-forward innovator in the restaurant world with Local Kitchens.\u201d\nSimilarly, Mini Kabob\u2019s Armen Martirosyan had long been interested in scaling the family business. But facing $20,000 to $30,000 a month in rent for a new location, he said, was \u201calmost a dream.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the Neighborly team reached out.\n\u201cI explained to my parents, like, \u2018Look, we can cook but we\u2019ve never scaled a business,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re tired. I\u2019m tired. Let\u2019s put that creativity back into Neighborly\u2019s hands, and let\u2019s grow with them.\u2019\u201d\nMini Kabob\u2019s has tried expanding before \u2014 at the Westfield Topanga shopping center\u2019s Topanga Social food hall. Martirosyan calls the still-operating venture \u201cthe bane of my existence.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no chef coming in and training with us. We literally had to go to Topanga and train 18-year-old kids to make our proprietary recipes,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately we knew this was bad, and it was either A, we would go everyday to try to save the face of our company and make sure that the quality doesn\u2019t get killed, or B, we just take a step back.\u201d\nLocal Kitchens and Neighborly, however, are explicitly pitching a higher level of fast-casual food and work with the chefs to ensure quality.\nLocal Kitchens, for instance, has implemented safeguards such as requiring each store to submit a picture of a specific recipe each day, said culinary head Ashley Torrijos, who got her start in Michelin-starred kitchens Melisse and Providence before working in research and development at the Cheesecake Factory.\nAnd unlike a traditional food hall where small businesses pay rent to the operator, the partnering businesses at Local Kitchens and Neighborly receive a share of revenue. This will continue as both companies look to expand \u2014 in West L.A. and beyond.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting our brand marketed, and we\u2019re actually getting paid back by tasting all these different products and trying all these new things and having access to a research and development team at zero cost to us,\u201d said Dominick DiBartolomeo, owner of the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills and Domenico\u2019s Foods.\n\u201cIf I would have tried to come up with this plan on my own, of course we would have done it. But you know how much time and money that would have taken? It\u2019s exactly what you call a win-win.\u201d"

      "text": "How caps lock became Newsom\u2019s weapon of resistance\n- Share via\n- Newsom\u2019s initial all-caps post has received 5 million views. Since then, his trolling has been both prolific, pointed, and extremely popular.\n- The X account where Newsom does most of his smack-posting, @GovPressOffice, gained more than 500,000 followers in recent weeks.\nHELLO AND HAPPY THURSDAY. IT\u2019S ME, ANITA LYNNE CHABRIA, COMING TO YOU IN ALL CAPS \u2014 BECAUSE THAT\u2019S NOW HOW POLITICS IS DONE.\nNo, I won\u2019t really torment you with shift-lock psychosis. But we will be diving into Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s wildly successful social media trolling of Donald Trump. Although much has been written about his parody of the president\u2019s bombastic style, replete with weird syntax and tongue-in-cheek self-aggrandizement, it turns out it\u2019s far more than just entertaining.\nMore than any other Democratic presidential hopeful out there, the social media offensive has raised both his profile and political fortunes \u2014 and highlighted some uncomfortable truths about American politics in this moment when the vast majority of voters are getting their information in 20-second snippets on TikTok, YouTube and X: Social media is not the sideshow, it\u2019s the main event.\nBut it\u2019s about more than GCN (Gavin Christopher Newsom, as he now signs his posts) making it to the Resolute desk.\nWhether you love Newsom or hate him, California is the epicenter on the resistance to Trump\u2019s push to expand presidential powers into authoritarianism. In courts, in the Legislature and on social media, this is the state that has fought back most effectively.\nNewsom\u2019s recent decision to throw caution and subservience to the wind is at the heart of that, a move from frenemy to fighter that is essential to shaping and protecting the future of our democracy. One cheeky post at a time.\nThe seed of inspiration\nHow did we wind up here? Although January may seem like eons ago, it was in reality only nine short months since Newsom showed up uninvited on the tarmac in L.A. to greet Trump, even embrace him, as the president came to view the fire damage in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nNewsom was still in that frenemy phase, trying to reason with, flatter and cajole a president who demands praise, but who, like the fable of the scorpion and the frog, will always attack because it\u2019s in his nature. California needs fire aid, and as Newsom said at the time, \u201cI hope he comes with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. That\u2019s the spirit to which we welcome him.\u201d\nThat, however, didn\u2019t work out great. Trump not only dillydallied with fire money, threatening conditions, he also sent the National Guard into L.A. for a nonexistent emergency around immigration protests, then strong-armed Texas into redrawing voting maps to help ensure MAGA keeps control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.\nSo now California has Proposition 50, the effort to redraw our own maps to find more Democratic seats, and a hoppin\u2019-mad governor (get that frog reference?) who knows a scorpion when he sees one.\nWhat does this have to do with social media, you ask? In mid-August GCN wrote to DJT with one last peace offering: California would stop its push for redistricting if other states stopped as well. No luck, big surprise.\nBut staffers at Newsom\u2019s office were in a mood, and thought it would be funny to tweet out the last paragraph of that letter in all caps, Trump-style. The only change? Switching the last line from the statesman-like \u201cAnd America will be better for it\u201d to the Trump-favored \u201cThank you for your attention to this matter.\u201d\nAnd there, in a moment of frustration and gallows humor \u2014 no grand strategy intended \u2014 the seed of inspiration was planted.\nThe Result\nThat post has received 5 million views so far, and emboldened Newsom to go further. Since then, his trolling has been both prolific, pointed, and extremely popular.\nThe X account where Newsom does most of his smack-posting, @GovPressOffice, gained more than 500,000 followers in recent weeks, and racked up more than 480 million impressions. That\u2019s up 450%, according to CNN\u2019s Harry Enten.\nHe\u2019s been in demand on traditional media as well (and seems to be living rent-free in the brains of right-wing Fox commentators), and has made himself available to digital content creators \u2014 who have helped him reach more than 30 million views across various platforms.\nNewsom\u2019s speech about the National Guard coming into L.A. \u2014 at nine minutes long, an eternity these days \u2014 was viewed more 40 million times in a week.\nAnd, as Enten also pointed out, 75% of California Democrats now say they want Newsom to run for president, and betting markets give Newsom a 24% chance of being the Democratic nominee, rating him with the highest potential in the pack.\nLove-bombed with all that success, Newsom has pushed further into the rage-baiting. The \u201cGCN\u201d sign-off? That came from Newsom himself. But there\u2019s a team behind the effort, and they\u2019re running 24/7 to keep the big, beautiful bludgeoning going.\nBut what about democracy?\nGreat for Newsom, you say, but how does a meme of him with bulging biceps save democracy? Here\u2019s the thing I learned covering the rise not just of Trump, but of the extremist and fringe ideologies such as QAnon that fueled his base: It would not happen without social media.\nSocial media is the sauce that has seasoned this change in our politics, which sounds obvious but is much deeper than most realize. Social media created communities, communities largely without physical or ethical boundaries. Anything goes, and the more intense and crazy, the deeper it tends to go. The more people believe, the more involved they become.\nShort take: Social media spreads extremism.\nBut can social media also spread resistance?\nThe hardest parts of an autocracy are division and fear. It feels lonely and scary to speak out. Newsom has done two crucial things with his social media barrage.\nFirst, he showed us that the Republicans were right all along. For years, the far-right has found Trump\u2019s social media hilarious, and all the funnier because Democrats were outraged by its crassness, vulgarity and childishness. Many Democrats found no humor in a president behaving in ways that would get their own teenagers grounded.\nBut as soon as Newsom did it, Democrats were the ones who found it funny, especially the irony-free Republican outrage. And empowering. And awesome. Suddenly, they got the joke.\nIn copying, Newsom was subverting \u2014 not just holding up a mirror to the bad behavior, but revealing that Democrats have in fact had a stick somewhere unnecessary and need to admit that low humor tickles the American fancy. He has given Democrats something light and amusing to rally around, creating community that has been sadly lacking.\nAnd community is where resistance thrives, same as with extremism. When people feel not alone, they feel stronger.\nThat\u2019s the second thing Newsom has brought with his trolling. Democrats, Republicans, democracy-backers of any stripe are relieved to laugh at Trump together \u2014 because nothing undermines his power more than a collective chuckle at his expense.\nLike this:\nWhat else you should be reading:\nThe must-read: The AI Doomsday Machine Is Closer to Reality Than You Think\nThe what happened: Trump can\u2019t use Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan gang members, court rules\nThe L.A.

In a strange way, without it there wouldn\u2019t be a caf\u00e9 and I would have never learned how to cook. At a time when I was desperate to recover from depression, I decided I needed some time out from the music management company where I was working. My mother Odette showed me her recipe for Guinness bread, and I found that the meditation of mixing the bread really helped with the pressure and intensity of what I was going through.\nMy mum is from Ireland and the bread recipe is very traditionally Irish. Every meal at Caf\u00e9 Cecilia begins and ends with a nod to this bread. From the bread plate when you first sit down to the Guinness bread ice cream for dessert, it always features. It\u2019s slightly sweet, with notes of treacle along with the buttermilk, and I find it brings something unique to the caf\u00e9\u2019s menu, as it\u2019s hard to find good freshly baked Irish soda bread in London. Our menu changes daily, but the soda bread is always here.\nHeat the oven to 340 degrees and grease a 2-pound loaf pan, buttering well into all the corners, otherwise your bread will stick.\nPut all the dry ingredients, except the oats, into a bowl and combine. Pour all the wet ingredients into a separate bowl and stir together with a whisk until totally combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, then mix with one hand while keeping the bowl stable with the other, until all the ingredients are well combined and a wet dough forms.\nUsing your dough-covered hand, put the dough into the loaf pan, then wash your hands thoroughly. Sprinkle over the oats, then score a short, shallow line in the middle of the dough using a small, sharp knife.\nBake the bread in the oven for 1 hour, then remove and tip out of the pan. Return the bread to a shelf in the oven and bake for about another 10 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Leave to cool on a wire rack. This bread will keep for up to 3 days."

      "text": "Federal judge halts indiscriminate immigration stops in Los Angeles and beyond\n- Share via\nIn a searing ruling against the Trump administration, a federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests that advocates say have terrorized Angelenos, forced people into hiding and damaged the local economy.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, was widely hailed by immigrant rights groups and California Democrats, who have been in a pitched battle with the administration over recent sweeps through Southern California immigrant neighborhoods.\nIf adhered to, the ruling would stop immigration agents from roving around Home Depots and car washes, stopping brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking day laborers and others to arrest on immigration charges, as they have been for the past month.\n\u201cJustice prevailed today,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom posted about the ruling on X Friday evening.\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision puts a temporary stop to federal immigration officials violating people\u2019s rights and racial profiling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCalifornia stands with the law and the Constitution \u2014 and I call on the Trump Administration to do the same.\u201d\nThe orders cover Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Following the ruling, groups that have been monitoring the immigration sweeps reported none as of Saturday afternoon.\nThe White House said it would challenge the ruling.\n\u201cNo federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy \u2014 that authority rests with Congress and the President,\u201d said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cEnforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview or jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.\u201d\nIn her ruling, Frimpong said she found a sufficient amount of evidence that agents were using race, language, a person\u2019s vocation or the location they are at, such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meet or row of street vendors, to form \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d \u2014 the legal standard needed to detain someone. Frimpong said the reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment.\n\u201cWhat the federal government would have this Court believe in the face of a mountain of evidence presented in this case is that none of this is actually happening,\u201d she said.\nFrimpong ordered federal agents not to use those factors to establish reasonable suspicion to detain people. And that all those in custody at a downtown detention facility known as B-18 must be given 24-hour access to lawyers and a confidential phone line.\nU.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, who has brought charges against protesters at the raids, blasted the ruling on X.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and maintain that our agents have never detained individuals without proper legal justification,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur federal agents will continue to enforce the law and abide by the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\nThe ruling came at a particularly fraught moment as details of the largest work-site enforcement raid since the crackdown began to emerge.\nAgents arrested around 200 suspected undocumented immigrants at two cannabis operations on Thursday, and prompted a tense standoff between authorities and hundreds of protesters in Ventura County. A man who fell 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during the raid was gravely injured and the FBI is investigating whether shots were fired at federal agents during the protest.\nAlthough the order is temporary, the coalition will seek a preliminary injunction that would make it more permanent. The judge has not yet ruled on a request by Los Angeles city, county and seven other municipalities to join the lawsuit.\n\u201cLos Angeles has been under assault by the Trump Administration as masked men grab people off the street, chase working people through parking lots and march through children\u2019s summer camps,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement Friday evening. \u201cWe went to court against the administration because we will never accept these outrageous and un-American acts as normal.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification .\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most important decision in the history of the country about limitations on what immigration authorities can do when they carry out operations,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public Counsel. \u201cIt means that they can\u2019t racially profile, they can\u2019t treat car wash workers and nannies as illegally in the country just because of who they are. It means that those whom they sweep into detention have to have access to attorneys right away. And it means that the Constitution is not a dirty word. It\u2019s brought the rule of law back to Los Angeles.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn\u2019t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.\nOnce someone was in custody, the complaint argues, their constitutional rights were further violated by being held in \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions at B-18 without access to a lawyer, or regular food and water.\nFrimpong firmly agreed with the plaintiffs, saying they were likely to succeed in trial.\nSince June 6, immigration agents have arrested nearly 2,800 undocumented individuals, according to data released by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday. A Times analysis of arrest data from June 1 to 10 found that 69% of those arrested during that period had no criminal conviction and 58% had never been charged with a crime.\nThe sweeps have paralyzed parts of the city where high numbers of immigrants work.\nEarlier in the day, before the order was issued, Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s chief advisor on border policy, responded to the tentative ruling, telling Fox News: \u201cIf the judge makes a decision against what the officers are trained, against what the law is based upon,\u201d he said that it would \u201cshut down operations.\u201d\nHe echoed government attorneys who argued that agents, in deciding whether to stop a person, can consider location, vocation, clothing, whether they run, and other factors.\n\u201cICE officers and Border Patrol don\u2019t need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just need the totality of the circumstances.\u201d\nHe said agents receive training on the 4th Amendment every six months.\nJustice Department attorney Sean Skedzielewski, in an hours-long hearing Thursday afternoon, said he would seek a $30-million bond, should the order be granted in order to train agents to comply with it. Frimpong wrote in her decision she would reject the government\u2019s request, since the restraining order doesn\u2019t require training, only \u201ccompliance with existing law.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Frimpong took issue with Skedzielewski\u2019s lack of specific evidence to refute accusations of indiscriminate targeting.\nWhen he argued that \u201cthese are sophisticated operations\u201d and seemed to say that arrests stemmed from particular people who were being targeted, she questioned how that could be true.\nIn other cases where local and federal law enforcement are targeting people for crimes, the judge pointed out, there are reports after an arrest \u201cas to why they arrested this person, how they happened to be where they were and what they did.\u201d\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything like that here, which makes it difficult for the court to accept your description of what is happening, because there is no proof that that is what is happening as opposed to what the plaintiffs are saying is happening,\u201d Frimpong said.\nSkedzielewski argued the lack of evidence is why the court should not grant a temporary restraining order. The government, he argued, had only \u201ca couple days\u201d to try to identify individuals mentioned in the court filings.\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t had a chance to identify in many cases who the people stopped even were, let alone \u2014 over a holiday weekend \u2014 get ahold of the agents,\u201d he said.\nFrimpong didn\u2019t seem moved and questioned the government\u2019s reliance on two high-ranking officials who have played a key role in the raids in Southern California: Kyle Harvick, a Border Patrol agent in charge of El Centro, and Andre Quinones, deputy field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nTheir declarations, she said, were \u201cvery general\u201d and \u201cdid not really engage with the pretty high volume of evidence that the plaintiffs have put in the record of the things we have all seen and heard on the news.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any one of these people and there was a report about \u2018this is how we identified this tow yard, parking lot and so on,\u2019 that would have been helpful,\u201d Frimpong said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the court to believe that in the time that you had, you couldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\nSkedzielewski said the evidence is replete with instances of stops, but \u201cit is not replete with any evidence that those stops or that the agents in any way failed to follow the law.\u201d\nHe said agents\u2019 actions were \u201cabove board.\u201d\nMohammad Tajsar, an attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, told the judge that agents cannot solely use a person\u2019s workplace, their location or the particular work they\u2019re doing as reasons to stop people.\nTajsar added that it was because of the government\u2019s \u201cmisunderstanding of the law\u201d that they\u2019d made so many stops of U.S. citizens, including Brian Gavidia, a named plaintiff who was detained by Border Patrol agents outside of a tow yard in Montebello.\nTajsar said Gavidia, who was present in the courtroom during the hearing, was stopped \u201cfor no other reason than the fact that he\u2019s Latino and was working at a tow yard\u201d in a predominantly Latino area.\n\u201cBecause of this fundamental misunderstanding of the law from the government, we have seen so many unconstitutional and unlawful arrests,\u201d Tajsar said.\nTajsar also pushed back on the government attorneys saying they didn\u2019t have enough time, stating that \u201cthey had time and they have all the evidence.\u201d\nIn the court filing of the county and cities trying to join the suit, including Pasadena, Montebello, Monterey Park, Santa Monica, Culver City, Pico Rivera and West Hollywood, they countered that the raids haven\u2019t actually been about immigration enforcement, but are instead politically driven \u201cto make an example\u201d of the region for \u201cimplementing policies that President Donald J. Trump dislikes.\u201d\nThey cited Trump\u2019s post on his social media platform where he calls on immigration officials to do \u201call in their power\u201d to achieve \u201cthe single largest Mass Deportation Program in History\u201d by expanding efforts to detain and deport people in Los Angeles and other cities that are \u201cthe core of Democrat power.\u201d\nLate Friday evening, Trump\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a Santa Monica native widely viewed as the architect of the sweeping immigration crackdown, responded to the order on X.\n\u201cA communist judge in LA has ordered ICE to report directly to her and radical left NGOs \u2014 not the president,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is another act of insurrection against the United States and its sovereign people.\u201d"

Here are 8 rollicking spots to go line dancing around L.A.\n- Share via\nEarly into my tenure as a new line-dancing enthusiast, I found myself in Chatsworth, alone on a Friday night. I was looking for action \u2014 the country dance kind. It was not yet dusk when I entered the Cowboy Palace Saloon, which hosts line dancing on most nights. Suddenly, L.A. felt very far away. In the parking lot, men were flicking cigarettes into the hot summer air. The space was almost dreamlike, with leather boots hanging above the bar table. American flags strung up. A cue ball clattered on a pool table.\nPlanning your weekend?\nStay up to date on the best things to do, see and eat in L.A.\nIn the bar area, I stumbled upon a crowd in denim vests and leather-soled boots dancing in unison. They were line dancing, warming up the dance floor before the live band started their set. A man told me that on any given Friday night, this is the wildest bar in America. I believed him.\nThe appeal of line dancing is simple: It\u2019s a partnerless dance. And still, it naturally fosters community. Scared? Saddle up anyway. If you fumble, the line will keep moving \u2014 feet brushing, stomping, rocking it back \u2014 and soon enough, you\u2019ll find your rhythm again.\nIn Los Angeles, line dancing has a storied legacy. \u201cIn the early \u201890s, there used to be country dance bars all over L.A.,\u201d says Sean Monaghan, one of the founders of queer line dancing night Stud Country. While the popularity of line dancing has seen dips since then, the scene is once again experiencing a revival, partly due to the 2021 closure of country western institution Oil Can Harry\u2019s in Studio City. Deeply feeling its absence, the community filled the void with pop-up line dancing nights scattered across L.A.\n\u201dPeople want to share their joy,\u201d Monaghan says of these gathering spaces.\nAbout This Guide\nOur journalists independently visited every spot recommended in this guide.

Pop stars like Chappell Roan, Post Malone and Beyonc\u00e9 are making country albums and singles. Sabrina Carpenter released a line-dancing tutorial to accompany her hit song \u201cMan Child.\u201d Cowboy boots and camouflage have become fashionable in the L.A. nightlife scene too, littered across wine bars and nightclubs. Queer-themed line-dancing nights are popping up at queer bars across the city, from Dude Ranch at Micky\u2019s WeHo to Hogtied at Precinct. Line-dancing has experienced a Gen-Z makeover in L.A. with TikToks showing line dancers accessorized with Labubus.\nToday you can try line dancing at several country western bars around town, each one as eclectic and unique as the dances themselves. Each of these events on the dance floor will have you feeling like you\u2019ve been teleported to a rollicking barn party \u2014 and may just make you want to abandon your life for the Old West.\nThe Cowboy Palace Saloon\nWomen shuffle from wall to wall in bedazzled denim vests and cowboy boots. The dance floor is populated by both longtime regulars (some who\u2019ve been frequenting the bar for 50 years) as well as younger generations embracing the tradition. Early in the evening, there\u2019s a line-dancing class that\u2019s suitable for beginners, followed by an intermediate lesson. Later in the night, a live country band joins in.\nLine-dancing nights: Typically every night from Wednesday through Sunday. Times vary by day.

      "text": "(What\u2019s the Story): Everything you need to know ahead of this week\u2019s Oasis shows\n- Share via\nOasis is back.\nThe Manchester-born Britpop group last touched down in Los Angeles in 2008, when the venue they performed at as part of their Dig Out Your Soul tour was called the Staples Center. It was in the midst of winter \u2014 if you can even call it that in L.A. \u2014 and the arena was packed.\n\u201cWho\u2019d have thought Oasis, the Britpop holdover that seemingly couldn\u2019t be more out of vogue, could fill Staples Center?\u201d the Orange County Register wrote about the evening. \u201cFor that matter, who\u2019d have thought a band with such a fractious history and spotty track record would still be together at this point, let alone still visiting the States?\u201d\nPerhaps it was a jinx, but a little more than eight months later, the Gallagher brothers would call it quits on August 22, 2009, at the V Festival in Weston Park, England.\nSome other details from that time? Barack Obama was inaugurated as president of the United States. The country was, simultaneously, dealing with an economic crisis then-titled the Great Recession. Bitcoin was invented under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 it was worth an eye-watering $0.\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s been quite some time since Oasis graced the States.\nBut on Saturday and Sunday, they\u2019ll return in style to play back-to-back sold-out shows at the Rose Bowl as part of their reunion tour.\nThe tour, after a 16-year hiatus, is expected to fetch them around $1.1 billion, according to the Guardian. It\u2019s a remarkable amount that says a lot about the group\u2019s enduring popularity \u2014 and they\u2019re probably happy to put issues to bed for now, and even more so when the checks clear.\nIf you were lucky enough to snag tickets for either of the shows \u2014 or shelled out on resale \u2014 there are some crucial details to note before making the trek out to Pasadena.\nIn a water supernova in the sky\nLabor Day weekend proved to be one of this year\u2019s hottest in L.A., and it boasted a heat advisory to show for it. As the week drags on, expected high temperatures will slowly dwindle, but don\u2019t shrug at the anticipated 89 degrees on Saturday and Sunday.\nAs most Angelenos will know, the further you move inland, the more the sun feels like someone\u2019s shoved a magnifying glass in front of it. Don\u2019t underestimate this claim.\nMake sure you hydrate before, during and after the show. The Rose Bowl offers water fountains alongside its concourse and permits factory-sealed water bottles (two per person) and empty, reusable bottles up to 32 ounces.\nWorst-case scenario, you can purchase water at the venue, though likely at exorbitant prices. Still, it beats an ambulance ride.\nCan I ride with you in your BMW? No, just take the Metro\nYou saw this one coming.\nThere are a couple of contributing factors to why you should take the Metro to Pasadena and the subsequent shuttle ride to the Rose Bowl. For starters, any rideshare option may seem easy enough on the way there, but quickly turns into a game of \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d when pick-up comes around.\nThis event includes a mandated Old Town Pasadena pick-up and drop-off for rideshare. Still, consider this: According to the UCLA Bruins\u2019 official site, the venue can hold up to roughly 92,000 fans. Think about waiting around the mandated Old Town pick-up area with even a fraction of those attendees \u2014 after this sold-out show \u2014 before you call in that Uber or Lyft.\nSecond point: Parking is $75 at the gate.\nThe Metro site offers a quick guide to getting there via public transportation, as does the Rose Bowl\u2019s official instructions on getting to the show. There\u2019s even a special, dedicated express shuttle system on the day, which begins at 2:30 p.m.\nThat runs from Old Town\u2019s Parsons Engineering Complex (100 West Walnut St.) to the Rose Bowl.\nMy (soles) slide away, but don\u2019t look back in anger\nThe Rose Bowl is an old stadium, constructed in 1921 and undergoing multiple renovations over the years in light of major sporting events. Its most recent is planned over the course of the next three or so years as the 2028 Olympic Games arrive in Los Angeles.\nThe venue is steep, and that doesn\u2019t pair well with alcohol in the system or on the ground.\nThe Times of London previously reported that Oasis fans set a new record at Wembley Stadium by drinking 250,000 pints, averaging about three drinks per attendee. Last year\u2019s Coldplay gigs saw 120,000 pints sold, and 40,000 for Taylor Swift.\nThe Rose Bowl is not Wembley, but there will be drinks involved and probably more than usual. You don\u2019t garner fame as a rock n\u2019 roll outfit with songs titled \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol\u201d and \u201cChampagne Supernova\u201d without attracting a strong drinking culture.\nAnd \u2014 without instilling unreasonable fear \u2014 an Oasis fan fell to their death at one of those Wembley reunion shows. The father of the 45-year-old man was widely critical of the venue\u2019s alcohol management.\n\u201cAll I know is there was beer everywhere, it\u2019s slippery, he slipped apparently, we do not know the rest of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s questions about the barriers.\u201d\nAt the very least, such an environment certainly increases the risk of a tumble and subsequent injury.\nStand by me (but not in line)\nIt\u2019s fair to say that the city and the Rose Bowl have done their best to prepare for the onslaught of Oasis fans due to swarm Pasadena this week. However, it can be impossible to check off all boxes. One aspect will always remain an anomaly: merchandise booths.\nYou can bet that lines will be packed \u2014 regardless of how many are set up \u2014 before, during and after the show. Thankfully, you can grab Oasis merch before attending the show.\nOn Aug. 20, fans began to gather outside the W Hotel for band\u2019s a peek at the band\u2019s debut North American Oasis Live \u201925 pop-up shop. Inside, a treasure trove awaited: Exclusive merch hung on the walls, bins with posters lined the floors, and bucket hats were stacked on shelves.\nVisits require a reservation, but the availability is OK \u2026 for now. The shop closes its doors Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but will reopen Monday and Tuesday for post-concert indulgence.\nStop crying your heart out: Just buy the tickets\nTickets for all shows across the North American leg of Oasis\u2019 reunion tour sold out within an hour, antiMusic reports. This is no surprise, as the band\u2019s UK and Ireland dates sold out within 10 hours, mostly due to various technical issues and long queue times.\nNow, the only way to get tickets is through resellers, which feels scummy at the very least. If you\u2019re looking to get incredible seats where Noel and Liam may appear bigger than ants, you\u2019ll probably have to pay around $480 per ticket for GA.\nHowever, you can get tickets a bit farther away for around $250 to $300 each, which isn\u2019t the worst when you consider the price of nosebleeds for other artists. It beats standing outside with your grandpa and asking passerbys if they\u2019re willing to part with theirs.\nSeriously, it\u2019s Oasis. Who can say if they\u2019ll stay together for longer than this tour, given their rocky history?\nResale tickets reside with the usual suspects: SeatGeek, Ticketmaster and StubHub."

      "text": "A gondola to Dodger Stadium? How about a gondola to the Big A?\n- Share via\nDodger Stadium might not be the first ballpark in Southern California served by a gondola, if that comes to pass. In Anaheim, city planners are considering whether to pursue a gondola that would serve Angel Stadium.\nFor more than a decade, the city has explored how to connect its two main visitor hubs along Katella Avenue, with Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center about three miles west of Angel Stadium and Honda Center.\nThe effort has accelerated recently, spurred by city approval of a plan that allows Disney to expand its theme parks and add nearby attractions as well as the construction of OC Vibe, a dining, entertainment and residential village surrounding Honda Center.\nIn May, the chief executive of the local tourist agency told Spectrum News that a gondola was one of the transit options under consideration. On Tuesday, the Anaheim Investigator posted public records regarding the gondola option, including a study the city had paid a gondola company $20,000 to produce.\nFrank McCourt will have to pursue his proposed Dodger Stadium gondola without legislation that would have limited potential legal challenges to the project.\nAmong the possibilities the company pitched, according to the Investigator: the gondola\u2019s towers, which hold the support cables in place, could be flared to resemble the Big A, the landmark that gives the ballpark its beloved nickname.\n\u201cIt is fun and exciting to think about something like a gondola,\u201d said Mike Lyster, the city spokesman. \u201cWe know Dodger Stadium\u2019s has generated a lot of interest. To suggest it\u2019s anything more would give the wrong impression.\u201d\nLyster said Anaheim officials also have been in touch with Tesla and Waymo about options for driverless shuttles or trams, and with a company called Glydways that pitches small driverless vehicles operating along dedicated pathways.\nThe gondola company, called Swyft Cities, does not have gondolas in commercial operation but has discussed a similar option with the city of Irvine for use in its emerging Orange County Great Park neighborhoods.\nLyster said the possibility of expanding the Disneyland monorail has not come up in \u201crecent discussions,\u201d since the newer options might turn out to be environmentally friendlier and less costly.\n\u201cWe have to evaluate these emerging technologies to determine which ones may have staying power, which ones may be cost-effective,\u201d Lyster said. \u201cWe\u2019re too early to say this one or that one may be a strong candidate.\u201d\nMitch Farris pitched five effective innings to win his major league debut and the Angels beat the Kansas City Royals.\nSwyft Cities estimated a gondola construction cost of roughly $35 million last year and increased the cost to $125.7 million this year, the Investigator reported. The estimated cost of the proposed Dodger Stadium gondola, which would involve construction over hillside terrain, has risen from $125 million when former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt first pitched the plan in 2018 to about $500 million now.\nIn its presentation to Anaheim, Swyft Cities said the next step would be for the city to commission a \u201cdetailed analysis, preliminary engineering, and implementation strategy.\u201d\nThe estimated cost of that study, should the city choose to want it: $350,000 to $500,000."

      "text": "California pushes back on Trump\u2019s CDC with West Coast Health Alliance\n- Share via\n- California, Washington and Oregon will partner to create the West Coast Health Alliance to provide science-based vaccine recommendations.\n- The move comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed top scientific advisors and fired top leadership at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 With the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in turmoil as vaccine skeptics gain influence in the Trump administration, California is partnering with Washington and Oregon to form a pact that will offer its own public health recommendations.\nGovs. Gavin Newsom of California, Tina Kotek of Oregon and Bob Ferguson of Washington announced Wednesday the creation of the West Coast Health Alliance, which they said will provide science-based recommendations at a time when the nation\u2019s top public health agency is reversing long-standing vaccine guidance.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. , the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a loyal Trump ally, has dismissed top scientific advisors and fired top leadership at the CDC, moves that have shaken public confidence in its direction. And Kennedy has warned that more turnover could be coming.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists \u2014 and his blatant politicization of the agency \u2014 is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,\u201d the three governors said in a joint statement Wednesday. \u201cThe CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.\u201d\nThe rebuke from the West Coast states reveals the escalating concerns about the life-and-death consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s healthcare agenda. For decades, the CDC has been the nation\u2019s trusted authority on vaccines \u2014 setting childhood immunization schedules, guiding which shots adults should receive and shaping state health policies across the country.\nThe states said the focus of their health alliance will be on providing evidence-based recommendations about who should receive immunizations while ensuring the public has access to credible information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the three states have partnered to counter upheaval within the federal public health agency. In June, the states condemned Kennedy\u2019s decision to remove all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Among the replacements named by Kennedy are appointees who spread vaccine misinformation and relayed conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Associated Press.\nKennedy said the change would improve public trust by ensuring members of the committee didn\u2019t have \u201cany specific pro- or anti-vaccine agenda.\u201d\nPolling suggests the opposite effect. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month found Americans across the political spectrum are increasingly uncertain about public health guidance and whether new recommendations from the administration will make them more or less safe.\nExperts say that not only are vaccines crucial for the health of individuals and the community but they also ultimately save money \u2014 preventing sickness and the rise in healthcare costs that would accompany widespread disease outbreaks.\nAndrew Nixon, director of communications at Health and Human Services, told The Times that it was in fact California and Washington that had undermined trust in public health with their response to the coronavirus pandemic, and he pushed back against attempts to create a shadow CDC.\n\u201cDemocrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people\u2019s trust in public health agencies,\u201d he said.\nNixon said the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee \u201cremains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.\u201d\nThe clash over vaccine guidance comes as a new wave of COVID takes hold and flu season nears. In California, some county-level health officials are recommending that residents take greater precautions, such as temporarily wearing masks in indoor public settings. The CDC estimates that as of last week, COVID infections were growing or probably growing in 30 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe increase comes as federal guidance is making it more difficult for people to receive the COVID vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration, which falls under Kennedy\u2019s purview, now requires adults 65 and younger and otherwise healthy \u2014 who say they don\u2019t have an underlying health issue \u2014 to consult with a healthcare provider before getting the shot. Similarly, the CDC requires parents of healthy children to talk to a healthcare provider before their child can receive the COVID vaccine, a barrier the American Academy of Pediatrics called \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued its own COVID vaccine guidance, countering what the CDC recommended, that says all young children 6 months to 23 months should be vaccinated, as well as certain high-risk older children. The group has also said that older children should be offered the vaccine if their parents request it.\nEarlier this year, the CDC changed its vaccine schedule from recommending the COVID vaccine to all pregnant women to offering \u201cno guidance\u201d as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the vaccine. In response, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that people receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point during their pregnancy.\nIt\u2019s not the first time California has created a state safeguard to vet federal vaccine recommendations. In 2020, Newsom created a group of physicians and scientists working at the California Department of Public Health to independently review all newly created FDA-approved COVID vaccines, which were developed during President Trump\u2019s first term in office. The concern at the time was that the White House would rush the approvals under an initiative dubbed Operation Warp Speed.\nThree other states \u2014 Washington, Oregon and Nevada \u2014 quickly joined California\u2019s initiative, which was renamed the Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup and reviewed subsequent versions of the COVID vaccines. The review group returned saying the vaccines were safe and effective.\nNow, amid mounting turmoil at the CDC, California is reviving that playbook, saying the public needs credible information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The three-state effort follows more than 1,000 current and former U.S. Health and Human Services officials calling on Kennedy to resign.\nKennedy is expected to face a bipartisan grilling from the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he had already been scheduled to testify on the president\u2019s healthcare agenda for the coming year. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana and a member of the committee, has vowed \u201coversight\u201d over Kennedy and the agency after expressing concern over his skeptical approach to vaccine policy.\nPeter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco, said that although California\u2019s health alliance with Oregon and Washington is, for now, largely symbolic \u2014 providing an alternative voice to the CDC \u2014 it does risk adding to the polarization of healthcare. It\u2019s paramount, he said, that healthcare practitioners from across the political spectrum come together.\nChin-Hong said other state alliances are also forming, including eight states in the Northeast and a group of healthcare systems in the upper Midwest.\n\u201cWhat you are seeing is people standing up for science \u2014 coming together and bringing people together to give a counter argument to what the CDC is saying,\u201d Chin-Hong said.\nBut things may become more difficult when it comes to funding vaccination programs. He said insurance companies typically follow CDC guidance. If the federal government is not recommending vaccines, it\u2019s unclear how they\u2019ll be covered.\nStill, Chin-Hong noted the challenges of political division and community resistance surrounding immunizations, pointing to Florida\u2019s announcement that vaccines will no longer be mandated in public schools.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all so bananas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like today is \u2018opposite day\u2019 and we\u2019re all in some Dr. Seuss story where nothing is what it seems.\u201d\nJake Scott, an infectious disease physician and clinical associate professor at Stanford School of Medicine, said the alliance could put the three states at risk of retaliation by Trump and his allies.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how this administration uses federal agencies to go after states that won\u2019t fall in line,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThese states are likely looking at reduced federal funding, regulatory harassment, you name it. But honestly, what\u2019s the alternative? The cost of just letting preventable diseases spread, of completely losing public trust in vaccines, of throwing out decades of medical evidence \u2014 that would be catastrophic. From a medical perspective, these states really don\u2019t have a choice here, regardless of the political fallout.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Rong-Gong Lin contributed to this report."

      "text": "Video shows immigration agents interrogating a Latino U.S. citizen: \u2018I\u2019m American, bro!\u2019\n- Share via\nBrian Gavidia was at work on West Olympic Boulevard in Montebello at about 4:30 p.m. Thursday when he was told immigration agents were outside of his workplace.\nGavidia, 29, was born and raised in East Los Angeles and fixes and sells cars for a living. He said he stepped outside. And saw four to six agents.\nWithin seconds, he said, one of them \u2014 wearing a vest with \u201cBorder Patrol Federal Agent\u201d written on the back \u2014 approached him.\n\u201cStop right there,\u201d he said the agent told him. Then the agent questioned whether Gavidia was American.\n\u201cI\u2019m an American citizen,\u201d Gavidia said he told the agent at least three times.\nDespite his responses, the agent pushed him into a metal gate, put his hands behind his back and asked him what hospital he was born in, Gavidia said.\nRattled by the encounter, he said he couldn\u2019t remember the hospital.\nVideo taken by a friend shows two agents holding Gavidia against a blue fence. He tells them they are twisting his arm.\n- Share via\n\u201cI\u2019m American, bro!\u201d Gavidia said in the video.\n\u201cWhat hospital were you born?\u201d the agent asked again, this time recorded in the video.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dawg!\u201d he said. \u201cEast L.A., bro! I can show you: I have my f\u2014ing Real ID.\u201d\nHis friend, whom Gavidia did not name, narrated the video. As the incident continued, he said: \u201cThese guys, literally based off of skin color! My homie was born here!\u201d The friend said Gavidia was being questioned \u201cjust because of the way he looks. \u201c\nGavidia said he gave the Border Patrol agent his Real ID, but the agent never returned it to him. The agent also took his phone and kept it for 20 minutes, he said, before finally returning it.\nEven after the agent saw his ID, Gavidia said, he never apologized. Border Patrol agents arrested a friend of Gavidia\u2019s, Javier Ramirez, and have charged him in a federal criminal complaint with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. Gavidia said he and Ramirez rent space at the tow yard on West Olympic Boulevard to work on cars.\nIn a statement Saturday, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, \u201cthese U.S. citizens were arrested because they ASSAULTED U.S. Border Patrol Agents. Secretary Noem has been clear: if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\nAfter being questioned by a reporter on why Gavidia hadn\u2019t been arrested if he assaulted an agent, McLaughlin clarified that Gavidia was questioned by agents, but that there is no arrest record for him.\nIn a response to an email from The Times, U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not answer questions about the encounter with Gavidia.\nThe agency said in a statement that it is \u201cconducting targeted immigration enforcement in support of ICE operations across the Los Angeles area. Enforcing immigration law is not optional \u2014 it\u2019s essential to protecting America\u2019s national security, public safety, and economic strength.\u201d\nThe statement continued: \u201cEvery removal of an illegal alien helps restore order and reinforce the rule of law.\u201d\nPressed by The Times for answers about that specific encounter, a CBP spokesperson said: \u201cThe statement provided is the only info available about the operation at this time.\u201d\nBut according to the criminal complaint against Ramirez, Border Patrol agents were conducting a \u201croving patrol\u201d in Montebello around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday when they entered a parking lot on West Olympic Boulevard. The lot is fenced and gated, but the gate was open when agents entered, according to the complaint.\nAs an agent engaged \u201cin a consensual encounter\u201d with someone inside the parking lot, authorities allege that Ramirez tried to conceal himself between two nearby vehicles and then began running toward the exit. Ramirez is also accused of pushing and later biting an agent.\nDuring processing, Ramirez was confirmed to be a U.S. citizen, according to the complaint.\nTomas De Jesus, Ramirez\u2019s cousin and his attorney, said immigration agents had entered a private business, \u201cwithout a warrant without a probable cause, to warrant entering into a place like that.\u201d\nDe Jesus said his cousin began alerting people to the presence of the agents. He said he only learned of his cousin\u2019s whereabouts Friday afternoon and said authorities are accusing him of \u201cresisting arrest, assaulting people.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still conducting an investigation to really understand and ascertain the facts of the case,\u201d De Jesus said. De Jesus said he called the Metropolitan Detention Center and identified himself as an attorney wishing to speak with his client, but he was told attorneys were not allowed to see their clients at the moment.\n\u201cI was not given permission, I was not given access to even speak to him on the phone,\u201d he said.\nMontebello Mayor Salvador Melendez, who watched video of the encounter with Gavidia, called the situation \u201cjust extremely frustrating.\u201d\n\u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s no due process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just getting folks that look like our community and taking them and questioning them.\u201d\nMelendez said he got a call from a resident when immigration agents were on Olympic Boulevard. Melendez said he heard they were going out to other locations in the city, too.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going for a specific look, which is a look of our Latino community, our immigrant community,\u201d he said.\nGavidia said his mother is Colombian and his father is Salvadoran. They are American citizens.\n\u201cHe violated my rights as an American citizen,\u201d Gavidia said, his voice shaking with anger as he spoke over the phone from his business Friday. \u201cIt was the worst experience I ever felt. I felt honestly like I was going to die. He literally racked a chamber in his AR-15.\u201d\nGavidia\u2018s clothes were dirty from work, and he said he figured that\u2019s partly why agents questioned him.\n\u201cI\u2019m legal,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak perfect English. I also speak perfect Spanish. I\u2019m bilingual, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I have to be picked out, like, \u2018This guys seems Latino; this guy seems a little bit dirty.\u2019 I\u2019m working, guys. I\u2019m an American. We work. I\u2019m Latino. We work.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s just scary, walking while brown, walking while dirty, coming home from work, there\u2019s a high chance you might get picked up.\u201d\nGavidia said he still doesn\u2019t have his Real ID back. He went to the Department of Motor Vehicles on Friday morning and said immigration agents had stolen his ID. He said he was told he would need to reapply for another one.\n\u201cHe took my ticket to freedom,\u201d Gavidia said."

      "text": "Wildfire burns into historic California Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp\n- Share via\nChinese Camp was once a bustling mining outpost for thousands of immigrants who worked the gold fields of the Southern Sierra. Then it was a historic landmark where tourists could revisit an often-forgotten chapter in California history.\nOn Tuesday, a wildfire raced through the remnants of the Tuolumne County town, raising worries about what has been lost.\nThe destruction came as 22 wildfires erupted Tuesday in multiple locations in Calaveras, Stanislaus and Tuolumne counties during a burst of dry thunderstorms that produced more than 5,000 lightning strikes. The fires, which ranged from a few acres to several thousand acres, together had burned 13,371 acres as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\nThe largest of the fires \u2014 the 6-5 fire \u2014 forced the evacuation of Chinese Camp, a California Gold Rush mining town where thousands of Chinese immigrants settled in the late 1800s. The fire was still uncontained as of Wednesday morning.\nThe extent of the damage in Chinese Camp wasn\u2019t immediately clear pending an official review, said Emily Kilgore, public information officer with the Cal Fire Tuolumne Calaveras Unit. About 61 people still live there.\nVideos shared by local media outlets showed widespread devastation. Smoke billowed up from blackened pavement as flames licked at piles of rubble, power lines snaked across the street.\nChinese Camp began as a distribution center to move supplies out of nearby mining camps, namely from San Francisco to Stockton and then to the camp, according to the Tuolumne Historical Society. By 1856, nearly 600 Chinese people lived in the town, and its population eventually grew to 5,000. By the 1920s, Chinese Camp became a ranching community.\nThe Chinese Camp Store and Tavern, a beloved gathering spot for locals since 1934, appeared to have survived, said Add Beale, who has owned the store with her husband for the past nine years. But she hadn\u2019t yet been to the property to assess the damage.\nBeale spoke from a hotel room after she was forced to evacuate from fast-moving flames that destroyed the homes of several friends, she said. She was hoping to soon return to her store to cook for firefighters and displaced residents and is in touch with others who also want to donate their time, she said.\n\u201cEveryone in the town is like family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know everyone by name.\u201d\nAnother fire \u2014 the 2-7 fire \u2014 destroyed structures in Vallecito, a historic mining town in Calaveras County that\u2019s home to one of the state\u2019s largest caves, Kilgore said.\nThere were no reported injuries or deaths.\nEvacuation orders were also issued for Six Bit Ranch Road, Six Bit Gulch Road, Red Hill Road, Don Pedro Dam Road, Old Don Pedro Dam Road, Menkee Hess Road, all roads east of Highway 108 from Junction 59 to Highway 49, both sides of Highway 120 from Chinese Camp to Highway 120 Bridge, and Rojo Shawmut Road.\nThe fires were each denoted by two numbers \u2014 the first indicating the battalion number associated with the area where it started, and the second the fire\u2019s numerical order, Kilgore said. For instance, the 6-5 fire was the fifth fire to be reported in the sixth battalion, she said.\nThe fires were burning in remote, rugged areas that were difficult for crews to access, Kilgore said. Flames chewed swiftly through parched grass and brush oak woodlands that had received no significant precipitation in months, she said.\nWhile the exact cause of the fires was still being investigated, they ignited during a spate of dry lightning, as afternoon thunderstorms rolled through the area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Jeffery Wood. The weather service recorded 5,282 lightning strikes between Modesto and Shasta County from Tuesday morning to Wednesday, he said.\nDry lightning events are common in the Western United States, said Craig Clements, professor at San Jos\u00e9 State University and director of the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center. They take place when a cloud forms high in the atmosphere and drops rain into very dry air, which causes it to evaporate before hitting the ground, he said.\nThese types of storms have driven some of the state\u2019s most destructive fire years like 2020, when lightning-sparked blazes following a severe heat wave scorched more than a million acres of land and killed at least 22 people.\nPredictions heading into this fire season were similarly dire, with experts cautioning that warm and dry conditions could stoke large fires.\nBut those forecasts have yet to materialize. Fires have so far this year burned 425,680 acres in California, compared with a five-year average of 772,489 to date, according to Cal Fire. That\u2019s in part thanks to a July in which temperatures were below normal across much of the state, Clements said. In fact, Northern California saw the coolest July in 30 years, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s day-to-day weather that drives fire behavior,\u201d he said.\nStill, the temperate stretch was followed by a Labor Day heat wave that helped to dry out plants, priming them to burn. And conditions could continue to shift quickly \u2014 a single intense heat wave or a strong offshore wind season may change everything, Clements noted. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what October is going to bring.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s thunderstorms also resulted in flooding and damage elsewhere in the state. Two people were displaced in Riverside when high winds uprooted a large tree that fell onto a home. Winds damaged a mobile home park in Oxnard.\nMore thunderstorms were expected to develop Wednesday along the higher elevations of the Sierra and Southern Cascade, bringing gusty winds that could hamper firefighting efforts, Wood said."

      "text": "Online sleuths or streaming ghouls? Baby Emmanuel case unleashes army of internet vigilantes\n- Share via\nAttorney Vincent Hughes was swarmed by reporters and self-proclaimed TikTok journalists when he exited the home of Jake and Rebecca Haro, who\u2019d just been arrested on suspicion of killing their infant son, Emmanuel.\nOnlookers heckled him with boos and insults. One man streaming from his phone barked out a question.\n\u201cHow does it feel to defend a murderer?\u201d he said, before turning the camera back on himself and telling his viewers: \u201cI just asked him the question.\u201d\nIn the last couple weeks, the case of missing 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro has been a clarion call for independent journalists, online sleuths and criminal case followers \u2014 some of whom traveled across the country to California to chronicle developments.\nThey have set up lawn chairs outside the Haro home and livestreamed; some have gone up to the door and knocked.\nThe internet sleuths pick apart the trickle of information being released by authorities, often filling in the holes with rumor, speculation and innuendo. (For example, Hughes was Jake Haro\u2019s attorney in a previous criminal case but is not representing him in the one involving Emmanuel.)\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad that at a recent news conference, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco called out the \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d following the case and sharing unverified updates or spreading misinformation.\n\u201cThe problem that we are having ... is someone posts something on social media and then y\u2019all believe that it\u2019s true,\u201d Bianco said.\nThe rise of social media has fundamentally changed the way crime buffs follow high-profile cases. One early example was the Golden State Killer case, where unsolved serial murders around California became an obsession to people across the country and helped push officials to keep focus on and eventually solve the case. The grass-roots detective work was chronicled in Michelle McNamara\u2019s bestseller, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark.\u201d\nWhen Hannah Kobayashi, of Hawaii, went missing after landing at Los Angeles International Airport last year, the internet went to work trying to find her. Their efforts brought global attention to her case, but also caused problems for police and family members. Some sleuths claimed she had been murdered or was the victim of human trafficking. In the end, police said she had left of her own volition and gone to Mexico. No foul play was involved.\nIn the case of Emmanuel, officials expressed their own frustrations with the freelance investigating.\n\u201cThere should be no one out there looking for baby Emmanuel except for us,\u201d Bianco said after some social media broadcasters visited locations relevant to the case, ostensibly to help look for his remains.\n\u201cAll you\u2019re going to do is complicate things in the future,\u201d the sheriff said.\nKamala Harris to get CHP protection after President Trump pulls Secret Service\nIt used to be that people who traded in true crime stories and shared conspiracy theories had to go out of their way to find their material and like-minded people.\n\u201cNow they come to us,\u201d said Whitney Phillips, associate professor of information and media ethics at the University of Oregon\u2019s school of journalism and communications.\nAs more people engage with stories about murder and mystery, social media algorithms designed to keep readers online create a feedback loop of related content, which is where creators jump in to offer updates that grow their audiences.\n\u201cThese kinds of stories about crime, they become content \u2014 which immediately raises all kinds of ethical issues,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBecause what you\u2019re talking about is real-life violence. It\u2019s real-life trauma. It\u2019s real-life destruction of maybe multiple people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nThere are two primary groups of people who interact with true crime content, Phillips said: everyday internet users, and those attempting to build a brand.\nWhen the brutal slaying of four people in an Idaho home by Bryan Kohberger was still a mystery, online sleuths combed publicly available information to identify their own suspects.\nWhen travel vlogger Gabby Petito was killed by her fiance, the case became a launchpad for some true crime influencers.\n\u201cYou had a bunch of people who were just regular people online, who latched onto the story early and they were able to build their brands,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThen they became true crime influencers from that, then branched out and started to engage with more true crime stories and monetize off of that.\u201d\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nThe search for Emmanuel started Aug. 14 when Rebecca Haro, 41, reported her infant missing and said she\u2019d been attacked in a parking lot in Yucaipa while changing her son\u2019s diaper.\nShe told authorities she\u2019d been knocked unconscious and when she came to, Emmanuel was gone, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nBut two days later, authorities announced that Emmanuel\u2019s mother had contradicted herself while talking to investigators and that they were \u201cunable to rule out foul play\u201d \u2014 triggering an avalanche of suspicion onto Rebecca Haro and, soon after, her husband.\nJake Haro, 32, has been on probation after pleading guilty to felony willful cruelty to a child in connection with serious, permanent injuries to his daughter in 2018, according to court records.\nHe pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced to jail followed by time in a work-release program in lieu of four years in prison, records show. But a superior court judge suspended the prison sentence.\nAt a recent news conference, Riverside County Dist. Atty. Mike Hestrin said suspending Haro\u2019s prison sentence had paved the way to Emmanuel\u2019s death.\n\u201cIf that judge had done his job as he should have done, Emmanuel would be alive today,\u201d Hestrin said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame and it\u2019s an outrage.\u201d\nOn Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard towed the fishing boat, Karolee, to Eureka after the vessel traveled nearly 400 miles in the ocean, apparently without a captain or passenger for much of the trip.\nThe Haros made their initial court appearance in Riverside on Aug. 26 to a packed courtroom, a group of reporters and a TV news camera broadcasting the hearing. Although Emmanuel was reported missing in San Bernardino County, authorities said they believe he was the victim of long-term abuse in his home in Riverside County that ultimately led to his death.\nAmong those gathered for the initial hearing was Ahmed Bellozo, a self-described independent journalist who runs the popular TikTok account \u201cOn The Tira,\u201d where he posts daily videos on the Haro case. There is a link to his online store, where he sells shirts, hoodies, hats and stickers. All of the store items were recently sold out.\nVideos on Bellozo\u2019s account show him visiting the Haro home, where he was greeted by fans, an area in Moreno Valley where authorities looked for Emmanuel\u2019s remains and the parking lot in Yucaipa where the baby was reported missing. In one clip, Bellozo interviewed two women who work at the strip mall and asked one if she could provide security camera footage from the day of Emmanuel\u2019s disappearance.\nAsked about the role the media has played in the case, the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department aimed to distinguish between reporting and rumor-mongering.\n\u201cIt is essential to recognize that misinformation, regardless of its source, can create unnecessary fear, confusion, and mistrust within the community,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the important role that journalists play in fact-checking and reporting responsibly. In contrast, the rapid spread of unverified information by social media influencers can lead to reckless speculation that interferes with the pursuit of justice.\u201d\nFamily members of woman who gave birth at Burning Man said she did not know she was pregnant until she went into labor early Wednesday morning.\nAccording to an August Pew Research Center study, about 26% of Americans consider people who post about news on social media \u201cjournalists\u201d while 50% say they are not and 23% aren\u2019t sure.\nOne of those who says he\u2019s trying to do it the right way is Jimmy Williams, a self-described independent journalist from Chesapeake, Va., who runs the true crime YouTube channel Dolly Vision.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out here for three days,\u201d he said outside the Haro home the day of their arrest.\nThe case stood out to him because of the mother\u2019s statements, the father\u2019s past child abuse case and the fact that authorities said they could not rule out foul play.\n\u201cIn a missing kid\u2019s case, there shouldn\u2019t be that many red flags,\u201d Williams said.\nAs an independent journalist and husband to a private investigator, he said, he holds his YouTube channel\u2018s content to a higher standard.\n\u201cSome of these people are a little crazy and they get out there and they start to instigate things and try to create a scene so it brings them more clicks and views,\u201d Williams said of those he doesn\u2019t consider serious journalists.\nWe ranked the 25 best and worst freeways in Southern California, based on traffic, accidents and much more. See the worst roads in Los Angeles.\nA quick search for the hashtag #EmmanuelHaro on social media will produce scores of news clips and videos of commentators opining about the case.\nSince the Haros first appeared in court, Bellozo has created more than a dozen videos.\nHe posted one of himself and a group of people in a parking lot, announcing they\u2019d created their own search party to look for Emmanuel\u2019s remains.\nHe followed that up with a video that, with suspenseful horror music in the background, showed a vehicle driving down the 10 Freeway, with a caption reading: \u201cThis is the road to Emanuel\u2019s house in Cabazon, California,\u201d misspelling the infant\u2019s name.\nEarly on in his coverage, he\u2019d erroneously reported that Emmanuel\u2019s body had been found.\nBellozo winced when asked about the error and said medication he\u2019s taking for his cancer treatment has affected his judgment.\n\u201cThis is taking a toll on me,\u201d he said.\nAfter the couple\u2019s hearing, Bellozo shouted: \u201cHola\u201d at Rebecca Haro as she was led out of the courtroom. It was the same greeting the mother said the alleged kidnapper uttered to her before taking her son.\nA group of sheriff\u2019s deputies briefly detained him.\nOutside the courthouse, Bellozo apologized on camera to his viewers for the outburst. He was then mobbed by fans who wanted to take a selfie and thank him for his work."

Dogs tugged at their leashes.\nWilliam Vazquez moved through the crowd, greeting familiar faces and welcoming new ones. He asked for a show of hands: \u201cWho\u2019s here for the first time?\u201d\nAt least half the group raised their hands. L.A. local Vazquez, who founded We Explore Earth, a nonprofit outdoor group, welcomed and introduced himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time to appreciate, to admire \u2014 but also to harvest,\u201d he told the group, referencing the sturgeon moon rising later that evening. Named after the giant fish once abundant in North American lakes, the sturgeon moon is August\u2019s full moon and has long been associated with seasonal harvests.\n- Share via\nTrash grabbers were handed out as the group crossed the street together to begin the short hike. Like most of We Explore Earth\u2019s outdoor experiences, this one included a cleanup component.\nThe group hosts free community hikes, cleanups and nature experiences across Los Angeles. Its most popular event \u2014 a full moon hike capped with yoga, a sound bath and stargazing \u2014 happens every month, timed to the moonrise, and often draws dozens of newcomers. These experiences rotate between Elysian Park and Griffith Park.\nThe gatherings are open to all ages and experience levels and are substance-free by design. Vazquez caps RSVP numbers at 100, though turnout usually lands between 50 and 60. The hikes are short \u2014 usually one mile up, one mile down \u2014 with 30 minutes of yoga and a 30-minute sound bath under the rising moon.\n\u201cI think a lot of people find their tribe here,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cA lot of them are taking their first steps into nature with us.\u201d\nBefore founding the group, Vazquez worked in the music industry, producing events for artists such as Steve Aoki and on shows such as \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d But after a few years of burnout and depression, he stepped away, unsure of what would come next.\nHe started organizing cleanups and group hikes just for fun at first. But the response was so strong, the demand so clear, that he began building something bigger. Now, We Explore Earth hosts up to 14 events a month. There are intro-to-backpacking workshops, herbal walks, camping trips, trail maintenance projects and more. The group has chapters in New York and San Francisco, and counts REI, Patagonia and Arc\u2019teryx among its sponsors.\nStill, Vazquez runs it all as a volunteer, covering his own bills with side gigs like Instacart delivery and marketing jobs, while applying for grants in hopes of doing this community work full-time. He\u2019s also a certified wilderness first responder, adding an extra layer of preparedness to the group\u2019s outdoor events.\nVazquez has found greater purpose in leading this group and says he will always provide these experiences for free.\n\u201cOur goal is to put on a good experience and pass on knowledge of exploration, conservation and also mindfulness,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, nature\u2019s free. Why would we charge people?\u201d\nYvonne Temal, vice president of We Explore Earth and head of its women\u2019s department, was still catching her breath as she made her way up the hill during the hike. Temal met Vazquez a few years ago while leading her own women\u2019s hiking group. They merged efforts under We Explore Earth.\n\u201cAs we get older, I feel personally like it\u2019s a little harder to find the space, also the comfort level when you\u2019re out in nature,\u201d Temal said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so many stories of women not feeling safe out in the environment, so being able to provide a women\u2019s-only group really helped.\u201d\nTemal has found purpose in giving women the tools to feel safe and empowered outdoors \u2014 tools she wishes she\u2019d had when she was younger.\nDuring a break in the middle of the hike, new volunteer and full moon first-timer Aria Middleman took a seat on a nearby rock. She said that before joining We Explore Earth, she had been completely disconnected from nature.\n\u201cI email all day, every day. I\u2019m behind a screen all day, every day. It gets suffocating,\u201d Middleman said. \u201cScreens haven\u2019t been around forever. What has been around forever is the Earth.\u201d\nWhen a college friend posted about a hike, Middleman decided to join. Although her friend canceled, she went anyway. \u201cI was welcomed with open arms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like I had the space to be a beginner, and the space to be ignorant.\u201d\nShe has since helped with the group\u2019s social media and says the events have transformed how she sees the city. \u201cIt just gets me better familiar with the Greater Los Angeles topology,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it gives me a bit of spirituality.\u201d\nAt the top of the hike, participants laid out yoga mats as the roar of the crowd at Dodger Stadium echoed in the background. For the next hour, they were led through 30 minutes of yoga followed by a 30-minute sound bath as the moon slowly rose above the horizon, and Vazquez began setting up his telescope.\nAs twilight settled in, sisters and We Explore Earth first-timers Abigaille and Sarah Leon sat on a rock, looking out over the city. \u201cI loved it. There was no pressure,\u201d Abigaille said. They had found We Explore Earth on Instagram, unsure of what to expect.\nNow L.A. locals, the sisters are originally from Yucatan, Mexico, where they say the moon holds spiritual significance. As children, their grandmother would ask them to speak to the moon, sharing what they wanted to let go of \u2014 and what they hoped to welcome in. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice, because now we get to do it with other people,\u201d Abigaille said. \u201cThat\u2019s energy \u2014 at least to me.\u201d\nSarah, who sometimes gets anxious about hiking, said she would absolutely do it again. \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure to do anything,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cIt\u2019s very inviting.\u201d\nAs the sun fully set and people waited in line for the telescope, sound practitioner Nicole Johnstone packed up her instruments. She often volunteers her time with We Explore Earth.\n\u201cIt felt like a group exhale,\u201d Johnstone said. \u201cListening to the sound of the Dodgers game and having 100 people just meditating at the top of the city \u2014 I was smiling ear-to-ear.\u201d\nWhen she struggled with grief and mental clutter after losing her father, Johnstone found that sound baths helped her reconnect with herself. Now, she sees the same peace settle over the group each time.\n\u201cI feel like everyone, when I go above their face, I can see a little smile,\u201d she said. \u201cI would do this day in, day out. It feeds me.\u201d\nShe also believes representation matters in the sound-bath space. \u201cIt feels really good being a Black woman in this space \u2014 a Black, tattooed woman,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show up and be myself, not to try to fit into the cookie-cutter yoga beige world.\u201d\nAmong the group was Rico Coria, who said the full-moon hikes and We Explore Earth events have become a grounding routine in his sobriety journey. Now three years sober, Coria said having a social experience that doesn\u2019t center on alcohol has made all the difference.\n\u201cI was looking for things to do that didn\u2019t involve drinking, but also to help mental health,\u201d Coria said.\nHe\u2019s now a regular and has met friends through the group \u2014 even inviting longtime ones to join.\nAs the event wrapped up, Vazquez began leading people back down the trail. A few hikers lingered on their mats, watching the moon rise.\nHe\u2019s seen the group grow every year, especially during the pandemic, when more people began seeking meaning and fresh air.\n\u201cThe perfect person to come,\u201d he said, \u201cis someone who wants to learn more about nature or connect with the community \u2014 someone who wants to find their tribe.\u201d\nSome come for the views. Others come for the yoga, or the telescope or the trash cleanup or a night of sobriety. But most come back for the sense of community.\nThe next full-moon event will be Sunday, Sept. 7. Reservations fill up quickly. Monitor We Explore Earth\u2019s Eventbrite page for up-to-date information."

      "text": "Newsmax sues Fox News, alleging anti-competitive tactics to suppress rivals\n- Share via\nUnderdog conservative channel Newsmax is challenging Rupert Murdoch\u2019s dominant Fox News in court.\nNewsmax sued Fox News parent firm Fox Corp. Wednesday, accusing Murdoch\u2019s television company of anti-competitive behavior designed to squeeze rivals to maintain its \u201cunlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market.\u201d\nFox has \u201cengaged in an exclusionary scheme to increase and maintain its dominance in the market ... resulting in suppression of competition in that market that harms consumers, competition and Newsmax Broadcasting,\u201d the Boca Raton, Fla., firm said in its federal lawsuit filed in Miami.\nPolitically conservative news is big business, and Murdoch has mined that lucrative niche since launching Fox News in 1996 with network architect Roger Ailes. Newsmax launched as an alternative nearly two decades later, in 2014. By that time, Fox News was well established as the go-to outlet for Republicans and other political conservatives.\nIn its 31-page complaint, Newsmax accused Fox of using its market clout to discourage pay-TV distributors from carrying or promoting Newsmax and other rival conservative news outlets. Fox allegedly imposed \u201cfinancial penalties on distributors if they carry Newsmax\u201d in basic cable packages, and other obstacles, including charging higher fees or requiring carriage of \u201clittle-watched channels like Fox Business,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cBut for Fox\u2019s anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier \u2018critical mass\u2019 for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property,\u201d Newsmax said in its lawsuit.\nNewsmax became a publicly traded company earlier this year. It raised $75 million through its initial public offering, but its stock, which entered the market at about $83 a share, closed Wednesday down nearly 1% to $13.84.\nA destination for political conservatives, the Boca Raton, Fla.-based news operation surges after its initial public offering.\nFox News scoffed at the lawsuit.\n\u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can\u2019t attract viewers,\u201d the network said in a statement.\nNewsmax, in its complaint, argued that Fox throws its weight around when striking deals with digital media platforms, including Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV+, Sling TV and YouTube TV, which now make up about 30% of the pay-TV market. As a result, some pay-TV providers have little incentive to carry or promote Newsmax, the lawsuit alleges.\nFox\u2019s commanding position has allowed the company to extract \u201csupra-competitive carriage fees,\u201d according to Newsmax. Fox charges pay-TV distributors nearly $2.20 per subscriber per month to carry Fox News. That\u2019s double CNN\u2019s fees and about six times MSNBC\u2019s carriage fee, Newsmax said.\n\u201cThese inflated costs have been or likely will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Newsmax said in a statement.\nFox News consistently beats CNN and MSNBC in the Nielsen ratings. It was the No. 1 traditional TV network overall this summer, beating ABC, NBC and CBS, according to Nielsen.\nA Deleware judge previously ruled that Newsmax aired false statements about Dominion Voting Systems when reporting on Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims.\nNewsmax also alleged Fox News resorts to intimidation campaigns, including pressuring guests not to appear on Newsmax. \u201cIt also hired private investigators targeting Newsmax executives to damage the company\u2019s credibility,\u201d according to a Newsmax statement.\nNewsmax, in its lawsuit, contends the market is not the universe of cable news channels, including CNN and MSNBC. Instead, it contends the politically conservative news space is a market unto itself, controlled almost entirely by Fox.\n\u201cRight-leaning pay TV news has been a cornerstone of American television, drawing tens of millions of viewers who identify with, or prefer, right-leaning perspectives on politics, current events, and cultural debates,\u201d the Newsmax lawsuit said.\n\u201cA large segment of consumers of political news and media seeks news, commentary, and analysis that aligns with or speaks to their political viewpoints,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThese right-leaning viewers treat other right-leaning news channels as their next best substitute \u2014 and do not consider left-leaning news outlets as adequate substitutes for right-leaning news channels.\u201d\nNewsmax is seeking a jury trial and unspecified financial damages. It also wants a judge to declare Fox\u2019s conduct unlawful under the Sherman Act and Florida\u2019s anti-competition laws and prevent Fox from striking exclusionary contracts.\n\u201cThis lawsuit is about restoring fairness to the market and ensuring that Americans have real choice in the news they watch,\u201d Newsmax Chief Executive Christopher Ruddy said in a statement."

      "text": "- Share via\n- New research based on 22 years of satellite data shows vast areas of the world are losing fresh water and getting drier. These regions include much of the American West, Mexico, Central America and the Middle East.\n- The depletion of groundwater accounts for an estimated 68% of the water loss in the world\u2019s drying regions. And the total water loss in these regions now surpasses mountain glacial melt as a contributor to sea level rise.\nFor more than two decades, satellites have tracked the total amounts of water held in glaciers, ice sheets, lakes, rivers, soil and the world\u2019s vast natural reservoirs underground \u2014 aquifers. An extensive global analysis of that data now reveals fresh water is rapidly disappearing beneath much of humanity\u2019s feet, and large swaths of the Earth are drying out.\nScientists are seeing \u201cmega-drying\u201d regions that are immense and expanding \u2014 one stretching from the western United States through Mexico to Central America, and another from Morocco to France, across the entire Middle East to northern China.\nThere are two primary causes of the desiccation: rising temperatures unleashed by using oil and gas, and widespread overpumping of water that took millennia to accumulate underground.\n\u201cThese findings send perhaps the most alarming message yet about the impact of climate change on our water resources,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist and professor at Arizona State University who co-authored the study. \u201cThe rapid water cycle change that the planet has experienced over the last decade has unleashed a wave of rapid drying.\u201d\nSince 2002, satellites have measured changes in the Earth\u2019s gravity field to track shifts in water, both frozen and liquid. What they sent back shows that nearly 6 billion people \u2014 three-fourths of humanity \u2014 live in the 101 countries that have been losing water.\nEach year, these drying areas have been expanding by an area roughly twice the size of California.\nCanada and Russia, where large amounts of ice and permafrost are melting, are losing the most fresh water. The United States, Iran and India also rank near the top, with rising temperatures and chronic overuse of groundwater.\nFarms and cities are pulling up so much water using high-capacity pumps that much of the water evaporates and eventually ends up as rain falling over the ocean, measurably increasing sea level rise.\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, found that these water losses now contribute more to sea level rise than the more widely understood melting of mountain glaciers or the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets.\nThe staggeringly rapid expansion of the drying regions was surprising even for the scientists. Famiglietti said it is set to worsen in many areas, leading to \u201cwidespread aridification and desertification.\u201d\n\u201cWe found tremendous growth in the world\u2019s land areas that are experiencing extreme drought,\u201d Famiglietti said. \u201cOnly the tropics are getting wetter. The rest of the world\u2019s land areas are drying.\u201d\nThe wave of drying has prompted many people across the world\u2019s food-growing regions to drill more wells and rely more heavily on pumping groundwater.\nThe researchers estimate that 68% of the water the continents are losing, not including melting glaciers, is from groundwater depletion. And much of that water is to irrigate crops.\nWhere aquifer levels decline, wells and faucets increasingly sputter and run dry, people drill deeper and the land can sink as underground spaces collapse.\nThe loss may be irreversible, leaving current and future generations with less water.\nFamiglietti said the potential long-term consequences are dire: Farmers will struggle to grow as much food, economic growth will be threatened, increasing numbers of people will flee drying regions, conflicts over water are already increasing, and more governments will be destabilized in countries that aren\u2019t prepared.\nThe researchers estimated that the world\u2019s drying regions have been losing 368 billion metric tons of water per year. That\u2019s more than double the volume of Lake Tahoe, or 10 times Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States.\nAll that water, year after year, has become a major contributor to sea level rise, which is projected to cause worsening damages in the coming decades.\nPrevious studies have shown dropping groundwater levels, dry regions getting drier and these water losses contributing to sea level rise. But the new study shows these changes are happening faster and on a larger scale than previously known.\n\u201cIt is quite alarming,\u201d said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an Arizona State research scientist who co-authored the study. \u201cWater touches everything in life. The effects of its irreversible decline are bound to trickle into everything.\u201d\nHe likened the global situation to a family overspending and drawing down their savings accounts.\n\u201cOur bank balance is consistently decreasing. This is inherently unsustainable,\u201d Chandanpurkar said.\nThe draining of groundwater, often invisible, hides how much arid regions are drawing down their reserve accounts, he said. \u201cOnce these trust funds dry out, water bankruptcy is imminent.\u201d\nThe researchers examined data from two U.S.-German satellite missions, called Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On.\nThe scientists ranked California\u2019s Central Valley as the region where the fastest groundwater depletion is occurring, followed by parts of Russia, India and Pakistan.\nIn other research, scientists have found that the last 25 years have probably been the driest in at least 1,200 years in western North America.\nOver the last decade, groundwater losses have accelerated across the Colorado River Basin.\nAnd farming areas that a decade ago appeared in the satellite data as hot spots of drought and groundwater depletion, such as California\u2019s Central Valley and the Ogallala Aquifer beneath the High Plains, have expanded across the Southwest, through Mexico and into Central America.\nResearchers identify western U.S. and Central America as one of four \u2018mega-drying\u2019 regions\nThese regions including large parts of Canada and Russia; southwestern North America and Central America; and a giant interconnected drying region spanning from North Africa to Europe, through the Middle East to northern China and Southeast Asia.\nChange in total water storage, 2003-24\nUTAH\nNEV.\nCALIF.\nN.M.\nARIZ.\nTEXAS\n500 MILES\nMEXICO\nDetail\nUTAH\nNEV.\nCALIF.\nN.M.\nARIZ.\nTEXAS\n500 MILES\nMEXICO\nDetail\nModel data are from February 2003 to April 2024.\nChandanpurkar, Famiglietti, et al., (2025)\nSean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES\nThe satellite data show that these and other regions are not only shifting to drier conditions on average, but are also failing to \u201clive within the means\u201d of the water they have available, Chandanpurkar said.\n\u201cThe truth is, water is not being valued and the long-term reserves are exploited for short-term profits,\u201d he said.\nHe said he hopes the findings will prompt action to address the chronic overuse of water.\nIn the study, the researchers wrote that \u201cwhile efforts to slow climate change may be sputtering,\u201d people urgently need to take steps to preserve groundwater. They called for national and global efforts to manage groundwater and \u201chelp preserve this precious resource for generations to come.\u201d\nIn many areas where groundwater levels are dropping, there are no limits on well-drilling or how much a landowner can pump, and there is no charge for the water. Often, well owners don\u2019t even need to have a meter installed or report how much water they\u2019re using.\nGroundwater depletion is worsening in many of the world\u2019s farming regions. But a global study also found that some efforts are helping to boost aquifers.\nIn California, farms producing vast quantities of nuts, fruits and other crops have drawn down aquifers so heavily that several thousand rural households have had their wells run dry over the last decade, and the ground has been sinking as much as 1 foot per year, damaging canals, bridges and levees.\nThe state in 2014 adopted a landmark groundwater law that requires local agencies to curb widespread overpumping. But it gives many areas until 2040 to address their depletion problems, and in the meantime water levels have continued to fall.\nState officials and local agencies have begun investing in projects to capture more stormwater and replenish aquifers.\nArizona has sought to preserve groundwater in urban areas through a 1980 law, but in much of the state, there are still no limits on how many wells can be drilled or how much water can be pumped. Over the last decade, out-of-state companies and investors have drilled deep wells and expanded large-scale farming operations in the desert to grow hay and other crops.\nFamiglietti, who was previously a senior water scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has extensively studied groundwater depletion around the world. He said he doesn\u2019t think the leaders of most countries are aware of, or preparing for, the worsening crisis.\n\u201cOf all the troubling findings we revealed in the study, the one thing where humanity can really make a difference quickly is the decision to better manage groundwater and protect it for future generations,\u201d Famiglietti said. \u201cGroundwater will become the most important natural resource in the world\u2019s drying regions. We need to carefully protect it.\u201d"

      "text": "From Waitress to an \u2018American Idol\u2019\n- Share via\nIn a glitzy Hollywood production accented by fireworks, red, white and blue confetti and wild applause, Texas cocktail waitress Kelly Clarkson was crowned \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d the winner of the Fox Television talent show that has become a cultural phenomenon.\nClarkson beat out runner-up Justin Guarini by 58% to 42% in a viewer poll that registered more than 15 million calls Wednesday night after a singing showdown between the two.\nDuring the nationally televised variety show broadcast live from the Kodak Theatre, an overflow, wildly enthusiastic audience roared with approval as Clarkson was named winner. Her eyes welling with tears, Clarkson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d then let out several shrieks of delight as she belted out one final song.\nThe two faced off with each taking a turn singing the two songs slated for the first single--the ballad \u201cBefore Your Love\u201d and the more up-tempo love song \u201cA Moment Like This\u201d--as well as a song of their choice. The showdown was witnessed by a capacity crowd at the venue, and a national TV audience of more than 18 million, the show\u2019s largest audience since its June debut.\nThough the performances by Guarini and Clarkson were greeted with loud cheers and standing ovations, Clarkson appeared to have the edge. The 20-year-old Texan received the lion\u2019s share of praise from the show\u2019s three judges--music executive Simon Cowell, singer/choreographer Paula Abdul and record producer Randy Jackson. Cowell declared near the end of the show that Clarkson should be named \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d\nFor the season, the interactive show generated more than 100 million calls from viewers voting for their favorite singers.\nDespite the popularity that has recently surrounded the show, \u201cIdol\u201d-mania is expected to ramp up even further in the next few weeks with the release of the winner\u2019s first single and a national tour featuring the 10 finalists. Numerous other \u201cIdol\u201d-related ventures also are planned.\nPlans for the inevitable \u201cAmerican Idol 2\u201d are being finalized, although executives at Fox and FreemantleMedia, which produced the show, hope to get it on the air as early as January.\nSome contract details still need to be worked out.\nFox had only limited expectations for the show when it went on the air in early summer. Although its predecessor, \u201cPop Idol,\u201d was a sensation in Britain when it aired this year, spawning a handful of No. 1 hit singles, Fox executives had slated the series as a youth-oriented, low-cost stopgap during the summer.\nThey didn\u2019t think they could dare run it during the more competitive TV season from mid-September until about Memorial Day each year.\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d to take off, adding viewers each week and gradually rising in the ratings until it became the most watched show the last couple of weeks.\nThe show benefited from its combination of telegenic contestants, popular songs, a harsh British judge (Cowell) and a call-in poll that drew viewers into the process."

      "text": "He was delivering strawberries in L.A. when Border Patrol stopped him. \u2018The wrong place at the wrong time\u2019\n- Share via\nThe strawberry delivery driver was making his last drop-off in Little Tokyo, unloading nearly a dozen boxes onto the sidewalk outside the Japanese American National Museum.\nInside the building, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies were holding a news conference about a Democratic Party plan to fight back against President Trump\u2019s efforts to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives through redistricting in Texas.\nAngel Rodrigo Minguela Palacios knew nothing of the powerful men\u2019s clash as he stacked cardboard boxes filled with ripe, red fruit Thursday morning. He also didn\u2019t know that dozens of Border Patrol agents were massing nearby.\nMinguela was caught between the two spectacles. His life was about to be upended.\nIn the days that followed, Newsom accused the Trump administration of trying to intimidate the president\u2019s political opponents by sending the immigration agents. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin has said the agents were \u201cfocused on enforcing the law,\u201d not on Newsom.\nNewsom has since submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records from the administration about why agents arrived at the museum as he was announcing his latest skirmish with the president.\nFor Minguela, who has been in the country for close to a decade, that day felt a lot more personal. He was arrested by Border Patrol agents and now faces deportation back to Mexico. Speaking from behind a plexiglass window at the \u201cB-18\u201d federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, Minguela stressed that he is not a criminal.\n\u201cOne comes here to work, not commit crimes,\u201d said Minguela, who wore the same red T-shirt and jeans he\u2019d been arrested in four days prior.\nWhen asked last week whether the person arrested outside the news conference had a criminal record, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the agency would share a criminal rap sheet when it was available. After four follow-up emails from a reporter, McLaughlin on Saturday said agents had arrested \u201ctwo illegal aliens\u201d in the vicinity of Newsom\u2019s news conference \u2014 including \u201can alleged Tren de Aragua gang member and narcotics trafficker.\u201d\nAsked twice to clarify whether the alleged gang member and narcotics trafficker were the same person, Homeland Security officials did not respond. But when presented with Minguela\u2019s biographical information Monday, the department said he had been arrested because he overstayed his visa \u2014 a civil, not criminal, offense.\nBorder Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino told Fox News on Friday that operations were based on intelligence about the alleged Tren de Aragua gang member. They arrested that man two blocks away from Newsom\u2019s news conference.\nTwo law enforcement sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak with the media told The Times that they had received word from federal authorities that Little Tokyo had been targeted because of its proximity to the Newsom event.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Times that though agents \u201cintended to intimidate the Governor and community leaders, the brunt was born, as it always is, by people who believe in the American dream.\u201d\nFor those who know Minguela, it felt like mala suerte \u2014 bad luck.\nAs Martha Franco, one of Minguela\u2019s employers, put it, \u201cHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\n::\nLike every other weekday, Minguela rose before the sun to start his 2 a.m. delivery route Thursday. He had around eight places to hit.\nHe\u2019d worked for the same produce company for around eight years and never missed a day.\nThat day, Minguela left his partner and their three children \u2014 ages 15, 12 and 6 \u2014 asleep in their home, hours before the kids would head off for their first day of school. His partner, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, had worked the night before as a cashier at a liquor store. She did not get off work until about 12:30 a.m. She brought him coffee as he started his day.\nShortly before 6 a.m., Minguela called his partner to wake her up so she could take the kids to school. Throughout the morning, they checked in with each other on how the day was progressing.\nShe called to warn him about immigration agents at Slauson and Miles avenues in Huntington Park. Over the last couple of months, as immigration raids became a part of daily life, the couple\u2019s world had slowly shrunk.\nMinguela had overstayed a tourist visa after fleeing the Mexican state of Coahuila in 2015 because of violence he faced there, his partner said. She said he had worked servicing ATMs there, was kidnapped twice and at one point was stabbed by people intent on stealing the money. After his employers cut staff, she said, he lost his job, helping drive his decision to leave.\nBecause he was undocumented, he rarely went out, leaving the house only for work and errands. Minguela began wondering whether it was even safe for him to pick up the kids from school, his partner said. He planned ahead, made copies of his keys and left money for his family in the event that he was grabbed by immigration agents.\nThat morning, he reassured his partner he was fine. He was heading to his last stop at a tearoom in Little Tokyo.\n\u201cTen mucho cuidado,\u201d his partner told him.\nBe very careful.\n::\nThe Border Patrol agents descended on 1st Street in Little Tokyo about 11:30 a.m., just as Newsom\u2019s news conference got underway.\nThey were decked out in camouflage and helmets, their faces obscured by black masks. One wore an American flag neck gaiter. They were armed, some with AR-15-style weapons.\nBorder Patrol agents arrested at least one person, who a coworker said was delivering strawberries, outside of Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s event in Little Tokyo.\nNearby, Minguela was busy unloading several boxes of strawberries and a box of apples. He didn\u2019t notice the agents until they were close behind him. Then, he ducked back inside the van.\nA video shared with The Times shows at least eight Border Patrol agents as they passed the van, its side door wide open. They did not stop. Then, one appeared to double back and peek inside.\nMinguela said he feels he was targeted based on his physical appearance.\nWhen the agent began asking him questions, Minguela said he pulled a red \u201cknow your rights\u201d card out of his wallet and handed it to the agent.\n\u201cThis is of no use to me,\u201d he said the agent told him. Another agent soon joined them.\nMinguela told them he didn\u2019t have to talk. But they kept asking questions, he said. What was his nationality? What was his name? Did he have papers?\n\u201cThey demanded I show them some kind of identification,\u201d he said. \u201cInsisting, insisting.\u201d\nThe agents were armed, and Minguela said he grew scared. Believing he had no choice, Minguela said, he gave one of the agents his California driver\u2019s license.\nMinguela tried to call his partner twice, but she was at a doctor\u2019s appointment and couldn\u2019t answer. At 11:22 a.m., he sent her three WhatsApp messages:\n\u201cAmor ya me agarr\u00f3 la migra..no te preocupes.\u201d\n\u201cTodo va a estar bien.\u201d\n\u201cDiosito nos va a ayudar mucho.\u201d\nImmigration had gotten him, he said, but everything would be fine. God would help them, he assured her.\nMinguela sent her a picture of an agent holding his license and seemingly plugging the information from it into a phone. Then, the agent arrested him.\nVideo captured Minguela, hands cuffed behind his back, as the agent linked an arm through his. He walked Minguela away from the van, toward Bovino.\nAfter conferring with colleagues, the agent walked Minguela back toward his delivery van. Bovino patted the agent on the back and said, \u201cWell done.\u201d\nAt about the same time, one of Minguela\u2019s employers, Isaias Franco, received a call from Little Tokyo warning him about the immigration activity. He immediately called Minguela, whose cell number is saved in his phone under \u201cpaisa,\u201d countryman. Both hail from the Mexican city of Torre\u00f3n.\nNo answer.\nIsaias Franco texted him, trying to tell him what was unfolding.\nBy that time, though, Minguela was already in handcuffs.\n::\nHours before visitation began at the detention center in downtown L.A. on Monday, families began lining up along a driveway where \u201cB-18\u201d was stamped in black on a concrete wall.\nSomeone had scrawled on the ground in chalk: \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d and \u201cViva La Raza.\u201d Another message read, \u201cCivil disobedience becomes a duty when the state becomes lawless and corrupt.\u201d\nBy 11:30 a.m., 18 people were waiting for visitation to start at 1 p.m. In less than an hour, that number had ballooned to 33.\nThey include three siblings there to visit their uncle who had been arrested at a car wash in Long Beach the day before. A woman whose uncle was taken from a Home Depot in Pasadena. Two sisters whose loved one had been arrested at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in.\nThey carried bags of medication and sweaters for detained loved ones, because they\u2019d heard it was cold inside. Each person hoped to get in before visitation ended at 4 p.m., although it seemed increasingly unlikely for those at the back of the line.\nMartha and Isaias Franco, Minguela\u2019s employers, were among the hopeful. It was their third attempt to see him. The day of Minguela\u2019s arrest, they got there too late.\nThe next day, they arrived earlier and were in luck. On the advice of others in line, they brought a jacket to keep Minguela warm.\nIn the years they\u2019ve employed Minguela, they\u2019ve only ever seen his serious, professional side. But during the five minutes they got to visit with him Friday, he spent most of it in tears, hardly able to speak.\nThe couple assured him they would help however they could.\nThey returned Monday, this time bringing a blue Ralph Lauren shirt and a pair of black New Balance socks so he could change clothing. Isaias and the couple\u2019s son, Carlos, had both come, despite starting their workday at 2 a.m.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be with him until the end,\u201d Martha Franco said. \u201cHe\u2019s part of our family. He\u2019s one of us.\u201d\nAs the hours wore on, people in line squatted or sat on the concrete to rest their aching legs. Martha Franco flitted around, advising people to bring sweaters for loved ones and letting them know the officers allowed in only one item of clothing for each detained person.\nBy the start of visitation, 44 people were in line. Martha Franco was No. 19. Families exited red-eyed, tears dripping down their cheeks after getting only a few minutes with their loved ones.\nAbout 3 p.m., after waiting three and a half hours, the Francos handed the officer their passports and identification, before finally making it inside. They had to turn off their phones. They could give Minguela only the T-shirt. The officer said no to the socks, a prohibited second item of clothing.\nMinguela beamed when he saw the Francos, who greeted him through the plexiglass window. He was trying to maintain his spirits, but said he felt \u201cimpotente.\u201d Powerless.\nThe Francos told him not to sign anything.\n\u201cVamos a estar con usted,\u201d Isaias told Minguela, letting him know they would be with him. He and Carlos fist-bumped Minguela through the Plexiglass.\n\u201c\u00c9chale ganas,\u201d Isaias added, keep going.\n::\nMinguela\u2019s children have hardly stopped crying since his arrest.\nDuring the eight years he and his partner have been together, he\u2019s helped raise her two children and their 7-year-old son, who is autistic.\nMinguela\u2019s lawyer, Alex Galvez, said the hope is that his client will be released on bond, as he initially entered the country lawfully and is the primary breadwinner for the family. The lawyer said he believes Minguela was arrested in defiance of a federal judge\u2019s order that immigration authorities cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u201cIt was a political opportunity. He was one of the two guys picked up right during Newsom\u2019s press conference,\u201d Galvez said. \u201cThey had to show something for it.\u201d\nJust days before his arrest, Minguela\u2019s family had celebrated his 48th birthday. His partner made him his favorite dish, shrimp ceviche.\nHer birthday was Tuesday. The family had planned to go on a rare outing for a dinner of enchiladas de mole.\nBut they spent the day without him. There was no celebration.\nThe children asked their mother, as they have every day for nearly a week: When is pap\u00e1 coming home?\nTimes staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report."

Milliken said the university is facing \u201cone of the gravest threats in UC\u2019s 157-year history\u201d after the Trump administration cut off more than $500 million in grants to UCLA before demanding a $1.2-billion fine over allegations of campus antisemitism.\nMilliken outlined the potential losses at the nation\u2019s preeminent public university system under Trump\u2019s higher education agenda in his strongest and most detailed public words since starting the job Aug. 1, days after funding troubles hit UCLA.\nUC \u201creceives over $17 billion per year from the federal government \u2014 $9.9 billion in Medicare and Medicaid funding, $5.7 billion in research funding, and $1.9 billion in student financial aid per year,\u201d Milliken wrote in the letter addressed to Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), chair of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. If such funds were lost, Milliken wrote, \u201cwe would need at least $4-5 billion per year to minimize the damage.\u201d\nUCLA is in conflict with the Trump administration, which has frozen federal grants and demanded a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will sue.\n\u201cA substantial loss of federal funding would devastate our university and cause enormous harm to our students, our patients, and all Californians. Classes and student services would be reduced, patients would be turned away, tens of thousands of jobs would be lost, and we would see UC\u2019s world-renowned researchers leaving our state for other more seemingly stable opportunities in the US or abroad.\u201d\nMilliken, who met with lawmakers in Sacramento last month, penned his message in response to an Aug. 31 letter from Wiener and 33 other legislators, who urged UC leaders to \u201cnot to back down in the face of this political shakedown\u201d from President Trump, whose actions the lawmakers said were \u201can extortion attempt and a page out of the authoritarian playbook.\u201d\nIn a statement about the letter, a UC spokesperson said the university \u201cis committed to working with leaders in Sacramento and across the country to ensure we have the resources we need to continue generating jobs, life-changing discoveries, and economic opportunity in the face of historic challenges.\u201d\nIn addition to grant cuts and the $1.2-billion fine demand from UCLA, the Trump administration has also proposed sweeping changes at the Westwood campus. They include the release of detailed admissions data \u2014 the government accuses UCLA of illegally considering race when awarding seats \u2014 restrictions on protests, and an end to race-related scholarships and diversity hiring programs. The Department of Justice has also called for a ban on gender-affirming care for minors at UCLA healthcare systems.\nThe Trump administration accuses UCLA of violating civil rights law by not taking antisemitism seriously. Although there have been complaints of antisemitism on campus since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza, a number of influential faculty members, staff and students, including many in the Jewish campus community, have said UCLA has made progress on addressing the campus climate.\n\u201cFree speech, academic freedom, scientific research, and democracy are values that have led to Jewish flourishing. These attacks on California, on our immigrant communities, on science, and on LGBTQ people stand in stark contrast to Jewish values,\u201d Wiener wrote in the letter whose signatories included members of California Legislative Jewish Caucus, of which Weiner is co-chair.\nThe Trump administration has proposed the University of California pay more than $1 billion to settle antisemitism charges and restore frozen grant funding at UCLA. Newsom says the state will sue.\nWiener\u2019s letter urged UC leaders to fight the government\u2019s demands as the university negotiates with the DOJ.\n\u201cAcceding to these reprehensible demands won\u2019t stabilize the UC system; it will betray our values of protecting and celebrating our most vulnerable communities. Giving in will only encourage further unconstitutional behavior by this administration,\u201d said the letter, addressed to Milliken, the UC Board of Regents and UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk.\n\u201cConcessions by UCLA would establish a damaging precedent for extorting public schools in states with leadership that does not bow down to this President,\u201d Wiener and others wrote, who described federal demands as \u201cextortion,\u201d echoing statements by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\u201cWe must resist Trump\u2019s extortion to protect public higher education, the economy, our students and California\u2019s values,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\nAlthough the university has engaged with the Trump administration to restore UCLA funding, no settlement has been reached and there is a wide gulf between the two sides on what terms would be acceptable.\nNewsom has called the government\u2019s proposed fine \u201cransom,\u201d saying he wants UC to sue the administration and not \u201cbend the knee\u201d to Trump.\nBut the decision over a lawsuit rests with the independent UC Board of Regents. The governor has appointed many but not all of the regents and sits as a voting member on the 24-person board. Newsom can exercise political sway over its moves but, aside from his vote, has no formal power over the body\u2019s decisions."

      "text": "- Share via\nAmerica, your front yard has been militarized. Yet residents and visitors there hardly pay the troops any mind.\nIt\u2019s the normalization of excessive federal force under President Trump, just seven months into his reign.\nAmerica\u2019s Front Yard is what the National Park Service calls the National Mall, the grassy expanse that knits together the neighborhood that\u2019s home to the U.S. Capitol and the iconic monuments to Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt; veterans of World War II, Vietnam and Korea; and Martin Luther King Jr.\nFor decades I jogged here (one morning literally running into Jimmy Carter, long gone from the White House). I introduced friends and family to the Mall\u2019s delights and the museums that open onto it. I attended festivals, concerts and Fourth of July fireworks displays. On a gorgeous, sunny Labor Day this year, I returned. And for the first time, I saw armed, camo-clad soldiers among the tourists.\nAs I left the World War II memorial, five soldiers emerged nearby, marching in single-line formation to join about two dozen more beside three vans under trees near the Reflecting Pool. At the pool\u2019s opposite end, nearer the Lincoln Memorial, another dozen soldiers milled. Tourists mostly ignored the shows of force, except for the two park policemen on horseback along separate sides of the Reflecting Pool. Tourists wanted photos with them.\nAs I approached the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, five more soldiers circled a statue dedicated to women who served in Vietnam. The men studied the sculpted figures and read the inscriptions \u2014 just like tourists.\n\u201cThey\u2019re bored,\u201d a park ranger told me. \u201cThey\u2019d rather be home with their families.\u201d\nI and most Washingtonians (8 out of 10, according to a mid-August poll for the Washington Post) also would rather have them home with their families, wherever home is. Six states headed by Republican governors, ever-eager to please Trump, have sent hundreds of National Guard troops to supplement those from blue Washington, who, unlike in the states where governors hold sway, are under the president\u2019s direct command.\nHeading to a restroom on my way to the Tidal Basin and Jefferson Memorial, I passed three hulking black SUVs. Despite their darkened windows, I could vaguely make out men inside. Only the vehicles\u2019 license plates identified them: \u201cDHS,\u201d Department of Homeland Security, the tip of Trump\u2019s antimigrant spear. Perhaps these secret agents were awaiting a dispatcher\u2019s call to nab another Latino delivery driver or raid another restaurant\u2019s kitchen to drive up the numbers for Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\nWhat you see out in the open \u2014 2,200 uniformed soldiers and additional federal agents patrolling the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 is bad enough. It\u2019s what you don\u2019t see, or can\u2019t identify, that\u2019s more disturbing in the land of the free. Like masked agents in unmarked cars stopping and searching residents without evident reason, as videos on social media regularly capture.\nEither way, Trump\u2019s takeover of the District of Columbia using National Guard troops and federal agents from the DHS, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and from the FBI and other agencies \u2014 together with his threats to Chicago, Baltimore and other cities \u2014 amount to \u201ccreating a national police force with the President as its chief,\u201d as a federal judge proclaimed this week in ruling against troops acting as cops in Los Angeles.\n\u201cWhy is the National Guard still around?\u201d an exasperated Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer (brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer) demanded last month during a trial in the L.A. case. \u201cWhat is the threat today? What was the threat yesterday or two weeks ago that allowed it? I\u2019m trying to see whether there are any limits, any limits to the use of a federal force.\u201d\nThose were my questions in Washington as well, during my Labor Day stroll and a drive through downtown and various higher-crime neighborhoods.\nThat same day, Trump boasted on social media that, three weeks into his policing of the nation\u2019s capital, Washington is \u201cNOW A CRIME FREE ZONE.\u201d Yet he\u2019s vowed to keep boots on the ground beyond a legal 30-day limit next week, which would require Congress\u2019 assent.\nThe fact is that Washington, like any city, still has crime, though the rate was at a 30-year low before Trump\u2019s executive order Aug. 11 citing a nonexistent \u201ccrime emergency,\u201d and it\u2019s fallen more since then, as Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged. The issue isn\u2019t whether there is crime that needs to be policed. It\u2019s who does the policing. In America, that\u2019s historically been the states and local jurisdictions \u2014 unless, as federal law requires, they prove incapable of doing so. Which they haven\u2019t.\nIf more police is an answer to crime, as Bowser and most mayors of either party would agree, then Trump should quit cutting federal funding \u2014 Washington is short a full $1 billion in this fiscal year \u2014 and instead do what former President Clinton did amid high crime in the mid-1990s: increase money to states and cities to hire more local cops. That helped in Clinton\u2019s time, if not so much as he liked to claim.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that Trump\u2019s bid to take charge in U.S. cities extends mostly to states led by Democrats, despite high or higher crime in red state cities including Memphis, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Louisville, Jackson and Birmingham. Sending red-state troops to police unfamiliar blue cities can only exacerbate polarization. So does a president who spurs on those troops and agents by denigrating U.S. cities as \u201cunsafe and dirty and disgusting\u201d (Washington), \u201chell holes\u201d (Chicago and Baltimore) and \u201cterrible\u201d (L.A.).\nThis is not normal, not in America\u2019s front yard or anywhere else in this nation. Nor will it ultimately be accepted, as Trump takeovers spread and protests expand with them. I fear this is just what the Great Divider wants: an excuse to dispatch more troops.\nBluesky: @jackiecalmes\nThreads: @jkcalmes\nX: @jackiekcalmes\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nArmed National Guard troops patrolling the National Mall represents an unprecedented militarization of America\u2019s symbolic \u201cfront yard,\u201d marking a disturbing departure from democratic norms where tourists now encounter camouflaged soldiers among the monuments and memorials that define the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe deployment constitutes excessive federal overreach given that Washington\u2019s crime rate had already reached a 30-year low before the president\u2019s executive order citing a nonexistent \u201ccrime emergency,\u201d demonstrating that local law enforcement was effectively managing public safety without military intervention.\nThis federal takeover violates America\u2019s historical principle that policing remains a state and local responsibility unless jurisdictions prove incapable of maintaining order, which has not occurred in Washington despite the administration\u2019s claims of uncontrolled crime.\nThe strategy deliberately targets Democratic-led cities while ignoring comparable or higher crime rates in Republican-controlled urban areas, creating dangerous political polarization by deploying red-state National Guard troops to police unfamiliar blue cities they may view with hostility.\nRather than militarizing cities, effective crime reduction requires increased federal funding for local police departments, following the successful model of the 1990s when federal support helped cities hire more community-based officers who understood their neighborhoods.\nDifferent views on the topic\nThe National Guard deployment follows established legal precedent, as federal law grants presidents authority to activate Guard units to protect federal personnel and property, similar to operations during inaugurations and the January 6, 2021 riots[1].\nThe 800 activated National Guard members serve primarily in support roles, providing law enforcement agencies with logistics, transportation, and administrative assistance rather than direct combat operations, with only 100 to 200 troops visible on streets at any given time[1].\nMilitary personnel carry weapons only under strict rules of engagement that authorize force solely as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm, while troops assigned to administrative duties remain unarmed[2].\nThe federal intervention addresses the administration\u2019s stated policy goal of making the District of Columbia \u201csafe, beautiful, and prosperous by preventing crime, punishing criminals,\u201d through enhanced enforcement of quality of life and public safety laws across federal properties including the National Mall and Memorial Parks[3].\nThe visible military presence serves a deterrent function around national monuments and tourist areas, with Army officials explaining that being present at national monuments constitutes part of their official assignment to support public safety[1]."

      "text": "\u2018The Paper\u2019 is a spot-on commentary about the sad state of American journalism. But you\u2019ll laugh.\n- Share via\n\u201cThe Paper,\u201d premiering Thursday on Peacock, is a belated spinoff of \u201cThe Office,\u201d much as Peacock is a sort of spinoff of NBC, where the former show aired on Thursdays from 2005 to 2013. In the new series, Dunder Mifflin, the office in \u201cThe Office,\u201d has been absorbed into a company called Enervate, which deals in office supplies, janitorial paper and local newspapers, \u201cin order of quality.\u201d The newspaper at hand is the Toledo Truth Teller, sharing space with the toilet paper division.\nCreated by \u201cOffice\u201d developer Greg Daniels with Michael Koman, \u201cThe Paper\u201d is shot in the same documentary style, ostensibly by the same fictional crew, and imports \u201cOffice\u201d player Oscar N\u00fa\u00f1ez as head accountant Oscar Martinez, not at all happy to be back on camera.\nIn the first episode, Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), a starry-eyed journalism school graduate turned cardboard salesman turned toilet paper salesman, arrives as the new editor in chief of the Truth Teller, not exactly taking charge of a staff that consists entirely of narcissistic interim managing editor Esmeralda Grand (Sabrina Impacciatore), whose sole prior media experience is as a contestant on a dating reality show called \u201cMarried at First Sight\u201d; ad salesman Detrick Moore (Melvin Gregg); subscriptions person Nicole Lee (Ramona Young); compositor Mare Pritti (Chelsea Frei), who wrote for \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d; accountants Adam Cooper (Alex Edelman) and Adelola Olofin (Gbemisola Ikumelo); and Duane Shepard Sr. as Barry Stokes, the only official reporter, whose beat consists of high school sports and falling asleep. In the sitcom logic of the show, they will all be drafted as volunteer journalists, joined by Travis Bienlien (Eric Rahill), from the toilet paper division.\nTimes television critic Robert Lloyd and news and culture (and former television) critic Lorraine Ali have worked in many newspaper and magazine offices between them, and come together here to discuss how \u201cThe Paper\u201d compares to \u201cThe Office,\u201d its journalistic veracity and whether or not it\u2019s funny.\nAli: I\u2019ll start with my favorite quote about journalism from \u201cThe Paper\u201d: \u201cThe industry is collapsing like an old smoker\u2019s lung.\u201d Hack, hack, cough, I say from inside the beast. This half-hour comedy offered so many great moments of spot-on commentary about the state of legacy journalism that I wasn\u2019t sure if I should weep or laugh. I chose the latter, most of the time. The first couple episodes are clever, funny and charmingly clumsy \u2014 if not too close to the bone for folks like us. I\u2019ll get to the rest of the series in a minute, but how did the satire about a contracting newsroom strike you, Robert?\nLloyd: There are a couple of moments in the pilot episode where it flashes back to an old black-and-white documentary on the Truth Teller in an earlier age when 1,000 people worked for the paper, before the internet destroyed print journalism and the newspaper, which once occupied a whole building, and was eventually reduced to sharing a corner of a floor with the toilet paper division. It gave me a little shock. I feel like I caught the end of that analog era, at the L.A. Weekly, when it was a thin, then a fat alternative paper, and the Herald Examiner, where there were typewriters that must have been sitting there since the \u201930s, a sort of piratical \u201cFront Page\u201d energy and tons of talent. (Much of which migrated to The Times when the Herald folded.)\nAli: I felt a tinge of sadness and loss watching those flashback scenes. Then they cut to present day, and the marbled halls of the once-great Truth Teller newspaper are empty. What struck me is how much the fictional paper\u2019s lobby looked like the old Globe Lobby of the L.A. Times\u2019 building downtown. I also got a lump in my throat when they went down into the basement where the old giant presses sat frozen. We had those relics in the old Times building too. For readers who don\u2019t know, the L.A. Times hasn\u2019t been in that landmark building since 2018. We\u2019re now in El Segundo. Sounds like a great setup for a sitcom joke, right?\nThe Irish actor stars as an idealistic editor in chief of a Midwest newspaper that he\u2019s trying to revive with the help of his ragtag staff.\nLloyd: Most \u2014 all? \u2014 newspapers have felt the stress of shrinking staffs and resources, of doing more with less. But the Truth Teller starts with almost nothing \u2014 that it comes out at all, apparently daily, is something of a joke in itself; at least Ted Baxter was the only knucklehead working at WJM on \u201cMary Tyler Moore,\u201d but there are more than a few of them here. \u201cThe Office\u201d wasn\u2019t about the work, but about surviving the environment. It didn\u2019t really matter what did or didn\u2019t get done. But this is a show about a business \u2014 a noble institution, however ignobly served \u2014 with deadlines, some of which one would rightly regard as impossible, having met hundreds, if not thousands, in one\u2019s life \u2014 even without a skeleton crew that has no idea what it\u2019s doing. But it just sort of wishes them away. Then again, it is a sitcom.\nThe jokes are well-timed and reliably funny, but like \u201cThe Office,\u201d it\u2019s all down to the characters, which are wonderful company. Oscar, of course, we already know and love. But I especially liked Gregg as the soft-edged Detrick, with an awkward crush on the wry Nicole. Ned, whom the Irish Gleeson plays like someone out of a Frank Capra pastiche, can be a little competitive, but he\u2019s no Michael Scott; neither is he exactly Jim to Mare\u2019s Pam, though obviously they occupy a similar position, being relatively normal and attractive. But as the One Who Needs to Be Noticed, Impacciatore\u2019s Esmeralda does have more than a little Michael Scott in her, though turned up to 11, insanely glamorized and in an Italian accent. It\u2019s a hilarious performance. Her delighted scrolling through a thicket of ads on a clickbait article on a tip Brad Pitt left someone is a little comic gem. It\u2019s not unlike the way Janelle James pops out as Ava on \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d\nAli: It\u2019s impossible not to compare \u201cThe Paper\u201d to \u201cThe Office.\u201d It\u2019s unfair yet inevitable, and \u201cThe Office\u201d wins, though my favorite version of that show was the British version with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. But I do like what Gleeson does in \u201cThe Paper\u201d with Ned Sampson, portraying him as an enthusiastic editor in chief born about 50 years too late to experience the Woodward and Bernstein glory days of print journalism. The deflated expression on his face is priceless when he advises his lost \u201creporters\u201d to rely on the Five Ws of reporting, and one asks, \u201cIs that a gang?\u201d Gleeson has an impressive range. He was haunting as the conflicted foodie/serial killer in psychological thriller \u201cThe Patient,\u201d where he co-starred, ironically, with Steve Carell. I also really like Young as Nicole, who I admittedly had an affinity for as a drama club nerd in \u201cNever Have I Ever.\u201d\nMy issue with \u201cThe Paper\u201d isn\u2019t the cast, but the pacing. It starts off strong. The first two episodes are filled with sharp writing and build a strong foundation for what we expect to see: the hilarity of an inexperienced, underdog staff turning a local rag into a real source of news. But the momentum doesn\u2019t quite sustain. I felt myself losing interest in the story as the series progressed because their ensuing assignments, setbacks and interpersonal trajectories weren\u2019t all that compelling.\nI do, however, appreciate that \u201cThe Paper,\u201d like \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d mines the tragic humor of a crumbling American institution while also pointing out that this thing is happening under our noses, and shouldn\u2019t we do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to save it? Turning that tragedy into a sitcom is one answer."

      "text": "- Share via\nFor a century, it worked, and brilliantly. The \u201cCalifornia model\u201d rested on massive investments in higher education, development of industrial zones in places such as the South Bay and Silicon Valley, and persistent upgrading of basic infrastructure.\nYet the system that made California dynamic and prosperous for so long is now broken and backward-looking. The state still provides ample opportunities for technological and financial elites but leaves behind a broad spectrum of the middle and working classes.\nThis failure is reflected in the state\u2019s poverty and unemployment rates (both the highest in the nation), and its tepid job growth. Meanwhile other states \u2014 Texas, Florida, Arizona, the Carolinas and Tennessee, for example \u2014 have copied the California model and they have done it, as Californians once did, based on the goal of lifting up all classes. Long reactionary in their politics and social structure, these states\u2019 business-friendly policies now have something to teach the progressive Golden State.\nThe Trump administration is talking about buying stock in Intel and starting a sovereign wealth fund. There isn\u2019t a dumber, more irresponsible financial idea swirling around in Washington.\nThe defense and aerospace industries are showcases for California\u2019s problem and missed opportunities. The state still leads in numbers of aerospace engineers and creates cutting-edge technologies. But once companies develop products based on all that innovation, they\u2019ve tended to move the manufacturing, with its high paying blue-collar jobs, elsewhere, chasing fewer regulations, cheaper energy and a less expensive cost of living.\nTake Jet Zero, which makes fuel-efficient planes. The company, based in Long Beach, is ready for prime time, with large orders for its new planes. But those jets will be built in Greensboro, N.C., in a $4.7-billion plant employing more than 14,000 people over the next decade. The company also plans to move its headquarters to Greensboro when the plant is finished.\nElon Musk\u2019s story is well-known. The space economy is expected to be worth trillions, but Musk\u2019s rocket company has already decamped in large part from California to Texas. Space X and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin have built large test facilities in Brownsville and Van Horn, Texas, bringing a blue-collar bonanza to traditionally poor regions. And Space X is rumored to be investing upward of $1 billion to turn the Astrodome in Houston into its Mission Control Alpha.\nEven companies that plan to stay headquartered in California are making big investments elsewhere. Anduril, a fast growing tech-driven defense company, designs its systems in Orange County but has announced plans to build a 4,000-job plant in Ohio and is also expanding its operations in Mississippi.\nA new report from the Brookings Institution think tank examines AI adoption, talent and innovation in 387 metropolitan areas.\nThis pattern should alarm the state\u2019s leaders who seem more concerned with boosting green energy, fighting Trump and saving Hollywood. Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi has been pushing for a space commission, as exists in Texas and Florida, but so far to no effect. The California Coastal Commission\u2019s recent rejection of Space X\u2019s request to double launches at Vandenberg Space Force Base, ostensibly over environmental questions, is another sign that the state\u2019s focus is anywhere but on aerospace.\nThe loss of potential new aerospace investment is tragic. Imagine if Anduril\u2019s and Jet Zero\u2019s plants were going up in Fresno, Bakersfield, San Bernardino or Modesto \u2014 areas afflicted with high levels of poverty. Manufacturing remains the key to productivity growth, packs a far higher multiplier effect on local economies than retail, trade or finance and generally pays far higher wages.\nYou might hope that California\u2019s tech sector would make up for the loss, one of many in a long decline in industrial jobs in the states. But in tech too, California is losing to emerging players. The Computing Technology Industry Assn. 2024 assessment found that Texas led in new tech jobs, with Florida second, and Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina making significant gains. California, not surprisingly, isn\u2019t high on the association\u2019s list of states projected to enjoy the biggest growth in the sector over the next decade.\nThe AI craze has intensified in the \u2018gold rush town\u2019 of San Francisco, spreading through work and social life.\nArtificial intelligence and Washington-pushed chip manufacturing could prove a new source of growth, and at the very least create capital gains needed to boost the state\u2019s poor fiscal position. However, California\u2019s highest in the nation energy prices , tough land-use regulations and lack of blue-collar skills education discourage the construction of new data centers by the likes of Nvidia and Samsung.\nTo be sure, the Bay Area is an AI startup epicenter but this is likely to offer opportunities for the investor class, a handful of entrepreneurs and well-compensated \u201cgenius\u201d programmers, not middle- and working-class Californians.\nIs there hope for a recovery? San Francisco city economist Ted Egan suggests President Trump\u2019s tariffs, with their emphasis on electronic goods, could help make California an ideal place for \u201creshoring\u201d various kinds of aerospace, computer and other tech manufacturing, but only if the California model is modernized to suit these industries\u2019 land use and energy needs.\nAnd there are California entrepreneurs \u2014 bred to look at and shape the future \u2014 who are not ready to abandon the state\u2019s reservoir of expertise and talent, and who are committed to making things as well as developing concepts. \u201cWe\u2019re inventing the new factory town, and recovering the sense of what works in America,\u201d says Cameron Schiller, whose Rangeview Corporation startup uses 3-D technology to make castings for the metal parts used in aerospace, one of dozens of industrial startups in the former aerospace stronghold of El Segundo.\nTo revive the California model, we need dedicated visionaries and an evolving workforce, but mostly we need state government to remember what it means to be willing and able to help the visionaries and the workers succeed.\nJoel Kotkin is a contributing writer to Opinion, the presidential fellow for urban futures at Chapman University and senior research fellow at the Civitas Institute at the University of Texas, Austin.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

      "text": "Fears of racial profiling rise as Border Patrol conducts \u2018roving patrols,\u2019 detains U.S. citizens\n- Share via\nBrian Gavidia had stepped out from working on a car at a tow yard in a Los Angeles suburb Thursday when armed, masked men \u2014 wearing vests with \u201cBorder Patrol\u201d on them \u2014 pushed him up against a metal gate and demanded to know where he was born.\n\u201cI\u2019m American, bro!\u201d 29-year-old Gavidia pleaded, in video taken by a friend.\n\u201cWhat hospital were you born?\u201d the agent barked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dawg!\u201d he said. \u201cEast L.A., bro! I can show you: I have my f\u2014ing Real ID.\u201d\nHis friend, whom Gavidia did not name, narrated the video: \u201cThese guys, literally based off of skin color! My homie was born here!\u201d The friend said Gavidia was being questioned \u201cjust because of the way he looks.\u201d\nIn a statement Saturday, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. citizens were arrested \u201cbecause they ASSAULTED U.S. Border Patrol Agents.\u201d (McLaughlin\u2019s statement emphasized the word \u201cassaulted\u201d in all-capital and boldfaced letters.)\n- Share via\nWhen told by a reporter that Gavidia had not been arrested, McLaughlin clarified that Gavidia had been questioned by Border Patrol agents but there \u201cis no arrest record.\u201d She said a friend of Gavidia\u2019s was arrested for assault of an officer.\nAs immigration operations have unfolded across Southern California in the last week, lawyers and advocates say people are being targeted because of their skin color. The encounter with Gavidia and others they are tracking have raised legal questions about enforcement efforts that have swept up hundreds of immigrants and shot fear into the deeply intertwined communities they call home.\nAgents picking up street vendors without warrants. American citizens being grilled. Home Depot lots swept. Car washes raided. The wide-scale arrests and detainments \u2014 often in the region\u2019s largely Latino neighborhoods \u2014 contain hallmarks of racial profiling and other due process violations.\nFederal agents in riot gear detained workers in the Garment District in downtown Los Angeles as crowds gathered to record them and shout protests.\n\u201cWe are seeing ICE come into our communities to do indiscriminate mass arrests of immigrants or people who appear to them to be immigrant, largely based on racial profiling,\u201d said Eva Bitran, a lawyer at ACLU of Southern California.\nWhen asked about the accusations of racial profiling, the White House deflected.\nCalling the questions \u201cshameful regurgitations of Democrat propaganda by activists \u2014 not journalists,\u201d White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson chided Times reporters Saturday for not reporting the \u201creal story \u2014 the American victims of illegal alien crime and radical Democrat rioters willing to do anything to keep dangerous illegal aliens in American communities.\u201d\nShe did not answer the question.\nMcLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cAny claims that individuals have been \u2018targeted\u2019 by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.\u201d\nShe said the suggestion fans the flames and puts agents in peril.\n\u201cDHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know who we are targeting ahead of time. If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement is trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability.\n\u201cWe will follow the President\u2019s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America\u2019s streets,\u201d she said.\nThe unprecedented show of force by federal agents follows orders from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s immigration plan and a Santa Monica native, to execute 3,000 arrests a day. In May, Miller reportedly directed top ICE officials to go beyond target lists and have agents make arrests at Home Depot or 7-Eleven convenience stores.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not answer specific questions about the encounter with Gavidia and said that immigration enforcement has been \u201ctargeted.\u201d The agency did not explain what is meant by targeted enforcement.\nBut a federal criminal complaint against Javier Ramirez, another of Gavidia\u2019s friends, said Border Patrol agents were conducting a \u201croving patrol\u201d in Montebello around 4:30 p.m. when they \u201cengaged a subject in a consensual encounter\u201d in a parking lot on West Olympic Boulevard. The complaint noted that the parking lot is fenced and gated, but that, at the time of the interaction, the gate to the parking lot was open.\nThe enforcement was part of a roving patrol in what John B. Mennell, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said was a \u201clawful immigration enforcement operation\u201d in which agents also arrested \u201cwithout incident\u201d an immigrant without legal status.\nGavidia said he and Ramirez both rent space at the tow yard to fix cars.\nOn video captured by a security camera at the scene, the agents pull up at the open gate in a white SUV and three agents exit the car. At least one covers his face with a mask as they walk into the property and begin looking around. Shortly after, an agent can be seen with one man in handcuffs calmly standing against the fence, while Ramirez can be heard shouting and being wrestled to the ground.\nGavidia walks up on the scene from the sidewalk outside the business where agents are parked. Seeing the commotion, he turns around. An agent outside the business follows him and then another does.\nGavidia, whom Mennell identified as a third person, was detained \u201cfor investigation for interference (in an enforcement operation) and released after being confirmed to be a U.S. citizen with no outstanding warrants.\u201d\n\u201cVideo didn\u2019t show the full story,\u201d he said in a statement.\nBut it is unclear from the video exactly what that interference is. And Gavidia denies interfering with any operations.\nCustoms and Border Protection, the agency that has played a prominent role in the recent sweeps, is also under a federal injunction in Central California after a judge found it had engaged in \u201ca pattern and practice\u201d of violating people\u2019s constitutional rights in raids earlier this year.\nU.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino, who oversaw raids that included picking people up at Home Depot and stopping them on the highway, has emerged as a key figure in L.A. He stood alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday at a news conference where Sen. Alex Padilla \u2014 the state\u2019s first Latino U.S. senator \u2014 was handcuffed, forced to the ground and briefly held after interrupting Noem with a question.\nFederal immigration sweeps have spread fear and uncertainty across the region and forced some into hiding.\n\u201cA lot of bad people, a lot of bad things are in our country now,\u201d Bovino said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here right now, is to remove those bad people and bad things, whether illegal aliens, drugs or otherwise, we\u2019re here. We\u2019re not going away.\u201d\nBovino said hundreds of Border Patrol agents have fanned out and are on the ground in L.A. carrying out enforcement.\nA federal judge for the Eastern District of California ordered Bovino\u2019s agency to halt illegal stops and warrantless arrests in the district after agents detained and arrested dozens of farmworkers and laborers \u2014 including a U.S. citizen \u2014 in the Central Valley shortly before President Trump took office.\nThe lawsuit, brought by the United Farm Workers and Central Valley residents, accused the agency of brazen racial profiling of people in a days-long enforcement. It roiled the largely agricultural area, after video circulated of agents slashing the tires of a gardener who was a citizen on his way to work, and it raised fears that those tactics could become the new norm there.\nThe effort was \u201cproof of concept,\u201d David Kim, assistant chief patrol agent under Bovino, told the San Diego investigative outfit Inewsource in March. \u201cTesting our capabilities, and very successful. We know we can push beyond that limit now as far as distance goes.\u201d\nBovino said at the news conference that his agents were \u201cnot going anywhere soon.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see us in Los Angeles. You\u2019ll continue to see us in Los Angeles,\u201d he said.\nBitran, who is working on the case in the Central Valley, said Miller\u2019s orders have \u201cset loose\u201d agents \u201cwith a mandate to capture as many people as possible,\u201d and that \u201cleads to them detaining people in a way that violates the Constitution.\u201d\nIn Montebello, a 78% Latino suburb that shares a border with East Los Angeles, Border Patrol agents took Gavidia\u2019s identification. Although they eventually let him go, Ramirez, also American and a single father of two, wasn\u2019t so lucky.\nTomas De Jesus, Ramirez\u2019s cousin and his attorney, said authorities are accusing him of \u201cresisting arrest, assaulting people\u201d after agents barged into a private business \u201cwithout a warrant, without a probable cause.\u201d\nImmigration raids Friday led to the arrests of dozens of people and caused hours of chaos in downtown L.A. Here is what we know so far.\n\u201cWhat is the reasonable suspicion for him to be accosted?\u201d De Jesus questioned. \u201cWhat is the probable cause for them to be entering into a private business area? ... At this moment, it seems to me like they have a blanket authority almost to do anything.\u201d\nRamirez has been charged in a federal criminal complaint with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. Authorities allege that Ramirez was trying to conceal himself and then ran toward the exit and refused to answer questions about his identity and citizenship. They also allege he pushed and bit an agent.\nDe Jesus said Ramirez \u201cwas not attempting to flee, he did not assault anyone, and he raised his hands when confronted by CBP.\u201d He added: \u201cHe is the victim, not the aggressor.\u201d\nMontebello Mayor Salvador Melendez said he\u2019d watched the video of Gavidia being questioned and called the situation \u201cextremely frustrating.\u201d\n\u201cIt just seems like there\u2019s no due process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going for a specific look, which is a look of our Latino community, our immigrant community. They\u2019re asking questions after. ... This is not the country that we all know it to be, where folks have individual rights and protections.\u201d\nA third individual was detained on the street for investigation for interference and released after being confirmed to be a U.S. citizen with no outstanding warrants.\nEven before the video was looping on social media feeds, Angelica Salas \u2014 who heads one of the most well-established immigration advocacy groups in Los Angeles \u2014 said she was getting reports of \u201cindiscriminate\u201d arrests and American citizens being questioned and detained.\n\u201cWe have U.S. citizens who are being asked for their documents and not believed when they attest to the fact that they are U.S. citizens,\u201d said Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights. \u201cThey just happen to be Latino.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court has long held that law enforcement officers cannot detain people based on generalizations that would cast a wide net of suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.\n\u201cSome of the accounts I have heard suggest that they\u2019re just stopping a whole bunch of people, and then questioning them all to find out which ones might be unlawfully present,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law School.\nAn agent can ask a person about \u201canything,\u201d he said. But if the person declines to speak, the agent cannot detain them unless they have reasonable suspicion that the individual is unlawfully here.\n\u201cThe 4th Amendment as well as governing immigration regulations do not permit immigration agents to detain somebody against their will, even for a very brief time, absent reasonable suspicion,\u201d he said.\nJust being brown doesn\u2019t qualify. And being a street vendor or farmworker does not, either. A warrant to search for documents at a work site also is not enough to detain someone there.\n\u201cThe agents appear to be flagrantly violating these immigration laws,\u201d he said, \u201call over Southern California.\u201d\nGavidia said the agents who questioned him in Montebello never returned his Real ID.\n\u201cI\u2019m legal,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak perfect English. I also speak perfect Spanish. I\u2019m bilingual, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I have to be picked out, like, \u2018This guy seems Latino; this guy seems a little bit dirty.\u2019\n\u201cIt was the worst experience I ever felt,\u201d Gavidia said, his voice shaking with anger as he spoke from the business Friday. \u201cI felt honestly like I was going to die.\u201d\nOn Saturday, Gavidia joined De Jesus in downtown L.A. for his first-ever protest.\nNow, he said, it felt personal.\nTimes staff writer Andrea Castillo contributed to this report."

      "text": "This California highway is a lifeline, and deadly. Can it be fixed before it falls into the sea?\n- Share via\n- A combination of climate change and natural erosion is thought to be threatening the highway, vital for school buses, emergency services and local businesses.\n- \u201cLast Chance Grade and Highway 101 isn\u2019t just a road \u2014 it\u2019s a lifeline,\u201d said state Senate President Pro Tem Sen. Mike McGuire, who represents the north coast.\nDEL NORTE COUNTY, Calif. \u2014 In March 1972, Kurt Stremberg\u2019s parents gave him a predawn ride from their house in northwest California to his friend\u2019s home in the tiny town of Klamath, about 20 miles south of Crescent City on Highway 101.\nStremberg, then 24, and his buddy were going to hitch a ride on a log truck bound for San Francisco, catch a flight to Europe, and see the world.\nHis parents, Edwin and Aili Stremberg, said a quick goodbye, then started driving home. It was still dark. And raining hard.\nIn the few minutes it had taken to drop their son off, a landslide-plagued portion of the highway \u2014 ominously named Last Chance Grade \u2014 had crumbled. The Strembergs\u2019 Ford sedan went over the cliff, killing them both.\n- Share via\nFor decades, residents of California\u2019s remote northwest corner have been pleading with government officials to do something about Last Chance Grade, an eroding, three-mile stretch of highway hugging the fog-shrouded cliffs between the redwood forest and the Pacific Ocean.\nIt is a critical thoroughfare \u2014 the only viable route linking Crescent City, a tsunami-prone town of 6,200 people, with neighboring Humboldt County and the rest of the state.\nBut 53 years after the Strembergs\u2019 death, the two-lane road is still perilous. Perched atop four active landslides, its pavement warped and cracked by constant land movement, Last Chance Grade is so unstable that it was reduced to one-way traffic for nine years straight, reopening in October 2023. Last week, it was down to one lane again.\n\u201cYou look at the kind of problems we\u2019ve had over the years, you\u2019d think there would be some kind of movement,\u201d said Stremberg, now a 77-year-old real estate agent living in Crescent City. \u201cIt was ignored, as long as a lane of the highway could stay open. We need a solution to something that\u2019s been a problem forever.\u201d\nNow, after decades of patching holes and building retaining walls \u2014 temporary repairs that have cost more than $125 million since 1997 \u2014 the California Dept. of Transportation has settled on a long-term solution: a 6,000-foot tunnel through the redwoods that would bypass Last Chance Grade\u2019s fast-eroding cliffs.\nIt would become the longest highway tunnel in California, far surpassing the 4,233-foot Wawona Tunnel in Yosemite National Park that was built in 1933. Running between 100 and 400 feet below ground, it would be engineered to absorb and dissipate land movement at the southern entrance.\nThe Last Chance Grade Tunnel would cost $2.1 billion \u2014 an eye-popping amount that Caltrans and elected officials say they are still trying to figure out how to fund.\nAfter years of debating numerous alternatives \u2014 including maintaining Last Chance Grade as-is, rerouting it farther inland, and using dewatering wells to slow the landslide \u2014 Caltrans settled on the costly tunnel plan last year.\nIf funding can be cobbled together, construction is expected to begin as early as 2030, with the tunnel potentially opening by 2038.\nThis summer, the California Transportation Commission allocated $40 million to formally kick off the project\u2019s design phase. California State Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Democrat who represents the North Coast, has called the funding a \u201cmajor milestone,\u201d noting that $50 million had already been invested in environmental reviews.\nBut the process, McGuire has said, has taken too long.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, if the biggest highway in the Bay Area or L.A. kept falling into the Pacific, the problem would have been fixed long ago,\u201d McGuire said in a statement to The Times. \u201cLast Chance Grade and Highway 101 isn\u2019t just a road \u2014 it\u2019s a lifeline. And every truckload of goods, every visitor to the redwoods, and every emergency response depends on reliable access through this critical corridor.\u201d\nResidents and elected officials say it has been an ongoing struggle to draw outside attention to Last Chance Grade, despite its long-known dangers, because the region is so remote and economically depressed.\nDel Norte County is home to just 27,000 people. The median household income of $66,780 is just 70% of the state median of $96,334.\nThe industries that once defined the place, logging and fishing, have either collapsed or are struggling. And there is not much room to grow, since more than 80% of the county\u2019s land is under state or federal control, mostly as parks, national forests or wildlife preserves.\nA 2018 Caltrans study concluded that an emergency one-year full closure of Last Chance Grade would devastate the region, resulting in the loss of up to 3,800 jobs and $456 million from the local economy.\nHere, residents and elected officials say it is difficult to compete with critical infrastructure projects in wealthier, more populated places such as the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where ground movement has turned Palos Verdes Drive South into an asphalt roller coaster near President Trump\u2019s golf course, and coastal Monterey County, where landslides have kept portions of the tourist-heavy Highway 1 near Big Sur closed for more than two years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so rural up here, and we tend to be forgotten,\u201d said Del Norte County Supervisor Valerie Starkey, who added that every time Last Chance Grade is closed then reopened, \u201cwe\u2019re all just waiting for it to fail again.\u201d\nHighway 101 is the only viable route between Crescent City and Klamath, population 800 or so. When Last Chance Grade is closed, the only alternative \u2014 aside from steep, unpaved logging roads \u2014 is a 449-mile, eight-hour detour circling through Redding and southern Oregon.\nA tsunami that followed a powerful earthquake off the coast of Russia on July 29 caused $1 million in damage to Crescent City Harbor, initial estimates show.\nMany children in Klamath attend school in Crescent City and rely upon the campus\u2019s free meals. So when rocks and mud buried Last Chance Grade in February 2021, Starkey said, school employees hauled lunches to the base of the landslide and handed them to Caltrans crews to take across to kids on the other side.\nShe added that Klamath residents must traverse the road to reach the small hospital in Crescent City \u2014 and that residents there use it to access specialized medical care, including chemotherapy and opioid addiction treatment, more than 80 miles south in Humboldt County.\nStarkey said the $2.1 billion price tag for the tunnel is daunting, but \u201cwe\u2019re just hoping this is a better option fiscally\u201d in the long run.\nA spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) \u2014 who put together a Last Chance Grade stakeholder group comprising local agencies, Indigenous tribes, businesses and environmental groups a decade ago \u2014 said he hopes to get some federal funding through the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Mega Grant Program for major, complex projects.\nYet the prospects of the Trump administration supporting the project are uncertain at best. The president and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom are locked in seemingly unending political battles, and Trump has already tried to claw back funding for more high-profile California transportation initiatives, including its high-speed rail project.\nLast Chance Grade \u2014 first built as a wagon trail through the dense redwood forest in 1894 \u2014 was built in its current alignment between 1933 and 1937. Before the work began, an engineer noted that the road would be expensive to maintain because of the constant land movement, and while it was being built, \u201cmany slipouts and slides occurred, delaying construction,\u201d according to a 2015 project feasibility study commissioned by Caltrans. An alternate route to the east was considered, but then dropped because of costs and state park resources.\nSince the 1930s, portions of Last Chance Grade have shifted 40 feet horizontally and 30 feet vertically, said Jaime Matteoli, the Last Chance Grade project manager for Caltrans. The movement, he said, has accelerated over the last decade, with some sections of the road now moving several feet a year toward the sea.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of real estate,\u201d Matteoli said. \u201cWhether you believe in climate change or not, this situation is getting worse and worse, the coastal erosion and the landslide.\u201d\nCrews have built more than two dozen retaining walls to prop up the roadway over the last three decades, he said. But those have shifted, cracked and broken, too, and need their own constant repairs.\nAs Matteoli drove the curves of Last Chance Grade last week, construction workers appeared out of the thick morning fog like neon-vested ghosts. Their work can be dangerous, he said. During the 2021 landslide, three workers were seriously injured when a tree crashed down the hillside, including a Caltrans engineer who lost part of her foot.\nThe highway runs through Redwood National and State Parks, a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tunnel construction would result in the loss of 16 old-growth redwood trees wider than 4 feet, in addition to other trees, Matteoli said.\nSteve Mietz, president and chief executive of Save the Redwoods League, a century-old conservation group, said the cutting of any such trees is a loss. But in an email, he said that the tunnel \u201cwas among some of the least environmentally harmful options\u201d for Last Chance Grade.\nHarlan Watkins, who helps manage Crescent City\u2019s Battery Point Lighthouse, a beloved tourist stop, said he believes the tunnel project could be a boon for the region, especially if the state hires locals to help build it, providing much-needed jobs.\nAs a former volunteer with the Del Norte County sheriff\u2019s search and rescue team, Watkins, 69, has pulled numerous people off the slopes of Last Chance Grade.\nHis first rescue was in the early 1990s \u2014 an older man who was driving drunk, pulled over to urinate, stepped out of his vehicle and tumbled down the cliff. Watkins descended the slope with a rope and harness to find the man, who had cut his nose \u2014 and forgot to zip his pants back up \u2014 but was otherwise fine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a treacherous road,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cBut if that road goes out, this town will dry up pretty quick.\u201d\nStremberg eventually did make his trip to Europe. It included a stop in Finland \u2014 the country from which his late parents emigrated when he was a toddler. After he returned, he wanted nothing more than to avoid Last Chance Grade. But \u201cit\u2019s difficult to ignore it when you have to drive over it all the time,\u201d he said.\nFor several years, he said, his own adult son was the principal of an elementary school in Klamath, driving to and from home in Crescent City.\n\u201cI always felt bad with him driving it on a daily basis,\u201d Stremberg said, \u201cbut there wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d\nStremberg, who supports the tunnel, said most people in town feel relieved there is momentum for a long-term fix, though they are frustrated that construction is still years away. Disaster has forced quicker construction even in this remote place, he said.\nIn December 1964, when Stremberg was in high school, a major flood wiped out a Highway 101 bridge over the Klamath River, as well as much of the eponymous town.\nStremberg was on the basketball team in Crescent City at the time. With the bridge out, the boys rode a bus to the river, boarded jet boats, and met another bus on the other side of the water to reach their rivals\u2019 gyms south of Klamath.\n\u201cThey rebuilt the bridge in a year\u2019s time,\u201d Stremberg said. With Last Chance Grade, \u201cit\u2019s very frustrating because you look at it and go, \u2018OK, if this were [considered] a real issue, it could be done more rapidly.\u2019 \u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nEverything in Luchita Hurtado\u2019s life belonged to a daily practice.\nHer artwork was, of course, a major part of that routine. But her need to express herself often took forms beyond the canvas. She kept shelves full of journals which documented her day-to-day life and tracked all her dreams \u2014 never excluding the most mundane moments, from what she ate for lunch to taking her car to the mechanic. Her living spaces were delicately curated, with indigenous artifacts, rocks and leaves she would pick up on her walks and vintage wind-up toys. And no matter the occasion, Hurtado led this intentional lifestyle wearing a wardrobe she crafted entirely for herself.\nThe Venezuelan-born painter lived in a utilitarian uniform of sorts. She designed all kinds of pieces, from striped vests and floor-length dresses to lightweight pants and winter coats. But almost every silhouette was inspired after a specific design she used for almost all her shirts: a boxy shape with four front pockets and partial buttons, similar to a smock. Seemingly inspired by Japanese workwear, Hurtado wore these oversize, functional looks for around 80 years.\nInside a Gardena warehouse, where her and her husband Lee Mullican\u2019s estates are housed, racks hang from the high ceilings. It\u2019s the first time her personal wardrobe is being shared with the public in this capacity. Surrounded by packaged canvases, drawers of sketches and displayed family photos, Hurtado\u2019s clothes are color-coded, labeled and tagged with identifiers. There are dozens of her favored shirt form, each made from the same sewing pattern in colors ranging anywhere from beige to a deep magenta. Other racks hold the matching skirts and pants as well as stylized denim shawls and double-breasted, patchwork coats she made for special occasions.\nHurtado\u2019s \u201cuniform,\u201d though, wasn\u2019t without modifications. Once she figured out her signature boxy silhouette, she experimented from there. Some were made from colorful tweed, iridescent fabric or patterned upholstery material. The shirts, though of the same shape, varied between full button-ups and a more pop-over style with a few buttons. Some tops had no buttons at all. She would sometimes use erratic stitching to pattern her clothes or reversible patterns to give a rolled sleeve a bigger pop.\n\u201cShe was somebody that didn\u2019t want to settle for what was around her and made her own path for everything,\u201d says Cole Root, the director of Hurtado and Mullican\u2019s estates. He worked with Hurtado, as a registrar, from 2017 until 2020, when she died. Now, he helps carry on the two artists\u2019 legacies.\nThough Hurtado created art throughout her almost 100-year life, she didn\u2019t start to gain mainstream recognition until her 90s. In her last years, she was able to see her paintings fill places like LACMA, the Hammer Museum and London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery.\nOver the summer, Hauser & Wirth\u2019s downtown L.A. gallery opened \u201cYo Soy\u201d (on view through Oct. 5), a more expansive look into Hurtado\u2019s first solo exhibition at the Woman\u2019s Building in 1974. The show is centered around her \u201cLinear Language\u201d series, where Hurtado abstracted various words into geometric shapes and patterns to create a new kind of portrait. Some of the paintings are brightly colored and spell out many hidden words like \u201cmouth,\u201d \u201calone\u201d or \u201cchild.\u201d\nShe writes in the original artist statement: \u201cI had a good response to the show but no one saw the letters, the messages. Just the color and energy. It didn\u2019t seem important that they were not fully seen and I thought it superfluous to explain.\u201d\nWhile leading a tour of the show, Root even joked about how it\u2019s taken him years to spot some of the camouflaged words.\nFrom her repetitious linework to her paintings of blue skies with surrealist feathers and self-portraits of her fragmented nude body, Hurtado\u2019s art is marked by her sense of experimentation and constant changes in style. At the heart of all her work lies her deep interest in what it means to be human and exist in nature.\nThe poignance of Gaines\u2019 practice lies in his ability to form entirely new, generative structures \u2014 a mindset with profound implications beyond art-making.\nBut before settling into art, Hurtado got her start with clothes \u2014 roots that she at first rejected yet returned to throughout her life.\nShe was born in Maiquet\u00eda, Venezuela, where her mother was a seamstress and her father a representative for Singer sewing machines. It was initially her grandmother who taught Hurtado to sew, as it was a skill most Venezuelan girls acquired during childhood. Hurtado\u2019s early moments of solitude and daydreaming were often interrupted by her grandma, who would tell her that \u201cidle hands tempt the devil\u201d and then guide Hurtado through undoing and restitching the hem on her favorite dress. Hurtado then immigrated to New York City in 1928, when she was 8.\nFor high school, the aspiring artist attended Washington Irving, one of the first women\u2019s vocational schools in the city. Her family was under the impression she was studying dressmaking and following in the steps of her family. It wasn\u2019t until after graduation that they discovered she had been studying art the whole time.\n\u201cHer family was trying to establish themselves in this country, so they stuck with the support systems they had,\u201d says Root. \u201cBut Luchita was really branching out from that.\u201d\nShe returned to the sewing machine while pregnant with her first son. She wasn\u2019t a fan of any of the contemporary maternity clothes, writing that stores only offered \u201c\u2018butcher boy\u2019 dresses with an ugly hole cut out in the skirt.\u201d So she decided to make exactly what she wanted: long flowy skirts and comfortable but operational tops.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the way Luchita lived her life. She wasn\u2019t going to do the thing that her family was doing. She always kind of chose her path,\u201d says Root. \u201cSo, she returned to making clothing when what she wanted wasn\u2019t available. She manifested her own reality and perfected this uniform.\u201d\nHer collection was meant to last her through different phases of her life. All of the skirts had elastic waists, were cut on the bias (a nonnegotiable for Hurtado) and had a little contrast stitch on the trim. Motherhood marked much of her adult life, as three of her four children were born 11 years apart.\nRoot shares, \u201cShe found great joy in it. It was something she could do to make her happy. She could envision making things for her children, even when she couldn\u2019t afford it or if it didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nAs a mother in her 20s, going through a divorce from her first husband, Hurtado had to come up with new ways to support her family. She turned to her familial roots in fashion and combined them with her artistic practices. She worked on window displays and murals for department store Lord & Taylor and did fashion illustrations for Cond\u00e9 Nast.\nRoot points out a heavy winter coat among one of the racks. The bright red material with thick black stripes was originally a Pendleton horse blanket in a Lord & Taylor\u2019s Christmas window display. Hurtado\u2019s employers at the time allowed her to keep it. She then turned it into a jacket which she wore her whole life, especially in New York winters.\nIn an indirect way, her closet was a factor in her decision to settle down in Los Angeles. It was 1951 and she had recently coupled up with Lee Mullican, a member of the post-surrealist group Dynaton. He was headed to Oklahoma, tending to some exhibitions, and she was pregnant, unsure of where to go.\n\u201cHer sister had told her not to come home to Venezuela because their mom wouldn\u2019t want her there pregnant, with no husband. She thought about going to New York, but it was winter and she didn\u2019t have any warm clothes. So she found a support system in L.A.,\u201d says Root. The story continues that she found a fully furnished apartment for her family immediately after giving birth and while still in the hospital bed. She and Mullican eventually got married and settled into a home in the Santa Monica Canyon where they split the remainder of their lives between Los Angeles and Taos, New Mexico.\nAlmost every article in Hurtado\u2019s archive has a unique story. Before her passing in 2020, members of her team sat with her, went through her entire closet and took note of each anecdote she shared. Today, these records exist digitally in an organized spreadsheet, with columns detailing when each item was made, the materials used and Hurtado\u2019s associated memories.\nSome of the remarks include notes like, \u201cused to wear with big platform shoes,\u201d \u201cgood for travel because it doesn\u2019t crease,\u201d \u201cvery art nouveau\u201d and \u201cI ended up with a passion for denim.\u201d Others are more in-depth, telling stories about the time she dressed as a geisha: \u201cThey put on ropes that bind you in to put on the back part of the clothing. My ribs were black and blue. It really hurt.\u201d Or she recounts the story of wearing her white cotton jacket with these \u201cIndian shoes \u2026 that point and turn up at the end, very unusual combination. I met a couple who were intrigued by my outfit and wanted to know where the shoes were from. It turned out to be Dal\u00ed and his wife!\u201d She knew exactly where she wore most of these logged outfits, like when she would attend Cond\u00e9 Nast parties or one of Frank Gehry\u2019s functions.\nAmong the racks, there are some pieces left unfinished, threads hanging and pins pushed in. Every single article of clothing, whether it was worn hundreds of times or never completed, still carries the feeling of being lived in. Behind a partition in the warehouse, bins full of fabric cram the storage space. Hurtado always had plans to continue creating more pieces. Her daily practice truly never stopped."

      "text": "- Share via\n\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is certainly the right movie to face the great and powerful ambitions of Sphere, the most expensive entertainment venue in Las Vegas history. Since 1939, the treasured classic has hailed the awe of gazing into a glowing globe, whether it\u2019s glinting atop a fortune teller\u2019s table, transporting the meddlesome Glinda the Good Witch or spying on a teenage girl and her companions like a sinister security camera.\nSpecial effects are central both to \u201cOz\u2019s\u201d appeal and its plot: The big reveal is that technicians, not wizards, pull the levers that make an audience gasp. For Sphere \u2014 officially, there\u2019s no \u201cthe\u201d \u2014 those tools include three football fields of bright 16K LED screens that curve around its domed interior, with another 10 on the outside that light up Vegas day and night with rotating animations. (I saw blue gingham, scarlet sequins and thatches of burlap and straw.) Sphere cost an estimated $2.3 billion to build and must have an electricity bill scarier than the Wicked Witch. You can make out Dorothy\u2019s slippers from an airplane.\n- Share via\nWith no heel clicks needed, I was whisked to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u2019s\u201d Sphere premiere in a red sedan by a Lyft driver named \u2014 no fooling \u2014 Ruby, who said she was grateful that the Backstreet Boys\u2019 recent stint at the arena \u201cmade Vegas busy for a minute.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of financial pressure on \u201cOz\u2019s\u201d girl from Kansas. Adapting the film to Sphere\u2019s stunning dimensions took about $100 million. Although the arena seats 17,600 when full, \u201cOz\u201d showings only offer a slice of the middle section, roughly a third of its capacity. A trimmed 70-minute edit of the movie is playing two to three times a day, nearly every day, through the end of March 2026, with a ticket price that currently starts at $114.\nEighty-six years ago, when a kiddie fare cost 15 cents, my then-6-year-old grandmother watched the theater blink from sepia to vivid color splendor. That innovation gets credited to Hollywood, but the idea of contrasting lush and luminous Oz against soul-drainingly monochrome Kansas is actually right there on Page 1 of L. Frank Baum\u2019s book, published in May 1900, a self-proclaimed effort to write a \u201cmodernized\u201d fairy tale that swaps Old World elves for American scarecrows. \u201cWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side,\u201d Baum wrote, adding that her house and her weary aunt and uncle and everything else were gray too, \u201cto the edge of the sky in all directions.\u201d\nThat\u2019s exactly what Sphere was designed to do: stretch to the edge in all dimensions. It exists neither to save film nor supplant it, but to augment a rectangular screen with new digital and (controversially) generative-AI-supplied imagery, timed props and seats that vibrate whenever the Wicked Witch cackles.\nDespite my queasiness about cutting \u201cOz\u201d by half an hour, the experiment is a romp. I was immersed in \u2014 or, more accurately, surrounded by \u2014 scenes from one of my favorite movies, a pivotal blockbuster whose artistic influence extends from David Lynch to Elton John to Salman Rushdie. Even more giggle-inducing, I was pelted with scented foam apples and dive-bombed by half a dozen drone-piloted flying monkeys.\nVegas is known for its Egyptian pyramids, dancing fountains, fake Rome. A spherical building broadcasting eyeballs takes the surreal up a notch.\n\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d has always braved new technology. An early adopter of Technicolor, it boasted a lighting budget nearly double that of its rival, \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d yet the latter gobbled nearly every Academy Award and poached \u201cOz\u2019s\u201d director, Victor Fleming, who swapped projects halfway through and won an Oscar for his vision of Sherman\u2019s March instead of the Yellow Brick Road. In the 1950s, when the rest of Hollywood was terrified of television, \u201cOz\u201d agreed to be the first theatrical movie to screen in full on a prime-time network. TV transformed the prestige money-loser into a hit. Sphere has turned \u201cOz\u201d into a flash point in the industry\u2019s fundamental fight over the use of AI. Artists and audiences alike fear a future in which, behind the curtain, there might not be a man at all.\nI like my art made by human beings. But I\u2019m no nostalgist. \u201cOz\u201d was a book, a musical, a silent short and a cartoon before MGM made the variant we adore. It should be a playground for invention.\nEntering Sphere, the escalators are tinted sepia and the soundscape hums with birdsong and lowing cattle. The implication is that we\u2019ve not yet been whirled over the rainbow. Preshow, the view from one\u2019s seat is of being in a massive old opera house with dusky green drapes flanked by rows of orchestra seats. None of the proscenium is actually there, nor are the musicians heard running scales and rehearsing \u201cFollow the Yellow Brick Road.\u201d\nThe simulation of human handicraft \u2014 of stagehands and horn players hiding in the wings \u2014 is unnerving. But it gets you thinking about the actual, contemporary people who are behind that curtain. Visual artists who labored on the Sphere project have justly grumbled that their sweat has gotten publicly dismissed as AI. An actual symphony orchestra rerecorded \u201cOz\u2019s\u201d mono score on the very same MGM stage used in 1939, allegedly with some of the same instruments. It sounds fantastic, and it\u2019s so loyal to every jaunty warble that audiences might not notice.\nA few scenes have been lopped off entirely. The Cowardly Lion no longer trills about becoming king of the forest. The majority of the shots have been micro-trimmed to be snappier, a pace that wouldn\u2019t suit stoners\u2019 penchant for synchronizing the movie to Pink Floyd\u2019s dreamy, woozy \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon.\u201d Occasionally, the camera\u2019s placement appears to have been adjusted to allow the visuals to expand to fill the space. Inside Dorothy\u2019s Kansan house, a once-shadowed frying pan on the wall now dangles front and center, as does a digitally added \u201cHome Sweet Home\u201d needlepoint nailed to the threshold. (The plotting has become so brisk that we might otherwise miss the message that there\u2019s no place like it.)\nThe tweaks can be subtle and lovely. Dorothy belts \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d underneath newly actualized bluebirds and an impressively ominous sky. When the tornado happens, the tech changes hit us like a cyclone. We\u2019re pulled through the window and into the eye of the storm, where a cow spirals around like it wants to outdo the scene-stealing bovine from \u201cTwister.\u201d A great, giddy blast of air from the 750-horsepower fans blew my bangs straight off my forehead. I kept one eye on the screen while trying to catch a flurry of tissue-paper leaves. The wow factor is so staggering that you might not spot that Sphere\u2019s founder and chief executive, James Dolan, and Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav have superimposed their faces on the two sailors twirling past in a rowboat \u2014 an apropos in-joke for people concerned the moguls have been swept away by their own bluster.\n\u201cAnyone can blow wind into your face,\u201d Dolan said to the premiere audience before the film began. \u201cNot everyone can make you feel like you\u2019re in a tornado.\u201d Wearing the Wizard\u2019s green top hat and suit and with his microphone dropping out inauspiciously, Dolan never introduced himself, but he did compliment the other creators of the event, who also wore costumes. (I overheard that some of them thought Dolan was kidding about dressing in character until they found themselves spending four hours getting groomed to look lionesque.)\nJust a week earlier, in trial runs, perfumes were piped into the air so people could get a whiff of the Emerald City. (Gauging by the souvenir candles in Sphere\u2019s gift shop, it is chocolate mint.) They\u2019ve currently been scaled back out of concerns that it all might get too overwhelming. Having figured out how to do sight, sound, feel and smell, Dolan conceded that only one sense remains: \u201cWe still haven\u2019t figured out taste.\u201d\nTaste is definitely still a concern. Oddly, Sphere\u2019s \u201cOz\u201d loses a dram of its spellcraft once audiences touch down in Munchkinland. Seeing the newly added tops of Oz\u2019s trees makes the fantastical place look smaller.\nYou feel for the design teams. They\u2019ve been challenged to magnify a 4-foot matte painting of the arched hallway into the Wizard\u2019s throne room \u2014 initially done in pastels on black cardboard \u2014 into a 240-foot-tall tableau. One of the 1939 film\u2019s production designers, Jack Martin Smith, said that his instructions were to make Oz \u201cethereal\u201d and \u201csubdued.\u201d Descriptions of the cornfield\u2019s hand-painted muslin background make it sound like a proto-Rothko. Now, you can see every kernel. The razor-sharp mountains on the horizon don\u2019t inspire your imagination \u2014 they make you think of Machu Picchu.\nMore troublesome are the Munchkins and the citizens of Emerald City. Tidied into high definition, they often appear restless. As Dorothy pleads for the Wizard not to fly away without her, we\u2019re distracted by hundreds of waving extras who visibly don\u2019t give a hoot what happens to the girl. Worse, they occasionally seem to glitch. If that\u2019s the best AI can do in 2025, then Sphere isn\u2019t a resounding endorsement.\nBy contrast, Judy Garland\u2019s performance, delivered at just age 16, feels monumental. Her big brown eyes dominate the screen. When the heartbroken girl sobs that the Wicked Witch has chased away her beloved Toto, I found myself annoyed by a flying monkey on the left side of the frame who simply looked bored.\nThe field of poppies is dazzling; the additional deer, ants and rodents skittering across the golden sidewalk are simply strange. Overall, you\u2019re so caught up observing the experience itself that the emotions of the story don\u2019t register as anything more than theme-ride hydraulics. Still, it\u2019s nice to have a sweeping view of the first film\u2019s prosthetic makeup: the Cowardly Lion\u2019s upturned nostrils, the Scarecrow\u2019s baggy jowls, the real horses painted purple and red with Jell-O. (Due to pace tightening, we only see two ponies, not all six).\nI recoiled when the Wizard\u2019s disembodied head loomed above. Who decided to make him look like a cheesy martian? Flipping through sketches from 1939 afterward, I realized that he always looked that bad. His gaunt cheekbones just weren\u2019t as obvious before. Nevertheless, be sure to look to the right when Toto reveals Oz\u2019s control booth. In a clever touch, Sphere lets us continue to see the monstrous green face, now neutered and ridiculous, mouth along as the panicked geek apologizes for being a humbug.\nCan Sphere win big on its risky gamble that there\u2019s no place like dome? It\u2019s not the first Las Vegas attraction to bet on our love for the MGM extravaganza. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d has been tangled up with Las Vegas\u2019 fortunes for more than half a century, ever since real estate investor Kirk Kerkorian purchased MGM Studios in 1969 and, one year later, auctioned Dorothy\u2019s slippers to help fund the construction of the first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. The second MGM Grand, the one that opened in 1993, was branded for \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s green like Emerald City \u2014 and during the first year, visitors could walk through an animatronic forest of lions, tigers and gamblers.\nThe Strip was once a magical place where innocents like Dorothy flocked to get into trouble, often in encounters with sleight-of-hand hucksters like Professor Marvel. Hopes are high that tourists will come back to be transported to Oz, even at a ticket price that costs a chunk of the family farm. The hurdle is that although audiences have become begrudgingly accustomed to spending more than $100 to see their favorite bands, they\u2019re still seeing an actual band and not a shortened version of a movie that\u2019s popular in part because everyone grew up watching it on TV for free.\nBut on opening night at least, the crowd was treating the cinema like a concert. Many folks were in some sort of costume, including me. (I couldn\u2019t resist wearing a pair of red shoes.) When I complimented a man\u2019s blue gingham suit, he handed me a handmade beaded, Taylor Swift-style bracelet that read: Toto Too.\nIf fans like him turn this techno-incarnation of \u201cOz\u201d into a hit, Sphere has said it would consider following it up with a similar presentation of \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d Imagine the smell of the burning of Atlanta. Much better than the air of burning money."

      "text": "- Share via\nOn the Shelf\nGray Dawn\nBy Walter Mosley\nMulholland: 336 pages, $29\nIf you buy books linked on our site, The Times may earn a commission from Bookshop.org, whose fees support independent bookstores.\nWalter Mosley has penned more than 60 novels in the course of about four decades, but the Easy Rawlins mysteries are arguably his most readily recognized body of work. After writing about Easy, Raymond \u201cMouse\u201d Alexander and other memorable characters in the series since their 1990 debut in \u201cDevil in a Blue Dress,\u201d the Los Angeles native is certainly entitled to sit back and enjoy the significant milestone in Easy\u2019s history. But neither the success, the accolades nor the 35-year anniversary matter to Mosley as much as the work itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he muses over Zoom from his sun-drenched apartment in Santa Monica where he\u2019s working one August afternoon. \u201cEveryone has a career. Bricklayer, politician, artist, whatever. But what you think of as a career, for me it\u2019s \u2026 I just love writing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good thing that he does. In the 17 mysteries in the series, Easy has given readers a front-row seat to Mosley\u2019s vision of L.A.\u2019s evolution from a post-World War II boom town proscribed by race and class to the tumultuous \u201970s, with seismic social shifts for Black Americans, women and the nuclear family. These are the long-term changes that Easy must navigate in \u201cGray Dawn,\u201d out Sept. 16.\nThe year is 1971 and Easy, now 50, is beset by memories of his hardscrabble Southern youth and first loves before he enlisted to serve in World War II in Europe and Africa. And while coming to L.A. after the war meant opportunity, real estate investments and success as \u201cone of the few colored detectives in Southern California,\u201d Easy has not lost his empathy for the underdog. So when he\u2019s approached by the rough-hewn Santangelo Burris to find his auntie, Lutisha James, Easy leans in to help, even after he learns Lutisha is more dangerous than he suspected and brings with her an unexpected tie to his past. Then his adopted son, Jesus, and daughter-in-law run afoul of the feds and Easy must also figure out a way to save them from a certain prison sentence. Add assorted killers, business tycoons, Black militants and crooked law enforcement to the mix, all of whom underestimate Easy\u2019s grit and outspoken determination to protect himself and his chosen family, and the recipe is set for another memorable tale.\nGiven Easy\u2019s maturity and the world as it was in 1971, Mosley felt the need, for the first time, to write a note to readers to put Easy and his times into context. \u201cWhen I was writing this book, I realized that, in 2025, there are some readers who may not understand where Easy\u2019s coming from.\u201d\nMosley\u2019s introduction provides that frame, calling the combined tales \u201ca twentieth century memoir\u201d and linking them to the fight for liberation and equality. \u201cBlack people, people during the Great Enslavement,\u201d Mosley writes, \u201cweren\u2019t considered wholly human, and, even after emancipation, were only promoted to the status of second-class citizenship. They were denied access to toilets, libraries, equal rights, and the totality of the American dream, which had often been deemed a nightmare.\u201d But Easy, with his passion for community and love for the underdog, is always there to help. \u201cHe speaks for the voiceless and tried his best to come up with answers to problems that seem unanswerable.\u201d\nDespite these conditions, Mosley explains to me, the series\u2019 recurring characters \u2014 Mouse, Jackson Blue, Fearless Jones, among others \u2014 who serve as Easy\u2019s family of choice have prospered since the beginning of the series, Easy most of all. \u201cEasy is a successful licensed PI, living on top of a mountain with his adopted daughter, plus his son and his family are around too. So for readers who pick up the series at this point, everything seems great. But then, Easy walks into a place [in the novel] and he\u2019s confronted by some white guy who says, \u2018Well, do you belong here?\u2019 Before, when I had written something like that, I assumed that people are going to understand how those kinds of verbal challenges are fueled by the racism of the time. But this time I thought there are readers who may not understand it, even though it\u2019s speaking to something about their lives or their world, even today.\u201d\nEasy Rawlins also speaks to other writers, who read the mysteries as a beacon of hope, a crack in the wall through which other voices can be heard.\nWalter Mosley revisits Easy Rawlins\u2019 neighborhood\nS.A. Cosby, bestselling author of \u201cBlacktop Wasteland\u201d and \u201cAll the Sinners Bleed\u201d and an L.A. Times Book Prize winner, clearly remembers his introduction to Easy\u2019s world. \u201cReading \u2018Devil in a Blue Dress\u2019 was like being shown a path in the darkness. It spoke to me as a writer, as a Southerner and as a Black person,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn some ways, it gave me \u2018permission\u2019 to write about the people I love.\u201d\nEasy also offers a unique lens through which to view L.A. Steph Cha, Times Book Prize winner for \u201cYour House Will Pay,\u201d discovered \u201cDevil in a Blue Dress\u201d as a freshman in college. \u201cI was totally thunderstruck,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThis was before I had the context and vocabulary to articulate its importance in the broader literary landscape, but I knew I loved Easy Rawlins and his eye on Los Angeles. Walter was one of my primary influences when I started writing fiction. I even named a character Daphne in my second book after the missing woman in \u2018Devil.\u2019\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Toes in the soil beneath my feet.\u2019 That\u2019s what a detective has to have. She has to know the city, its peoples, dialects, and languages. Its neighborhoods and histories. Everything you could see and touch. A detective\u2019s mind has to be right there in front of her. Your city was your whole world.\u201d\nBut why does the series endure? Cha credits the quality of the man himself: \u201cEasy\u2019s been through so much over 35 years, but he\u2019s still the same guy, a man who will go anywhere, talk to anybody and bear anything, while still giving the feeling he bleeds as much as the rest of us.\u201d\nBut Easy\u2019s also thinking about the future, which in \u201cGray Dawn\u201d means helping Niska, a young Black woman in his office, develop into a detective. Along the way, he shares his creed and his hope for what she will become one day: \u201c\u2018Toes in the soil beneath my feet.\u2019 That\u2019s what a detective has to have. She has to know the city, its peoples, dialects, and languages. Its neighborhoods and histories. Everything you could see and touch. A detective\u2019s mind has to be right there in front of her. Your city was your whole world.\u201d\nBack on our Zoom call, I ask Mosley whether he was thinking of Raymond Chandler\u2019s seminal 1944 essay \u201cThe Simple Art of Murder\u201d and the oft-quoted line \u201cDown these mean streets\u2026\u201d when writing that passage. Not consciously, but he liked the comparison because \u201cEasy in many ways is the opposite of Philip Marlowe.\u201d\nNot the least of which is his willingness to help a woman become a detective. \u201cEven though Easy is skeptical about a woman being a detective,\u201d he explains, \u201che recognizes it\u2019s the 1970s and, with the women\u2019s movement, he\u2019s willing to help her if that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d\nAs the song goes, the times they are a-changin\u2019, and Easy with them. What does Mosley hope readers take away from \u201cGray Dawn,\u201d Easy\u2019s midlife novel? \u201cI want them to see how Easy has developed and changed over the years. And that family, even though Easy\u2019s doesn\u2019t look like the nuclear family, is what America has always been about.\u201d\nMosley\u2019s also experienced enough to know that what writers hope readers understand and what readers actually see in their writing can be very different. And while he appreciates comments from writers like Cosby and Cha, he puts it all in perspective. \u201cAs a writer, I think it\u2019s important for you to remember not to judge your success by what other writers have said about your work. Because writers more than anybody in literature are confused about what literature actually is. Writers will say, \u2018I did this, and I did that, and I wrote this, and this was my intention, and I started here, and I moved it there.\u2019 But the truth is you\u2019ve written a book, you\u2019ve created the best thing you could have written, and all these people have read it. And for every person who has read it, it\u2019s a different book.\u201d\nMosley is also a talented screenwriter, having served as an executive producer and writer on the FX drama \u201cSnowfall.\u201d Most recently, he shared a writing credit (with director Nadia Latif) for the screenplay of the upcoming film \u201cThe Man in My Basement\u201d \u2014 an adaptation of his 2004 standalone novel \u2014 starring Willem Dafoe and Corey Hawkins. Mosley is particularly cognizant of how book-to-film translations can have different meanings for their creators.\nOver the past 20 years, industry shifts have funneled more novelists into TV rooms than ever. It\u2019s salutary in many ways \u2014 beginning with health insurance.\n\u201cWith very few exceptions, books and the films that they spawn are very different,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd they have to be because books come to life in the mind of readers, who imagine the characters and places the writer describes. And books are language, and your understanding through language as a reader is a part of the process. But a film is all projected images. So when somebody says they\u2019re writing a book, you tell them, \u2018Show. Don\u2019t tell.\u2019 When you produce or direct a movie, they just say, \u2018Show.\u2019\u201d\nMosley praises Latif, who, in her directorial debut, leaned into certain aspects of his novel. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in the genre of horror and uses certain elements of it in the film,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she could do that without those elements already being there in the novel.\u201d\nBeyond \u201cGray Dawn\u201d and the forthcoming film, Mosley\u2019s collaborating with playwright, singer and actor Eisa Davis on a musical stage adaptation of \u201cDevil,\u201d as well as working on a monograph about why reading is essential to living a full life. But regardless of the medium, Mosley\u2019s purpose is crystal clear. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about the writing itself,\u201d he says, leaning in to make his point. \u201cI love being a writer so much that even if I had much less success, or even none, I would still be doing it.\u201d"

Mejia\u2019s reporting exposed misstatements by DHS officials, highlighted racial profiling allegations, and prompted a federal judge to temporarily halt indiscriminate immigration stops. The case has sparked a lawsuit and increased scrutiny of ICE\u2019s enforcement tactics, with the judge ordering agents to cease profiling based on appearance.",
