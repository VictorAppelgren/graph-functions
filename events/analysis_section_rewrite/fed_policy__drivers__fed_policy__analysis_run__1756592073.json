      "feedback": "The draft correctly identifies the Fed‑cut/​rate‑stickiness dichotomy as the core driver of the S&P 500, but it over‑relies on generic “if‑then” language and under‑quantifies the magnitude of each leg. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread to the equity discount (e.g., “a 57 bp widening raises the equity discount by ~30 bp, compressing the risk‑premium and lifting the index 3–5 %”) and citing the exact source ID (Z7O1DCHS7). Replace vague phrases like “tightening the spread” with concrete thresholds (e.g., “spread > 57 bp” or “spread < 30 bp”) and attach the corresponding IDs (FAN5RYW6T, 7XH2DKEKV). Add a short‑term risk‑reward table: Fed cut → +3–5 % SPX, +10–20 bps UST10Y, –200 bp DXY; sticky inflation → –5–10 % SPX, +5–10 bps UST10Y, +200 bp DXY. Explicitly map each scenario to canonical handles (spx, ust10y, dxy) with sign and magnitude ranges. Drop the redundant “September Fed cut would compress the 10‑yr yield by 10–20 bps” sentence (already covered). Finally, list the watch signals in bullet form with dates and IDs: July CPI/PCE (FAN5RYW6T), Aug 30 PCE (7XH2DKEKV), Aug 31 NFP (7XH2DKEKV), Sep 16‑17 Fed meeting (B1KYJ1GPU), 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trajectory (Z7O1DCHS7). This will satisfy the acceptance gate and provide a concise, defensible, and actionable view.",
