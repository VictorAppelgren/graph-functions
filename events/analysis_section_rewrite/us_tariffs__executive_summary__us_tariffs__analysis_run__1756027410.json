      "feedback": "The Horizon draft has credible anchors and data references (the 15% EU tariff with car exemptions, 1.8% near‑term price lift, 18.6% import tariff burden, Adyen H1 2025 metrics, and CRA/Intel governance signals) but the causal chain and the house view are not crisp enough. Add a single, decision‑ready house view and tie each pillar to that view in a tight narrative (e.g., a moderate‑confidence path with capital allocated toward embedded‑finance cross‑border platforms if policy cadence remains orderly). Explicitly structure Baseline/Escalation/Deregulation/Geopolitics with defined catalysts, primary triggers, and invalidation points; specify observable metrics (tariff cadence, steel‑quota outcomes, UK DCTS progress, CRA moves, Intel CHIPS governance) and clear go/no‑go thresholds. Strengthen first‑principles grounding by mapping a simple channel: tariff regime influences pass‑through to prices, which reprice margins and drive capital allocation, and quantify the likely magnitudes with source anchors (1.8% lift; 18.6% burden; $350m annualized tariff cost; Adyen revenue/EBITDA growth) while reconciling any ties across sources. Tighten citations so each assertion is anchored to the IDs and provide a concise 4–6 sentence executive brief with a crisp watch‑list: tariff cadence/exemptions, steel quotas, UK DCTS, CRA reversals, Intel governance, and Adyen's expansion signals.",
