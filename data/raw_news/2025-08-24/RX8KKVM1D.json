  "title": "The 4 Reasons I\u2019m Picking the Pixel 10 Over the iPhone 17",
  "description": "The Pixel is a must buy because of these features.",
  "content": "Google has finally unveiled its new smartphone lineup, the Pixel 10 series. While each model in the series is better than its respective predecessor, I am going to buy the Google Pixel 10 because of these four upgrades.\n\nThe Tensor chip available in the Google Pixel 9 is built on the foundation of Samsung\u2019s Exynos processors. Unfortunately, the Exynos processors have so many drawbacks that even Samsung doesn't use them and instead relies on Qualcomm to power its flagship devices, such as the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The use of Exynos processors has resulted in Google receiving more complaints than appreciation for its Pixel devices.\n\nThe Pixel 9 has always been in the news because of different issues, such as overheating even during regular usage, rapidly losing charge, and encountering various connectivity problems. However, in the Pixel 10, Google has used the Tensor G5 chip, which is most likely going to address all these issues.\n\nThe best thing about the Tensor G5 chip is that it's Google's first chip designed from scratch in partnership with TSMC. As a heads-up, TSMC is the same company behind the powerful iPhone A-Series chips.\n\nUnlike the G4 chipset, which is built on Samsung's 4nm architecture, the G5 chipset is built on TSMC's 3nm architecture. The use of this new architecture has allowed Google to add more transistors to the chip, ultimately making the Pixel 10 more power-efficient. Furthermore, it makes the CPU 34% and the TPU 60% more powerful than those in the Pixel 9.\n\nGoogle Pixels are not among the smartphones with the best battery life. However, by introducing a bigger battery in the Pixel 10, it seems that Google has finally started to give importance to its smartphones\u2019 battery.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 comes with a 4970 mAh battery, which is almost 5.8% more than what you get in the Pixel 9. That's definitely not a big jump, but an upgrade is an upgrade after all. It's important to note that the use of the new Tensor G5 chip, Exynos 5400 modem, and improved thermal system will complement the battery. As a result, you will definitely get more power backup than what you would expect from just a 5.8% increase in battery size.\n\nThe charging speed has also received an upgrade in the Google Pixel 10. In comparison to the 27W wired charging in the Pixel 9, the Pixel 10 offers 30W charging. The smartphones also support 15W wireless charging using Qi2. Interestingly, Google has installed the magnets right inside the phone. So, you simply need to take Google's Qi2 charger, which Google calls the PixelSnap charger, and attach it to the back of the Pixel 10 to start charging it.\n\nThe telephoto lens was previously exclusive to Pixel Pro models. But in the Pixel 10 series, Google has offered the telephoto lens in the base Pixel model as well.\n\nThe smartphone comes with a 5x telephoto lens that offers 10x optical image quality and Super Res Zoom up to 20x. This will allow you to take high-quality zoom shots. However, I didn't like Google's approach of downgrading the main and ultra-wide cameras. They have reduced the main camera from 50 MP to 48 MP and the ultra-wide camera from 48 MP to 13 MP. Perhaps Google will be able to compensate for that through software processing. I will definitely put that to the test once I get my hands on the Pixel 10.\n\nThis year's Made by Google event was all about AI features in the Pixel 10 series, and I must say that I loved all of them. Let's begin with the Magic Cue feature, which was the main highlight of the event, in my opinion.\n\nThe Magic Cue feature predicts and displays information on your Pixel screen. For instance, when you call an airline to inquire about your flight, the Magic Cue feature will automatically go through your email to find the flight details and display them on your screen.\n\nSimilarly, if you were chatting with your friend on Google Messages and they asked you to recommend a good restaurant near your area, then the Magic Cue feature would automatically go through your Google Search or Google Maps history to find restaurants you have searched for in your area and display those restaurant names as floating suggestions in the Google Messages app. You simply need to tap on a suggestion to send it. In essence, the Magic Cue feature ensures you quickly get the information you are looking for without having to manually search for it on your device.\n\nThe next AI feature is real-time voice translation, and as you would expect, it translates your voice as you speak in any language. Once you enable the voice translation feature, you need to choose the language into which you want your voice to be translated. For instance, if your primary language is English but the person you are talking to speaks German, then you select German as the language into which you want the AI to translate your voice.\n\nNow, as you speak, the AI feature will translate your English into German, and the person on the other end will hear everything you say in German. Similarly, the German that the other person is speaking will be translated into English. This feature completely removes the language barrier when you are talking with someone who doesn't speak your first language.\n\nWhat separates Google's voice translation from Apple\u2019s Live Translation feature is that the translated voice on Pixel phones sounds similar to your own voice instead of a robotic AI sound, ensuring that the other person doesn't feel like they are talking to an AI. Interestingly, all the translations happen on your Pixel phone, and the other person doesn't need a Pixel device to hear the translated voice.\n\nCamera Coach is another AI feature that you get in the Google Pixel 10. You will find it in the camera app, and as you would expect from a coach, it guides you to make your photographs look better. It uses the Gemini model to detect the area and objects you are capturing and offers different suggestions accordingly. For instance, you may see this feature recommending improvements to the lighting, composition, camera position, and more.\n\nSince I'm purchasing the Pixel 10 mainly for taking photographs, I am looking forward to using the Camera Coach feature a lot.\n\nAI features are coming to the Pixel 10 Google Photos app as well. While viewing a photo, if you think you need to remove an object from it, then instead of manually doing the editing, you simply need to type the edits you want to make in the Gemini search field that appears at the bottom. The Google Photos app will then apply the requested edits.\n\nThese were some of the reasons I am getting the Google Pixel 10 this year. The iPhone 17 series is just around the corner as well, but according to all the leaks that have come out till now, there isn't any feature coming that's going to make me ditch the Pixel 10 for the iPhone 17. Anyway, the pre-orders for the Google Pixel 10 have already started, and the device will start shipping from 28th August.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nThe difference between a good photo and a great one might be the few minutes you spend editing it before you share it. These techniques can quickly boost the quality of your photos.\nYou can make all of these edits on a smartphone using built-in tools, like Apple's Photos app or Google Photos. There are, of course, more in-depth apps available for both hobbyists and professionals.\nRecover Details From Shadows and Highlights\nHighlights are the lightest areas of your image, while shadows are the darkest. If either of these are pure white or pure black, these areas are over- or underexposed. Fortunately, you can try and claw back some detail from these areas using the \"Highlights\" and \"Shadows\" sliders.\nThe format you used to capture your image will affect how much detail you can recover. If you shot an image in RAW on a digital SLR or mirrorless camera, or you have a smartphone app that can capture RAW photographs, you'll have a lot more to work with.\nHowever, if you're using a compressed image format, like JPEG, much of the detail in the highlights and shadows is discarded during the compression process. A RAW file is much larger because it retains all of the data captured when you press the shutter, including portions that are invisible to the human eye without some editing.\nEven if you're shooting in JPEG on a smartphone, you should be able to recover some detail. The aim here is to create a \"flat\" image, in which there are no over- or underexposed areas. By doing this, you'll lose contrast, but that's okay because you can add it back afterward.\nFirst, reduce the \"Highlights\" slider until you see some detail return to the lightest areas of your image. Then, increase the \"Shadows\" slider to recover some detail in the darkest areas.\nHow far you go with either of these settings depends on your image, its format, and the look you're trying to achieve.\nYou now have a flat image with more dynamic range. You can now gradually add some contrast back into the image using the contrast slider. Go slow, though---you don't want to lose any of the detail you just recovered. The key is to find the right balance between the dynamic range and contrast.\nYou can use this technique to fix over- or underexposed images by focusing primarily on the highlights or shadows, respectively.\nStraighten Your Photos (or Find Other Straight Lines)\nIf you don't already straighten your images, it's possible you've never noticed they're uneven. Unfortunately, when you do start to notice this, it can quickly become an obsession. You can save your sanity by always correcting your images in postproduction before you share them.\nThe easiest way to straighten an image is to look for the horizon. If your image is of a landscape or features the horizon in any prominent way (like a group portrait taken outside), adhere to the horizon whenever possible.\nOf course, there's more to straightening images than simply matching the horizon.\nNot all images feature the horizon. In those cases, it's important to look for other straight lines you can use. For example, in indoor shots, you might look for beams or pillars. Sometimes, though, you might have an image with lines that weren't straight to begin with, such as beams in an old building or a toppled fence post.\nIn these instances, you'll need to use your best judgment to pick a prominent straight line and adhere to it. There are lots of factors at play here, including focal length and your perspective when you took the shot. For example, an image of a skyscraper shot upward will likely feature two converging lines that get closer near the top.\nYou can get a lot more hands-on by playing around with perspective distortion tools. These allow you to manually distort an image on both axes to get a perfect result.\nYou can also just choose your lines wisely and run with it!\nCrop Your Images for Better Composition\nMost digital cameras now shoot in the range of around 20 megapixels. This is enough to print a pristine photo at about 18 x 12 inches at 300 dpi. You can even usually print a larger version at 200 dpi or lower. This means even if you're printing images, you have a large area to play with to make crops and enhance your composition in post.\nIt's always preferable to nail down the composition before you press the shutter. Thinking twice before you fire a shot will certainly improve your photography. However, photography also involves understanding which changes you can make to improve your images after you take them, and cropping is a powerful tool.\nWhat you leave out of a photo can be just as important as what you leave in. Zooming with your feet isn't always possible, and not everyone can carry a 400mm lens in their back pocket. Don't be afraid to lose any distracting elements that draw attention away from the subject of your image.\nRemember, there are no strict rules when it comes to photography. Experiment until you're happy with the results. Forget the rule of thirds, or at least try not to lean on it too much during your workflow. Focus instead on creating a composition that feels organic, regardless of where the grid lines fall.\nRemoving any distracting foreground objects or extraneous details around the edge of a frame will draw the eye toward the subject in the middle. However, you should also resist the urge to aggressively center your subjects. Much of the time, an off-center portrait is more visually pleasing than a perfectly centered one. This is why documentary filmmakers often position their subjects at the edge of the frame.\nThis is why leading lines---the lines in your image that naturally lead the eye in a certain direction---are important when cropping.\nCorrect White Balance for Better Colors\nMost cameras and smartphones do a good job of nailing white balance the first time. Of course, no device is perfect. It's easy to use a manual white balance and forget to change it. Sometimes, conditions change quickly, or competing light sources throw off the white balance.\nDifferent sources of light create different temperatures of light, and this is reflected in the white balance. A golden sunset casts a warm glow, whereas an overcast shot of a snowy mountain might appear cold and blue. Tubular fluorescent lights cast a cold white glow, while incandescent lights in table lamps are usually warmer.\nIf the white balance is off, skin tones won't look right, nor will any white or gray areas in your image. You can use this to your advantage to create warmer or colder scenes, but here, we'll be focusing on getting as close to neutral white as possible.\nThe easiest way to do this is to increase the \"Vibrance\" slider. This should make even the dullest colors in your image stand out. You should also be able to tell from this whether your image is too warm or cold.\nTry to strike a balance between cold (blue) and warm (yellow) by adjusting the \"Temperature\" (or \"Warmth\" in some editors) slider.\nOnce you've struck a balance between yellow and blue, turn your attention to green and magenta (pink). Most image editors also have a \"Tint\" slider you can use to strike the right balance between green and magenta. It's a lot easier to get this right with the \"Vibrance\" increased.\nWhen you've achieved a good white balance, your image should look neutral. Whites should be white, and skin tones, hopefully, will be as close to normal as possible. It can be hard to get skin tones right, even after you've adjusted, particularly if there's any colored lighting in the scene.\nJust remember to reduce the \"Vibrance\" setting to something more reasonable when you're done.\nBoost Colors with Vibrance to Preserve Skin Tones\nThe \"Vibrance\" slider targets the dullest colors in your image without overdoing the tones that are already saturated. You can use the \"Saturation\" slider to increase the overall amount of color, but this affects the entire image.\nIt's very easy to overdo color saturation and create a radioactive mess of an image. Skin tones that are too saturated can make a subject look jaundiced. Blemishes, like freckles or moles, can become way too exaggerated.\nEverything in an image will start to fight for attention. You can use color to lead the eye, but you have to do so carefully.\nThis is where the \"Vibrance\" setting comes in. It's like the \"Saturation\" slider, but with training wheels. It's particularly good for salvaging colors in shadows, which tend to be dull as a result of underexposure.\nDon't Spend Big on Photo Editors\nAgain, you can perform all of these edits right on your smartphone in even the simplest of photo editors, including the built-in tools on Android or iPhone\nWhile Adobe Photoshop is still the undisputed desktop photo-editing king, there are plenty of alternatives you can use that don't require a monthly fee."

      "text": "The version of wireless charging we know and love today first appeared on phones in 2012. That\u2019s plenty of time to evolve, but is it all smooth sailing, or are there still hidden snags beneath the surface? Let's dive into the magic of wireless charging and see if it's the right choice for you.\nWhat we refer to as \u201cwireless charging\u201d is also known as \u201cinductive charging,\u201d and it\u2019s been around since at least the 1970s. Back in 2009, Palm launched the Pre with an optional magnetic inductive charging dock. But it wasn\u2019t until 2012 that the Qi standard, found in practically all modern smartphones today, first appeared. The Nokia Lumia 920 and Samsung Galaxy S3 were the first to use it.\nThe pure concept of wireless charging\u2013simply placing your phone on a pad and charging it without cables\u2013sounds amazing, but it\u2019s not that simple.\nThe Pros\nOne of the most appealing aspects of wireless charging is the convenience it offers. There\u2019s not much easier than simply placing your phone on a pad without having to touch a cable or find a port. This can be particularly useful if you have mobility issues or frequently charge your phone throughout the day. Just drop it and go.\nBeyond convenience, wireless charging can also lead to a tidier setup. With fewer cables cluttering your desk or nightstand, you can have a cleaner and more organized space. Some charging pads even offer multi-device charging, allowing you to power up your phone, watch, and earbuds simultaneously with a single pad. This can significantly reduce the number of cables you need to manage.\nBuying a Wireless Charger? Keep an Eye Out for These Features\nIn an era where cutting the cord is a top priority for many people, wireless phone chargers are a hot commodity. That\u2019s why the market is flooded with them. But not every wireless charger is created equal, so here are some purchase pointers to help you navigate the market.\nWireless charging can also protect your device's charging port. Constantly plugging and unplugging cables can put wear and tear on the port, leading to connectivity issues down the road. This happened with my Pixel 3, and it was very frustrating. By using wireless charging, you minimize the physical stress on your device's port, so it\u2019s always ready in those times when you need it.\nThe Cons\nWireless charging isn't without its drawbacks. One of the most common complaints is the slower charging speeds compared to wired charging. While wireless charging technology has gotten better over the years, especially now with Qi2, it still almost always takes longer to fully charge your device wirelessly than it would with a cable.\nFor some cold, hard data, a Reddit user conducted a test with the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which supports Qi2 charging. The phone went from 0% to fully charged in 120 minutes with a good \u2018ol cable. The Qi2 wireless chargers took an extra hour longer, and the Qi1 charger took nearly two hours longer. If you're in a hurry and need a quick power boost, that extra time matters.\nAnother potential downside is the inefficiency of wireless charging. Some energy is inevitably lost during the wireless power transfer, resulting in less efficient charging compared to a direct wired connection. Not only does this mean you\u2019re using more power to get a slower charge, but it can make your device hot, too. Over time, that\u2019s not great for the battery health.\nWireless charging isn\u2019t always more convenient, either. Unlike wired charging, where you can comfortably move around and use your phone while it's charging, wireless charging typically requires your device to be placed flat on the pad. Magnetic MagSafe-like wireless charging solves this\u2013if your device supports it.\nWhy I'll (Probably) Never Buy a Wireless Charger\nI'm all in for tech companies working toward a wireless future. I love my wireless earbuds, mouse, and keyboard, but when it comes to wireless charging, I remain skeptical. Allow me to explain.\nAnd that\u2019s another problem: not all devices support wireless charging. While many modern smartphones and some earbuds come equipped with the feature, older devices and some budget-friendly options still don\u2019t. This means you might still need to rely on traditional cables for some of your gadgets.\nFinally, the barrier to entry for wireless charging can be higher. Phones nowadays rarely even come with USB wall adapters, let alone charging pads. You'll need to purchase a wireless charging pad in addition to your device. Some charging pads also have specific wattage requirements to get the best charging speeds, which might mean purchasing a compatible power adapter, too.\nSo, is wireless charging still the future of powering our devices? It certainly offers a level of convenience and tidiness that traditional cables can't match. The reduced wear and tear on charging ports is also a notable advantage. However, the slower charging speeds, inefficiency, and the need for direct contact are real downsides to consider.\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to embrace wireless charging depends on your priorities. If convenience and a clutter-free environment are your goals, and you're not always in a rush to charge your devices, then wireless charging will be great. But if speed and efficiency are your top concerns, sticking with a reliable cable might still be the better option."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- The Qi2 standard adds three times the wireless charging speed at launch (with even faster speeds coming later) and includes magnets for easy alignment.\n- Qi2 is compatible with older Qi devices, works with cases, and extends beyond phones to other gadgets.\n- Look for Qi2-certified chargers from brands like Anker and Belkin. More options and competition are expected.\nWireless charging has always been convenient, but it was typically slower than wired charging methods. Good news! With the Qi2 wireless charging standard, things are faster and more convenient.\nQi2 is a Modern Wireless Charging Standard\nQi2 is an open wireless charging protocol that has been standardized by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC). The original Qi standard was established in 2008 (along with the WPC itself), and in November 2023 the newer Qi2 standard was officially launched.\nThere have been smaller updates to the original Qi charging standard, but Qi2 makes some big changes. The standard supports up to 15w of power at launch, three times more than the original standard (5w) and double what Apple\u2019s MagSafe wireless charging launched with (7.5w).\nBased on Apple\u2019s MagSafe charging technology, Qi2 is characterized by what the WPC calls a Magnetic Power Profile (MPP). New Qi2 chargers feature magnets for quick alignment on a charger. Products that include magnets will be branded with the Qi2 logo.\nQi2 maintains backward compatibility with Qi devices. Even if your older wirelessly charging device can\u2019t make use of higher power outputs or magnetic alignment, it will still be able to charge wirelessly using a Qi2-certified charger. The original Qi logo will still be used since a revision to the standard (confusingly known as Qi v2.0) allows these devices to draw more power.\nQi is pronounced \u201cchee\u201d and is derived from the Chinese word that means \u201cvapor\u201d or \u201cair\u201d but is more commonly translated as \u201cvital energy\u201d or \u201cvital force.\u201d\nCharging Is Easier and Faster (and Getting Even Better)\nTaking a leaf out of Apple\u2019s book, Qi2 relies on magnets to solve one of the biggest annoyances with wireless chargers: alignment. It\u2019s no fun fishing around on a wireless charging pad to find the \u201csweet spot\u201d where your phone reports that it is finally charging. It\u2019s even less fun to return to the charger 30 minutes later to realize things weren\u2019t lined up correctly.\nThese magnets are used to align charging coils on the charger and within the device itself, which means power transfer is efficient and predictable. If you\u2019ve used a MagSafe charger on an iPhone, you're already familiar with the fundamentals of Qi2. The WPC's new standard brings the technology to more than just Apple devices since the standard is open.\nQi2 launches with up to 15w of wireless charging, though this is just the starting point. The WPC hopes to improve the standard and increase total power output in the future. According to an interview the WPC gave to Android Authority in early 2023, charging speeds that exceed 15w aren\u2019t expected until at least mid-2024.\nJust like existing MagSafe chargers, Qi2 works with pass-through cases that include a magnetic charging ring. Just as you can add MagSafe to Android phones, you should be able to buy a Qi2 compatible case for older devices that don\u2019t support the newer standard.\nSomething else that the WPC has been keen to stress is that Qi2 isn\u2019t just for phones, though that\u2019s where you\u2019re most likely to see the tech for a while. In addition to headphones and earbuds, the WPC mentions that augmented reality and virtual reality headsets could benefit, as could \u201cnew accessories that magnetically attach to the back of a smartphone.\u201d Gadgets like the Plaud Note seem ripe for this.\nWhich Devices Currently Use Qi2?\nAt the time of writing in February 2024, only select iPhones are compatible with the Qi2 standard. Perhaps most surprisingly, the majority of these devices received Qi2 compatibility via an over-the-air software update. That\u2019s right: Apple increased the speed at which your iPhone can charge with a software tweak.\nAll iPhone models from the iPhone 13 to the iPhone 15, inclusive of any Pro, Plus, Plus Max, and the shelved iPhone 13 mini are compatible with Qi2. The only caveat is that you\u2019ll need to have upgraded to iOS 17.2 under Settings > General > Software Update to unlock Qi2 compatibility.\nSamsung neglected to include Qi2 compatibility in the Galaxy S24, and though aftermarket cases can add compatibility in terms of magnetism, you\u2019ll need to use an official Samsung wireless charger to get the full 15w. Standard Qi charging on the S24 device is limited to 7.5w. The OnePlus 12 can also do 15w wireless charging but it lacks magnets and thus doesn\u2019t qualify as a Qi2 device.\nOther Android device manufacturers are yet to make a move on Qi2, including Google with its Pixel line.\nLook for Qi2 Certified Devices\nQi2 introduces a handshake process between the device being charged and the charger itself. This means that your Qi2 device can refuse to draw power from a charger if it fails the handshake, which is part of the WPC\u2019s big push to make Qi2 a unified standard.\nThis means that the certification process for Qi2 chargers is much more important than it was for Qi devices. This will limit your choice in terms of chargers and means that you should steer clear of the cheapest no-name brands.\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to pay Apple prices for a WPC-certified Qi2 charger. The WPC has more than 245 members, including brands like Anker, Belkin, and IKEA. Third-party Qi2 chargers already exist, and they\u2019re cheaper than official Apple MagSafe chargers.\nFor example the Anker MagGo Wireless Charger is Qi2-certified and costs $21.99, almost half what Apple asks for its white $39 MagSafe Charger. As more manufacturers enter the market, expect more competition and more options including charging stands, car chargers, and battery packs.\nYou can always check the Qi2-certified product database before you buy. Just be sure to look for \u201cQi2\u201d certification, since the database includes Qi models too. And be on the lookout for uncertified chargers or fakes!\nMore Qi2 Devices Are on The Way\nTake a look at the WPC member list to see which companies have signed up to be part of the consortium. It will take a while for Qi2 to get a foothold on the market but the fact that the standard addresses the two biggest issues with wireless charging should see it take off in a big way.\nWorried that wireless charging might damage your smartphone battery? Don\u2019t be. It\u2019s just another smartphone battery myth that you should stop believing."

      "text": "Quick Links\nWith the arrival of the Galaxy S25 Edge already official, Apple fans are now eyeing the rumored iPhone 17 Air. While some speculation has me excited, like the presence of a ProMotion OLED screen and an A19 chip on the slimmest iPhone, I'm a bit concerned about its camera and battery performance.\nUltra-Slim Titanium Chassis With Camera Control Button\nThe iPhone 17 Air is said to be Apple's thinnest iPhone ever. Currently, that title rests with the iPhone 6 (with a 6.9mm thin chassis). However, the iPhone Air will be even slimmer, measuring 5.5mm at its thinnest, excluding the camera bump (via Ming-Chi Kuo).\nChinese tipster Ice Universe claims that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 4.0mm camera bump, implying that it could measure 9.5mm at the thickest point.\nSpeaking of the camera, it is expected to reside in a pill-shaped horizontal housing at the top of the back panel (similar to what we've seen on the recent Google Pixel smartphones), as claimed by tipster Majin Bu. A report by MacRumors states that all models in the iPhone 17 lineup will use an aluminum frame, except for the iPhone 17 Air, which may feature a titanium frame.\nAt first, this may sound counterintuitive, but aluminum's lower carbon footprint could help Apple achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Meanwhile, carving a titanium frame for the iPhone Air could enhance its rigidity and in-hand feel (and bring parity with the Galaxy S25 Edge).\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that the super-thin iPhone will feature the Camera Control button (as seen on the latest iPhone 16 lineup) and a USB-C port at the bottom (toward the back panel instead of the center).\nThe handset is also said to feature the programmable Action Button, as seen in the pictures of the iPhone 17 dummies shared by Australian leaker Sonny Dickson. Last but not least, the Naver (Korean blog) user \"yeux1122\" claims that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh about 145 grams.\niPhone 17 Air Could Get a 6.6-Inch OLED ProMotion Screen\nFirst, the super-thin iPhone is said to have a 6.55-inch screen (which could be marketed as a 6.6-inch screen), according to a report by 9to5Mac that cites Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young. Kuo also corroborates the 6.6-inch screen size, which could make it bigger than the display on the standard and the Pro iPhones in the lineup.\nWhat's interesting is that the handset is rumored to use Samsung's M14 OLED panel, the one that powers the ProMotion display (LTPO panel with variable refresh rate) on the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThere has been some chatter about the non-Pro iPhones getting a 120Hz fixed refresh rate LTPS screen, according to a Chinese tipster.\nI believe that including a ProMotion screen on the iPhone Air would make much more sense, as it would help preserve battery life by switching to 1Hz when viewing static content or in always-on mode, as opposed to a panel locked at 120Hz.\nThe sleekest iPhone should also retain the Dynamic Island from the recent iPhones, but sources seem to be divided on its width. While analyst Jeff Pu believes that Apple could utilize metalens technology for the Face ID system on all iPhone 17 models (via 9to5Mac) to reduce the thickness of the Dynamic Island, Kuo doesn't expect the pill-shaped cutout to change at all.\nApple's Ultra-Thin iPhone Could Get the A19 Chip\nBack in the day, Apple used to power its regular and Pro iPhones with the same chip. Take the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro as examples: both feature the A14 chip. However, beginning with the iPhone 14 series, the company started equipping the Pro iPhones with more powerful chips, giving buyers a clear incentive to upgrade.\nLast year, the Cupertino giant released two new chips based on TSMC's N3E (3nm) fabrication technology: A18 (for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and A18 Pro (for the iPhone 16 Pro models). If Apple sticks to its plan, we should see two new processors later this year: the A19 and the A19 Pro.\nContrary to this, a MacRumors report citing a research note shared by Jeff Pu suggests that the standard iPhone 17 may borrow the A18 chip from the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air may debut with a new A19 chip.\nAlthough we don't know the extent of CPU or GPU upgrades the A19 chip might offer, it is said to be based on TSMC's third-generation 3nm fabrication process called N3P (which should unlock higher clock speeds and improve efficiency).\nIf I were to speculate, the standard A19 chip should provide a modest performance improvement over the A18 Pro chip on the iPhone 16 Pro (somewhere around 10 to 15% better scores in synthetic benchmarks).\nBesides the processor, memory could be another difference between the regular and Air iPhones. Per Kuo, at least three variants in the iPhone 17 lineup may feature 12GB of RAM (mostly to accommodate all the Apple Intelligence features), including the ultra-thin iPhone and the two Pro models.\n6 Things Apple Must Add to the iPhone 17 or I'm Not Upgrading\nGetting me to upgrade this year is going to require some changes.\nFrom what it looks like, Apple could use the performance advantage to sell more iPhone 17 Air units.\nIn-House C1 Modem and Custom Wi-Fi Chip\nIn February 2025, Gurman (in December 2024) and Kuo (in July 2024) collectively stated that Apple's slimmest iPhone would use the in-house C1 modem, the one that debuted with the iPhone 16e.\nAccording to Apple, the C1 subsystem is the power-efficient cellular chip in an iPhone, which could help the iPhone 17 Air conserve battery while browsing via mobile data or making a voice call. However, the modem only supports sub-6 GHz 5G connectivity.\nIn February 2025, Kuo also claimed that all iPhones in the iPhone 17 lineup will utilize Apple's custom Wi-Fi chip, which may support Wi-Fi 7, as part of the company's plans to transition from the Broadcom Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips currently used in iPhones.\nDeveloping a Wi-Fi chip will give the company more control over its cost, configuration, and optimization. Another connectivity-related change coming to the ultra-thin iPhone is the removal of the physical SIM card slot, i.e., the slimmest iPhone might be eSIM only.\nAll iPhone 17 Models Get iOS 26 and the Liquid Glass Design\nThanks to the Worldwide Developers Conference 2025, we already know about the operating system that will power the iPhone 17 lineup: iOS 26.\nYes, Apple has skipped five version numbers in favor of iOS 26, as it is standardizing the naming convention by moving to years (and aligning the version with its calendar year). Besides the name, it is the Liquid Glass design language that's the center of attraction.\nThe Liquid Glass design largely consists of translucent user interface layers that each behaves as if they were made of glass. The layers, when stacked on top of one another, also exhibit the properties of reflection and refraction as if they were made of real-world glass.\nAll The iOS 26 iPhone Features You're Not Getting This Fall\nApple didn't discuss them, but we found 'em all!\nWith iOS 26, Apple has added elements across the board, such as floating on-screen elements like menus, a glassy lock screen clock (with dynamic sizing), Call Screening and Hold Assist in the native Phone app, Live Translation in the Messages app, an overhauled CarPlay with the Liquid Glass design, so on and so forth.\nDon't Expect Dual Cameras (Or Speakers) on the iPhone 17 Air\nMultiple sources, including an Instagram reel by WEIS Studio, a YouTube video from the popular channel Front Page Tech, and a CAD render shared by leaker Majin Bu, all point toward a horizontal camera bump on the iPhone 17 Air, housing a single camera lens.\nAs seen in videos and renders, the camera bar features the lens on the left, while the microphone and LED flash module are positioned on the right. In October 2024, Jeff Pu (via a MacRumors report) claimed that the slim iPhone 17 would feature a single 48MP rear-facing camera, and that has been the collective opinion ever since.\nYou'd get lossless in-sensor crop (2x) and fantastic video stabilization, but you won't be able to zoom out in case you need to capture a group picture. So, if you're someone who captures a lot of ultrawide pictures, the thinnest iPhone could be disappointing for you.\nMost recently, I commended Samsung for equipping its super-thin flagship, the Galaxy S25 Edge, with a dual-rear-facing camera setup (200MP + 12MP), and, unfortunately, the iPhone 17 Air's camera may lack this versatility.\nHowever, you should still get all the other features, including Photographic Styles, portraits with focus and depth control, Cinematic Video, Dolby Vision recording, and many more. On the front, the thinnest iPhone 17 may feature a 24MP camera, up from the 12MP sensor found on the iPhone 16 lineup.\nAccording to a report by The Information, the iPhone 17 Air will feature a single speaker in the earpiece; you might not get a dual-speaker setup after all. This will most certainly result in a reduction of the loudness and fullness of sound from the speaker.\niPhone 17 Air's Battery Conundrum\nLast month, The Information reported (citing Apple's internal tests) that only 60 to 70% of iPhone 17 Air customers will be able to use the phone for a day without needing to recharge it. For other iPhones, this number is around 80 to 90%.\nThough I don't remember a day I didn't have to plug in my iPhone 16 before sleeping to finish off the digital chores at the end of the day, the iPhone 17 Air's battery situation could be even more concerning, especially for heavy users like me. To solve the issue, Apple could release battery cases for the slim iPhone (last seen for the iPhone 11 lineup).\nThe leaker \"yeux1122\" says (via a blog post on Naver) that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 2,800 mAh battery. However, Apple is also said to use a high-density, silicon-anode battery (according to Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg, respectively), which could increase the effective usage time by 15-20% (when compared to a regular 2,800 mAh battery).\nHow the Ultra-Thin iPhone Air Could Avoid the Galaxy Edge's Biggest Problems\nThe iPhone 17 Air might be a better deal than the Galaxy S25 Edge, provided Apple solves these problems.\nPer Dickson (mentioned earlier in the article), the purported iPhone could also feature the MagSafe charging infrastructure (including the wireless charging coil and the magnetic rings).\nPrice and Availability\nApple might price the slimmest iPhone between the standard and the Pro version, or similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus (whose baseline variant costs $899). The Pro and the Pro Max, on the other hand, could cost $100 more than the current versions.\n-\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18\nThe iPhone16e is an affordable addition to the iPhone 16 line, costing $200 less than the base iPhone 16.\n-\nApple iPhone 16\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 chip\nApple's newest iPhone featuring a camera button, programmable action button, and artificial intelligence features.\n-\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro\n- Display\n- 2,622 x 1,206 resolution (460 ppi)\nA version of Apple's newest iPhone with a larger screen featuring a camera button, a programmable action button, and artificial intelligence features.\nIn terms of design, in-hand feel, display quality, and performance, the iPhone 17 Air looks set to be an exciting development. However, I'm skeptical about how potential customers would feel about its camera and battery life."

      "text": "As someone who prefers smaller phones, it\u2019s always been a bummer that Google reserves certain cameras for the bigger Pixel \u201cPro\u201d models. That\u2019s finally changing with the Pixel 10, and I\u2019m very excited.\nThe first time Google included a \u201cPro\u201d model was back in 2021 with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. They both had a 50MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide camera, but the Pro had one extra camera: a 48MP telephoto. It was the same story with the Pixel 7/7 Pro in 2022, the Pixel 8/8Pro in 2023, and the Pixel 10/10 Pro in 2024.\nThe non-Pro model has always been one camera behind. Dual cameras are nothing to scoff at, of course. A 50MP main camera is awesome, and ultrawide cameras can be useful too. However, I have found that an optical telephoto camera is much, much more valuable to me. I\u2019ve been using the Pixel 9 Pro XL for nearly a year, and I barely ever use the ultrawide camera, but the telephoto camera gets used all the time.\nThe Pixel 10 Breaks the Mold\nGoogle has finally given the base Pixel a third camera, a telephoto for the Pixel 10. This is an awesome upgrade for the most affordable phone in the series. Now, it\u2019s not the same telephoto camera that can be found on the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, but it\u2019s still an optical zoom camera, and that\u2019s what matters.\nThe lack of telephoto cameras in the base models of smartphones has bothered me for a long time. Manufacturers are more than happy to toss in an ultrawide or macro camera to go alongside the main shooter, but they\u2019re stingy with telephoto cameras. Those are reserved for the biggest and best phones, and I\u2019m tired of it. I\u2019m glad Google is finally giving the base Pixel some zoom love.\nGoogle Pixel 10\n- Brand\n- SoC\n- Google Tensor G5\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch Actua OLED, 20:9\n- RAM\n- 12 GB RAM\n- Storage\n- 128 GB / 256 GB\n- Battery\n- 4970mAh\nLooking to upgrade to a Pixel but not sure if you need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models? You won't be disappointed with the standard Pixel 10 model. Coming in striking colors, Gemini features, and seven years of updates, you can't go wrong with this purchase.\n- Operating System\n- Android 16\n- Front camera\n- 10.5 MP Dual PD selfie camera\n- Rear camera\n- 48 MP wide with Macro Focus | 13 MP ultrawide | 10.8 MP 5x telephoto lens\n- Connectivity\n- Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth v6\n- Dimensions\n- 6.0-inches x 2.8-inches x 0.3-inches\n- Colors\n- Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, Obsidian\n- Charge speed\n- Up to 55% in about 30 minutes\n- IP Rating\n- IP68\nThe Importance of Telephoto\nIn my opinion, telephoto cameras are the most useful cameras to have. Typically, when you take a photo with your phone, things will always look farther away than they do to you in real life\u2014that's just how lenses work. I\u2019ve found that I need at least a 2X zoom to bring subjects closer and more accurately match my perspective. But most things that I take a photo of are not right in front of me, which makes the 5X zoom equally as useful.\nThe Pixel 10\u2019s telephoto camera is 5X, just like the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, but it\u2019s only 10.8MP. The Pro models have 48MP telephoto cameras. Another difference in the telephoto cameras is Quad PD autofocus for the Pro models, whereas the Pixel 10 has Dual PD autofocus. So, the Pixel 10 is still clearly not on the same level, but it\u2019s much closer than previous generations.\nUltimately, it's a huge step in the right direction. Google has been holding back on its affordable phones for a long time, and a telephoto lens on the base Pixel 10 is a sign that things are changing. Yes, it's not the same sensor as the Pro model, and that's okay. You're getting a phone that's $200-400 less expensive than the Pro models, but still gets you some real zoom capabilities.\nObviously, it\u2019s never been an issue of Google not thinking people would want a zoom lens on the base model. They need to reserve some things for the more expensive models. For whatever reason, Google has let up on that just a bit, and I\u2019m hoping this is just the beginning of a new trend for Google's phones."

Scroll down the menu and select the item that says \"Battery.\" Choose \"Battery Saver\" and turn on \"Use Battery Saver.\"\nIn addition to Standard Battery Saver, Pixel 9 offers an Extreme Battery Saver mode, which further conserves phone battery. Note that this mode puts more restrictions on your apps and phone features.\n5 Google Pixel Features You Probably Didn\u2019t Know About\nYour Pixel has a few tricks up its sleeve.\n2 Lower the Screen Brightness\nAnother way to conserve battery on your Pixel 9 is by lowering the screen brightness. This is because the brighter your screen is, the more battery juice it uses. If you aren\u2019t outdoors, it\u2019s a good idea to lower the brightness without compromising on anything.\nPSA: You Can Make Your Android Screen Extra Dim\nWhen the lowest brightness setting isn't dim enough.\nTo do that, swipe down from the top of your phone\u2019s screen. You\u2019ll see the brightness slider at the top. Drag this slider to the left to decrease the brightness.\nYou can also get your phone to automatically adjust the screen brightness. To enable that feature, on your phone, head into Settings > Display & Touch and turn on \"Adaptive Brightness.\"\n3 Activate Adaptive Battery\nPixel 9 offers an adaptive battery feature that learns how you use your phone and then optimizes your apps for better battery usage. This feature may reduce performance and delay notifications.\nTo turn it on, head into Settings > Battery > Battery Saver. Tap \"Adaptive Battery\" and turn on \"Use Adaptive Battery.\"\n4 Enable Dark Theme on Your Phone\nTurning on dark mode on your Pixel 9 helps slightly conserve battery life. To enable it, head into Settings > Display & Touch and turn on \"Dark Theme.\"\nIf you want to turn on dark mode automatically at the specified schedule, tap \"Dark Theme,\" choose \"Schedule,\" and select \"Turns On at Custom Time\" or \"Turns On From Sunset to Sunshine.\" If you choose the former option, tap \"Start Time\" and select when to enable dark mode. Tap \"End Time\" and choose when dark mode should be disabled. This is when your phone gets back to light mode.\n5 Turn Off Location Services for All or Specific Apps\nThe location services feature is a big battery drainer as it uses your phone\u2019s GPS (Global Positioning System) to find your location. Many apps use this feature to locate where you are. You can turn off this feature for all or select apps to save battery.\nTo turn off location services entirely, head into Settings > Location and disable \"Use Location.\" This prevents all your apps from using location services.\nTo disable the feature for a specific app, on the Location screen, tap \"App Location Permissions.\" Select your app on the list and choose \"Don\u2019t Allow.\"\n6 Disable Pixel 9\u2019s Smooth Display Feature\nPixel 9 offers a Smooth Display feature that dynamically increases the screen refresh rate to 120Hz, giving you a more fluid experience. This comes at the cost of more battery usage.\nTo turn off the feature, head into Settings > Display & Touch. Scroll to the bottom and turn off \"Smooth Display.\"\nLater, you can reactivate the feature by turning on the toggle.\n7 Turn Off Always-On Display\nPixel 9 has an option that keeps your screen always on to show you time and certain other pieces of information. Since your screen remains always on, it uses more battery juice. You can turn off this feature to save battery.\nTo do that, head into Settings > Display & Touch > Lock Screen. Scroll down and disable \"Always Show Time and Info.\"\n8 Turn Off 5G and Switch to 4G\nIf you use 5G with your carrier, you can switch to 4G to save battery. This is because 5G uses more battery juice. To do that, head into Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs and tap your SIM card on the list.\nOn the following screen, choose \"Preferred Network Type\" and select \"4G.\"\nLater, you can switch back to 5G by tapping the \"Preferred Network Type\" drop-down menu and choosing \"5G.\"\nAnd that\u2019s how you make your Pixel 9 last as longer as possible by tweaking various system options. You should also follow other Android battery health tips to make your battery last longer."
