  "title": "Dolphins RB Alexander Mattison suffered season-ending neck injury vs. Bears",
  "description": "The injury couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time as the veteran tailback was in the midst of an impressive training camp.",
  "content": "Looks like the Miami Dolphins officially need running back help.\n\nAlexander Mattison suffered during Sunday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bears, according to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter. The 27-year-old underwent surgery at a Chicago-area hospital.\n\nThis news comes less than 24 hours after Mattison . In the third quarter of Sunday\u2019s preseason matchup, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers fired a pass to the veteran tailback who took the ball 21 yards to the Bears\u2019 3-yard line. That\u2019s when Bears safety Tysheem Johnson tackled Mattison who landed awkwardly on his head.\n\nAlthough Mattison later walked off on his own power, he was not present in the locker room after the game. Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel initially called the injury \u201csoreness\u201d but confirmed that he wasn\u2019t in concussion protocol.\n\n\u201cHe had some neck and shoulder soreness, but we\u2019ll find out more in the next couple of days,\u201d McDaniel said Sunday.\n\nFollowing stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Las Vegas Raiders, Mattison signed with the Dolphins in March 2025 to help solve some of . He converted an astounding 91% of his short yardage situations on the ground into first downs or touchdowns in 2024. As a team, the Dolphins converted just 59% of the same opportunities.\n\n\u201cI think I was also blessed with a certain type of running style and technique that allows me to break tackles and do some things,\u201d Mattison said in late March.\n\nThe injury news especially hurts considering Mattison was in the midst of a very impressive training camp in which he showcased more than just his prowess in short yardage situations. At the time of his injury, the former Boise State standout had already rushed for the Dolphins\u2019 first touchdown of the day and accounted for nearly 30 yards from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great running back,\u201d Dolphins tailback De\u2019Von Achane said of Mattison who had amassed more than 2,750 yards across his career. \u201cFor his size he actually does move, he\u2019s got great feet, he\u2019s got great vision. For somebody to be that big he moves quite great.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel praised his ability to \u201cdefine\u201d himself outside of the limits that the NFL has already placed on him.\n\n\u201cHere we allow your play to tell us who you are and how you adjust to coaching and how willing you are to invest in your game and your team,\u201d McDaniel said Aug. 1. \u201cHe\u2019s a great example as a veteran player who I\u2019m hoping he knew that kind of box-in that he\u2019s had because that was the whole basis of my continued joke that I\u2019ve been yelling at him. I think that\u2019s the great thing about football and being on a team in the National Football League, is a lot of people have a lot of opinions and collectively you can work together so that individually you can define yourself.\u201d\n\nThe loss of Mattison for the entire 2025 season makes tailback an immediate need for the Dolphins. As of Sunday, the running back room has Achane, sophomore Jaylen Wright, the rookie Ollie Gordon Jr. and fullback Alec Ingold.\n\nThat\u2019s likely why the Dolphins hosted free agent tailback Jamaal Williams for on Monday, according to Schefter. With more than 4,100 career rushing yards, Williams brings experience and the ability to convert in short-yardage situations. The former 2017 fourth-round pick has spent time with the Green Bay Packers, Detroit Lions and, most recently, New Orleans Saints.\n\nAt his peak, Williams rushed for more than 1,000 yards and scored a league-leading 17 touchdowns in 2022. He has yet to eclipse those marks again, however, has shown the ability to convert his short-yardage opportunities. Case in point: of his 212 career rushing attempts with three or less yards to go, Williams has converted an impressive 78% into touchdowns or first downs . That\u2019s slightly more than Mattison (73%) as well as a slew of top running backs including the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Saquon Barkley (70%) and the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Jonathan Taylor (70%).",
