  "description": "After finding it violated Jewish students' civil rights by tolerating antisemitism",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Monday intensified its battle with Harvard University, formally finding the school tolerated antisemitism \u2014 a step that could jeopardize all of Harvard\u2019s federal funding, including federal student aid.\n\nIn a letter sent to Harvard, a federal task force said its investigation had found the university was a \u201cwillful participant\u201d in antisemitic harassment of Jewish students and faculty. The task force threatened to refer the case to the Justice Department to file a civil rights lawsuit \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d unless Harvard comes into compliance.\n\nThe finding escalates the White House\u2019s conflict with Harvard, which has faced mounting sanctions after rejecting a list of federal demands calling for sweeping changes to campus governance, hiring and admissions. Already, the government has slashed more than $2.6 billion in research grants. But the civil rights violation could jeopardize Harvard\u2019s eligibility to accept federal loans or grants for students to attend the university \u2014 a penalty often referred to as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d in higher education.\n\n\u201cFailure to institute adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard\u2019s relationship with the federal government,\u201d officials said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press and first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Trump administration for months has accused Harvard of tolerating antisemitism on its campus, but a formal investigative finding gives the administration a channel to block more federal funding.\n\nTrump personally has railed against Harvard, but on June 20 suggested a deal resolving the monthslong conflict could be coming soon. In a post on social media, Trump said Harvard has \u201cacted extremely appropriately\u201d during negotiations. He did not elaborate on the terms of a potential resolution.\n\nHarvard has not commented on whether it is negotiating with the White House. On Monday, Harvard said it strongly disagrees with the government\u2019s findings and is committed to fighting bias.\n\n\u201cAntisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cHarvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community.\u201d\n\nFederal officials made their case in a 57-page report detailing an investigation by the civil rights office of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency is among several represented on a federal antisemitism task force.\n\nThe government\u2019s investigation largely relied on a campus antisemitism study commissioned by Harvard and released in April. Federal officials cited numerous details from that report, including accounts of Jewish students who said they were spit on and faced chants on campus including \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d\n\nIt focuses heavily on last year\u2019s protests over the Israel-Hamas war. In the letter to Harvard, federal officials said the campus was \u201coverrun by an impermissible, multiweek encampment\u201d that left Jewish and Israeli students fearful and disrupted their studies.\n\nIt accuses Harvard of imposing lax and inconsistent discipline against students who participated in the encampment, noting that none were suspended.\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber has acknowledged problems with antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus, but he says Harvard has made strides to fight prejudice. He announced new initiatives in April upon release of the antisemitism study.\n\n\u201cHarvard cannot \u2014 and will not \u2014 abide bigotry,\u201d Garber wrote at the time.\n\nThe Monday letter finds Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Such findings have almost always been resolved through voluntary resolutions between schools and the federal government. The Trump administration has taken a much sharper edge than its predecessors, however.\n\nIt has been decades since an administration even attempted to strip a school or college of its federal funding over civil rights violations. Trump officials are seeking that outcome in a Justice Department lawsuit against Maine over transgender athletes, and it\u2019s threatening the same action in a similar investigation into California.\n\nTrump officials have barraged Harvard with sanctions after it became the first university to defy White House demands addressing accusations of antisemitism and liberal bias. Along with research cuts, the administration has attempted to bar Harvard from hosting foreign students, and President Donald Trump has said the school should lose its tax-exempt status.\n\nSome of the actions have been blocked by courts after Harvard sued, accusing the government of illegal retaliation.\n\nHarvard\u2019s previous funding cuts were carried out under a provision allowing the government to end grants and contracts that no longer align with federal priorities. That strategy is believed to be unprecedented and is being challenged in court. But by invoking a civil rights violation, the government has put Harvard on an established path to further penalties.",

      "text": "California found in violation of Title IX in clash with Trump officials over transgender athletes\nCalifornia found in violation of Title IX in clash with Trump officials over transgender athletes\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has found that the California Department of Education and the state\u2019s high school sports federation violated civil rights law by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams.\nThe federal Education Department announced the finding Wednesday and proposed a resolution that would require California to bar transgender women from women\u2019s sports and strip transgender athletes of records, titles and awards. It\u2019s the latest escalation in the Republican administration\u2019s effort to bar transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports teams nationwide.\nIf California rejects the proposal, the Education Department could move to terminate the state\u2019s federal education funding.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration will relentlessly enforce Title IX protections for women and girls, and our findings today make clear that California has failed to adhere to its obligations under federal law,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. \u201cThe state must swiftly come into compliance with Title IX or face the consequences that follow.\u201d\nTitle IX is a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination based in education.\nCalifornia education and sports officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\nFederal officials opened an investigation into the California Interscholastic Federation in February after the organization said it would abide by a state law allowing athletes to compete on teams consistent with their gender identity. That followed an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that was intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls and women\u2019s sports.\nIn April, McMahon\u2019s department opened an investigation into the California Department of Education over the same issue.\nBoth investigations concluded that state policies violated Title IX. The administration has been invoking the law in its campaign against transgender athletes, launching scores of investigations into schools, colleges and states. It\u2019s a reversal from the Biden administration, which attempted to expand Title IX to provide protections for transgender students. A federal judge struck down the expansion before Trump took office in January.\nThe administration\u2019s proposed resolution would require California to notify schools that transgender athletes should be barred from girls athletic teams and that all schools must \u201cadopt biology-based definitions of the words \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female.\u2019\u201d The state would also have to notify schools that any conflicting interpretation of state law would be considered a violation of Title IX.\nAthletes who lost awards, titles or records to transgender athletes would have their honors restored under the proposal, and the state would be required to send personal apology letters to those athletes.\nA similar resolution was offered to Maine\u2019s education agency in a separate clash with the administration over transgender athletes. Maine rejected the proposal in April, prompting a Justice Department lawsuit seeking to terminate the state\u2019s federal education funding.\nUnder federal guidelines, California\u2019s education office and the sports federation have 10 days to come into compliance or risk enforcement action.\nThe federation separately tested a pilot policy at a state track meet in May, allowing one extra competitor in three events featuring high school junior AB Hernandez, who is trans. The organization announced the change after Trump took to social medial to criticize Hernandez\u2019s participation. The Justice Department said it would investigate Hernandez\u2019s district and the state to determine if Title IX was being violated.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "text": "Trump administration moves to cut $100 million in federal contracts for Harvard\nTrump administration moves to cut $100 million in federal contracts for Harvard\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration asked federal agencies Tuesday to cancel contracts with Harvard University worth about $100 million, intensifying the president\u2019s clash with the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university.\nThe government already has canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants for the Ivy League school, which has pushed back on the administration\u2019s demands for changes to several of its policies.\nA letter sent Tuesday from the General Services Administration, which oversees contracting and real estate for the federal government, directed agencies to review contracts with the university and seek alternate arrangements.\nThe New York Times first reported on the letter.\nPresident Donald Trump has railed against Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. The school filed a lawsuit April 21 over the administration\u2019s calls for changes to the university\u2019s leadership, governance and admissions policies. Since then, the administration has slashed the school\u2019s federal funding, moved to cut off enrollment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.\nContracts include scientific research, executive training\nThe administration has identified about 30 contracts across nine agencies to be reviewed for cancellation, according to an administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided details on the condition of anonymity.\nThe contracts total roughly $100 million, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. The contracts include executive training for Department of Homeland Security officials, research on health outcomes related to energy drinks and a contract for graduate student research services.\nAgencies with contracts that are deemed critical are being directed not to halt them immediately, but to devise a plan to transition to a vendor other than Harvard.\nThe letter applies only to federal contracts with Harvard and not its remaining research grants.\nTrump threatens to give Harvard\u2019s funding to trade schools\nTrump laid into Harvard on social media over the weekend, threatening to cut an additional $3 billion in federal grants and give it to trade schools across the United States. He did not explain which grants he was referring to or how they could be reallocated.\nThe president also accused Harvard of refusing to release the names of its foreign students. In a new line of attack, he argued that students\u2019 home countries pay nothing toward their education and that some of the countries are \u201cnot at all friendly to the United States.\u201d\nInternational students are not eligible for federal financial aid, but Harvard offers its own aid to foreign and domestic students alike.\n\u201cWe are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country,\u201d Trump said on social media.\nIt was not clear exactly what the president was referring to. The federal government already has access to visa information and other records on foreign students at Harvard and other universities.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of files related to its foreign students, including disciplinary records and records related to \u201cdangerous or violent activity.\u201d\nHarvard says it complied, but the agency said its response fell short and moved to revoke the university\u2019s ability to enroll foreign students. A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the move after Harvard sued.\nHarvard rallies against Trump administration\nTrump administration officials have said some of Harvard\u2019s international students are promoting antisemitism on campus. But the ban on international students has \u201cnothing to do with combating antisemitism,\u201d said Jacob Miller, a former president of Harvard Hillel, who is graduating this week with math and economics concentrations.\n\u201cAntisemitism is a real problem. It\u2019s a problem at Harvard. It\u2019s a problem in our country,\u201d Miller said Tuesday at a rally outside Harvard Yard. \u201cThese policies will do nothing to combat this age-old hatred. Instead, they are designed to divide us. ... The Jewish community rejects this administration\u2019s narrative. We will not allow our identities to be invoked to destroy Harvard.\u201d\nHarvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on its \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation.\nHarvard\u2019s international students await further court rulings to find out whether they can enroll in summer or fall classes. Some say they\u2019re discussing backup plans.\nThe government\u2019s ban would not apply to students graduating this week, such as Jemma Liu, a Chinese student who studied landscape architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.\n\u201cI hope the situation will resolve,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens next. But I do feel a privilege that I can actually graduate tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the international students are caught in right now is just a limbo,\u201d said Leo Gerd\u00e9n, a graduating senior from Sweden.\nOther nations respond\nJapan\u2019s government said Tuesday that it\u2019s looking for ways to help Harvard\u2019s foreign students. Education Minister Toshiko Abe told reporters she planned to ask Japanese universities to compile measures to support international students.\nThe University of Tokyo, Japan\u2019s top school, is considering temporarily accepting some Harvard students hit by the Trump sanctions.\nUniversities in other countries have made similar moves, including two in Hong Kong that recently extended invitations to Harvard students.\nOn Harvard\u2019s campus, law student Carson Durdel said he was proud of the university for standing up to Trump. He said intellectual independence has historically made the United States strong.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason we are like a beacon for the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that undermining those things, cutting those things is not only a bad short-term view but a horrendous long-term view.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "text": "Trump administration sues Maine over participation of transgender athletes in girls sports\nTrump administration sues Maine over participation of transgender athletes in girls sports\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday sued Maine for not complying with the government\u2019s push to ban transgender athletes in girls and women\u2019s sports, escalating a dispute over whether the state is abiding by a federal law that bars discrimination in education based on sex.\nThe lawsuit follows weeks of feuding between the Republican administration and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills that has led to threats to cut off crucial federal funding and a clash at the White House when she told President Donald Trump: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\nThe political overtones of the moment were clear, with Attorney General Pam Bondi \u2014 and one of the athletes who joined her on stage at the Justice Department \u2014 citing the matter as a priority for Trump. Bondi said other states, including Minnesota and California, could be sued as well.\n\u201cPresident Trump, before he was elected, this has been a huge issue for him,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cPretty simple: girls play in girls\u2019 sports, boys play in boys\u2019 sports. Men play in men\u2019s sports, women play in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Trump administration is suing Maine over letting transgender athletes take part in girls\u2019 sports.\nTrump campaigned against the participation of transgender athletes in sports in his 2024 race. As president, he has signed executive orders to prohibit that and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court.\nTrump\u2019s departments of Education and Health and Human Services have said Maine\u2019s education agency is violating the federal Title IX antidiscrimination law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls teams. The Justice Department is asking the court to order the state to direct all schools to prohibit the participation of males in athletic competition designated for females.\nMaine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. Mills said Wednesday that the lawsuit was expected and is part of a pressure campaign by Washington to force Maine to ignore its own human rights laws.\n\u201cThis matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,\u201d Mills said in a statement.\nMaine\u2019s attorney general, Aaron Frey, said Wednesday he is confident Maine is acting in accordance with state and federal law.\n\u201cOur position is further bolstered by the complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration\u2019s position in its own complaint,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the President issued an executive order that reflects his own interpretation of the law, anyone with the most basic understanding of American civics understands the president does not create law nor interpret law. \u201d\nThe government\u2019s complaint cites as examples the case of a transgender athlete who in February won first place in pole vault at a Maine indoor track and field meet and a transgender athlete who last year began competing in female cross country races in the state and placed first in a girl\u2019s 5K run.\nThe lawsuit reflects a stark philosophical turnabout from the position on gender identity issues taken during Democratic administrations.\nUnder President Joe Biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. In 2016, the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sued North Carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.\nTrump signed an executive order in February, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with his administration\u2019s interpretation of \u201csex\u201d as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\nBondi was joined at the news conference by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who has emerged as a public face of the opposition to transgender athletes. Gaines tied with a transgender athlete for fifth place in a 2022 NCAA championship and has testified before lawmakers across the country on the issue. She and others frame the issue as women\u2019s rights.\nDuring a February meeting with governors, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order. Mills responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\nMaine sued the administration this month after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state\u2019s educational programs because of what the administration contended was Maine\u2019s failure to comply with the Title IX law. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.\nQuestions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.\nTwenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. GOP-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings.\n____\nWhittle reported from Portland, Maine.

      "text": "How Trump has targeted Harvard\u2019s international students \u2014 and what the latest court ruling means\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have tried several tactics to block Harvard University\u2019s enrollment of international students, part of the White House\u2019s effort to secure policy changes at the private, Ivy League college.\nTargeting foreign students has become the administration\u2019s cornerstone effort to crack down on the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college. The block on international enrollment, which accounts for a quarter of Harvard\u2019s students and much of its global allure, strikes at the core of Harvard\u2019s identity. Courts have stopped some of the government\u2019s actions, at least for now \u2014 but not all.\nIn the latest court order, a federal judge on Friday put one of those efforts on hold until a lawsuit is resolved. But the fate of Harvard\u2019s international students \u2014 and its broader standoff with the Trump administration \u2014 remain in limbo.\nHere are all the ways the Trump administration has moved to block Harvard\u2019s foreign enrollment \u2014 and where each effort stands.\nHomeland Security tries to revoke Harvard\u2019s certification to host foreign students\nIn May, the Trump administration tried to ban foreign students at Harvard, citing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s authority to oversee which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program. The program allows colleges to issue documents that foreign students need to study in the United States.\nHarvard filed a lawsuit, arguing the administration violated the government\u2019s own regulations for withdrawing a school\u2019s certification.\nWithin hours, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston put the administration\u2019s ban on hold temporarily \u2014 an order that had an expiration date. On Friday, she issued a preliminary injunction, blocking Homeland Security\u2019s move until the case is decided. That could take months or longer.\nThe government can and does remove colleges from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, making them ineligible to host foreign students on their campus. However, it\u2019s usually for administrative reasons outlined in law, such as failing to maintain accreditation, lacking proper facilities for classes, failing to employ qualified professional personnel \u2014 even failing to \u201coperate as a bona fide institution of learning.\u201d Other colleges are removed when they close.\nNotably, Burroughs\u2019 order Friday said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law. After Burroughs\u2019 emergency block in May, DHS issued a more typical \u201cNotice of Intent to Withdraw\u201d Harvard\u2019s participation in the international student visa program.\n\u201cToday\u2019s order does not affect the DHS\u2019s ongoing administrative review,\u201d Harvard said Friday in a message to its international students. \u201cHarvard is fully committed to compliance with the applicable F-1 (student visa) regulations and strongly opposes any effort to withdraw the University\u2019s certification.\u201d\nTrump has sought to ban U.S. entry for incoming Harvard students\nEarlier this month, Trump himself moved to block entry to the United States for incoming Harvard students, issuing a proclamation that invoked a different legal authority.\nHarvard filed a court challenge attacking Trump\u2019s legal justification for the action \u2014 a federal law allowing him to block a \u201cclass of aliens\u201d deemed detrimental to the nation\u2019s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cclass of aliens,\u201d Harvard said in its filing.\nHarvard\u2019s lawyers asked the court to block the action. Burroughs agreed to pause the entry ban temporarily, without giving an expiration date. She has not yet ruled on Harvard\u2019s request for another preliminary injunction, which would pause the ban until the court case is decided. \u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard told international students Friday.\nAt the center of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Harvard are his assertions that the school has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment, especially during pro-Palestinian protests. In seeking to keep Harvard students from coming to the U.S., he said Harvard is not a suitable destination. Harvard President Alan Garber has said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism and will not submit to the administration\u2019s demands for further changes.\nThe administration has stepped up scrutiny of Harvard scholars\u2019 and students\u2019 visas\nIn late May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed U.S. embassies and consulates to start reviewing social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.\nOn Wednesday, the State Department said it was launching new vetting of social media accounts for foreigners applying for student visas, and not just those seeking to attend Harvard. Consular officers will be on the lookout for posts and messages that could be deemed hostile to the United States, its government, culture, institutions or founding principles, the department said, telling visa applicants to set their social media accounts to \u201cpublic.\u201d\nIn reopening the visa process, the State Department also told consulates to prioritize students hoping to enroll at colleges where foreigners make up less than 15% of the student body, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail information that has not been made public.\nForeign students make up more than 15% of the total student body at almost 200 U.S. universities \u2014 including Harvard and the other Ivy League schools, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal education data from 2023. Most are private universities, including all eight Ivy League schools.\nSome Harvard students are also caught up in the government\u2019s recent ban against travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle East. The Trump administration last weekend called for 36 additional countries to commit to improving vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States.\nInternational students make up half the students at some Harvard programs\nHarvard sponsors more than 7,000 people on a combination of F-1 and J-1 visas, which are issued to students and to foreigners visiting the U.S. on exchange programs such as fellowships. Across all the schools that make up the university, about 26% of the student body is from outside the U.S.\nBut some schools and programs, by nature of their subject matter, have significantly more international students. At the Harvard Kennedy School, which covers public policy and public administration, 49% of students are on F-1 visas. In the business school, one-third of students come from abroad. And within the law school, 94% of the students in the master\u2019s program in comparative law are international students.\nThe administration has imposed a range of sanctions on Harvard since it rejected the government\u2019s demands for policy reforms related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Conservatives say the demands are merited, decrying Harvard as a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism. Harvard says the administration is illegally retaliating against the university.\n____\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "text": "Trump re-ups his threat to strip Harvard University\u2019s tax-exempt status\nTrump re-ups his threat to strip Harvard University\u2019s tax-exempt status\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday re-upped his threat to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status, escalating a showdown with the first major college that has defied the administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on campus activism.\nHe\u2019s underscoring that pledge even as federal law prohibits senior members of the executive branch from asking the Internal Revenue Service to conduct or terminate an audit or an investigation. The White House has said any IRS actions will be conducted independently of the president.\n\u201cWe are going to be taking away Harvard\u2019s Tax Exempt Status,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Friday morning from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is spending the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s what they deserve!\u201d\nThe president has questioned the fate of Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status \u2014 which a majority of U.S. colleges and universities have \u2014 ever since the school refused to comply with the administration\u2019s demands for broad government and leadership changes, revisions to its admissions policy, and audits of how diversity is viewed on the campus. That prompted the administration to block more than $2 billion in federal grants to the Cambridge, Massachusetts, institution.\nHarvard stressed Friday that there is \u201cno legal basis\u201d to revoke its tax-exempt status.\n\u201cSuch an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cIt would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\u201d\nThe Treasury Department directed a senior official at the Internal Revenue Service to begin the process of revoking Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status shortly after a social media post from Trump in mid-April questioning it, although the White House has suggested that the tax agency\u2019s scrutiny of Harvard began before Trump\u2019s public comments targeting the school.\nDemocrats say Trump\u2019s actions against Harvard are purely political. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, along with Massachusetts\u2019 two Democratic senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, and the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Ron Wyden of Oregon, called for an inspector general investigation into Trump\u2019s attempts to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status.\nTrump\u2019s move \u201craises troubling constitutional questions, including whether the president is trying to squelch Harvard\u2019s free speech rights and whether the revocation of its tax-exempt status will deprive the university of its due process rights,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter Friday to Heather Hill, the acting Treasury inspector general for tax administration.\nMike Kaercher, deputy director of NYU\u2019s Tax Law Center, said: \u201cOverwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress have enacted laws making it a crime for the President and his staff to request an audit or investigation of a particular taxpayer.\u201d\nAn IRS representative did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\nTrump\u2019s battle against Harvard is part of a broader campaign the administration is framing as an effort to root out antisemitism on college campuses. But the White House also sees a political upside in the fight, framing it as a bigger war against elite institutions decried by Trump\u2019s loyal supporters.\nThe \u201cnext chapter of the American story will not be written by The Harvard Crimson,\u201d Trump said Thursday night in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he delivered the commencement address at the University of Alabama. \u201cIt will be written by you, the Crimson Tide.\u201d\nThe Harvard Crimson is that school\u2019s student newspaper. The Crimson Tide refers to the Alabama school\u2019s football program.\nIn addition to threatening Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status and halting federal grants, the Trump administration wants to block Harvard from being able to enroll international students.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report."

Notably, Burroughs said the federal government still has authority to review Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students through normal processes outlined in law.\nHarvard sued the Department of Homeland Security in May after the agency abruptly withdrew the school\u2019s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork for their visas, skirting most of its usual procedures. The action would have forced Harvard\u2019s roughly 7,000 international students \u2014 about a quarter of its total enrollment \u2014 to transfer or risk being in the U.S. illegally. New foreign students would have been barred from coming to Harvard.\nThe university said it was experiencing illegal retaliation for rejecting the White House\u2019s demands to overhaul Harvard policies related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Burroughs temporarily had halted the government\u2019s action hours after Harvard sued.\nLess than two weeks later, in early June, President Donald Trump tried a new strategy. He issued a proclamation to block foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard, citing a different legal justification. Harvard challenged the move, saying the president was attempting an end-run around the temporary court order. Burroughs temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s proclamation as well. That emergency block remains in effect, and Burroughs did not address the proclamation in her order Friday.\n\u201cWe expect the judge to issue a more enduring decision in the coming days,\u201d Harvard said Friday in an email to international students. \u201cOur Schools will continue to make contingency plans toward ensuring that our international students and scholars can pursue their academic work to the fullest extent possible, should there be a change to student visa eligibility or their ability to enroll at Harvard.\u201d\nStudents in limbo\nThe stops and starts of the legal battle have unsettled current students and left others around the world waiting to find out whether they will be able to attend America\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of \u201cprofound fear, concern, and confusion,\u201d the university said in a court filing. Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said.\nStill, admissions consultants and students have indicated most current and prospective Harvard scholars are holding out hope they\u2019ll be able to attend the university.\nFor one prospective graduate student, an admission to Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education had rescued her educational dreams. Huang, who asked to be identified only by her surname for fear of being targeted, had seen her original doctoral offer at Vanderbilt University rescinded after federal cuts to research and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.\nHarvard stepped in a few weeks later with a scholarship she couldn\u2019t refuse. She rushed to schedule her visa interview in Beijing. More than a month after the appointment, despite court orders against the Trump administration\u2019s policies, she still hasn\u2019t heard back.\n\u201cYour personal effort and capability means nothing in this era,\u201d Huang said in a social media post. \u201cWhy does it have to be so hard to go to school?\u201d\nAn ongoing battle\nTrump has been warring with Harvard for months after the university rejected a series of government demands meant to address conservative complaints that the school has become too liberal and has tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.

Some schools overseas quickly offered invitations to Harvard\u2019s students, including two universities in Hong Kong.\nHarvard President Alan Garber previously said the university has made changes to combat antisemitism.

      "text": "Harvard pledges reforms following internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab bias\nHarvard pledges reforms following internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab bias\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Harvard University is promising to review its academic offerings and admissions policies in response to a pair of internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the Ivy League campus commissioned in the aftermath of last spring\u2019s pro-Palestinian protests.\nHarvard released the reports on Tuesday while the university simultaneously battles the Trump administration over demands to limit campus activism \u2014 reforms the government says are necessary to root out campus antisemitism. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and Harvard responded with a lawsuit in a clash that is being watched closely across higher education.\nIn a campus message, Harvard President Alan Garber said Harvard has made \u201cnecessary changes and essential progress\u201d over the last year but promised further action.\n\u201cWe will redouble our efforts to ensure that the University is a place where ideas are welcomed, entertained and contested in the spirit of seeking truth,\u201d Garber wrote.\nGarber convened two panels to study campus antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias last year, with an initial round of recommendations released last June. The final reports total more than 500 pages and include dozens of recommended changes.\nHarvard said it will begin implementing at least some of the recommendations, with potential updates to admissions, hiring and discipline systems.\nU.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, said Harvard\u2019s internal reports suggest it tolerated antisemitism.\n\u201cHarvard\u2019s president said the school will not abide bigotry, yet that\u2019s exactly what the school\u2019s feckless leadership did,\u201d said Walberg, a Michigan Republican.\nIn a list of \u201cactions and commitments,\u201d Harvard said it will review admissions processes to make sure applicants are evaluated based on their ability to \u201cengage constructively with different perspectives, show empathy and participate in civil discourse.\u201d\nIt pointed to a recently added application question asking students about a time they strongly disagreed with someone. The antisemitism task force called for that kind of questioning, saying Harvard should reject anyone with a history of bias and look unfavorably on \u201cexhibitions of hostility, derision or dismissiveness.\u201d\nStill, it appears to fall short of the Trump administration\u2019s demands around admissions, which called on Harvard to end all preferences \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof\u201d and implement \u201cmerit-based\u201d policies by August. The Supreme Court has rejected the use of race in college admissions, but many colleges look at factors including students\u2019 family income and geography to bring a diverse class to campus.\nResponding to complaints that Harvard\u2019s instruction had become too politicized and anti-Israel, the university said it will work to hold professors to new standards of \u201cexcellence.\u201d Deans will make sure faculty promote intellectual openness and refrain from endorsing political positions \u201cthat may cause students to feel pressure to demonstrate allegiance,\u201d the university said.\nCourses and curriculum will also be reviewed to reflect those standards.\nOther changes include required antisemitism training for students and staff, along with expanded academic offerings on Hebrew, Judaic, Arab and Islamic studies. Harvard will put money toward a research project on antisemitism along with a historical overview on Muslims, Arabs and Palestinians at the university.\nIn his message, Garber said Harvard will accelerate a campus-wide effort to promote viewpoint diversity, though he didn\u2019t elaborate. Viewpoint diversity is among the top concerns of the White House, which demanded that Harvard hire an external auditor to make sure the student body and every academic department represent diverse views.\nHarvard is the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it uses its hold on colleges\u2019 federal funding to press its political agenda.\nThe administration has argued that universities did not do enough to check antisemitism at campus protests last year. Garber has said Harvard will not bend to the demands, calling it a threat to academic freedom and the autonomy of all universities.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
