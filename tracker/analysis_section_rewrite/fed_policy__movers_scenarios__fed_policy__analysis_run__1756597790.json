      "feedback": "The draft lines miss key compliance elements: (1) no explicit magnitude range for DXY, (2) the canonical handle “DXY” is not embedded in the driver/mechanism, (3) the catalyst window is not tied to specific dates, and (4) the Down line on tech earnings rebound lacks a quantified DXY effect. Edit each line to include a +/‑ point range (e.g., “+0.5 to +1.5 points”), prepend “DXY” in the driver/mechanism, and embed the dated catalysts (Aug 12 CPI, Sep Fed, etc.) within that field. Add a citation for the magnitude claim. For the tech earnings line, specify the DXY pullback magnitude (e.g., “–0.3 to –0.8 points”) and cite the earnings source. Keep each line as a single sentence, preserve the strict “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” format, and ensure every numeric claim has an inline citation.",
