  "content": "The iPhone 17 series will be unveiled next week. Apple's \"Awe dropping\" event is scheduled for Tuesday, September 9. If Apple follows the traditional pattern, iPhone 17 pre-orders will begin later the same week on Friday, September 12. The new devices would likely then reach customers and retail stores the following Friday, September 19.\n\n\n\nIf you're in the market for a new iPhone this year, or just plain curious, here are 20 rumored features coming to the iPhone 17 lineup this month.\n\nApple plans to launch an all-new iPhone 17 model with a \"significantly thinner\" design, reports The Information. The device, which could be called \"iPhone 17 Air,\" will feature a \"major redesign\" that will feature a single rear camera located on a horizontal camera bar running along the top of the device, along with a narrower Dynamic Island, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker rear camera bump area. The device is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display size, and is likely to replace the Plus model in Apple's lineup. Other reported features include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, Apple's C1 modem, an Action button, a Camera Control button, and a 24MP front camera. See our iPhone 17 Air rumor roundup for more.\n\n\n\n 2. New All-Aluminum Design\n\nApple is reportedly planning to bring all its devices back to aluminum with the iPhone 17 lineup. The two flagship iPhone 17 Pro models will mark the return of aluminum frames to high-end iPhones for the first time since Apple began distinguishing between Pro and non-Pro models. In recent years, aluminum frames have been reserved for lower-end devices like the iPhone SE and iPhone 16, while premium models featured stainless steel frames until the iPhone 15 Pro, which introduced a titanium chassis as a major upgrade. This shift in materials for the iPhone 17 lineup signals a unified approach, with aluminum frames set to return across the entire device range.\n\n\n\n 3. Significantly Redesigned Camera\n\nThis year's iPhone 17 Pro models will have a major redesign, specifically centering around changes to the rear camera module. Apple will move away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width, according to recent reports. The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device. The redesigned camera module is not expected to extend to the regular iPhone 17.\n\nThe devices are rumored to feature a new rear design combining aluminum and glass. The top half of the back will be aluminum, incorporating a new camera bump made from aluminum instead of the traditional 3D glass. The bottom half will remain glass to enable wireless charging. While Apple has used a glass back since the \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 and \u200ciPhone\u200c X in 2017, earlier \u200ciPhone\u200c models \u2013 except the \u200ciPhone\u200c 3G, \u200ciPhone\u200c 3GS, and \u200ciPhone\u200c 5C \u2013 had aluminum rears.\n\n\n\n 4. New Display Sizes\n\nLast year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard \u200ciPhone\u200c model, while the equivalent \"iPhone 17 Plus\" model (provisionally called \"iPhone 17 Air\") could adopt completely new display dimensions.\n\n\n\n 5. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)\n\nRumors indicate Apple intends to expand ProMotion to all iPhone models in 2025, allowing all models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Previously, only \"Pro\" models in Apple's iPhone lineup have had the feature. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 \"Air\" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked. Most recently, one leaker has disputed that the non-Pro models will get ProMotion, claiming that they will come with fixed 120Hz screens to maintain some differentiation.\n\nApple's premium 2025 models are expected to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the \"Pro\" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.\n\nAn upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's premium devices is expected to be optimized for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset, although we don't how any details on how it will interface with the Vision Pro. The upgraded Telephoto would make the iPhone 17 Pro models the first iPhones to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.\n\nThe upgraded Telephoto lens on Apple's iPhone 17 Pro models will have up to 8\u00d7 optical zoom, compared to up to 5\u00d7 optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models, according to one rumor. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths. This could explain why the devices are expected to have significantly larger rear camera bumps compared to previous models \u2013 the parts that would allow the lens to move on the iPhone 17 Pro models could be housed inside the middle of the camera bump, in the area between the lenses and the LED flash, rear microphone, and LiDAR Scanner.\n\nApple reportedly tested 8K video recording on the iPhone 16 Pro models, but such functionality is still not available. With the iPhone 17 Pro models expected to have entirely 48-megapixel rear cameras, there is a good chance that 8K video recording will debut on those devices. Several rival smartphones currently offer 8K video recording capabilities, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro (via AI upscaling). Even though 8K video recording isn't widely used by content creators right now, there are still use cases for it. For example, shooting 8K would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution. Notably, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in February reported that Apple plans to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities when it unveils the device later this year, so it's quite possible that 8K video recording will be one of the capabilities that Apple will tout when the new lineup launches.\n\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and last year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.\n\nThe iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to one rumor, although the new iPhone 16 Pro models do have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a \"super-hard anti-reflective layer\" that is \"more scratch-resistant.\" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor. That said, one oft-reliable source who spoke to MacRumors has suggested Apple may have canceled its plans for the scratch-resistant coating.\n\nAt least one model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB. Jeff Pu of investment firm Haitong has claimed that the base iPhone 17 will come with 8GB of RAM, while both Pro models will come with the upped RAM, while Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature 12GB. In contrast, another reliable source has claimed that all iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have 6GB of RAM, and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while all iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.\n\nApple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller \"metalens\" for the Face ID system, claims Haitong's Jeff Pu and a Chinese leaker. While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens with microscopic patterns etched onto it that can focus light more precisely. Assuming this results in a narrowed Dynamic Island, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the feature since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.\n\nApple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year. While we are not expecting the iPhone 17 series to get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, Apple's A19 chip technology is likely to be built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip or even the A18 chip. TSMC is working on its N3P process, with mass production set to begin in late 2024, so that's the chip technology that we're expecting Apple will use for the iPhone 17 lineup. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.\n\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance, according to one report. Vapor chamber technology is already used in many high-end Android devices. Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices. The report claims that every model in the iPhone 17 series will adopt the improved thermal heat spreader.\n\nApple has reportedly tested a wireless reverse charging feature for its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models that would make the iPhone capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital. The Chinese leaker claims that Apple is testing a 7.5W wireless charging feature for iPhone 17 Pro models, and it could be used to charge other Apple accessories like AirPods, Apple Watch, or potentially an upcoming MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nApple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase \"surely means a larger battery,\" according to one leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly remains unchanged, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 17 series may be the first Apple devices to support the next-generation Qi2 25W wireless charging standard, based on regulatory filings. The filings reveal two new MagSafe charger models that support the standard. In contrast, the existing Qi 2 standard maxes out at 15W (although iPhone 16 models support upgraded MagSafe charging \u2013 with a 30W charger, the iPhones can charge at up to 25W). In addition to faster charging, Qi2 25W offers improved magnetic alignment and charging efficiency compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe base iPhone 17 model is rumored to be coming in six colors, comprised of the existing Black and White colors, and four new ones: Steel Gray, Green, Purple, and Light Blue. The all-new iPhone 17 Air is said to be coming in Black, White, Light Blue, and Light Gold. As for the iPhone 17 Pro models, Black, White (or Liquid Glass?), and Gray are said to be accompanied by new Dark Blue and Orange colors. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has since independently corroborated rumors of new orange and light blue colors for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Air, respectively.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro model will launch with a minimum 256GB of storage, doubling the base capacity of the current iPhone 16 Pro, according to a rumor out of China. Currently, the iPhone 16 Pro starts at 128GB for $999, while the 256GB version costs $1,099. By contrast, the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max already begins at 256GB for $1,199. A new 256GB base model could be priced at $1,049, replacing the 128GB model at $999. Rather than a straightforward $50 price hike, which has been rumored across the lineup, this move could be perceived by customers as better value, offering more storage for only a modest increase \u2013 and simplifying the lineup in the process.",

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17 Air\nContents\nWith the September 9 iPhone event, Apple will introduce an ultra thin \"iPhone 17 Air,\" marking the first notable redesign to the iPhone's form factor in several years. iPhone 17 Air is just a placeholder name, and we don't know what Apple will call the new device, but multiple rumors have confirmed Apple's work on a super thin iPhone.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be around 5.5mm thick, and at 5.5mm, it will be the thinnest iPhone released to date. That measurement doesn't include the area with the camera bump, which could be thicker to accommodate the single 48-megapixel rear camera rumored for the device.\nApple will sell the iPhone 17 Air alongside the standard iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max. We are not expecting an iPhone 17 Plus this year, with the iPhone 17 Air effectively replacing it in the lineup. Early rumors suggested the iPhone 17 Air could be as expensive or more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro, but more recent information suggests it will cost more than the iPhone 17 but won't be as expensive as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. That suggests we could see a price point around $899, similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus.\nIn terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which will put it in between the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max in size. As mentioned, it will have a single-lens rear camera, and Apple could be planning for a horizontal bar-like camera bump at the back, a design feature that's also rumored for the Pro iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 120Hz ProMotion display, and it will be equipped with Apple's C1 5G modem. Other features will include an A19 chip, Wi-Fi 7, and a more advanced display material that can better hold up to drops and scratches. There will be some small design changes to accommodate the device's thin chassis, such as a USB-C port that's not entirely centered, and fewer speaker holes.\nApple plans to market the iPhone 17 Air with a focus on design rather than internal specs. It won't have the top-of-the-line components or the fastest chip like the iPhone 17 Pro models, but the fresh design may be appealing to customers.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nWith the 2024 iPad Pro launch, Apple slimmed down the chassis, and the 12.9-inch model is just 5.1mm thick. It's Apple's thinnest device ever, and now Apple is aiming to follow it up with a super thin and light iPhone.\nWe've heard several rumors about the iPhone 17 Air, and thickness estimates have ranged from 5mm to a little over 6mm. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, for example, thinks that the iPhone 17 Air will be around two millimeters thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that's 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. 6.25mm would make the iPhone 17 Air the thinnest iPhone to date, but some rumors think it will be even thinner.\nThe Information believes the iPhone 17 Air will be around 6mm thick, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be 6mm thick. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker area for the rear camera bump. Dummy models that have surfaced are approximately 5.5mm thick.\nThe thinnest iPhone to date was the iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm. iPhones got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, because Apple changed device thickness to provide more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more. The iPhone 17 Air could be 9.5mm thick at the camera bump end, which means we can expect the camera bump to be notably thicker than the rest of the device.\nApple might use a titanium-aluminum frame for the iPhone 17 Air, with the device using more titanium than the current Pro iPhones. Rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. Titanium could help ensure that the iPhone frame resists bending while also keeping the device lightweight.\nConceptual renderings of the iPhone 17 Air provide insight into what the device is expected to look like. Mockups, renders, and dummy models feature a device with a slim, 5.5mm profile and a thicker rear camera bar with single-lens camera. Apple hasn't implemented a horizontal camera bar before, so this will be a significant design change. The iPhone 17 Pro models are also expected to have a camera bar.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6-inch display, which Apple chose because it was worried anything larger might be susceptible to bending. Apple initially planned on a 6.9-inch screen size for the device, but it was sized down to prevent any potential bending issues.\nRumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will feature a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The design can be seen in some renderings and iPhone 17 Air dummy models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button, based on dummy models of the device that have been circulating.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nA screen protector designed for the iPhone 17 Air based on leaked design dimensions suggests that the front camera of the device might be located on the left of the Dynamic Island, rather than on the right like the iPhone 16 models.\nColors\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be available in black, white, light gold, and light blue. The blue shade is rumored to be a very light blue similar to the blue that Apple used for the MacBook Air.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple has considered creating a bumper case designed for the iPhone 17 Air. The case would feature protection for the edges of the device, but would not cover the back. Apple last released a bumper case alongside the iPhone 4 in 2010. For the iPhone 17 Air, a bumper case would offer some protection without impacting the thin design of the device.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nThe iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a 6.6-inch display, which means it will be larger than the iPhone 17 but smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. There have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe entire iPhone 17 lineup is could get 120Hz ProMotion display technology, which means it will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro lineup. ProMotion displays will be enabled by the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels that Apple plans to use for all of the iPhone 17 models. LTPO allows for 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rates, and adds always-on display support.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThere were rumors that some iPhone 17 models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nHints of the iPhone 17 Air were found in the iOS 26 beta. There is a wallpaper for a display that has a 1260 x 2736 resolution, but that doesn't correspond to any existing iPhone models. It is, however, a resolution that would work for a 6.6-inch display.\nNaming\nWe don't know what Apple is going to call its ultra thin iPhone. Rumors have referred to it as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but neither name is official.\nGiven that Apple has an iPad Air and an iPad Pro and a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro, the iPhone \"Air\" naming might make the most sense to Apple customers.\nA-Series Chip\nApple is working on A19 and A19 Pro chips for the iPhone 17 lineup, and the iPhone 17 Air will get one of those two options. Some rumors suggest it will get the A19 alongside the iPhone 17, but it could also feature the A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used in the iPhone 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that all iPhone 17 models will have a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance. Vapor chambers work by spreading headtevenly across a larger area, reducing thermal throttling and ensuring consistent performance.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to have 12GB RAM, which would put it on par with the iPhone 17 Pro models. Current iPhone 16 models have 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence.\nCamera\nWith limited internal space due to the slimmed down design, the iPhone 17 Air will get just a single-lens rear camera. Rumors suggest it will use the same 48-megapixel Wide camera that's in the iPhone 16 models. If the iPhone 17 Air only has a single-lens rear camera, it will not be capable of capturing spatial video or spatial photos unless Apple has a new technique in mind for capturing this kind of content.\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nConnectivity\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones that will use an Apple-designed 5G modem chip. Apple's modem will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm modems in current iPhones. The chip also won't support the fastest mmWave 5G, and it will be limited to sub-6GHz speeds.\nFor other iPhone 17 models, Apple plans to continue to use Qualcomm chips. It's just the iPhone 17 Air that will get the Apple chip.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot in iPhones sold in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. U.S. iPhone models haven't included a SIM tray since the iPhone 14, but Apple has continued using it in other countries.\nThe iPhone 17 Air may be too thin to support a SIM tray.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery\nWith the iPhone Air featuring a chassis that's just 5.5mm thick, there will be less room for the battery. Apple is optimizing battery life with the more efficient C1 modem, processor improvements, and a higher-density battery that could use silicon-anode battery technology, but there could still be a hit to battery life.\nAccording to The Information, the iPhone 17 Air will have \"worse\" battery life compared to other iPhones. Apple's internal testing has apparently found that 60 to 70 percent of iPhone 17 Air users will be able to go a full day without charging, while that number is 80 to 90 percent for other iPhone models.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could have a 2,800mAh battery, which would be similar to the battery that Apple used in the iPhone 12. A second rumor says the battery will be under 3,000mAh, and a third suggests Apple will use a 2,900mAh battery.\nAlleged images of the iPhone 17 Air's battery suggest that it will be half as thin as the battery designed for the iPhone 17 Pro. It supposedly measures in at 2.49mm thick, which would take up just under half the thickness of the device if the iPhone 17 Air is 5.5mm thick as rumored.\nCharging\nApple is planning to release an iPhone battery case alongside the iPhone 17 Air that will add extra battery capacity, but it will mean that iPhone 17 Air users who need more battery will have to compromise on thickness.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support up to 35W wired charging speeds, which means there would be no change from the current charging maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 models could support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\niPhone 17 Air Launch Date\nApple's 2025 iPhone-centric event will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, September 9. Pre-orders may follow on September 12, with a launch to happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Air\nApple is already planning for the next few iPhone Air models, and the company plans to introduce an iPhone 19 Air with a larger display in the second half of 2027. The iPhone 18 Air coming in 2026 will be the same size as the iPhone 17 Air coming in September.\nA future version of the iPhone Air could use an upgraded LTPO3 OLED display that uses far less battery power. Apple could introduce this technology by 2027, resulting in iPhones that have longer battery life."

      "text": "A Chinese leaker with a mixed track record for accurate predictions has today disputed claims that the regular iPhone 17 and all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will feature ProMotion displays.\nProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.\nHowever, Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital's sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is \"just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate.\" If the claim is true, it would indicate that Apple is still using low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels for its lower-end iPhone models, albeit fixed at 120Hz, whereas the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are fitted with 60Hz LTPS panels.\nWithout ProMotion, a fixed 120Hz panel will still feel smooth, particularly during scrolling, animations, and UI transitions. However, it would likely drain more battery, since it's refreshing rapidly all the time, even when viewing static content. In contrast, ProMotion dynamically adjusts the refresh rate anywhere between 1Hz and 120Hz, depending on content and user interaction, which preserves battery life.\nA fixed 120Hz panel also means the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would lack Apple's always-on display capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked and idle.\nFortunately, the case for ProMotion coming to the non-Pro iPhone 17 remains strong. Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young last year indicated that Apple's suppliers are ramping up production of LTPO panels for the entire iPhone 17 lineup, further supporting the possibility of ProMotion displays across all models. LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption. Young's claim has since been corroborated by South Korea's ETNews and The Elec.\nFixed Focus Digital has shared accurate predictions in the past, including correctly naming the iPhone 16E before its official confirmation. The account also accurately claimed the iPhone 16 Pro models would be available in a new bronze finish, which ended up being Desert Titanium. On the other hand, the account was wrong about the number of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus color options that would be available. As for ProMotion, the weight of evidence is against them on this rumor, and we're personally hoping it's a bad call. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup around September."

      "text": "Next year's iPhone 17 series will feature processors made using TSMC's enhanced N3P 3-nanometer chip technology, but only iPhone 18 Pro models in 2026 are likely to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's next-generation 2nm processor technology because of cost concerns, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nThe terms \"3nm\" and \"2nm\" describe generations of chip manufacturing technology, each with its own set of design rules and architecture. As these numbers decrease, they generally indicate smaller transistor sizes. Smaller transistors allow more to be packed onto a single chip, typically resulting in increased processing speed and improved power efficiency.\nLast year, Apple adopted 3-nanometer chips for its iPhones and Macs. Both the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models and the M3 series chips in Macs are built on the 3-nanometer node, an upgrade over the prior 5nm node. This year's iPhone 16 series uses an A18 chip which is built using a second-generation 3-nanometer process, so it is more efficient and faster than the A16 Bionic chip used in the iPhone 15 models.\nTSMC plans to start manufacturing 2nm chips in late 2025, and Apple is expected to be the first company to receive chips built on the new process. TSMC is building two new facilities to accommodate 2nm chip production, and working on approval for a third. TSMC generally builds new fabs when it needs to increase production capacity to handle significant orders for chips, and TSMC is expanding in a major way for 2nm technology.\nTSMC is investing billions in this new chip technology, while Apple must adapt its chip designs accordingly. As TSMC's largest customer, Apple usually gets priority access to the latest chips. For instance, in 2023, Apple purchased all of TSMC's initial 3-nanometer chip production for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. This partnership often allows Apple to integrate cutting-edge semiconductor technology into its products before competitors.\nIn between the 3nm and 2nm nodes, TSMC will introduce several new 3nm improvements. TSMC has already come out with N3E and N3P chips that are enhanced 3nm processes, and there are other chips in the works such as N3X for high performance computing and N3AE for automotive applications."

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Models Again Rumored to Feature 48MP Telephoto Camera, 12GB of RAM, and More\nWhile the iPhone 17 Pro models are still nearly a year away from launching, analyst Jeff Pu has already outlined his expectations for the devices.\nIn a research note with investment bank Haitong International this week, Pu reiterated his previous claim that both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a 48-megapixel Telephoto rear camera and a 24-megapixel front camera. Both the Telephoto and front cameras shoot at 12 megapixels on iPhone 16 Pro models.\nHe also expects the iPhone 17 Pro models to be equipped with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB in iPhone 16 Pro models. This increase in memory would contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.\nThe analyst continues to believe that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a \"much narrowed Dynamic Island,\" as a result of the device adopting a smaller \"metalens\" for the Face ID system. This would be the first size reduction for the Dynamic Island since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in 2022.\nPu outlined a few less-surprising details that are apparently planned for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, including unchanged 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes for the devices, respectively.

      "text": "Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature 24MP Front-Facing Camera\nThe iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nThe information was shared in a new post on Medium. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements. The iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. With the iPhone 17, Apple will apparently bolster the hardware to a 24-megapixel camera with a six-element lens. Kuo says that the upgrade will significantly improve the image quality of the front-facing camera.\n- iPhone 6S: 5-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 4P lens\n- iPhone 7, iPhone X, and iPhone XS: 7-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 4P lens\n- iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 13: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/2.2 aperture and 5P lens\n- iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16: 12-megapixel front-facing camera with \u0192/1.9 aperture, autofocus, and 5P lens\n- iPhone 17: 24-megapixel front-facing camera with autofocus and 6P lens\nThe upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels is noteworthy because it would allow for greater detail and clarity in images. With a higher resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, providing more flexibility in post-processing. Additionally, the larger number of pixels can capture finer details, making the images sharper and more vibrant.\nThe upgrade to a six-element lens would also slightly enhance image quality. Each element can be designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos. The additional elements can also improve the efficiency of light transmission to the sensor, enhancing low-light performance.\nIt is worth noting that the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to be the first iPhone to feature under-panel Face ID technology, which could reduce the size of the Dynamic Island, but a circular cutout for the front-facing camera is expected to remain. The iPhone 17 Pro will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then expected adopt under-display cameras in 2027's \"Pro\" iPhone models for a true \"all-screen\" appearance.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

      "text": "Apple may have canceled the super scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating that it planned to use for the iPhone 17 Pro models, according to a source with reliable information that spoke to MacRumors.\nLast spring, Weibo leaker Instant Digital suggested Apple was working on a new anti-reflective display layer that was more scratch resistant than the Ceramic Shield. We haven't heard anything else about an upgraded display coating since then, and it's sounding like that's because it didn't work out.\nApple planned to use the anti-reflective coating for the higher-end iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max models, which would have made them the first iPhones with an anti-reflective display. Apple ran into problems scaling up the display coating process, and it is currently no longer a planned feature for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nThe process for adding the anti-reflective coating to the iPhone display was too slow when taking into account the millions of devices that Apple produces, so even though it was only planned for the Pro models, it still seems that it wasn't feasible this year.\nCurrent iPhone models have a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, but Apple hasn't focused heavily on anti-reflective technology. For the Mac and iPad Pro, Apple offers a nano-texture display that cuts down on glare, but that's not something that has been expanded to the iPhone. It's possible Apple pivoted to nano-texture or a simpler coating, but it's also possible it's just been scrapped entirely for now.\nWith the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung debuted a Gorilla Glass Armor display panel, which cuts down on reflections by up to 75 percent.

      "text": "Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to regulatory filings on Taiwan's NCC certification website. Qi2.2 is the forthcoming update to the Wireless Power Consortium's (WPC) Qi standard, building on improvements introduced with Qi 2.1.\nSpotted by 91mobiles.com, the filings reveal two new MagSafe charger models \u2013 A3503 and A3502 \u2013 that support the upgraded Qi 2.2 standard. The chargers feature the familiar white puck design with braided cables in 2-meter and 1-meter lengths, respectively.\nIt's a notable upgrade mainly because of the faster charging speed. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 25W charging output. In contrast, the Qi 2 standard maxes out at 15W (although iPhone 16 models support upgraded MagSafe charging \u2013 with a 30W Apple charger, the iPhones can charge at up to 25W). The WPC has since released the Qi 2.1 standard, but no Apple devices officially support it.\nTesting documents show the chargers work with devices ranging from the iPhone 16 back to the iPhone 11, indicating the Qi 2.2 pucks will have broad compatibility with existing devices, but charging speeds are going to be limited when using older models. Devices looking to take advantage of the faster charging speeds will need a corresponding advanced charging chip, similar to Samsung's Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC).\nIn addition to faster charging, Qi 2.2 offers improved magnetic alignment and charging efficiency compared to its predecessor. The standard also features backward compatibility with older Qi chargers.\nApple has not officially announced these new chargers, but their appearance in Taiwan's regulatory databases indicates we're likely to see a public release in the coming months. It also increases the likelihood that the upcoming iPhone 17 models will support the new charging standard \u2013 but that doesn't guarantee they will charge at the maximum 25W. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup around September, while the broader industry is expected to launch Qi 2.2-compatible phones, chargers, and accessories later this year.\nEditor's note: This article originally reported that Qi 2.2 offers a maximum charging output of 50W, which turned out to be based on false information. We apologize for the error."

      "text": "Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro will have a starting price that is $50 more than the iPhone 16 Pro but it will come with a minimum 256GB of storage, doubling the base capacity compared to last year's model. The information comes from Chinese leaker Instant Digital, posting on Weibo. The account, which has 1.5 million followers, has now made the claim three separate times in recent weeks.\nCurrently, the iPhone 16 Pro starts at 128GB storage for $999, while the 256GB version costs $1,099. By contrast, the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max already begins at 256GB for $1,199. Both Pro models offer up to 1TB of storage.\nBefore the launch of the iPhone 15 series in 2023, there were rumors that the iPhone 15 Pro Max would drop the 128GB tier and start at $1,199, up from $1,099 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The rumor proved accurate, but only because Apple eliminated the lower storage option, effectively raising the entry price.\nApple may be preparing a similar shift for the iPhone 17 Pro. A new 256GB base model could be priced at $1,049, replacing the 128GB model at $999. Rather than a straightforward $50 price hike, this move could be perceived by customers as better value, offering more storage for only a modest increase \u2013 and simplifying the lineup in the process.\nIn July, Jefferies reported that Apple plans to raise prices across the iPhone 17 lineup by $50, citing higher component costs and tariffs related to China. Instant Digital echoed this expectation in a previous post. The Wall Street Journal has also reported that Apple is considering raising prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 models.\nInstant Digital has shared accurate Apple information before, including the Yellow iPhone 14 launch, iPhone 15's frosted glass back, spatial video on iPhone 15 Pro, M4 iPad Pro's nano-texture display, and iPhone 16 Pro battery specs. Their claims are therefore worth taking seriously.\nWe'll know for sure soon enough. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup at its \"Awe dropping\" event on September 9, with a potential launch date of September 19."

      "text": "Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will have several new camera-related features, according to an anonymous tipster who contacted MacRumors today.\nThe tipster claimed to be familiar with an iPhone 17 Pro commercial that is allegedly being produced by a film company that has publicly listed Apple as one of its clients. MacRumors has not independently confirmed any of the information shared by the tipster, so skepticism is obviously warranted for now.\nThe tipster revealed three alleged iPhone 17 Pro features that have not been rumored previously:\n- An upgraded Telephoto lens with up to 8\u00d7 optical zoom, compared to up to 5\u00d7 optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths.\n- An all-new pro camera app from Apple for both photos and videos. This app would compete with the likes of Halide, Kino, and Filmic Pro. It is unclear if the app would be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro models.\n- An additional Camera Control button on the top edge of the devices, for quickly accessing the camera and related settings. This would complement the Camera Control button on the bottom-right edge of all iPhone 16 models.\nFor the pro camera app, the tipster warned there is a chance Apple is planning a major update to its existing Final Cut Camera app instead of an all-new app.\nThe tipster also said that rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro having a new copper-like color option and a centered Apple logo are apparently true.\niPhone 17 Pro models are widely expected to feature a redesigned rear camera system, so it would be a fitting year for Apple to have some big camera-related upgrades planned. The devices are expected to have three 48-megapixel rear cameras.\nIn February, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple was planning to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities.\nHere is what he said about that:\nIn past years, Apple has focused more heavily on the camera's photo-taking abilities. This year it will stress improvements to video recording. One of the goals for 2025's iPhone line is to get the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work. Look for Apple to more heavily than ever tout these video recording capabilities when the new iPhones debut in September.\nIn addition, Front Page Tech's Jon Prosser said the Camera app on the iPhone 17 Pro models will let users record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously.\nAs we mentioned above, these rumors should be treated with skepticism for now, since they were shared by an anonymous tipster with no proven track record. If other sources confirm or deny these rumors, we will be sure to update this article accordingly.\nUpdate \u2014 11:45 a.m. Pacific Time: MacRumors has voluntarily removed the name of the film company from this article, after receiving a follow-up request from the anonymous tipster. The tipster had not requested that the company's name remain confidential at the time the information was provided."

      "text": "Next year's iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly feature a major redesign, specifically centering around changes to the rear camera module, and now new supply chain information appears to confirm the striking change, according to a Chinese leaker.\nLate last month, The Information's Wayne Ma claimed that the rear of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging. The report also said the \"iPhone 17 Air\" currently has a \"large, centered camera bump on its back\" with a single camera.\nConcept renders like the one pictured above have been making the rounds ever since The Information report. However, this morning, Digital Chat Station, a Weibo user responsible for a range of details about the camera technology of upcoming iPhone models, claimed that supply chain materials they have seen appear to confirm the major camera module change.\n\"The details of the camera arrangement are unclear, but the module is of this elongated oval shape,\" said the leaker, commenting on the concept render image. \"Many new Android phones next year are also expected to adopt a similar design,\" the leaker added.\nIf accurate, the Google Pixel-style module redesign would be one of the most significant changes to Apple's signature square iPhone camera bump since September 2019 when the iPhone 11 debuted.\nThe iPhone 11's square camera module was a marked shift from previous models, which featured a more traditional vertical camera layout. Apple's decision to switch to a square design was mainly driven by the need to accommodate a third camera in the form of a new Ultra Wide lens, along with improved sensors and optics. The introduction of the square bump set a new aesthetic standard for subsequent models, influencing the design of later releases right up to today's iPhone 16.\nCommenting on the rumor, Ice Universe, another well-known Weibo-based leaker, noted that such an external change would require the internal structural design to undergo a \"major overhaul \u2014 much like redesigning the layout of an old house,\" that would require a significant amount of time for validation. \"Would Apple really take such an aggressive approach?\" they added.\nAs always, the look of the devices is based on scraps of information at this point, and Apple's plans could always change. Regardless, what do you think of the rumored new redesign for the iPhone 17 Pro models? Let us know in the comments."

Vapor chambers work by spreading heat evenly across a larger surface area, preventing thermal throttling and maintaining consistent performance, which is particularly beneficial in slim devices.\nWhile the notorious thermal issues of the iPhone 15 Pro were seemingly resolved thanks to the iPhone 16 Pro's new aluminum thermal substructure, graphene sheet, and back glass, the report claims that the device still struggles under intense thermal load. A vapor chamber heatsink would apparently resolve this and allow for better sustained performance.\nLast year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will also have an exclusive cooling system that combines vapor chamber technology with graphene sheets.

ProMotion was first introduced on the iPhone 13 Pro models in 2021 and remains exclusive to Pro models for now.\nIn a tweet today, Young provided a roadmap outlining various display-related technologies coming to future iPhones. Notably, the roadmap indicates that low-power LTPO display technology will be expanded to the standard iPhones in 2025, which Young said will enable ProMotion on these devices, allowing the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary.\nProMotion would also allow the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.\nAll in all, the roadmap suggests that the so-called \"iPhone 17\" and \"iPhone 17 Plus\" will feature ProMotion, and likely an always-on display too. Apple has routinely expanded Pro-only features to standard models over time, such as OLED technology, and the Dynamic Island is also expected to expand to all four iPhone 15 models later this year.\nYoung also outlined when Apple will adopt under-screen Face ID and cameras in future iPhones, which we discuss in more detail in a separate story.

This difference is said to be the reason why Apple Intelligence \u2013 Apple's AI suite of on-device features \u2013 is only currently supported by the iPhone 15 Pro models.\nSince it is a requirement for Apple Intelligence, all four of Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 models are expected to feature 8GB of RAM, as is the rumored iPhone SE 4, which is likely to launch in the spring. However, in a Weibo post on Wednesday, Chinese-language user \"Phone Chip Expert\" said next year's iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM for more advanced on-device AI applications.\n\"If you're planning to switch to an AI-powered iPhone, the iPhone 17 in 2025 might be a better choice,\" said the leaker. \"This year's iPhone 16 only has 8GB of RAM, with most of the AI processing done in the cloud. Next year's iPhone 17 will have 12GB of RAM and more edge AI applications. This is something to consider for those with a limited budget who want to upgrade their iPhone.\"\nEdge AI applications refer to AI processing that occurs directly on the local device, rather than relying on cloud servers. \"Edge\" refers to the edge of the network, meaning the data processing happens close to the data source (the device itself), rather than in a centralized location like a cloud data center.\nThis isn't the first time we have heard rumors of additional RAM coming to Apple's 2025 iPhones. In a May 2024 research note with investment firm Haitong, analyst Jeff Pu claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be equipped with 12GB of RAM, while the iPhone 17 and even the rumored iPhone 17 \"Slim\" or \"Air\" with an all-new design would stick with 8GB of RAM. However, today's leaker appears to be suggesting that all iPhone 17 models will be equipped with the additional RAM, bringing AI-capable continuity to the lineup.\nThe leaker \"Phone Chip Expert\" has a track record of accurate predictions. Phone Chip Expert was the first to reveal that the iPhone 7 would be water-resistant and that the standard iPhone 14 models would continue to use the A15 Bionic chip, while the more advanced A16 chip would be exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models. These forecasts were later confirmed by multiple credible sources and were proven correct when the products were released.\nMore recently, \"Phone Chip Expert\" was the first source of information about Apple developing its own AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025."

      "text": "First iPhone 17 Pro Design Leak Claims Surprising Return to Aluminum, Rectangular Camera Bump, and More\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will offer \"significant design changes,\" The Information's Wayne Ma reports.\nThe two flagship iPhone 17 models will be the first high-end iPhones to feature an aluminum frame since the delineation of the iPhone lineup into Pro and non-Pro models. In recent years, lower-end iPhone models such as the iPhone SE and iPhone 16 have featured aluminum frames. Until the release of the iPhone 15 Pro, high-end iPhone models featured stainless steel frames. Now, the high-end iPhones feature titanium chassis \u2013 a change that was touted as one of the key upgrades of the iPhone 15 Pro. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to bring the entire selection of devices back to aluminum.\nThe rear of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will also feature a new part-aluminum, part-glass design. The top half of the back will be made of aluminum and feature a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging. Apple introduced a glass back to the iPhone with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X in 2017, but prior to that, every iPhone except the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 5C had an aluminum rear. The new, aluminum camera bump of the iPhone 17 Pro will also apparently be larger than that of previous models.\nThe new design will constitute one of the most significant visual changes to the high-end iPhone models in recent years. The Information has an excellent track record for accurate Apple rumors, so the latest report is highly likely to pan out. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to launch in the fall of 2025 alongside the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

When attached to an iPhone that was charging via Lightning, the iPhone could deliver power to the MagSafe Battery Pack, which was the first instance of an iPhone being able to route power to an accessory device.\nApple discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack in September 2023 with the launch of the iPhone 15 lineup, which dropped the Lightning cable in favor of USB-C. iPhone 15 and later models can reverse charge Apple Watch, AirPods, and other smaller devices that support Power Delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the USB-C port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for Apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nIn 2022, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that a relaunched MagSafe Battery Pack would eventually transition to USB-C, but that has yet to happen. Likewise, In September 2023, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also said he expected USB-C versions of the MagSafe Battery Pack to return \"eventually.\" But he qualified that by saying \"Don't hold your breath.\"\nInstant Digital today admitted that while Apple is testing the reverse wireless charging feature for the iPhone 17 Pro models, the leaker does not know if the feature will actually be enabled on the devices when they officially launch.

He did not share any additional details about the chip.\nIn January, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple was developing its own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for use in devices starting in 2025. Later that month, however, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it was a Wi-Fi-only chip and said Apple had paused development \"for a while.\" It's unclear if development has resumed.\nLike its long-rumored 5G modem for iPhones, the Wi-Fi chip would allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers for components.\nWi-Fi 7 support would allow iPhone 17 Pro models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4\u00d7 increase over Wi-Fi 6E, according to Qualcomm.\nIn August, Pu said the iPhone 16 Pro models launching next year would also feature Wi-Fi 7 support, but not with an Apple-designed chip.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

The fourth-generation iPhone SE expected in early 2025 will reportedly also carry 8GB of RAM.\nThe amount of RAM in Apple's devices is currently of increased importance, as Apple has judged that 8GB is the minimum required for the Apple Intelligence features coming in iOS 18, which means only the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max of Apple's current phones will support them. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus carry only 6GB of RAM.\nWhile a move to 8GB across the board starting with next month's iPhone 16 lineup will enable all new iPhones to support Apple Intelligence going forward, a further bump to 12GB would likely allow for even more powerful AI capabilities, but it now appears that may be limited to Apple's highest-end model in 2025.\nAside from the increased 12GB of RAM, Kuo says the iPhone 17 Pro Max will also have an exclusive cooling system combining vapor chamber technology with graphite sheets.

Earlier this year, Apple extended its 5G modem supply agreement with Qualcomm for iPhone launches through 2026, so Apple's transition to its own in-house 5G chips will likely be gradual over multiple years.\nApple acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019, as part of its efforts to design its own 5G chip. It is unclear if Apple's chip would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm's modems, but it would reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm.

It might just be time to get used to this new look.\n\"The CAD renders are quite accurate,\" said Fixed Focus Digital. \"Let me add a bit more detail: The iPhone 17 Pro models will most likely use a combination of materials \u2014 specifically, a glass section for the logo area integrated into an overall metal chassis.\" This appears to explain the red areas on the iPhone 17 Pro models in the image. Indeed, rumors do suggest Apple plans to go with a half glass, half aluminum build, which would increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage.\nApple has also reportedly tested a wireless reverse charging feature for the iPhone 17 Pro models that would make the iPhone capable of delivering power to other Apple devices.\nApple plans to significantly revamp the camera design on its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models, moving away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width, according to recent reports.\nThe redesign extends to the new iPhone 17 Air model, which is set to replace the Plus variant in Apple's lineup. This thinner device will allegedly feature a similar horizontal camera bar design, though it will accommodate just a single camera lens.\nIn contrast, the base iPhone 17 is expected to maintain the current camera design language seen in the iPhone 16 series, helping to further differentiate Apple's premium and standard offerings.\nApple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu earlier this month said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. However, Pu expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame. Apple introduced titanium as a feature for its Pro models in 2023, but Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations.\nWhat do you think of the alleged changes in this year's iPhone 17 series? Let us know in the comments. Apple is anticipated to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup during its traditional September launch window."

Apple says the Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 15 is \"tougher than any smartphone glass.\" Introduced on iPhone 12 models in 2020, Apple advertised the ceramic-infused glass as increasing drop performance by 4x compared to the iPhone 11.\nMore recently, Samsung debuted its newest Galaxy S24 Ultra, which features a Gorilla Glass Armor display panel, also developed by Corning. According to Corning, the Armor panel cuts reflections by 75 percent compared to a typical glass surface, and is resistant to micro scratches that build up over time on competing glass panels. Corning also claims the panels offer over 4x more scratch resistance than competitive aluminosilicate cover glasses.\nIt's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt Gorilla Glass Armor for the iPhone 17, but the description matches the Chinese leaker's claims. Corning could also be supplying Apple with an equivalent technology that will be branded under another name.\nCorning has been a longtime Apple supplier, with Gorilla Glass used in devices across Apple's product lineup.

While the report does not mention this, the use of LTPO technology suggests that the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.\nProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, so the feature's expansion to the iPhone 17 and the rumored, tentatively-named \"iPhone 17 Air\" would be notable. Samsung and LG will supply the LTPO displays for all iPhone 17 models, according to the report.\nLTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption, ensuring that ProMotion does not significantly impact battery life.\niPhone displays with ProMotion have smoother-looking scrolling and video content. ProMotion would also allow the iPhone 17 and \"iPhone 17 Air\" displays to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that shows various Lock Screen elements even when the device is locked. It is unclear if the iPhone 17 and the \"iPhone 17 Air\" would ramp down to 10Hz or 1Hz.\nDisplay Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young previously informed MacRumors that the iPhone 17 and \"iPhone 17 Air\" will likely support ProMotion, and the feature's expansion to the entire iPhone 17 lineup has been rumored multiple times.\nThe standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus still have 60Hz displays.\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September 2025.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

      "text": "Reports that next year's iPhone 17 will adopt TSMC's next-generation 2nm process are \"fake news,\" a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans claimed on Monday.\nAccording to a post by Weibo user \"Phone Chip Expert,\" the 2nm process won't go into mass production until the end of 2025. The account holder, who claims to have 25 years of experience in the integrated circuit industry, including work on Intel's Pentium processors, suggests the iPhone 17 will therefore still use TSMC's 3nm process.\n\"The 2nm process won't be mass-produced until the end of 2025, so the iPhone 17 definitely can't catch up,\" read a machine translation of Phone Chip Expert's post. \"It won't be until the iPhone 18 that a 2nm processor will be used.\"\n\"Anyone who has seen the capacity planning chart will know that this is yet another report from an unscrupulous media outlet,\" added the user, commenting on an article by Zhitong Finance that repeated claims recently made by Taiwanese newspapers based on \"industry sources.\"\nTSMC plans to begin volume production of 2nm chips next year, but multiple reports out of Taiwan suggested that the company had been accelerating the process ahead of schedule to secure a stable yield for mass production. Apple is TSMC's main client, and it is typically the first to get TSMC's new chips. Apple acquired all of TSMC's 3nm chips in 2023 for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, for example.\nThe 2nm fabrication process, also known simply as \"N2,\" is expected to offer a 10 to 15 percent speed improvement at the same power or a 25 to 30 percent power reduction at the same speed compared to chips made with the supplier's 3nm technology. The A17 Pro chip in Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models is manufactured with TSMC's first-generation 3nm process, known as N3B. Apple's M4 chip, which recently debuted in the new iPad Pro, uses an enhanced version of this 3nm technology.\nCode in iOS 18 has confirmed that all four iPhone 16 models are set to use Apple's next-generation A18 chip, based on TSMC's N3E process. N3E is TSMC's second-generation 3nm chip fabrication process, which is less expensive and has improved yield compared to TSMC's first-generation 3nm process.\nThe Weibo user contesting claims that 2nm will be ready for the iPhone 17 has a track record of accurate predictions. Phone Chip Expert was the first to reveal that the iPhone 7 would be water-resistant and that the standard iPhone 14 models would continue to use the A15 Bionic chip, while the more advanced A16 chip would be exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro models. These forecasts were later confirmed by multiple credible sources and were proven correct when the products were released.\nMore recently, Phone Chip Expert was the first source of information about Apple developing its own AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025."

      "text": "A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.\nWeibo-based leaker Instant Digital on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a \"special\" color variant that is said to be \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\"\nThe leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, \"but it appears differently depending on the lighting.\"\nWhile speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI aesthetic of iOS 26, a shimmering surface could potentially create a sense of motion or unity with the glassy elements of the software interface.\nThe account Instant Digital has accurately leaked Apple information before, such as the Yellow finish for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2's Titanium Milanese Loop. But its track record isn't perfect.\nOn Wednesday, a Macworld report claimed to reveal all of the colors that each iPhone 17 model will come in. Allegedly based on an \"internal document,\" the report listed white as a color option for all models, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nOther colors that have now been rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models by multiple sources include a new copper-like orange, black, gray, and dark blue. Whether Apple chooses different names for the colors it ultimately goes with remains to be seen.\nCuriously, the leaker Majin Bu recently shared images of third-party lens covers purportedly reflecting Apple's iPhone 17 colors. A white color was not shown, but another, identified as \"Transparent,\" appeared in its place. When asked why the transparent accessory is included in the images, Bu has equivocated, but the leaker has since alluded to another \"surprise\" color that Apple is currently still testing, without giving anything else away.\nIn a change to last year's all-titanium iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple is believed to be using a part-glass, part-aluminum design for the iPhone 17 Pro chassis. This could potentially usher in all-new color choices for Apple's high-end iPhone 17 models. What they look like in reality is something we'll learn in just a couple of months. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 series in September."

When held in landscape orientation, the main and ultra wide lenses combine to record spatial video with added depth.\nEarlier this year, Pu said iPhone 16 Pro models would feature a 48-megapixel ultra wide lens, so the iPhone 17 Pro Max might be the first iPhone model to have a rear camera system entirely with 48-megapixel lenses.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro Max Will Feature Smaller Dynamic Island, Claims Leaker\nApple's largest high-end model in the upcoming iPhone 17 series this year will feature a smaller Dynamic Island, according to Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station.\nThe leaker claims that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a \"metalens\" for Face ID that integrates the transmitter and receiver components, which will reduce the size and thickness of structural elements, resulting in a smaller Dynamic Island on the device. The technology will also be applied to the next iPad Pro and a rumored foldable iPad, reckons the leaker.\nUnlike traditional iPhone cameras, which use curved lenses to bend light toward the image sensor, a metalens is an ultra-thin, flat lens with microscopic nano-structures that precisely control and focus light.\nConflicting Reports\nToday's rumor goes against a January report by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that claimed the upcoming iPhone 17 models will not feature a smaller Dynamic Island. However, Kuo's report contradicts analyst Jeff Pu's prediction last year that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a metalens for Face ID that results in a \"much narrowed\" Dynamic Island on the device. Pu in 2024 reiterated the claim several times, and he has a fairly good track record with Apple rumors.\nAs for Digital Chat Station, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus would feature a slightly smaller 48-megapixel sensor than the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, as well as the display panel design of the iPhone 12 back in 2020.\nApple introduced the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, and it is also available on all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, but the size has not changed in successive models. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series next September.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

      "text": "Next Year's Slim iPhone 17 Could Be an 'iPhone Air'\nApple's rumored iPhone 17 \"Slim\" could be positioned as an iPhone \"Air\" to boost sales, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\nIn the latest edition of his \"Power On\" newsletter, Gurman explained how the \"fourth\" model in the iPhone lineup since 2020 (the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone 15 Plus) has largely been a commercial failure. In the case of the Plus model, this is likely because it is just $100 less than the Pro, so most customers simply opt for the higher-end model.\nThere has been uncertainty in recent months about the intention of the so-called iPhone 17 \"Slim\" and its rumored position in the lineup. Last week, YouTuber Jon Prosser was first to suggest that the device could be positioned as an \"iPhone Air.\" Now, Gurman seems to have supported this idea.\nThe iPhone 17 \"Air\" will represent a new approach to this fourth model in the lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. Gurman compared the device to the original MacBook Air from 2008, which sat between the regular MacBook and MacBook Pro in the lineup.\nThe sales pitch will probably go like this: If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone \u2014 but don't really need the performance, screen size or cameras of a Pro model \u2014 you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.\nAt minimum, Gurman expects the iPhone \"Air\" to be more popular than the iPhone mini and Plus devices from recent years.\nGurman added that the thinner design of the iPhone 17 \"Air\" will \"just be a step toward something better\" since Apple will eventually want to \"squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design.\" However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.\nPopular Stories\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 series on Tuesday, September 9, and last-minute rumors about the devices continue to surface.\nThe latest info comes from a leaker known as Majin Bu, who has shared alleged images of Apple's Clear Case for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, or at least replicas.\nImage Credit: @MajinBuOfficial\nThe images show three alleged changes compared to Apple's iP...\nAn iPhone 17 announcement is a dead cert for September 2025 \u2013 Apple has already sent out invites for an \"Awe dropping\" event on Tuesday, September 9 at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California.

      "text": "TSMC's 3nm node will reportedly account for over 20% of its revenue in 2024, as Apple, AMD, and Intel adopt the technology\nTSMC's leading-edge 3nm process technology is popular.\nTSMC's 3nm fabrication process accounted for 15% of the company's revenue in Q4'23. Only one of TSMC's customers used it at the time: Apple. But as more customers adopt the manufacturing process, 3nm process nodes will account for a considerably larger share of TSMC's revenue, reports ICSmart.cn.\nThis year TSMC's N3-series nodes \u2014 including N3B and N3E \u2014 will account for over 20% of the foundry's revenue in 2024, the report claims. Apple currently exclusively uses TSMC's N3B to make its A17 Pro system-on-chip (SoC) for smartphones, as well as the M3-series processors for iMac desktops and MacBook laptops. Later this year, AMD and Intel are expected to adopt TSMC's N3E and, possibly, N3B for their upcoming processors, and 3nm will thus understandably account for a higher portion of TSMC's revenue.\nAMD is preparing to launch its new Zen 5-based processors made on 3nm- and 4nm-class process technologies later this year. Apparently, the platform codenamed Nirvana will also use TSMC's 3nm technology and is anticipated to be released in the second half of the year.\nApple's new iPhone 16 series will be equipped with the A18-series processor, and the upcoming M4-series processors for Mac PCs will also be produced using TSMC's 3nm technology, the report says. Production for both major chips is set to commence in the second quarter of this year, according to ICSmart.cn, which shows Apple's continued reliance on TSMC's N3-series node.\nIntel is also expected to leverage TSMC's 3nm technology for its Lunar Lake MX SoCs, with mass production scheduled for the second quarter. This marks the first time Intel has entrusted TSMC with the full range of chips for its mainstream consumer platform, the report notes. This collaboration highlights TSMC's expanding role in serving Intel, which also happens to be the company's rival on the foundry market.\nWith three major customers using TSMC's 3nm family of process technologies, the node will account for even larger portion of TSMC's revenue this year. More companies are expected to adopt TSMC's N3 nodes in 2025, including performance-enhanced N3P, and the report suggests 3nm will account for over 30% of TSMC earnings in 2025.\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Currently it is the second-best performing, after DAX, with +4,55%, more than double of what e.g. S&P 500 ETF performed since then.Reply\nObviously, previous performance is no indication of future performance, and all that. But some plus sure helps with paying for some hardware later on. :) -\nthisisaname I do wonder what makes up the biggest part of their revenue in 2024 considering 3nm is only 20%.Reply"
