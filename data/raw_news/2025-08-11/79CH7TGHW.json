  "title": "AOL will finally end 1991 dial-up Internet service that\u2019s older than smartphones",
  "description": "Around 175,000 households still use dial-up Internet in the US.",
  "content": "After 34 years of connecting Americans to the Internet through phone lines, AOL recently announced it is shutting down its dial-up modem service on September 30, 2025. The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the World Wide Web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: \"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.\"\n\nAOL's dial-up service launched as \"America Online\" in 1991, when the Internet consisted primarily of text-based content, although its dial-up roots extend back to a service launched in 1985 called Quantum Link for Commodore computers. For the next few years as the World Wide Web emerged, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 20 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.\n\nAlong with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.\n\nAccording to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the Internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.\n\nFor these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite Internet now serves about 2\u20133 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serve the vast majority of US Internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the Internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage\u2014designed with the assumption of broadband speeds\u2014can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't even work at all.",

      "text": "Quantum Link\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (July 2022) |\nQuantum Link (or Q-Link) was an American and Canadian online service for the Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated starting November 5, 1985. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which later became America Online.\nIn October 1989 the service was renamed America Online, and made available to users of PC systems as well. The original Q-link service was terminated on November 1, 1995, in favor of the America Online brand.\nThe original Q-Link was a modified version of the PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation licensed. Q-Link featured electronic mail, online chat (in its People Connection department), public domain file sharing libraries, online news, and instant messaging using On Line Messages (OLMs). Other noteworthy features included multiplayer games like checkers, chess, backgammon, hangman, and a clone of the television game show Wheel Of Fortune called Puzzler; and an interactive graphic resort island, called Habitat during beta-testing, then renamed Club Caribe.\nIn October 1986, QuantumLink expanded their services to include casino games such as bingo, slot machines, blackjack and poker in RabbitJack's Casino; and RockLink, a section about rock music. The software archives were also organized into hierarchical folders and expanded.\nIn November 1986, the service began offering to digitize users' photos to be included in their profiles, and started an online auction service.[1]\nConnections to Q-Link were typically made by dial-up modems with speeds from 300 to 2400 baud, with 1200 being the most common. The service was normally open weekday evenings and all day on weekends. Pricing was $9.95 per month, with additional fees of six cents per minute (later raised to eight) for so-called \"plus\" areas, including most of the aforementioned services. Users were given one free hour of \"plus\" usage per month. Hosts of forums and trivia games could also earn additional free \"plus\" time.\nQ-Link competed with online services like CompuServe and The Source, and with bulletin board systems (single- and multiuser), including gaming systems such as Scepter of Goth and Swords of Chaos. Quantum Link's graphic display was better than many competing systems because they used specialized client software with a nonstandard protocol. However, this limited their market, because only the Commodore 64 and 128 could run the software necessary to access it.\nClub Caribe / Habitat\n[edit]One of the most influential Quantum Link games was Club Caribe, a predecessor to today's MMOGs.\nClub Caribe was developed with Lucasfilm Games using software that later formed the basis of Lucasfilm's Maniac Mansion story system (SCUMM). Users controlled on-screen avatars that could chat with other users, carry and use objects and money (called tokens), and travel around the island one screen at a time. Club Caribe allowed users to take the heads off their characters, carry them around, and even set it down. However, other users could pick up heads that were placed on the ground, resulting in headless players exploring the game world.\nQuantum Link Reloaded\n[edit]In 2005, the proprietary server software was analyzed, and a version written in java and reachable via TCP/IP was released at SWRAP 2005.[2] The software evolved in two fork hosted on GitHub [3]\nPopular culture\n[edit]Much of the second and third seasons of the American TV series Halt and Catch Fire is centered around the development and troubles of the fictional tech startup Mutiny, heavily inspired by the story of PlayNET and Quantum Link in the 1980s.[4] In the show, Mutiny transitions from an online games company to eventually delivering an online subscriber-based graphical chat community for Commodore 64 users, mirroring Habitat.[5]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"RUN Magazine Issue 35\".

      "text": "Reading Time: 5 min\nThe Challenges of Geostationary Satellite Internet\nSatellite internet has become a vital option for people in rural and remote areas where traditional broadband is unavailable. Two major providers, HughesNet and Viasat, have long served these regions using geostationary (GEO) satellites. These satellites orbit about 22,000 miles above Earth, offering wide coverage but facing significant performance hurdles. In contrast, Starlink, a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite provider operated by SpaceX, has disrupted the market with faster speeds and lower latency, putting pressure on GEO providers. This article explores the performance gaps between HughesNet, Viasat, and Starlink as of early 2025, based on recent data published by OOKLA.\nLatency: A Persistent Weakness for GEO Satellites\nLatency, the time it takes for data to travel from a user to a server and back, is a key factor in internet performance. High latency can make activities like video calls, gaming, or even web browsing feel sluggish. For GEO satellite providers, latency is a major challenge due to the long distance signals must travel.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, HughesNet\u2019s median latency improved to 683 milliseconds (ms), down from 1019 ms in early 2022. This progress came after the launch of Jupiter 3, a high-capacity satellite introduced in July 2023, which boosted the company\u2019s network. Viasat\u2019s median latency, however, remained nearly unchanged, moving from 676 ms in 2022 to 684 ms in 2025. Meanwhile, Starlink\u2019s LEO satellites, orbiting just 340 miles above Earth, delivered a median latency of 45 ms in 2025\u2014a fraction of its competitors\u2019 figures. This stark difference makes Starlink far more responsive for real-time applications.\nDownload Speeds: Progress, but Not Enough\nDownload speed determines how quickly users can stream videos, download files, or load websites. Both HughesNet and Viasat have made strides in this area, but they still lag behind Starlink.\nHughesNet more than doubled its median download speed from 20.87 Mbps in early 2022 to 47.79 Mbps in early 2025. Viasat also improved, increasing from 25.18 Mbps to 49.12 Mbps over the same period. These gains reflect efforts to upgrade their networks. For instance, HughesNet uses a dedicated fiber backbone and artificial intelligence to manage network traffic, while Viasat employs spot beam technology to optimize bandwidth in specific areas.\nHowever, Starlink\u2019s median download speed reached 104.71 Mbps in 2025, nearly double that of its GEO competitors. For top-performing users (the 75th percentile), the gap is even wider. HughesNet\u2019s top users saw speeds of 95.97 Mbps, and Viasat\u2019s reached 78.55 Mbps, but Starlink\u2019s top users enjoyed 161.42 Mbps. These differences highlight Starlink\u2019s ability to handle growing demand as it expands its satellite constellation.\nThe following table summarizes median download speeds for the three providers:\n| Provider | Q1 2022 (Mbps) | Q1 2025 (Mbps) |\n|---|---|---|\n| HughesNet | 20.87 | 47.79 |\n| Viasat | 25.18 | 49.12 |\n| Starlink | 53.95 (Q3 2022) | 104.71 |\nUpload Speeds: A Mixed Picture\nUpload speeds, which affect tasks like sending emails or uploading videos, are another area where GEO providers struggle. HughesNet improved its median upload speed from 2.87 Mbps in 2022 to 4.44 Mbps in 2025. Viasat, however, saw a decline, dropping from 3.06 Mbps to 1.08 Mbps over the same period. This decrease may stem from an issue with Viasat-3, launched in May 2023, which suffered an antenna deployment problem that reduced its capacity. As a result, Viasat relied on older satellites, impacting performance.\nStarlink, by contrast, increased its median upload speed from 9.81 Mbps in 2022 to 14.84 Mbps in 2025. Even at the 75th percentile, Starlink\u2019s upload speeds far outpaced its competitors, reaching 20.08 Mbps compared to HughesNet\u2019s 7.23 Mbps and Viasat\u2019s 4.46 Mbps.\nThe following table compares median upload speeds:\n| Provider | Q1 2022 (Mbps) | Q1 2025 (Mbps) |\n|---|---|---|\n| HughesNet | 2.87 | 4.44 |\n| Viasat | 3.06 | 1.08 |\n| Starlink | 9.81 | 14.84 |\nSubscriber Losses: A Growing Concern\nThe performance gaps have taken a toll on HughesNet and Viasat\u2019s subscriber numbers. HughesNet\u2019s customer base fell from 1.22 million in 2022 to 853,000 in early 2025. Viasat\u2019s decline was even steeper, dropping from 590,000 in early 2021 to 189,000 in 2025. Starlink\u2019s aggressive pricing, including free equipment offers in some states, has drawn customers away from GEO providers. Despite efforts to lower prices and highlight customer service, HughesNet and Viasat are losing ground.\nThe following table shows subscriber changes:\n| Provider | 2022/2021 | Q1 2025 |\n|---|---|---|\n| HughesNet | 1,220,000 | 853,000 |\n| Viasat | 590,000 | 189,000 |\nRegional Performance: Bright Spots and Weak Points\nPerformance varies across states. HughesNet users in Maryland enjoyed median download speeds of 98.03 Mbps and upload speeds of 8.73 Mbps in 2025, likely due to the company\u2019s headquarters in Bethesda and contracts with federal agencies. Nebraska users also saw strong results, with download speeds of 77.11 Mbps, possibly boosted by HughesNet Fusion, a hybrid service combining satellite and fixed wireless. Viasat users in Hawaii achieved download speeds of 77.24 Mbps, a significant jump from 18.03 Mbps in 2022.\nOn the other hand, Viasat users in Mississippi faced the slowest speeds at 27.85 Mbps, and HughesNet users in New Jersey averaged just 35.56 Mbps, the lowest for HughesNet nationwide.\nInnovations and Future Plans\nHughesNet and Viasat are working to close the gap. HughesNet\u2019s Jupiter 3 satellite has already improved speeds and capacity, and its Fusion service shows promise in select areas. Viasat, despite setbacks with Viasat-3, plans to launch additional satellites in 2025 and 2026 to expand coverage. Its acquisition of Inmarsat in 2023 added satellites for maritime and mission-critical uses, though these haven\u2019t yet impacted consumer broadband performance.\nSummary\nHughesNet and Viasat have made progress in download and upload speeds, with HughesNet benefiting from its Jupiter 3 satellite and Viasat upgrading its network. However, their high latency and slower speeds compared to Starlink make it hard to compete, especially as Starlink continues to grow its LEO constellation. Subscriber losses reflect these challenges, though both companies remain vital for areas with limited connectivity options. As they roll out new satellites and technologies, HughesNet and Viasat will need to innovate further to stay competitive in the evolving satellite internet market."
