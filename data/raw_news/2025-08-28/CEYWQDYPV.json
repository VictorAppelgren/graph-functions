  "title": "The 5 Healthiest Air Fryer Foods, Hand-Picked by Registered Dietitians",
  "description": "We spoke with experts to determine the best healthy foods for cooking in your air fryer. They're also quick and easy to prep.",
  "content": "Like refrigerators, ovens or microwaves, air fryers have become a staple in our kitchens. In the form of compact, space-saving devices, these fryers are known for crisping food with less oil, making them a healthier alternative to other cooking methods. \"Air fryer cooking delivers the crispy texture we know and love from fried foods, but with far less oil and fat than traditional deep frying,\" explains Melissa Jaeger, head of nutrition at nutrition tracking app MyFitnessPal.\n\nHowever, despite their ease of use, it's easy to make mistakes with an air fryer or air fry the wrong foods. To save you a headache and help you meal plan, we consulted registered dietitians to find the best healthy air fryer foods. With their advice, you can cook a healthy meal while avoiding a mess in your air fryer.\n\n\"In my opinion, salmon is hands-down the best healthy air fryer food,\" says Jessica McAllister, a military and tactical performance registered dietitian. \"It's packed with high-quality protein, heart-healthy omega-3 fats and valuable micronutrients like vitamin D, B12 and selenium.\" Since it's a lean protein, salmon can promote muscle repair and energy, while its omega-3s reduce inflammation and support brain and heart health.\n\nMcAllister also likes salmon for meal-prepping lunches and dinners because it reheats well. To change things up, you can pair the protein with different spices or sauces for each meal. Yvette Hill, lifestyle medicine dietitian-nutritionist, endorses garlic powder, thyme, pepper and a squeeze of lemon.\n\nHowever, McAllister warns that you should monitor the cook time of your salmon when it's in the air fryer. Her recipe of choice:\n\u2022 Brush salmon fillets lightly with olive oil or add a simple spice blend for flavor.\n\u2022 Cook at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 7 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness. Don't overcrowd the basket so the air can circulate.\n\n\"Keeping the skin on the salmon can be another way to consume more healthy fat,\" Hill adds. \"The skin of the salmon contains a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids.\" It will also make the salmon extra crispy.\n\nTo reheat your salmon, set the air fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.\n\nRegistered dietitian Amy Chow of BC Dietitians recommends making veggie chips in the air fryer because they're easy and quick to make, can be added to a meal or eaten as a snack and are crispy and flavorful enough for both adults and kids to enjoy. She suggests sliced sweet potatoes, carrots, zucchini or kale as chips, or cauliflower or broccoli florets.\n\nPro tip: Make sure to cover broccoli with foil as it can burn easily in the air fryer.\n\n\"You get all the fiber, vitamins and antioxidants from the vegetables without the extra calories or saturated fat from deep-frying,\" Chow says. \"For kids especially, it's a way to make vegetables fun and familiar, like chips or fries, but with more nutrition.\"\n\nFor sweet potato chips, Chow provides these instructions:\n\u2022 With the skin on, thinly and evenly slice the potatoes into 1/16-inch thick pieces.\n\u2022 Toss the slices with a teaspoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt. You can also add spices such as chili powder or cumin.\n\u2022 Arrange the slices in a single layer with no overlap in your air fryer. Cook at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 8 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.\n\u2022 Let them cool to crisp up before eating.\n\n\"A light coating of olive oil or avocado oil can help with browning, flavor and texture, whereas too much can make the food soggy and greasy,\" Chow adds. \"Using parchment paper or a liner can help absorb some of the excess oil, prevent sticking and maintain the integrity of the air fryer.\"\n\nFor a healthier, quicker alternative to traditional fried chicken, Hill advocates for air frying your chicken. \"This alternative is healthier because you don't have to coat or bread the chicken, and you don't have to deep-fry it in oil,\" she says. \"The air fryer will also reduce fat in the chicken, allowing the excess to drip into the collecting tray beneath.\"\n\u2022 Dry-rub chicken wings with your spice blend of choice and add a small amount of olive oil.\n\u2022 Without overcrowding the basket, air fry the wings for 16 to 22 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, flipping them halfway through cooking for extra crispiness.\n\n3. Whole veggies you'd normally roast or steam\n\nIf slicing veggies for chips is too much after a long day, Jaeger proposes simplifying things even more by using the air fryer to cook whole vegetables you'd normally roast or steam in the oven or on the stovetop. Think Brussels sprouts, cauliflower or broccoli. Lightly toss them in oil and your favorite seasoning blend, and then pop them in the air fryer.\n\n\"Since many people fall short of daily fiber needs and don't eat enough vegetables, air frying can be a simple way to make veggies more enjoyable,\" Jaeger explains.\n\nGabriella Nowicki, a registered dietitian-nutritionist at Rebecca Bitzer and Associates, adds that vegetables that contain a moderate amount of starch typically roast well in an air fryer. This includes potatoes, carrots, squash, plantains and beets. \"A small amount of oil combined with a light dusting of cornstarch is often sufficient to achieve that crispy exterior,\" Nowicki says.\n\nWhen it comes to cooking time, Nowicki warns that dense starchy vegetables like potatoes or squash may require more time in the air fryer than lighter veggies like broccoli or green beans. \"Play around with temperature and time to find the perfect crispiness for you,\" she advises.\n\n\"Air frying can help retain more nutrients in sweet potatoes versus other methods of cooking them, such as boiling,\" says Hill. \"Boiling can cause loss of water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin C.\"\n\nTo make your sweet potato fries, according to Hill:\n\u2022 Wash and dry the potatoes before cutting them into 1/4-inch think pieces, lengthwise. You can keep the skin on to make them crispier.\n\u2022 Arrange them in a single layer in your basket. Air fry at 390 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes.\n\nWhy is air frying considered healthier than frying?\n\n\"The primary concern with traditional frying lies in the cooking method itself,\" Nowicki says. \"Most fried foods are first coated in batter or breading, which increases the carbohydrate and calorie content before the food even touches the oil. Once submerged in hot oil, the breading absorbs significant amounts of fat, further raising the overall calorie density of the dish.\"\n\nThe type of oil you're using and the high temperature are also factors to consider. Nowicki states that many commercial frying oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can promote inflammation when consumed in excess. Heating that oil over and over again also generates potentially toxic oxidation byproducts and, in some cases, trans fats, which are linked to increased cardiovascular health risks.\n\n\"Air frying takes the excess breading and oil out of the equation and therefore, is healthier,\" Nowicki says.\n\nDon't overcrowd your basket: \"Air fryers are designed for the best cooking results when the basket isn't overcrowded or foods are cooked in a single layer,\" Jaeger explains. \"Consider batch cooking to keep meal items in a single layer or shaking the basket at various times while cooking to ensure foods stuck in the middle layer don't result in a soggy mess.\"\n\nUse only a light coating of oil: To prevent sticking and achieve a crispy exterior, Nowicki suggests using a light coating of oil like avocado oil or canola oil for temperatures over 425 degrees Fahrenheit. \"This will reduce oxidation,\" she says.\n\nShake the basket: Both Jaeger and Nowicki recommend shaking your air fryer's basket halfway through the cooking process to ensure that everything cooks and crisps evenly.",

      "text": "It can be incredibly tough to balance your meals sometimes, especially when you consider that diet is actually much more complex than the old food pyramid. For one thing, you need to balance nutrient-rich foods with calorie-dense options and consider carbs and fats, while also ensuring you keep an eye on your intake of sodium and sugar. But how does protein factor in? Curious about protein? The USDA's Dietary Guidelines now suggest that the daily protein intake isn't a fixed amount but rather a ratio tailored to individual needs.\nProtein is a necessary component of your diet to help keep your muscles in good shape and regulate weight, energy levels, hormones and more. That being said, too much of anything, even protein, can be bad for your health.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\nProtein is a vital part of your diet for maintaining muscle health and regulating weight, energy, hormones and more. But you should know that if you consume too much protein, then, like any other nutrient, it can be harmful to your health.\nThere are numerous Reddit threads filled with discussions about how much protein people need. Everyone has their own opinion on the right amount, but the truth is that it largely depends on your own body and health. The current guidelines recommend that adults aim for 0.36 grams of protein per pound \u2014 or 0.8 grams per kilogram \u2014 of body weight. To put that into perspective, according to the USDA's dietary intake calculator, a person weighing 200 pounds would need about 73 grams of protein daily, while someone like me, who weighs 115 pounds, needs around 43 grams. Keep in mind, this calculator also takes into account your activity levels and BMI to give a more personalized recommendation.\nThat said, 43 or 73 grams of protein outside of powder supplements might be hard to imagine. Thankfully, we're here to help you improve by showing you the best way to achieve your daily protein goal. Whether you're an omnivore, herbivore or carnivore, we've gathered a wide selection of foods to help you portion your meals in the best way possible. However, be aware that the protein amounts below are based on specific products and their nutrition labels, so your figures may vary depending on the brand or preparation method.\nNote: Each picture contains 100 grams of protein combined, not 100 grams per item.\nWhat 100 grams of protein looks like for omnivores\nEating 100 grams of protein per day should be pretty easy if you don't have any dietary restrictions. Here's what that would look like:\n- Two eggs (12 grams)\n- Snack cheese (5 grams)\n- Greek yogurt (15 grams)\n- Beef sausage (14 grams)\n- One can of tuna (27 grams)\n- \u00bd cup of rolled oats (5 grams)\n- 2 ounces of deli ham (10 grams)\n- 1 ounce of mixed nuts (5 grams)\n- Two slices of rye bread (10 grams)\nEverything pictured above comes to 103 grams, which puts you slightly over your daily target.\nWhat 100 grams of animal protein looks like for carnivores\nAs you can see, getting 100 grams of protein from animal products doesn't take much:\n- Four eggs (24 grams)\n- One can of tuna (27 grams)\n- Three beef meatballs (15 grams)\n- 2 ounces of turkey bacon (10 grams)\n- 3 ounces of turkey breast (24 grams)\nThis amounts to a perfect 100 grams of protein. If you ate all of this in a day, plus bread and other nonanimal products, you would surpass 100 grams of protein in a day.\nWhat 100 grams of protein looks like for vegetarians\nFor vegetarians, 100 grams of protein might look like this:\n- Four eggs (24 grams)\n- \u00bd cup of rolled oats (5 grams)\n- Two snack cheeses (10 grams)\n- \u00bc cup of protein granola (10 grams)\n- A single-serve Greek yogurt (15 grams)\n- One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)\n- Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)\n- One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams)\nThis comes out to 99 grams of protein, which is pretty close.\nWhat 100 grams of protein looks like for vegans\nReaching your protein targets levels up in difficulty when you swear off some of its best sources, but these days there are plenty of ways to meet your goals. This nut- and grain-rich array adds up to 79 grams of protein, the RDA for a 210-pound human.\n- 1 ounce of nuts (5 grams)\n- \u00bd cup of rolled oats (5 grams)\n- A protein granola bar (8 grams)\n- Two slices of rye bread (10 grams)\n- \u00bc cup of protein granola (10 grams)\n- One tablespoon of hemp seeds (4 grams)\n- Two tablespoons of chia seeds (10 grams)\n- Two tablespoons of peanut butter (7 grams)\n- One scoop of plant-based protein powder (20 grams)\nIf we double up on the mixed nuts, chia seeds and hemp seeds, this brings us to 93 grams of protein. You could add an extra tablespoon of peanut butter or eat a full cup of oats, instead of half a cup, to come closer to 100 grams.\nThis plate also excludes high-protein vegan meat substitutes, such as tofu, tempeh or plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger. Those food sources can make it easier to get 100 grams of protein on a vegan diet.\nFAQs\nHow can I tell if I'm not getting enough protein?\nThe symptoms of protein deficiency -- which is normally part of a broader eating disorder or nutrition deficiency -- can vary, but the first one is usually brittle hair and nails, as the body is rationing the protein it does have to more important organs and systems. Other symptoms can include:\n- Anemia: continual fatigue, feeling of weakness, shortness of breath\n- Weakened immune system, leading to more frequent infections\n- Difficulty maintaining focus\n- Mood swings\n- Muscle loss or weakness\n- Swelling\n- Weight fluctuations\nHow can I get 100g of protein a day?\nThe best way to incorporate a large amount of protein into your everyday diet is to invest in researching which protein-rich foods like lean meats, eggs, dairy, lentils and chickpeas will be suitable for your lifestyle. You can also implement in supplements, such as protein powder."

      "text": "If you\u2019re aiming to eat healthier without giving up on flavor or convenience, an air fryer is the perfect companion. They use less oil to achieve the same crispy and caramelized texture you get from pan-frying, roasting, and broiling. To help you find the best, I've tested models from Ninja, De\u2019Longhi, Breville, Phillips, Cosori and Dash.\nOur Picks\nFrom cooking whole chickens to crisping up chickpeas, vegetables or salmon, air fryers handle it all with ease. I make no secret of my love for air fryers, and I've been testing various models for more than five years. My list of favorite things to make in the air fryer grows by the week, but choosing the right countertop oven to make them isn't as simple as it seems.\nWhat's the best air fryer overall?\nWhen Ninja released its Ninja glass-bowl Crispi, we got a new favorite air fryer on our list after two years. The Crispi has loads of power and is easy to clean, plus the cooking chamber doubles as a portable food container. This is hands down the best air fryer to buy in 2025. And guess what? It's available for just $180 -- a bargain.\nThe dynamic glass Crispi is the air fryer we now recommend most, but there are several other picks to choose from that cost less, hold more food or feature additional cooking modes and methods not available on that model.\nRead more: The Air Fryer Is the Best and Fastest Way to Make a Roast Chicken\nBest air fryers of 2025\nPros\n- Glass cooking chamber is easy to clean\n- Can view your food's progress without stopping\n- Cooking chamber turns into a sealed food container\n- Simple controls\nCons\n- Glass gets hot during and after cooking\n- Pricier than others on the list\n- No precise control of temperature\nWhat I liked:\nOur new favorite air fryer comes from the makers of our old favorite. The glass bowl Ninja offers several advantages over metal and nonstick cooking baskets. First, you can see your food while it's being cooked. After cooking, the glass bottom chamber converts to a sealable food carrier when you pop on a rubber lid. As a bonus, the Ninja Crispi's glass cooking chamber was the easiest to get squeaky clean of all the air fryers we've tested.\nUnlike most air fryers that utilize a basket that slides in and out of the machine, this air fryer has a cooking mechanism that clamps down on one of the included 4-quart or 6-cup containers. The powerful coils cooked everything we put inside to a perfect, even crisp. Four simple cooking modes -- warm, reheat, bake, and air fry -- and the adjustable timer made using the machine a breeze.\nWho is it for:\nIt's the best air fryer for those who are particular about getting their kitchen tools squeaky clean. It's also the best air fryer for anyone concerned about nonstick coatings and the potential hazards they present.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe one downside, aside from the high price, is that the glass chamber gets and stays pretty hot both during and after cooking, which could present a danger to careless cooks or those with small children. The glass bowls are equipped with stay-cool handles for handling and transporting the air fryer.\nPros\n- Modest size is good for crowded kitchens\n- Air fryer function was great\n- Able to do gentle toasting in addition to powerful air-frying\n- Fun retro look and available in a range of colors\n- Steam function helps keep food moist\nCons\n- There are definitely cheaper options available\n- Air fryer toaster ovens aren't as easy to clean\nWhat I liked:\nA conveniently sized, PFAS-free, countertop-worthy appliance that can air fry, bake, roast, toast, reheat and broil -- all with steam infusion technology for crispy exteriors and soft, moist interiors. It does everything, from ultra-crispy air frying to serious roasting, to rejuvenating steam infusion. It\u2019s fairly spacious, although certainly not the largest oven we tried. You could roast a roughly 4-pound chicken or go multilevel to cook double the capacity of a stand-alone air fryer.\nThis oven allows you to\nWho is it for:\nIf you have trouble keeping your air-fryer food from drying out, the Wonder Oven is the only model on our list with a steam function that helps keep food moist while it's being blasted with superconvection heat.\nWho should avoid it:\nThe modest capacity means you may have to cook food in batches. If you regularly feed a large crowd, consider upgrading to a larger air fryer or air-frying toaster oven.\nPros\n- Has major power and cooked food faster than any other air fryer we tested\n- The build is sturdy\n- Controls are simple\n- At $69, it's an excellent value\nCons\n- Its shiny plastic body shows fingerprints easily\nWhat I liked:\nNinja's sleek and efficient pod air fryer impressed us in several rounds of testing. At $69, it's a clear pick for the best budget air fryer in 2025. The Ninja is powerful, easy to operate, looks great and is reasonably priced. We tested both the 4-quart model and the otherwise identical 5.5-quart model (perfect for roasting a whole chicken). There were no discernible differences in performance between the two.\nThe Ninja turned out the best chicken wings of any air fryer we cooked them in. It seems to run a little hotter than other models of its size, but I consider that a good thing. Air frying is about getting the outside crispy without drying out the middle, and you need a blast of hot convection to do it.\nWho is it for:\nThose seeking a budget-friendly basket-style air fryer with lots of power. The Ninja's control panel is simple and intuitive. Beyond flicking on the air fryer, there are a handful of presets and cooking modes, including bake and reheat, that are perfect for warming bread or reviving leftover pizza without burning it.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis air fryer sports a nonstick basket, so if you're worried about chemical leaching or the coating wearing out over time, choose Ninja's glass-bowl air fryer instead. One other thing to note is that the Ninja lacks a special cooking mode for vegetables. Much as in earlier rounds of testing, the fresh Brussels sprouts emerged a tad overdone -- even burnt in spots. This simply requires a little more checking when you're air-frying certain foods for the first time.\nPros\n- Air fryer and pressure cooker both work great\n- Great value considering how much it does\nCons\n- Difficult to clean after air frying\n- Heavier than solo air fryers\nWhat I like:\nThis Instant Pot model is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, and air fryer with sear and steam functions, to boot. I found the air fryer function worked as well or better than most of the solo air fryers I tested.\nInstant Pot's Duo model made incredible crispy \"fried\" chicken, wings, veggies, and other classics, but know that you'll likely have to cook in batches if you're making food for a group. It's also a solid deal considering all this machine does. The Duo Crisp can often be found for $150 or cheaper if you nab it on sale.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're eyeing an air fryer but also an Instant Pot or another multicooker, let me save you some money and kitchen space. The Instant Pot Duo does all the work of the popular multicooker -- pressure cooker, slow cooker, steam and saute -- but comes with a separate air fryer lid and cooking function as well.\nWho should avoid it:\nIt's worth noting that the air fryer cooking capacity is relatively small, even if the full chamber for pressure and slow cooking is large. Another thing I didn't love about this model is the steel air fryer basket, which is trickier to clean than the pod-shaped models, most of which feature nonstick cooking baskets.\nPros\n- Sleek design and consistent function\n- Close to a replacement for your wall oven\n- Preheats fast\n- Great for holidays or when extra cooking capacity is needed\nCons\n- Expensive\n- A large cooking chamber makes it harder to get that true air fryer crust.\n- The air fryer function isn't as powerful as some others we tried\nWhat I like:\nBreville's stylish Smart Oven Air is our favorite air fryer and toaster combo. This isn't just a proficient air fryer but a mini version of a smart oven that can handle a small chicken, as many as four filets of salmon or a tray of homemade cookies. Most likely because of its size, the Smart Oven Air took a little bit longer to get crispy chicken wings and Brussels sprouts, but only by a few minutes.\nWho is it for:\nIf you want a countertop appliance that can do far more than wings and wedges, this is a whole lot of oven capability. The Breville heats very consistently and has a wealth of cooking modes -- toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, warm, reheat, air fry -- making it about as good a replacement for your big oven as any. This makes a great supplement to your large oven during holidays and other occasions where extra cooking capacity is welcomed.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you like a toaster oven and are just looking for an air fryer, this probably isn't the pick.\nPros\n- Light and easy to move around the kitchen\n- Good power despite a compact 2-quart size\n- Comes in 5 colors\n- Has a fun retro look\nCons\n- Small 2-quart capacity is not ideal for large groups or families\nWhat I like:\nAs the award suggests, this air fryer is small. About as small as any brand makes them. If you're only cooking for one or two people, it may be enough capacity and will save you precious space on the counter. The Dash has enough power to make eight or nine crispy chicken wings in about 20 minutes and a few servings of fries in about half that time.\nThe single analog dial is easy to manipulate, and there is just one mode -- air fry -- to keep things uncomplicated. For an air fryer under $50, this model is fairly solid, and the basket fits snugly into the hull without any wobble. It's also easy to clean and quiet when running.\nWho is it for:\nIf you're after pure value, the Dash performs well and will cost less than $50. It's also perfect for smaller kitchens or those wanting to test out an air fryer without committing much money or kitchen space.\nWho should avoid it:\nIf you're cooking for more than two or three people, this air fryer won't be big enough.\nPros\n- Dual basket design allows you to cook multiple foods at once\n- Huge capacity for making big batches of food for crowds\nCons\n- Takes up a lot of space in the kitchen\n- Expensive for an air fryer\nWhat I like:\nA dual-basket air fryer allows you to cook most of an entire meal in one go without fear of burning one thing or undercooking the other. Smaller baskets net better results when air frying, so I suggest a dual-basket as opposed to an oven with one single, large cooking chamber. This model has all the same settings and cooking modes as Ninja's single-basket model, but allows you to toggle between both baskets to set the time and temp accordingly. There's also a handy match-cook setting if you're doing one huge heap of wings in both baskets.\nWhile Instant also makes a formidable version, Ninja's 8-quart (two 4-quart baskets) is our top pick. It sports tons of power at a great price. As with the single-basket Ninja, this machine feels rock solid, and the baskets slide in firmly with no wiggle.\nWho is it for:\nThis is the perfect air fryer for those who regularly cook for big groups. You can make double batches of wings or cook two recipes at once for a full meal without having to do it in batches or worry about overcooking one of the recipes.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis is a massive air fryer and will dominate whatever part of the countertop you keep it on. If you don't regularly cook for large groups, opt for one of the smaller, less expensive models on our list. This dual-basket model also has a smaller 6-quart model (two 3-quart baskets) and a massive 10-quart version (two 5-quart baskets) available.\nWant more info? Check out our full review of the Ninja Foodi Dual-Basket air fryer.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025\nThe Ninja Crispi glass air fryer was tested and added as best air fryer overall\nThe Ninja 4-quart air fryer was tested and added as the best air fryer under $75\nThe Our Place Wonder Oven was tested and added as the best air fryer and toaster oven\nCompare air fryers\n| Air fryer | Size | Wattage | Controls | Cooking modes | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ninja Crispi glass air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,500 | Digital | Air fry, recrisp, reheat, mac crisp | $160 |\n| Ninja 4- or 6-quart air fryer | 4 quarts | 1,550 | Digital | Air fry, roast, reheat, dehydrate | $69 |\n| Dash 2-quart air fryer | 2 quarts | 1,500 | Analog | Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate | $50 |\n| Ninja Foodi DualZone air fryer | 8 quarts (total) | 1,690 | Digital | Air fry, broil, bake, dehydrate, roast, reheat | $200 |\n| Instant Pot Duo Crisp | 6 quarts | 1,000 | Digital | Pressure cook, slow cook, air fry, roast, steam, bake, broil, warm, saut\u00e9 | $150 |\n| Breville Smart Oven Air | 0.8 cubic feet | 1,800 | Digital | Toast, broil, bake, roast, warm, pizza, air fry, reheat, slow cook | $350 |\nOther air fryers we tested\nDreo Chefmaker: This souped-up air fryer has a built-in thermometer and tons of smart features. It works ggreen t but I found myself just using the basic air fryer function which makes it hard to justify the $359 price.\nDash Tasti-Crisp: I don't have major complaints with this model's function, but it feels a little flimsy for $60.\nCrux Marshmello: This compact 3-quart air fryer did well in testing and the cooking basket was easy to clean. I wasn't a fan of the control panels, which sport cutesy LED images in place of words, and it wasn't abundantly clear what each one was for.\nPhillips air fryer: I had no issues with this air fryer and liked the sleek design and intuitive controls. It performed similarly to the Ninja 4-quart but that model, our top budget pick, costs $100 less.\nPowerXL Air Fryer: This is another small air fryer that did well in testing, but I prefer the controls and sleek design of the more budget-friendly Gourmia 2-quart.\nInstant Vortex: One popular option is the Instant Vortex. It's priced in line with the other air fryers in this group. The Vortex is made by the same company that created the groundbreaking Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Despite that, I wasn't blown away by its results. Chicken wings and fried chicken were acceptable but not incredible and less juicy than what other fryers produced. My Brussels sprouts ended up overdone too, and frozen fries cooked unevenly.\nDash Compact Air Fryer: We found the Dash Compact Air Fryer to be underpowered. While the larger Dash Deluxe is a powerhouse, the Dash Compact struggled to air-fry almost everything we put inside it. Both french fries and Brussels sprouts were under-done and unevenly cooked. The only bright spot was chicken wings. They took 30 minutes, but I was treated to skin with some crunch.\nGoWise USA 8-in-1 Digital Air Fryer: You may not have heard of this brand, but this offering from GoWise is a solid choice. It didn't cook the skin of my chicken wings evenly. That said, french fries came out crispy and crunchy, with fluffy interiors. The fryer also roasted Brussels sprouts well, no mean feat for this group of appliances.\nChefman 3.5 qt. Analog Air Fryer: Another relatively affordable choice is the Chefman Analog Air Fryer. It's tiny, too, offering just 3.5 quarts of food-frying capacity. The appliance delivered decent chicken wings, but it undercooked the Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries. We also found the Chefman's timer control confusing. This dial is labeled in numerical increments of 10. The numbers are separated by groups of four dots, not nine, as you would expect.\nPowerXL Vortex Air Fryer: You might consider purchasing the PowerXL Vortex, but we recommend against it due to its steep price and mediocre frying performance. We had satisfactory results cooking chicken wings in it, but this machine overcooked Brussels sprouts, and the french fries were just OK.\nDeLonghi Rapid Crisp: The DeLonghi Rapid Crisp was one of the most expensive models we tested, and it just didn't live up to the price tag. While I liked the design and sturdy build and appreciated the small viewing window for watching the cooking progress, I found the buttons and interface clunky. There was no way to set an actual cooking temp, only presets, and even those weren't very intuitive.\nBeautiful Air Fryer by Drew Barrymore: This air fryer offering from the actor's new kitchen line performed well in the four rounds of testing. It showed good power and cooked chicken wings to a nice crispy outside and kept them juicy inside after about 25 minutes. The air fryer's interface is slick, although I liked the Ninja's simpler control panel more, which is one of a few reasons it edged out this unit for best air fryer overall. This is a great option and is about $30 cheaper than the Ninja. It also has a pleasing design with smooth matte plastic (which does smudge a bit).\nHow we test air fryers\nTo date, we've tested well over a dozen air fryers to curate this list. Each air fryer is evaluated for its power, consistency, ease of use, design, features and overall performance. In total, we've logged results for more than 20 air fryers and over 75 hours of air fryer testing.\nThere are hundreds of recipes that can be made with an air fryer but we stuck to the basics and focused on the most popular foods people associate with air fryers. Chicken wings are at the top of that list, but french fries, frozen snacks and dense vegetables -- in this case, Brussels sprouts -- are air fryer food staples. Before we began, we consulted each model's manual for relevant cooking directions. If the manual didn't provide specific instructions, we applied uniform procedures to each air fryer depending on the type of food we were preparing.\nFor chicken wings, we followed a basic air fryer recipe. First, we preheated the air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 25 minutes in the basket with the included tray, then checked on them and turned them every 8 minutes. Most of the air fryers we tested had a solid showing in the wing test, although some, including the powerful Ninja and Cosori Lite models, got the wings a bit crispier in that amount of time.\nFor Brussels sprouts, we preheated the ovens to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 15 minutes. Before cooking, we rinsed and cut the sprouts in half and tossed them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In this test, some ovens struggled to brown the outside of the sprouts, but most got there eventually.\nFor the french fry test, we opted for Alexia's frozen crinkle-cut fries and cooked 1 cup, according to the air fryer directions on the bag. Quick note: Be careful when cooking fries in an air fryer as some types, especially thinner-cut fries, can dry out easily when hit with super-convection. We recommend heftier waffle fries, tater tots, crinkle cut or potato wedges over the shoestring variety.\nAt the end of each test, we looked for how evenly the items were cooked, if they were cooked through and whether they had a sufficient level of crispy, crunchy, fried goodness comparable to deep frying or pan frying.\nEase of use\nBeyond cooking performance, how easy an air fryer is to operate and how intuitive the buttons and controls were something we observed closely during testing. Overly complicated settings, controls and presets didn't generally result in high marks, but certain features were appreciated. All air fryers have base-level control over the temperature and cook time, although some are controlled digitally while others require the crank of simple manual dials. From there, you'll find preset programs for various foods such as wings, fries, fish, veggies and even baked goods.\nHow well they cook\nTo get a sense of how each air fryer in this test group handles, we ran a battery of three tests on each model. Each test focused on one food: chicken wings, Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries.\nWhat health experts say about air fryers\nThe Cleveland Clinic: \"They [air fryers] won't magically remove the saturated fat from bacon or the trans fats from a bag of processed chicken wings. To reap the benefits, reach for better-for-you options like vegetables and lean proteins....Think of the air fryer as a way to enhance healthier foods, so they're even more tempting.\"\nMedical News Today: \"Research on the effects of air-fried food is promising. Air fryers appear to be a healthy alternative, offering flavors similar to fried food with fewer adverse effects.\"\nBritish Heart Foundation: \"If you often eat deep-fried foods, switching to an air fryer could be helpful.\"\nBuying guide: What to consider when choosing an air fryer\nAn air fryer can bring efficiency and simplicity to your nightly meal routine. It's easy to make a quick and delicious meal with the best air fryers in your kitchen. They are not only healthier than an oven but also use less energy. Check out the complete guide to air fryers to learn more about these great kitchen appliances.\nPod-shaped air fryers vs. air-frying toasters\nWhile the idea of a toaster oven that doubles as an air fryer is a good one, and the air frying function on many of the hybrid machines is proficient, certain foods we love cooking in an air fryer are too messy to cook in a toaster.\nAll pod air fryers have removable cooking baskets and most of them are nonstick. When you're cooking chicken thighs with a sauce or even veggies drizzled with oil -- a few favorites -- there is going to be some inevitable splatter. Air frying mode is intense, with high convection heat circulated at a fast pace. Do this in a toaster oven, which is markedly more difficult to clean, and you'll be dealing with some serious caked-on gunk after the first few dozen uses.\nPod air fryers, on the other hand, take very little effort to get clean. Most air fryer baskets are now thicker and also nonstick. Beware of thin wire baskets, which can be tougher to clean. Both types can be removed to soak in the sink and some can be run through the dishwasher. The same can't be said for the inside walls of a countertop oven.\nIf you're buying a toaster oven, there's no reason not to get one with an air fryer function. It can still be used for less splatter-prone foods such as potatoes, frozen empanadas and filets of salmon with too much risk of making a mess.\nFor more, read CNET's complete guide to air fryers.\nAir fryer size\nWhile there are several features to consider, the size of your air fryer is likely the most important decision you'll make. If you're typically cooking for one or two people, a 2- or 3-quart air fryer should be large enough. Consider adding another quart of capacity to your air fryer for every person that you're regularly cooking for.\nA family of four or five, for instance, should be fine with a 5-quart model. If you plan on regularly cooking full meals for a family, including meat and veggies or sides, you might consider a larger, dual-basket air fryer like the Ninja DualZone.\nAll that said, the smaller the air fryer you can get away with the better. I've found that smaller air fryers such as the Magic Bullet 2- to 5-quart model and Instant Pot's Duo Crisp net better results since food will get blasted faster and more often than inside a larger model. Smaller air fryers mean less overall capacity, so you may have to cook in batches.\nPower\nMost air fryers are somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 watts. Larger air fryers typically have more wattage and smaller models have less. Your midrange 4-quart air fryer should have about 1,500 watts. The small Magic Bullet and Gourmia air fryers have 1,300, but that's plenty of power to cook food in the petite basket. Larger air fryers should have about 100 more watts per quart to make sure they hit those hot temps of 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAir fryer accessories\nSome fancy models may come with extra accessories, but all you need is an air fryer basket with wire or nonstick grates. They come standard with most air fryer models and help the super-convection to hit all sides of your food evenly. I prefer the nonstick variety as wire baskets can be particularly tricky to clean.\nShould you just get a normal air fryer or a multifunction model?\nThat depends on the type of cooking you'll do and what other appliances you already have. I like having a solo air fryer, but I'm also a fan of the Instant Pot Duo Crisp which functions as both an air fryer and a multicooker (also a pressure cooker and slow cooker).\nConsider how the air fryer looks, too\nAir fryers don't have to be kept on the counter but anything larger than 3 quarts might be tricky to store when not in use. Considering that, you should get an air fryer that compliments your kitchen. Both the Ninja and Cosori models are available in a range of colors (Cosori has more). There are also glass bowl air fryers and more modern-looking machines.\nAir fryer FAQs\nHow do air fryers work?\nThe air fryer is a simple cooking machine that employs hot, fast-circulating convection heat and a small fan to flash-roast food inside a contained frying basket. While there's generally no or very little oil used, the results can be similar to those of traditional frying in that food comes out crispy on the outside and (ideally) moist on the inside.\nAre air fryers energy efficient compared to ovens?\nWe did an analysis and found that a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven.\nWhat can you make in an air fryer?\nThe options for foods you can cook in an air fryer are vast, but some air fryer favorites include chicken wings, chicken tenders, french fries and mozzarella sticks. You can also make fish in an air fryer, including salmon, for a moist inside and roasted outer crust. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are great when made in an air fryer, as are certain vegetables like Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, onions, peppers and carrots.\nIs using an air fryer healthier?\nGenerally speaking, air frying is a healthy way to cook. Cooking with an air fryer means you'll get foods that taste like they've been fried but with little or no oil. You can make healthier chicken wings, French fries, and cheese sticks without deep-frying or pan-frying in oil. Some foods do best in an air fryer with a light coating of oil, but most don't require any. Air fryers have become popular in part because they allow people to eat snack-type foods but with far less fat, cholesterol, and fewer calories.\nCan you cook raw meat in an air fryer?\nAs long as the raw meat is fully defrosted, you can place and even cook it in an air fryer with very little trouble. However, we do recommend using baking paper under the meat (either by covering the tray, or cutting a fine piece of the paper to put under your food) so that the juice collected doesn't collect at the bottom of your air fryer."

Remember, before you start taking an omega-3 supplement, be sure to check with your doctor about the right dosage, especially if you\u2019re on blood thinners.\nOur Picks\nBest Omega-3 Supplements\nPros\n- The GNC Mini softgels are smaller than the average size of omega-3 supplements, which is good for people who have trouble swallowing large pills.\n- ConsumerLab tested and approved\n- Free of heavy metals.\nCons\n- Smaller pills, but you have to take two of them\nOmega-3 supplements commonly have fairly large pills, generally measuring from half an inch to an inch. For some, that poses a problem. GNC offers an alternative with its mini fish oil softgels. The GNC Triple Strength Fish Oil Mini wins the best overall omega-3 supplement for its size and concentration of omega-3s.\nThe small softgels are enteric-coated, which means there's a polymer applied to the outside of the softgel to keep it from dissolving in the stomach. The softgels then move to the small intestine, where they are digested and released. It also means there isn't a fishy aftertaste.\nGNC Triple Strength Fish Oil Mini has a good concentration of omega-3s EPA (734 mg) and DHA (266 mg).\nOmega-3 content per serving: 1,065 mg of omega-3 per two softgels\nPros\n- A must for people who want to buy in bulk at an affordable price\n- USP certification\nCons\n- Other options on the list have a higher omega-3 dose\n- These fish oil capsules aren't enteric coated, which means there is nothing to hide that fishy aftertaste\nIf you prefer to buy in bulk, you might want to consider the Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil supplement. It's inexpensive at $18 for 400 capsules. This omega-3 supplement doesn't have all the bells and whistles other brands have. It's a basic, no-fuss option for people who don't need a high dose of fish oil. Kirkland Signature fish oil supplement only includes 300mg of EPA and DHA per softgel. That's significantly less than other brands, but taking one capsule twice daily puts it closer to the rest in terms of dosage.\nThe softgel capsules are long and narrow to make them easier to swallow. Still, the pills are large and some reviewers suggest they are hard to swallow.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 300mg omega-3 per softgel\nPros\n- Orange flavor that doesn't leave a fishy taste\n- It has a five-star rating from International Fish Oil Standards\nCons\n- You only get a 60-day supply for $35. It's slightly more expensive than other options on the list\nWhen it comes to fish oil and omega-3 supplements, taste matters, Barlean's Ideal Omega-3 Softgels are great for those who want to avoid the fishy taste that some omega-3 supplements have. It features an orange flavor that covers the smell and taste of fish oil so that you can get the benefits without the unpleasant side effects -- fishy burps and aftertaste. User reviews say these orange omega-3 supplements don't leave a fishy aftertaste in their mouth.\nThe dosage for this omega-3 supplement is one softgel, which users point out is rather large. However, the softgel form makes them easy to swallow. You get 750mg of EPA and 250mg of DHA omega-3s with one softgel.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 1,000mg of omega-3 per softgel\nPros\n- User reviews say these fish oil gummies are delicious and don't have a fishy taste\n- Flavors are strawberry, lemon and orange\nCons\n- 3 grams of added sugar per serving\n- Significantly lower omega-3 content than other brands\nThere's a gummy supplement for everything -- omega-3s included. Nature Made Fish Oil Gummies are a great option for people looking for a yummy way to intake a low dose of omega-3s. The two-serving dose only includes 47.5mg of DHA and 9.5mg of EPA omega-3s. Because of the low dose, it's not the best choice if you're deficient in omega-3s; it's better suited for people who already get most of it from their diet but are looking for a little boost.\nNature Made Fish Oil Gummies are free of any synthetic flavors or colors. The fish sources are wild, deep ocean water fish, not from raised farms. These fish oil gummies are also USP certified for quality and purity.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 57mg of omega-3s per two gummies.\nPros\n- Gluten- and GMO-free\n- Has earned a five-star certification from IFOS\n- Fish source in this product is sustainably-caught anchovies from off the coast of Chile\nCons\n- The packaging on the bottle says \"small\" softgels; however, some customer reviews point out that while they may be smaller than other brands, they are not truly small.\n- The serving size is two capsules twice daily with meals\nFor those looking to add an omega-3 supplement for heart health, consider the Life Extension Super Omega-3 Supplement. It features a formula of DHA, EPA, olive extract and sesame lignans for an antioxidant and antimicrobial supplement. Research shows that olive leaf extract and sesame can help prevent heart disease.\nLife Extension's omega-3 supplement carries a five-star certification from IFOS. It's also gluten-free and non-GMO. This omega-3 supplement delivers a solid dose of both DHA (500mg) and EPA (700mg). However, that is a trade-off of serving size. Instead of the standard one or two capsules a day, Life Extension requires two capsules twice a day with food.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 1,200mg of Omega-3s per four softgels\nPros\n- Certified vegan and gluten-free\n- Truvani is also tested for chemicals and heavy metals\nCons\n- Customer reviews say this vegan omega-3 supplement doesn't have the best aftertaste\nOmega-3 supplements are typically derived from fish. However, there are plant-based omega-3 supplements available, too. The best of these is Truvani Plant-Based Omega, an algae omega-3 dietary supplement.\nWith a two-capsule serving size, you get 500mg of DHA omega-3s. This vegan omega-3 supplement is minimally processed and doesn't impact ocean life. Truvani offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee if you're not pleased with the product.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 500mg of DHA omega-3s\nPros\n- Third-party tested and approved by ConsumerLab\n- Subtle lemon flavor that can mix easily into drinks or food, according to reviews.\nCons\n- Nordic Naturals Liquid Fish Oil has a very high concentration of omega-3s, which may be too much for some\nMost fish oil supplement pills are large, significantly larger than other capsules. This poses a problem for people who have a hard time swallowing pills. Liquid omega-3 offers a way to boost your intake without having to worry about large capsules. Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega Liquid omega-3 supplement is free from artificial additives and fillers.\nNordic Natural is a well-known brand that offers the best liquid fish oil supplement. The serving size is one teaspoon, with the highest concentration of omega-3s on the list. Each serving contains 1,470mg of EPA and 1,010mg of DHA in triglyceride form. Research suggests that the triglyceride form may be better absorbed in the body.\nOmega-3 content per serving: 2,470mg of omega-3 per one teaspoon\nHow we chose the best omega-3 supplements\nWhen choosing the best omega-3 supplements, we considered factors like cost, dosage, form and quality. We also researched each product's customer reviews to compare the capsules' texture, taste and size. We didn't test these products in-house. We relied on third-party certifications to determine the quality and purity of the products.\nThings to consider when buying the best omega-3 supplements\nThe market is flooded with brands offering omega-3 supplements. Knowing which is the best fit for you can be difficult. When shopping, keep these things in mind:\n- Supplement type: Omega-3 supplements are known for large capsules. Maybe people in product reviews call them \"horse pills.\" Because of this, it's more important than ever to consider the form of supplement that best fits your needs. There are mini capsules, gummies and liquid options if you have trouble swallowing large pills.\n- Dosage: The products across the fish oil market vary by dosage. Determining how much you should take depends on your diet, needs and potential medication interactions.\n- Fish oil source: Many brands source fish oil sustainably and responsibly. It's possible to take an omega-3 supplement with no fish source; you just need to check the nutritional label, which states the source.\n- Quality: The quality of a product can be determined by the ingredient label. Given the minimal regulations in the vitamin and supplement industry, it's important to look for products with third-party testing that vouches for their quality and purity.\n- Potential side effects: Taking omega-3 supplements does not by itself increase the risk of bleeding. However, if you are on blood thinners or other medications that affect your blood, your risk of bleeding could increase."

      "text": "Increasing fiber in your diet might not seem like something enjoyable for most people. Fiber comes in the form of grains, fruits and vegetables. And if one or more of these foods tend to be hard for you to enjoy or eat, it's probably something you don't prioritize.\nHowever, fiber is essential to a healthy diet as it keeps you fuller, provides regular bowel movements and can even help prevent certain diseases like colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, only 5% of the US population consumes the recommended amount of fiber daily, according to the National Library of Medicine. Many people think they eat enough fiber than they actually do. Many think that adding more fiber to their diet also means eating more boring foods.\nThere's good news, though. Fiber is found in many delicious foods that are easy to incorporate into your diet. Let's explore more about the benefits of fiber and some of the best sources of fiber you can eat.\nWhat is fiber and what are its benefits?\nDietary fiber -- the kind your doctor wants you to consume -- is a type of carbohydrate. Unlike many other carbs, it cannot be digested but instead aids in the entire digestive process. It comes in two forms: soluble fiber (dissolves in water) and insoluble fiber (does not dissolve in water). Each helps your body in different ways, but it's important to note that both kinds of fiber have a variety of health benefits. Here are a few of the best reasons to ramp up your fiber intake.\nReduces your risk of heart disease\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, soluble fiber is known to bolster heart health. Medical experts attribute this to how fiber slows digestion, reducing hunger and interfering with bile acid production. This reduces the risk of developing diabetes -- a key predictor of heart disease -- and high cholesterol.\nLower chances of developing type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is a condition with a wide range of risk factors, and not everyone is equally at risk of developing it. But studies have shown that increasing your insoluble fiber intake may reduce your overall risk level. In particular, consuming high levels of fiber from whole grains such as brown rice, rye and oats has been linked to lower levels of diabetes risk.\nProtects against certain types of cancer\nIncreasing your dietary fiber intake may help you avoid some types of cancer. Although the effects vary based on other factors and specific subtypes of cancer, soluble fibers have been tied to a reduced risk of many kinds of colorectal cancer. And with colorectal cancer diagnosis increasing in people younger than 50, it's important to not neglect fiber in your diet. One study also showed that high fiber intake might even reduce the risk of breast cancer by as much as 25%.\nSupports digestive health\nThis is perhaps the benefit for which fiber is best known. Fiber helps to increase the size and weight of your stools, as well as soften them. This makes it easier to pass bowel movements, which can contribute to overall well-being and reduce the likelihood that you'll develop conditions such as hemorrhoids or diverticular disease.\nExtends your life\nWhen you combine all these benefits, the net result is that a diet rich in fiber may improve your overall health and extend your life. One study showed that regular dietary fiber intake, especially from grains, reduced the risk of death from a variety of causes by 24% to 56% in men and 34% to 59% in women.\nFoods high in fiber\nAccording to the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 14 grams for every 1,000 calories is the daily dietary fiber recommendation. Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily and men 38 grams daily. If you're increasing your fiber intake, be sure to do it gradually and see how you feel before adding more. Now that we know the health benefits of fiber, let's get into the foods with the highest fiber contents.\n1. Chia Seeds\nChia seeds are tiny, black seeds with a jelly-like texture when mixed with liquid. They're popular among natural health aficionados for their nutrient-rich profile, which includes calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, omega-3 fatty acids and, yes, fiber. Many people like them in smoothies, yogurt, cereal and oatmeal.\nGrams of fiber: 2 tablespoons of chia seeds come packed with 10 grams of fiber, which translates to a whopping 34.4 grams of fiber per 100 grams of seeds.\n2. Popcorn\nYou read that right, popcorn. But, before you run off to the nearest theater and douse a big bucket of it in butter, remember that how you prepare your popcorn matters. If you want the most health benefits from this fiber-rich food, it's best to air-pop your kernels. If you need a little flavor, try a light topping of olive oil and salt.\nGrams of fiber: 3 cups of popped corn (not kernels) contain 3.5 grams of fiber, which equates to 14.4 grams of fiber per 100 grams of popcorn.\n3. Almonds\nAlmonds are one of the best sources of fiber, as long as you don't have a tree nut allergy. They're extremely dense in nutrients, including healthy fats, magnesium, manganese and vitamin E. They're also loaded with fiber, making for a powerful, healthy snack.\nGrams of fiber: 1 ounce of almonds carries about 3.5 grams of fiber, for about 13.3 grams in every 100 grams of nuts.\n4. Dark chocolate\nThis may be surprising, but health experts have been touting the health benefits of dark chocolate for a long time. Turns out it's not just rich in antioxidants, but also a great source of fiber. Keep in mind, though, that you won't get the full benefits unless you choose chocolate that's low in added sugar and at least 70% dark.\nGrams of fiber: A 1-ounce piece of 70% to 85% cacao has about 3.1 grams of fiber, which amounts to 10.9 grams of fiber per 100 grams of chocolate.\n5. Oats\nOats are a popular breakfast choice for many, and they come with powerful health benefits, including a variety of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Most of all though, they're packed with fiber and great for digestion. Oats, in particular, contain a fiber called beta-glucan, which has been shown to help control blood sugar and cholesterol. Steel-cut oats are the highest in fiber since they are less processed than rolled oats or quick oats.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of raw oats contains about 16.5 grams of fiber, which translates to 10.1 grams of fiber per 100 grams of oats.\n6. Split peas\nSplit peas are packed full of nutrients and rich in both protein and fiber. They're best known for making a great soup, but they're also handy for a crunchy snack or cooked in sauce for a casserole or gravy.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of boiled split peas contains about 16 grams of fiber, or about 8.3 grams of fiber per 100 grams of split peas.\n7. Lentils\nLike split peas, lentils are part of the legume family. That means they're similarly loaded with protein and fiber, as well as many other nutrients. They work well as a meat substitute in many dishes, and they're also a popular ingredient in soups.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of boiled lentils contains about 13 to 15 grams of fiber, which is about 7.3 grams of fiber per 100 grams of lentils.\n8. Chickpeas\nChickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are yet another member of the legume family (sensing a theme here?), making them another great source of fiber and protein. They're one of the most diverse food options on this list. You can puree them to make hummus, roast them and add them to a salad, or put them in a minestrone soup.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of cooked chickpeas has about 12 grams of fiber, which equates to about 7 grams of fiber per 100 grams of chickpeas.\n9. Kidney beans\nYep, we're in the legume family again. Kidney beans are another good choice for a high-fiber diet, and they're popular in bean salads, chilis or even pasta salads. A classic Italian soup, pasta e fagioli, also contains kidney beans.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of cooked kidney beans has about 12.2 grams of fiber, which translates to about 6.8 grams of fiber per 100 grams of beans.\n10. Avocados\nAvocados are one of the best things you can eat for healthy fats, but they're also surprisingly low in carbs and high in fiber. Spread them on toast or as topping on sandwiches, or make good old-fashioned guacamole for a tasty dip.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of raw avocado contains about 10 grams of fiber, yielding about 6.7 grams of fiber per 100 grams of fruit.\n11. Raspberries\nRaspberries are one of many fruits that provide all sorts of antioxidants and other nutrients. They also stand out as one of the most fiber-packed fruit options you can eat, and they're delicious. Pair them with chia seeds in a homemade chia seed pudding for an incredibly fiber-rich treat.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of raspberries has about 8 grams of fiber, which is about 6.5 grams of fiber per 100 grams of berries.\n12. Artichoke heart\nArtichokes are an easily overlooked vegetable, and that's a shame because they're incredibly rich in nutrients and dense in fiber. They're also notable for their positive effects on cholesterol. Roast them to make an artichoke dip, cook them on a pizza, or just eat them straight up.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of cooked artichoke hearts contains about 14 grams of fiber, which equates to about 5.4 grams of fiber per 100 grams of artichokes.\n13. Brussels sprouts\nBrussels sprouts have long had a bad rep with children. If you've never given them a serious try in adulthood, though, now may be the time. They're rich in antioxidants, vitamin K, and many other minerals. And they're great sources of fiber.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of boiled brussels sprouts has about 4 grams of fiber, which equates to about 3.8 grams of fiber per 100 grams of sprouts.\n14. Pears\nIf you've always leaned toward apples for your pome fruit of choice, you may want to switch it up and give pears a try for a fiber boost. Like apples, they're full of flavor and rich in vitamin C and vitamin K. But pears also have a richer, syrupy sweetness than apples, especially when ripe. Slice them and toss them on a salad or eat them right off the core. Regardless, you're getting a healthy dose of fiber.\nGrams of fiber: 1 medium pear contains about 5.5 grams of fiber, or about 3.1 grams of fiber per 100 grams of fruit.\n15. Quinoa\nAlthough it's actually a seed, quinoa is classified as a whole grain. It has soared in popularity in recent years due to its role as a gluten-free grain substitute, as well as its nutrient-packed profile. With all of its other attributes, it probably won't surprise you to learn that quinoa is also a great source of fiber.\nGrams of fiber: 1 cup of cooked quinoa contains about 5 grams of fiber, which translates to about 2.8 grams of fiber per 100 grams of quinoa."

      "text": "Fall months means you can cook meals that are more warming. Although salmon is great for the summer, it can be even better for these autumn months. If you're worried about leaving a mess behind or needing too much time with it, don't worry. Instead of cooking it on a pan or grilling this healthy fish outside, you can opt for an alternative that's less messy. If you've ever had to scrape salmon skin off your grill, you know what I mean.\nThe air fryer has gained popularity because of its ability to cook up quick snacks likecrispy wings and fries without all the oil, but it can also beautifully handle filets of salmon or any other fish. This 10-minute method will crisp the outside, while the inside cooks to a tender medium-rare. Not only does the cook itself save you time, but it doesn't leave behind a messy grill or oil-splattered stovetop to clean up afterwards. And you also don't have to preheat your large oven, which would have taken you twice as long and raise the temperature of the kitchen by as much as 10 degrees (the air fryer won't).\nFor hot nights when I need something affordable, healthy and quick, this air fryer salmon is an easy decision. You can also play with the recipe, mixing and matching sauces, seasoning and sides until you find a flavor that fits your taste. Salmon tacos are a particular favorite in this house.\nHere's how to make a perfect filet every time. And for more, see our favorite places to order salmon online and the best air fryers we tested for 2025. If you're wondering how these trendy and efficient countertop cookers work and which model is best, read my complete guide to air fryers.\nIngredients for the 10-minute air fryer salmon\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari\n- 1 tsp brown sugar\n- 1 green onion, diced\n- Salmon filet\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Parchment paper (optional)\nRead More: Best BBQ Sauces\nDirections for perfect 10-minute air fryer salmon\n- Step 1: Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F on either \"air fry\" or \"roast.\"\n- Step 2: Whisk together olive oil, brown sugar, soy sauce and green onion.\n- Step 3: Pat the salmon filet dry and place it in the air fryer on top of parchment paper (paper optional).\n- Step 4: Pour soy sauce mixture over salmon and brush to coat completely.\n- Step 5: Close the basket and cook for about 8 minutes, checking with a fork or internal probe for doneness (cook a minute or two more if you prefer your salmon medium well or well done).\nAir fryer salmon FAQ\nWhat else can I cook in the air fryer?\nThe air fryer is my go-to for roasted chicken, replacing my slow and dirty dish-heavy oven recipe. I recently learned to make juicy air fryer cheeseburgers and sizzle bacon in less than 10 minutes and without dirtying a skillet or sheet pan.\nWhy should I use an air fryer instead of an oven?\nAir fryers are incredibly convenient and can do many of the same jobs that an oven can. They only take a couple of minutes to preheat, contain many of the cooking messes you'd otherwise have to spend time cleaning up and are overall more energy-efficient cooking appliances.\nWhat's the biggest limitation of cooking with an air fryer?\nWhen you're planning to cook meals with an air fryer, you need to make sure you have enough space inside of your appliance for the food you want to cook. Many air fryers can accommodate for a single person's serving size, but you'll likely have to run the air fryer multiple times to make enough food for your whole family.\nCan I bake in an air fryer?\nYes, you can. The air fryer functions just like a convection oven, making it suitable for baking cookies, brownies and more."

      "text": "Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that supports a healthy immune system and bolsters our bones, brains and more. Last year, a meta-analysis published in July also linked vitamin D to maintaining cardiovascular health. It's specifically said to offer, \"overall beneficial effects on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and glycemic parameters.\" This was especially the case for participants from Asia, Oceania and Africa, participants with lower vitamin D levels, those with a BMI under 30 and adults aged 50 and older.\nMore recent studies are supporting the theory that vitamin D levels are associated with lower risks of cancer. Specifically, a study published in April 2025, found that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, which includes cancers of the colon and rectum. However, larger studies need to be conducted to corroborate these results.\nKeep reading to learn about the benefits, potential risks and who should take vitamin D supplements. Remember, before you start taking any supplement, it's important to consult your doctor to make sure it suits your health needs.\nWhat is vitamin D?\nYour body needs vitamin D for several critical processes, from building healthy bones to regulating certain cellular functions. It also affects your brain, skin and muscle function.\nAs far as bone health goes, vitamin D plays an important role because it maintains calcium and phosphorus balance by promoting absorption. Vitamin D is usually added to milk to increase calcium absorption, which occurs in the small intestine.\nVitamin D comes in two primary forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). They function fairly similarly in your body, although D3 is more bioavailable and more effective in raising and maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in the bloodstream.\nGood news: Your body can make vitamin D on its own when a chemical in your skin gets direct sunlight. Bad news: Most people can't make as much vitamin D as their bodies need. This becomes particularly true with limited sun exposure during the winter months when the days shorten and you spend less time outdoors. Others at higher risk for developing vitamin D deficiency include those who have dark skin, fat malabsorption disorders, inflammatory bowel disease or are older adults.\nWithout enough of this vitamin, you're more prone to stress fractures. Some people also experience fatigue, aches and pains due to vitamin D deficiency.\nIf you think you might have this deficiency, ask your doctor to order a blood test. They can help you determine if you're low on this vitamin and, if so, the best way to increase your levels. Some people benefit from adding more vitamin D-rich foods and drinks to their diet, while others need vitamin D supplements.\nFoods with vitamin D\nIf you want a safe, risk-free way to get more of this nutrient into your body, stock up on foods with vitamin D. Some naturally occurring sources include:\n- Tuna\n- Trout\n- Salmon\n- Sardines\n- Herring\n- Mackerel\n- Egg yolk\n- Mushrooms\n- Shrimp\n- Cheese\n- Beef liver\nYou can also find foods and drinks fortified with vitamin D. Remember, your body needs vitamin D to adequately absorb calcium. As a result, you'll often find it in milk and yogurt. Check the packaging. It should specifically say something like \"fortified with vitamin D.\"\nYou might also find vitamin D-fortified cereals, oatmeal and orange juice. In other words, food manufacturers have seemingly decided that a healthy dose of vitamin D is a great way to start the day. Also, these foods are fortified because they are affordable and accessible to most people.\nIf you got a blood test and found that you're low in this vitamin, you can try moving to a D-rich diet. If another test reveals that you're still low, it's likely time to start exploring vitamin D supplement benefits.\nVitamin D benefits\nWhether you combine food and sunlight or add vitamin D supplements to your diet, getting enough of this nutrient makes a big difference for your body. Specifically, sufficient vitamin D can deliver:\nStronger bones\nStudies show that vitamin D plays a critical role in your body's calcium absorption. And as you probably already know, calcium means strong, healthy bones. That's why doctors often prescribe vitamin D supplements for kids with rickets and people with inherited bone disorders.\nSince everyone has bones, it's worth double-checking that you're getting enough vitamin D. Sufficient vitamin D can help prevent and manage osteoporosis.\nReduced risk of heart disease and diabetes\nAcross the country, heart disease is the leading cause of death. While many factors come into play here, studies have linked low levels of vitamin D and:\n- Heart disease\n- Stroke\n- Hypertension\n- Type 2 diabetes\nIf you're looking for a way to defend yourself against some of the most common health conditions in the country, it might be time to consider these vitamin D supplement benefits.\nA stronger immune system\nWhile low vitamin D levels can make you more likely to get sick, the opposite can also be true. This vitamin works to activate your T cells, which help your body fight infection. That means vitamin D supplement benefits can include a reduced likelihood of getting sick, along with the potential to shrink your risk for deregulated immune system conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and diabetes. However, more research is needed to fully understand the extent of vitamin D's impact on these conditions.\nA more balanced mood\nStudies link insufficient vitamin D and depression. What's more, even if you're not living with major depressive disorder, low levels of vitamin D can contribute to depressive symptoms like low mood and apathy.\nReduced cognitive decline\nSpeaking of your brain, vitamin D might help it. Studies seem to demonstrate a correlation between vitamin D insufficiency and decreased cognitive function. Beyond that, early research suggests that low vitamin D levels can contribute to cognitive decline as we age.\nIn short, those vitamin D supplements may help you stay sharp now and through the years.\nDrawbacks to vitamin D supplements\nAll of this said, you can certainly have too much of a good thing regarding vitamin D supplements.\nWhile experts recommend around 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day for most adults, taking 4,000 IU a day or more is considered unsafe, particularly for those supplementing without a known vitamin D deficiency. These high doses, especially over a longer period of time, are linked to:\nHypercalcemia\nTaking too much vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia, which means you have too much calcium in your blood. This can cause kidney stones and contribute to hardening in your blood vessels, lungs and heart.\nNausea and vomiting\nExcess vitamin D supplements can upset your stomach, leading to nausea and vomiting. In fact, if you recently started taking these supplements and have been feeling queasy, it could be a sign that you're overdoing it.\nDehydration\nTaking extremely high levels of vitamin D can cause toxicity. One of the primary symptoms of vitamin D toxicity is intense dehydration.\nConfusion\nWhile some of the biggest vitamin D supplement benefits center around your brain, too much can cause the opposite effect. People taking an excess amount often report disorientation and confusion.\nShould you take vitamin D supplements?\nScreening for Vitamin D is actually not currently recommended as evidence is \"insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults,\" per the US Preventive Services Task Force. Instead, doctors test more for diagnostic purposes -- for instance, if someone has a suspicious symptom. If you have concerns, consult your doctor.\nIf you are vitamin D-deficient, adjusting your diet may be enough to tip the scales. If you're still low in this key nutrient after eating more D-rich foods or live in a climate where you're not getting enough sunlight, supplements can help. Your body needs vitamin D to keep your bones strong, bolster your immune response and support your heart and brain health. Just make sure you keep an eye on your intake levels. Around 600 to 800 IU a day should be plenty, unless your doctor instructs you otherwise.\nCan you take too much vitamin D?\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, too much vitamin D can be harmful. This is known as vitamin D toxicity or hypervitaminosis D. Over 375 nmol/L or 150 ng/mL of vitamin D in your blood are considered very high levels and can cause the following:\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Muscle weakness\n- Confusion\n- Pain\n- Loss of appetite\n- Dehydration\n- Excessive urination\n- Thirst\n- Kidney stones\nExtremely high levels of vitamin D can lead to irregular heartbeat, kidney failure and death. This is typically caused by taking too many vitamin D supplements.\nFor adults aged 19 and up, for example, 100 mcg (4,000 IU) is the daily upper limit for vitamin D from all sources, including supplements, food and beverages. However, a doctor may recommend a different upper limit if you have a vitamin D deficiency."

      "text": "When it comes to kitchen gadgets, the king right now is the air fryer. It can easily make everything from potato skins, to chicken wings, bacon and even a whole chicken. While these handy devices cut down on time spent in the kitchen, they aren't perfect.\nEven if you use yours all the time, a few simple missteps could be holding you back. From overcrowding the basket to skipping regular cleanings, here's what you need to know to get the best results every time.\nRead more: This New Glass Air Fryer Is the Best We've Tested. Is It Worth the Price?\nAir fryers are simple to operate, but there are some steadfast rules to follow to ensure even cooking and maximum deliciousness from your next air fryer creation.\nTo help, we consulted the \"Air Fryer Queen,\" Cathy Yoder of Empowered Cooks, for her take on the most common mistakes you may be making with your air fryer.\n1. Underestimating your air fryer\nAn air fryer's undeniable superpower is in its ability to make frozen fried food taste and feel like it's actually been deep-fried. However, getting stuck in an air fryer rut is mistake No. 1 when it comes to using your air fryer.\n\"People get fixated on maybe two things like chicken nuggets and french fries,\" says Yoder. \"Just thinking beyond frying, if you can grill it or if you can bake it, in most cases, you can use your air fryer for it.\"\n2. Wasting time preheating\nThis is a hot take, as many air fryer recipes call for preheating. This may just mean running it empty for a few minutes to get its nonstick surface hot, or some models even have a preheat setting built in that can take up to five minutes. Yoder tested several recipes using the same air fryer both preheated and not, however, and found that preheating didn't offer significantly different results.\n\"It maybe made a difference of two minutes,\" she says. \"I pretty much only preheat if something has a very short cooking time.\"\nSince air frying is meant to be a time saver, minutes matter. Many air fryers that have a preheat setting typically don't have a built-in temperature monitor, so if you accidentally open the basket during the preheat cycle, it will start all over again from the beginning, which is really a waste of time. (I have experienced this firsthand. It is indeed very annoying.) Plus, opening the basket after preheating just lets all the hot air out anyway.\n3. Using nonstick cooking spray\nAir fryers are meant to reduce the need for oil, resulting in healthier dishes, but the temptation to use some nonstick cooking spray -- even though the interior of most air fryers has a nonstick coating -- is real. But it's a bad idea: \"It is said that some of those propellants in cooking sprays could damage the coating in the air fryer,\" says Yoder. And what's more: \"Go look at the ingredients in there. You don't want to ingest that.\"\nFor items such as raw veggies that could use a little help from oil, for a highly convenient option akin to cooking spray, Yoder recommends just buying a spray pump and filling it yourself.\nRead more: 7 Must-Try Air Fryer Accessories to Elevate Your Cooking Experience\n4. Using too much oil\nCertain vegetables that don't contain any fat to begin with may need a little support for their spin in the air fryer, but \"in most cases, it's not needed,\" says Yoder. Most meats will release enough of their own fat during the cooking process: chicken skin will get crispy in the air fryer from the fat of the meat alone. Oil can be employed in certain preparations, but should be used sparingly.\n\"It's handy if you have a rub or spices on the surface to help them adhere,\" says Yoder, \"and if you're adding a breading, for sure you've gotta have it on there so the flour doesn't dry out. But for all the frozen things, they are chockfull of fats so you don't really need to add any more.\"\n5. Using not enough oil or the wrong kind\nPatchy spots of dried flour, incinerated broccoli florets and dehydrated potatoes can all be victims of not enough oil in the air fryer. When it is called for, you do need to consider what kind of oil to use. Olive oil is the grab-and-go for most of us, but \"it has a lower smoke point,\" says Yoder, which can result in burnt flavors if you're air frying for a longer time at the top of its temperature range. \"I just recommend avocado oil. It has a nice high smoke point, and it's healthy.\"\n6. Overcrowding the basket\nAir fryers rely on air circulation.\n\"It's essentially just a mini convection oven,\" Yoder says, \"For crispy things you want air to be able to get around all of them.\" For that ideal, crispy, fried-like outcome, air needs to have access to every surface, which means adequate space between pieces, and oftentimes a single layer. \"In the marketing pictures you'll see an air fryer basket with mounds of fries coming out,\" says Yoder, which speaks to the generous capacity of certain models, but doesn't reveal their best usage.\nThose recipes that have more of a roasted than fried vibe can take a little more crowding, but you're still not filling to the brim. If the food actually touches the cooking mechanism that hovers above the basket, then you've potentially got a hygiene problem, so stick to a single layer in most cases.\nRead more: 7 Essential Tips for Using Your Air Fryer\n7. Not shaking or rotating the food\nIt's tempting to adopt a \"set it and forget it\" mindset when cooking with an air fryer, but the best outcomes rely on the smallest bit of participation.\n\"Shaking or rotating helps with even cooking,\" says Yoder, especially if you are packing the air fryer with more than just a single layer. Your fries, tots and poppers will better resemble actual bar food if you take a moment in the middle of the cycle to give a little shake, and your chicken parts will have appealing browning all over with a flip to the opposite side.\n8. Starting with wet food\nAn air fryer isn't the same as a slow cooker, and its air circulating mechanism works best on food that isn't wet. So if you're rinsing anything destined for the air fryer, whether vegetables or proteins, you're going to want to take a moment to dry those first.\n\"If it's wet, you're going to be steaming the exterior where we want to char,\" says Yoder, which is counterproductive to the whole air fryer ethos.\n9. Not cleaning it properly\nBecause of their largely nonstick nature, air fryers are generally easy to clean, and many have baskets that can be put directly in the dishwasher. It's possible, however, that your air fryer isn't as clean as you think it is, even if you've been diligently scrubbing the residue from the basket.\n\"Not wiping down the heating unit inside of the air fryer is a common mistake,\" says Yoder. Think about it -- there's cooking happening inside of that drawer, including the kind of splatter similar to when you're doing a stovetop saut\u00e9. And if you're committing the overcrowding mistake, it's possible that your food is coming in contact with the heating unit, as well as whatever splatter is lingering there.\n\"It can be scary,\" says Yoder, but it's not hard to correct. \"After you let your air fryer cool, just have a cloth or even a damp paper towel to keep the gunk from collecting.\""

      "text": "Air fryers have earned their spot on the counter thanks to crispy fries, juicy chicken wings, and fast weeknight meals. But just because an air fryer can handle a lot doesn't mean it can handle everything. Some foods simply don't play well with that intense blast of circulating heat, and the results can be messy, uneven, or downright disappointing.\nLightweight veggies like spinach or kale are a good example. Instead of cooking, they whirl around the basket and burn. Shellfish is another culprit, turning rubbery in minutes. Even plain chicken breast can come out dry if you don't prep it properly with breading or a marinade. Other foods drip, splatter, or cook in patches, leaving you with a cleanup headache and less-than-appetizing results.\nIf you'd rather avoid the trial and error, there are some foods best left out of the air fryer altogether. Here are nine ingredients that consistently fail the test and why they're better cooked another way.\n1. Boneless pork chops\nA perfectly cooked pork chop is a thing of beauty, but leaner cuts of the other white meat can dry out in a hurry. Bacon, bone-in pork chops and fattier cuts of swine can handle the air fryer, but lean, boneless pork chops and tenderloin tend to dry out when subjected to the blast of high heat. If you're going to use the air fryer to cook pork chops, do so at a lower temperature and use some fat to keep things from getting too dry.\n2. Spinach and leafy greens\nLeafy greens are a big \"no\" when it comes to air-fryer cooking. The hot convection air will crisp most leafy greens such as spinach, kale and chard far beyond anything you'd want to eat. Solid veggies including Brussels sprouts, squash and zucchini fare well in the air fryer, but leafy greens are best when sauteed, stewed or steamed.\n3. Steak and most cuts of beef\nSteak reheats well in the air fryer, but it's not an ideal place to cook it for the first time. Air fryer baskets get hot but not hot enough to give the outside of your steak a proper sear. I've tried cooking steaks in the air fryer before. Even fatty, forgiving steaks don't come out as well as when they're cooking on a hot plancha, cast-iron skillet or grill.\nThe exception to the beef rule is burgers. Ground beef won't get stringy, and the air fryer's intense heat allows you to get a crusty sear without overcooking the middle. Here's how to make a bacon cheeseburger in the air fryer.\nRead more: Best Meat Delivery Services\n4. Boneless chicken breasts\nChicken wings, thighs and any bone-in pieces are perfect candidates for the air fryer. Boneless chicken breasts don't have much fat and will dry out easily. Protect them with a little egg batter and breadcrumbs, and you'll be OK, but bare chicken breasts cooked in the air fryer often emerge dry or rubbery.\n5. Large cuts of any meat\nLarge cuts of beef, pork and lamb typically do best when cooked using a low-and-slow method such as braising or smoking. Avoid the air fryer with its hot blast of convection air when cooking larger cuts of meat and opt for the Dutch oven, slow cooker or pellet smoker.\n6. Naked broccoli\nIf you wrap your broccoli in foil, you can use the air fryer to roast it (quickly). If you leave it uncovered and exposed to the hot convection air and you'll end up with sizzled broccoli ends that are anything but delicious.\n7. Shellfish\nShellfish such as clams and mussels need liquid to cook without drying out. They are also easily overcooked, which can lead to a chewy, rubbery morsel that you don't want anywhere near your plate. Avoid the air fryer when cooking most shellfish.\n8. Most baked goods\nRead more: Best Seafood Delivery Services\nYou can certainly do some baking in the air fryer, but use caution since the air fryer's super convection behaves differently than a normal oven's convection heat.\nBaking a cake or batch of cookies in the air fryer using the time and temperature called for in a recipe will often result in an overcooked, dry or burnt result. When baking in an air fryer, use recipes that are specific to an air fryer and don't assume an oven recipe will translate.\n9. Large casseroles or layered pasta\nBecause the air fryer cooks fast and the heat comes from above, deep casseroles and layered lasagnas may not cook all the way through before burning on top. If you are going to use the air fryer, set it to bake or a lower temperature than you would use to cook chicken wings or hot dogs.\nIf you're looking for a great air fryer, here are CNET's top-rated models for 2025.
