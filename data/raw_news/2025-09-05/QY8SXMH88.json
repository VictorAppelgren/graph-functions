The company announced in an Aug. 26 press release that Das would begin that role Tuesday (Sept. 2), would report to McDonald and would join the senior leadership team.\n\n\u201cThis is a new role at Lululemon and represents and elevated mandate to enable AI and technology to help expedite our product innovation process, improve our agility and speed to market, and increase personalization across our guest experience,\u201d McDonald said during the call.\n\nDuring the quarter ended Aug. 3, Lululemon saw its Americas comparable sales decrease 4% year over year while its international comparable sales increased 15%. Overall, the firm\u2019s comparable sales increased 1% year over year, according to a Tuesday earnings release.\n\nMcDonald attributed the decline in the Americas business to the company letting its product life cycles run too long, becoming too predictable and missing opportunities to create new trends. He added this happened at a time when there has been an industrywide decline in the market for premium athletic wear in the U.S.\n\n\u201cConsumers are spending less on apparel overall, spending less on performance activewear, and are being more selective in their purchases, seeking out truly new styles,\u201d McDonald said during the call. \u201cThis makes it even more important that we meet and exceed the expectations of our guests.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the company\u2019s go-to-market process failed in some cases to meet customer demand for new styles introduced by the company, leaving some customers disappointed, McDonald said.\n\nMoving ahead, the company plans to increase the share of new styles among its overall assortment from the current 23% to 35% by next spring, McDonald said. It is also working to accelerate its design capabilities and its go-to-market process.\n\nReferring to the company\u2019s new chief AI and technology officer, McDonald said: \u201cI\u2019m excited Ranju has joined us, and I look forward to partnering with him as he and our technology teams implement and accelerate these strategies.\u201d",

      "text": "Revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or increased 6% on a constant dollar basis\nComparable sales increased 1%\nDiluted EPS of $3.10\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nlululemon athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on August 3, 2025.\nCalvin McDonald, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"While we continued to see positive momentum overall in our international regions in the second quarter, we are disappointed with our U.S. business results and aspects of our product execution. We have closely assessed the drivers of our underperformance and are continuing to take the necessary actions to strengthen our merchandise mix and accelerate our business. We feel confident in the opportunity ahead and plans we have in place to drive long-term growth.\"\nFor the second quarter of 2025, compared to the second quarter of 2024:\n-\nNet revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or increased 6% on a constant dollar basis.\n- Americas net revenue increased 1%.\n-\nInternational net revenue increased 22%, or 20% on a constant dollar basis.\n-\nComparable sales increased 1%.\n- Americas comparable sales decreased 4%, or 3% on a constant dollar basis.\n-\nInternational comparable sales increased 15%, or 13% on a constant dollar basis.\n-\nGross profit increased 5% to $1.5 billion and gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 58.5%.\n-\nIncome from operations decreased 3% to $523.8 million and operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%.\n-\nThe effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 was 30.5% compared to 29.6% for the second quarter of 2024.\n-\nDiluted earnings per share were $3.10 compared to $3.15 in the second quarter of 2024.\n-\nThe Company repurchased 1.1 million of its shares for a cost of $278.5 million.\n-\nThe Company added 14 net new company-operated stores during the second quarter, ending with 784 stores.\nMeghan Frank, Chief Financial Officer, stated: \"In the second quarter, we exceeded expectations on EPS, but revenue fell short of our guidance driven predominantly by our U.S. business. We are also navigating industry-wide challenges, including higher tariff rates. In light of these dynamics, we are revising our full year outlook. As we begin the back half of the year, our brand and balance sheet remain strong, and we will continue to exercise financial discipline and strategically invest in our growth potential.\"\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nThe Company ended the second quarter of 2025 with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the capacity under its committed revolving credit facility was $393.2 million.\nInventories at the end of the second quarter of 2025 increased 21% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. On a unit basis, inventories increased 13%.\n2025 Outlook\nFor the third quarter of 2025, the Company expects net revenue to be in the range of $2.470 billion to $2.500 billion, representing growth of 3% to 4%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.23 for the quarter. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 30.5%.\nFor 2025, the Company now expects net revenue to be in the range of $10.850 billion to $11.000 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4%, or 4% to 6% excluding the 53rd week of 2024. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $12.77 to $12.97 for the year. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 30%.\nThe guidance for 2025 includes an estimated reduction in gross profit of approximately $240 million, net of currently anticipated mitigation efforts, including vendor savings, and pricing actions, reflecting our current assumptions about higher levels of tariffs on imports into the United States and the removal of the de minimis exemption. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates if tariff rates, sourcing savings, consumer demand, or the timing of regulatory changes vary from our current assumptions, or if our mitigation initiatives are less effective than currently expected.\nThe guidance does not reflect potential future repurchases of the Company's shares.\nThe guidance and outlook forward-looking statements made in this press release are based on management's expectations as of the date of this press release and do not incorporate future unknown impacts, including tariffs and macroeconomic trends. The Company undertakes no duty to update or to continue to provide information with respect to any forward-looking statements or risk factors, whether as a result of new information or future events or circumstances or otherwise. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those stated below.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss second quarter results is scheduled for today, September 4, 2025, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Those interested in participating in the call are invited to dial 1-833-752-3550 or 1-647-846-8290, if calling internationally, approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.

For more information, visit lululemon.com.\nShifted Calendar for Comparable Sales\nDue to the 53rd week in 2024, comparable sales are calculated on a one-week shifted basis such that the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2025 is compared to the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2024 rather than July 28, 2024.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report certain financial metrics on a constant dollar basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. The Company provides constant dollar changes in its results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses constant currency metrics internally when reviewing and assessing financial performance.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31st of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2024 was a 53-week year while 2025 will be a 52-week year. The expected net revenue increase excluding the 53rd week excludes the net revenue for the 53rd week of 2024. This enables an evaluation of the expected year-over-year increase in net revenue based on 52 weeks in each year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not a substitute for, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

These forward-looking statements also include the Company's guidance and outlook statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations but they involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation: the Company's ability to maintain the value and reputation of its brand; its highly competitive market and increasing competition; its ability to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and differentiated products; the acceptability of its products to guests; increasing costs and decreasing selling prices; its ability to accurately forecast guest demand for its products; its ability to expand in light of its limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets and new product categories; its ability to manage its growth and the increased complexity of its business effectively; changes in consumer shopping preferences and shifts in distribution channels; its leasing of retail and distribution space; its ability to attract, manage, and retain highly qualified individuals; seasonality; its ability to safeguard against security breaches with respect to its technology systems; its compliance with privacy and data protection laws; any material disruption of its information systems; its ability to have technology-based systems function effectively and grow its e-commerce business globally; changes to U.S. tariff and customs policy, including the elimination of the de minimis exemption; macroeconomic volatility, inflationary pressures, and shifts in consumer sentiment; global political and economic instability and related trade actions; changes to tariffs, customs rules, and other trade restrictions; changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities; its ability to comply with trade and other regulations; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; global or regional health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and related government, private sector, and individual consumer responsive actions; disruptions of its supply chain; its reliance on a relatively small number of vendors to supply and manufacture a significant portion of its products; suppliers or manufacturers not complying with its Vendor Code of Ethics or applicable laws; fluctuating costs of raw materials; its ability to deliver its products to the market and to meet guest expectations if it has problems with its distribution system; increasing labor costs and other factors associated with the production of its products in South Asia and South East Asia; imitation by its competitors; its ability to protect its intellectual property rights; conflicting trademarks and patents and the prevention of sale of certain products; climate change and related pressures; heightened scrutiny and legal risks from competing pressures regarding ESG; its exposure to various types of litigation; and other risks and uncertainties set out in filings made from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov, including, without limitation, its most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
