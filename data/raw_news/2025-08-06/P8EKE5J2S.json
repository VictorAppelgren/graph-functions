  "title": "Trump\u2019s special envoy will bring back only humiliation from his meeting with Putin",
  "description": "Steve Witkoff - the president\u2019s international diplomatic Mr Fixit - has failed to bring peace to the Middle East or deliver on Trump\u2019s boast to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, writes world affairs editor Sam Kiley",
  "content": "Arriving in Moscow ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cceasefire or suffer\u201d Friday deadline for the Kremlin, Steve Witkoff may wonder what he\u2019s there for. To threaten? Reassure? Or repeat the cooing craven performances he\u2019s shown Vladimir Putin in the past?\n\nThe US president has been taking a much tougher line, in public, when it comes to getting Russia to wind down its war against Ukraine since the blatantly pro-Putin stand of his earlier presidency.\n\nIf Russia doesn\u2019t join ceasefire discussions by Friday, Trump has threatened more sanctions against Moscow.\n\nAnd after Dmitri Medvedev, deputy director of Russia\u2019s security council and the Kremlin\u2019s in-house troll, threatened unspecified \u201cfurther steps\u201d following Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the defunct Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the US president announced he was moving two nuclear strike submarines to threaten Moscow.\n\nBoth this and Friday\u2019s deadline are empty and performative.\n\nRussia\u2019s trade with the US is close to zero anyway, after earlier sanctions saw it plummet. More bilateral throttling won\u2019t make any difference.\n\nAnd the whole point of the US nuclear deterrent is that it has strike capability against Russia 24/7 from submarines that prowl the oceans, in secret, armed with long range nuclear missiles \u2013 they don\u2019t need to be on Putin\u2019s door step to rattle his cage.\n\nWitkoff, a former property tycoon, was appointed Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy and has since enjoyed a role as the president\u2019s international diplomatic Mr Fixit. But he\u2019s failed to bring any peace to the Middle East and failed to deliver on Trump\u2019s boast to end the war in Ukraine in \u201c24 hours\u201d.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly agreed to a ceasefire or talks to achieve one. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of even a temporary suspension of fighting and has continued to make small gains in its efforts to capture eastern Ukraine.\n\nThis has prompted Trump to call out Putin for his \u201cbullshit\u201d.\n\nIf Trump is sincere in putting pressure on Russia economically, then he will have to make good on his threats to impose sanctions on countries that import Russian fossil fuels.\n\nRussia funds its war in Ukraine with about $500 million worth of fossil fuel sales every day. The European Union has cut imports from Russia severely. But since 2022, the EU has imported close to \u20ac300 billion of Russian goods \u2013 mostly gas.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has seen oil imports from Russia surge. Last year India imported $65.7 billion worth of goods, mostly oil, from Russia and Delhi insists that in doing so India is bringing stability to the world oil market.\n\nIn response, Trump has threatened India with more sanctions, along with China, another big Russian importer.\n\nTo offset the potential surge in oil prices this could bring, Gulf countries have recently increased their oil production.\n\n\u201cIf energy goes down enough, Putin is going to stop killing people,\u201d Trump said in an interview on CNBC this week. \u201cIf you get energy down, another $10 a barrel, he's going to have no choice because his economy stinks.\u201d\n\nSo, Trump is angry with Putin.\n\nBut not angry enough to do anything that could affect Putin\u2019s main priority \u2013 which is to secure the Ukrainian provinces of Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia and continue to hold Crimea.\n\nAll this year he has played Trump as a patsy. Russia\u2019s president has exploited the baffling admiration the US president holds for him to undermine military and intelligence support for Kyiv.\n\nHe has seen Trump act in Russia\u2019s interests by weakening the Nato alliance and insisting that Ukraine accept most of Moscow\u2019s terms for any future peace deal ahead of talks.\n\nOn top of that, it feels like Witkoff has been reduced to a simpering Kremlin sycophant. The property mogul accidentally delivered Putin\u2019s spooks a trove of intelligence data by using his unsecured personal mobile phone on previous trips to Moscow and during America\u2019s air attacks against the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nPutin has invaded Ukraine. His political opponents die in jails, rivals and critics fall out of windows and others risk dying mysteriously from gunshot wounds or being poisoned with nerve gas. But Witkoff said after a previous trip to Moscow that Putin\u2019s \u201cnot a bad guy\u201d and that he is \u201csuper smart\u201d.\n\nThose smarts extend to the very obvious truth that Trump is easily flattered. In an interview he gave in March after visiting Putin, and failing to get a ceasefire agreement, Witkoff could not name the four provinces that Russia\u2019s president wanted to capture.\n\nBut he did give Putin a PR boost with his boss by saying: \u201cHe gave me a beautiful portrait of Trump he had commissioned from a leading Russian artist and asked me to bring it back to the White House. Trump was clearly touched by it. This is the kind of connection that we\u2019ve been able to re-establish through, by the way, a simple word called communication.\u201d\n\nMoscow has given every indication that Witkoff\u2019s mission will fail and be ignored. Putin may now believe that he is closer to winning the territory he wants in Ukraine.\n\nHe is, Ukraine believes, forming 10 new army divisions to fight in Ukraine this year. That\u2019s at least 100,000 more men \u2013 30,000 more than the whole of the British army.\n\nIt is not clear why Trump has favoured Putin over Ukraine for so long. It seems his latest peevish remarks and threats do not amount to a change of attitude but is the pouting of a friend spurned.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign that the US is going to help Ukraine win by supplying more weapons and fulsome support for Europe\u2019s youngest democracy.\n\nAnd Putin knows it will be a long time before Trump stops preening himself in front of the \u201cbeautiful\u201d Russian portrait showing a heroic, defiant and blood spattered Trump painted in a modern, but mistakenly Soviet Realist style.",

      "text": "Trump\u2019s clumsy nuclear rhetoric shows he still has no strategy to deal with Putin\nWhatever Trump\u2019s latest verbal salvo at Moscow may be, there\u2019s one thing it isn\u2019t: a strategy for dealing with Russia, let alone a sensible or coherent one, says Keir Giles\nUS president Donald Trump claims to have ordered a redeployment of nuclear submarines in response to threatening language from Moscow. Predictably, the US and global media have reacted excitedly, without always stopping to consider what, if anything, has happened \u2013 and why.\nAs with Trump\u2019s other comments on Russia, the vague statement raised more questions than answers. Trump claimed he ordered two nuclear submarines (without specifying whether that meant nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered) to be positioned \u201cin the appropriate regions\u201d (without explaining why they would have been somewhere inappropriate to start with).\nAll of which came in response to a taunt containing a reference to The Walking Dead and a laughing emoji on social media from Dmitry Medvedev, once president of Russia but now enjoying a public persona more akin to a court jester.\nTrump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems confident that Medvedev is \u201cnot a relevant player in Russian politics\u201d, and yet his trolling has supposedly triggered a change in American nuclear posture. As with so much else in Trumpworld, the explanation probably lies elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s verbal outbursts criticising Moscow have become more frequent recently \u2013 and that this marks a startling turnaround from his earlier inclination to blame Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia having invaded his country.\nBut despite the latest claims, there\u2019s still no indication that Trump is willing to follow words with meaningful action.\nThe latest arbitrary deadline for Vladimir Putin to take unspecified action towards ending Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, followed by an equally arbitrary bringing forward of the deadline, suggests there is no coherent plan for putting pressure on Moscow. Instead, when setting dates, Trump appears to be plucking random numbers from the air and then changing them without warning, in the same manner as when setting the United States\u2019s global trade policy.\nWith the submarine comment, Trump has discovered another means of appearing \u201ctough on Russia\u201d without actually doing anything that would be of any concern to Moscow \u2013 and there are plenty of other reasons why he might be seeking headlines that suggest he is taking a firmer line with Putin.\nNamely, that Trump needs distractions at the moment. His best efforts to keep his relationship with sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell out of the headlines, and prevent the release of any material from their criminal case that may implicate Trump personally, have been counterproductive.\nAnd the effects of his economic policies are starting to dawn on even those sections of the American public that still believe he has their best interests at heart.\nWith prices rising rapidly amid uncertainty triggered by Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff policy, it is becoming harder to maintain upbeat messaging on the economy \u2013 and last week also saw the release of employment statistics so bad that Trump felt compelled to shoot the messenger who delivered them, by firing the head of the Bureau of Labour Statistics.\nThis, and moving submarines in response to an insult from a Russian politician who throws them for a living, unfortunately fits Trump\u2019s style of governing through outbursts and rants in response to perceived slights more than through clear and considered policy.\nBut whatever the reasons for that, the net effect is that once again, Trump has taken every possible step to pressure Russia short of actually doing something.\nIn fact, he has succeeded in preventing action that Russia would dislike: Trump\u2019s notional deadline for Putin to do something successfully headed off an initiative by Senate Republicans to push through a package of secondary sanctions that would have caused genuine headaches for Moscow, not to mention a proposal for sanctions on China for supporting Russia\u2019s war.\nThat\u2019s one reason among many why Russia felt the Trump submarine claim, which, if made by any other US president, would have been a significant and dramatic move, could be calmly ignored.\nWhatever Trump\u2019s latest verbal salvo at Moscow may be, there\u2019s one thing it isn\u2019t: a strategy for dealing with Russia, let alone a sensible or coherent one. Vladimir Putin and those around him will no doubt continue to watch Trump\u2019s moves closely \u2013 but perhaps as much out of curiosity as out of concern as to what he will do next.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Arms race fears as Putin says Russia is no longer bound by missile treaty\nRussia's move follows Trump's nuclear messaging\nRussia has declared that it no longer considers itself bound by a self-imposed moratorium on the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race as tensions between Moscow and Washington rise again over Ukraine.\nIn a statement Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry linked the decision to efforts by the U.S. and its allies to develop intermediate range weapons and preparations for their deployment in Europe and other parts of the world. It specifically cited U.S. plans to deploy Typhoon and Dark Eagle missiles in Germany starting next year.\nThe ministry noted that such actions by the U.S. and its allies create \u201cdestabilizing missile potentials\" near Russia, creating a \"direct threat to the security of our country\u201d and carry \u201csignificant harmful consequences for regional and global stability, including a dangerous escalation of tensions between nuclear powers.\u201d\nIt didn't say what specific moves the Kremlin might take, but President Vladimir Putin has previously announced that Moscow was planning to deploy its new Oreshnik missiles on the territory of its neighbor and ally Belarus later this year.\nAsked where and when Russia could potentially deploy intermediate-range weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that it's not something to be announced in advance.\n\u201cRussia no longer has any limitations, Russia no longer considers itself to be constrained by anything,\u201d Peskov told reporters. \u201cTherefore Russia believes it has the right to take respective steps if necessary.\u201d\n\u201cDecisions on specific parameters of response measures will be made by the leadership of the Russian Federation based on an interdepartmental analysis of the scale of deployment of American and other Western land-based intermediate-range missiles, as well as the development of the overall situation in the area of international security and strategic stability,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.\nThe Russian statement follows President Donald Trump's announcement Friday that he\u2019s ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines \u201cbased on the highly provocative statements\u201d of Dmitry Medvedev, who was president in 2008-12 to allow Putin, bound by term limits, to later return to the office. Trump's statement came as his deadline for the Kremlin to reach a peace deal in Ukraine approaches later this week.\nTrump said he was alarmed by Medvedev\u2019s attitude. Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council chaired by Putin, has apparently sought to curry favor with his mentor by making provocative statements and frequently lobbing nuclear threats. Last week. he responded to Trump's deadline for Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine or face sanctions by warning him against \u201cplaying the ultimatum game with Russia\u201d and declaring that \u201ceach new ultimatum is a threat and a step toward war.\u201d\nMedvedev also commented on the Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement, describing Moscow's withdrawal from the moratorium as \u201cthe result of NATO countries\u2019 anti-Russian policy.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cExpect further steps.\u201d\nINF treaty abandoned in 2019\nIntermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such land-based weapons were banned under the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Washington and Moscow abandoned the pact in 2019, accusing each other of violations, but Moscow declared its self-imposed moratorium on their deployment until the U.S. makes such a move.\nThe collapse of the INF Treaty has stoked fears of a replay of a Cold War-era European missile crisis, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union both deployed intermediate-range missiles on the continent in the 1980s. Such weapons are seen as particularly destabilizing because they take less time to reach targets, compared with intercontinental ballistic missiles, leaving no time for decision-makers and raising the likelihood of a global nuclear conflict over a false launch warning.\nRussia\u2019s missile forces chief has declared that the new Oreshnik intermediate range missile, which Russia first used against Ukraine in November, has a range to reach all of Europe. Oreshnik can carry conventional or nuclear warheads.\nPutin has praised the Oreshnik\u2019s capabilities, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at speeds up to Mach 10 are immune to being intercepted and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.\nPutin has warned the West that Moscow could use it against Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia."
