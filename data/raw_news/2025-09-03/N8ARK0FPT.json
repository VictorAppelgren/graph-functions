  "title": "How the Google ruling reshapes search, AI, and defaults",
  "description": "Exclusivity is out, data-sharing is in, but paid default lives on. U.S. v. Google didn\u2019t rip up the roads of the web; it put meters on the on-ramps",
  "content": "The government tried to turn Google into a cautionary tale. Instead, Judge Amit P. Mehta turned it into a public utility. Last night, his remedial order in the long-running U.S. v. Google antitrust case banned exclusive contracts for Search, Chrome, Assistant, and Gemini \u2014 no more locking up the on-ramps of the internet. But it also left the cash lanes wide open: Google can keep paying to be the default and doesn\u2019t have to spin off its browser, Apple can keep charging rent for the privilege, and the rest of the ecosystem can keep lining up for their slice of the toll. The homepage, in other words, isn\u2019t a page anymore; it\u2019s the tollbooth where discovery begins.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock shoot higher \u2014 about 8.5% by 11:30 a.m. ET; Apple gained a few percent (2.8%) just for keeping its Google annuity intact. Wedbush analysts wrote immediately following the ruling that the government \u201cfolds like [a] cheap suit.\u201d There were victory laps all around. \u201cThis is a monster win for Cupertino, and for Google it's a home run ruling that removes a huge overhang on the stock,\u201d Wedbush analysts led by tech bull Dan Ives cheered in a Wednesday analyst note, sounding more like a color commentator calling a walk-off than a sell-sider. \u201cWhile in theory Google is barred from \u2018exclusive deals\u2019 for search this now lays the groundwork for Apple to continue its deal and ultimately likely double down on more AI related partnership with Google Gemini down the road.\u201d\n\nMehta didn\u2019t cancel those payments; he just stripped away the exclusivity \u2014 less smashing a monopoly and more as converting it to metered parking. Apple still controls the on-ramp, but now the rent can be repriced every year and, in theory, collected from more than one bidder. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring estimated in a Wednesday note that Apple already takes in over $25 billion annually from Google\u2019s search deal at 95%-plus margins. With exclusivity gone, Cupertino can run an annual auction across Safari, Spotlight, and Siri, playing Google, Microsoft, and maybe even Perplexity off each other like landlords deciding which caf\u00e9 gets the scenic view.\n\nOf course, critics see through the sugar high. DuckDuckGo\u2019s Gabriel Weinberg warned on X that the order won\u2019t \u201cforce the changes necessary\u201d to end Google\u2019s stranglehold, predicting \u201cconsumers will continue to suffer\u201d and saying that \u201cCongress should now step in to swiftly make Google do the thing it fears the most: compete on a level playing field.\u201d Epic Games\u2019 Tim Sweeney posted on X that Google lost the liability phase but \u201cresoundingly\u201d won the remedies \u2014 \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said \u2014 likening the ruling to a convicted bank robber sentenced to probation where he can \u201ccontinue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers.\u201d (Sweeney also amplified a post from Matt Stoller, a researcher at the American Economic Liberties Project, that said \u201cIn America, crime pays. Here\u2019s a quick and dirty summary of a judge letting Google get away with monopoly.\u201d) And Brave Software CEO Brendan Eich, who co-founded Mozilla and Firefox and created JavaScript, said in a reply on X that the ruling left monetization untouched: \u201cWe can\u2019t beat Google the convicted monopoly abuser on payment.\u201d\n\nIn practice, the remedy reads less like a coup and more like a policy memo. Who qualifies? How fast is the feed? How do you balance freshness with privacy? Lucinda Guthrie, the head of M&A data and intelligence platform Mergermarket said, \u201cThe question is what will make these competitors \u2018qualified\u2019 For a genuine new entrant in the AI search market, this data could be transformative, but will they be allowed access to it?\u201d If the bar is high \u2014 ironclad security, capital requirements, service-level audits \u2014 the sandbox could become a velvet-rope club. Too low, and Google could cry regulatory overreach.\n\nEven Google\u2019s own statement, at times, betrayed ambivalence. \u201cThe Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\u201d the company said, adding that it had \u201cconcerns\u201d about privacy. Of course it does: The world\u2019s best retrieval engine now has to decide how much of its map to hand over without giving away the compass. Call this metered moat a search commons or call it compliance theater, but the fact is that the U.S. has chosen to regulate search like infrastructure \u2014 service levels, eligibility rules, and audits. The EU still prefers ceremonies such as choice screens. But Washington is now in the business of plumbing.\n\nOf course, Google\u2019s fight isn\u2019t entirely over; the epilogue is already in motion. The company still has an appeal pending on last year\u2019s liability ruling that branded it an illegal monopolist, plus a fresh DOJ case over its search advertising empire, not to mention a full docket of Brussels investigations that make Washington\u2019s remedies look like probation terms. Mergermarket\u2019s Guthrie said, \u201cThe tussle with antitrust enforcers is not over yet.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s order may have metered the tollbooth, but the traffic cops are still circling the block.\n\nAnd even the remedies themselves are hardly set in stone. Brave\u2019s Eich pointed out that the devil isn\u2019t in the decision, it\u2019s in the committees; key revenue-sharing caps and compliance rules have been punted to a technical panel with wide discretion. He blasted the vagueness in a series of posts, writing on X, \u201cWhat is going on, comrades?\u201d and calling the whole setup \u201cSovietnik.\u201d In other words, the next phase of the Google case won\u2019t just be fought in appellate courts; it will be fought in the weeds \u2014 rule-writing, cap-setting, and backroom discretion that could turn \u201ccompetition\u201d into another bureaucratic parlor game.",

      "text": "Related Content\nSpeech\nColumbus\nPress Release\nToday, the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division won significant remedies in its monopolization case against Google in online search. In United States et al. v. Google, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia prohibited Google from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and the Gemini app; ordered Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals; and ordered Google to offer search and search text ads syndication services to enable rivals and potential rivals to compete.\nThe court\u2019s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade. The ruling also recognizes the need to prevent Google from using the same anticompetitive tactics for its GenAI products as it used to monopolize the search market, and the remedies will reach GenAI technologies and companies.\n\u201cThis decision marks an important step forward in the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing fight to protect American consumers. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we will continue our legal efforts to hold companies accountable for monopolistic practices,\u201d said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.\n\u201cThe first Trump administration sued Google to restore competition for millions of Americans subjected to Google\u2019s monopoly abuses. Today, the second Trump administration has won a remedy to do just that,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cWe will continue to review the opinion to consider the Department\u2019s options and next steps regarding seeking additional relief. I am immensely proud of the dedicated public servants of the Antitrust Division and their tireless work on this case alongside our state partners.\u201d\nFiled in President Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department\u2019s case against the Google search monopoly has unified the country. The Department\u2019s original filing in October 2020 was joined by eleven State Attorneys General. Additional states filed a related action as the case progressed, and ultimately, the United States was joined in pursuing the remedies ordered today by 49 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia.\nUnder the remedies ordered today, Google will be barred from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and the Gemini app. Google cannot enter or maintain agreements that (1) condition the licensing of any Google application on the distribution, preloading, or placement of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, or the Gemini app anywhere on a device; (2) condition the receipt of revenue share payments for the placement of one Google application on the placement of another Google application; or (3) condition the receipt of revenue share payments on maintaining Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, or the Gemini app on any device, browser, or search access point for more than one year; or (4) prohibit any partner from simultaneously distributing any other GSE, browser, or GenAI product.\nIn addition, Google will have to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to certain competitors. Google will also be required to offer certain competitors search and search text ads syndication services, which will open up the market by enabling rivals and potential rivals to deliver high-quality search results and ads and compete with Google as they develop their own capacity.\nFor years, Google accounted for approximately 90 percent of all search queries in the United States, and Google used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in search and search advertising. Google entered into a series of exclusionary agreements that collectively locked up the primary avenues through which users access online search, requiring that Google be the preset default general search engine on billions of mobile devices and computers and, in many cases, prohibiting preinstallation of a competitor. Using its monopoly profits, Google bought preferential treatment for its search engine and created a self-reinforcing cycle of monopolization \u2014 shutting out potential competitors, reducing innovation, and taking choice away from American consumers.\nThe Department of Justice and the states proved that Google broke the law over the course of a bench trial that started in September 2023 and lasted nine weeks. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia released a 277-page opinion, concluding that \u201cGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly\u201d in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Today\u2019s decision follows a 15-day remedies trial in May 2025."

The decision keeps Google\u2019s paid default revenue streams intact\u2014Apple and other partners can still collect significant fees\u2014while opening the market to rivals through data sharing and syndication. The order has boosted Alphabet\u2019s stock and reinforced Apple\u2019s position, but critics argue it falls short of fully dismantling Google\u2019s dominance and may require further regulatory action.",
