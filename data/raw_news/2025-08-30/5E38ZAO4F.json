  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Friday closed down by -0.64%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down by -0.20%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down by -1.22%. September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.68%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.31%.\n\nStock indexes retreated on Friday, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks. Marvell Technology tumbled more than -18% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates. Also, Dell Technologies fell more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers.\n\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan's US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower. Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months. Also, the University of Michigan's inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller and San Francisco Fed President Daly were bullish for stocks as they signaled their support for Fed rate cuts.\n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months, and right on expectations. July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\n\nThe University of Michigan Aug 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised slightly lower by -0.1 to 4.8%, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. He said, \"With underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly signaled she's open to lower interest rates soon, saying, \"It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy.\" She added that tariff-related price increases \"will be a one-off\" and it \"will take time before we know that for certain, but we can't wait for perfect certainty without risking harm to the labor market.\"\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and closed down -0.83%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) Friday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.4 bp to 4.227%.\n\nSep T-notes posted modest losses on Friday after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y. T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. Also, the University of Michigan's Aug inflation expectations were revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher. The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.9 bp to 2.724%. 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.2 bp to 4.722%.\n\nThe ECB's July 1-year CPI expectations remained unchanged from June at +2.6%, which is stronger than the expected +2.5%. The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\n\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\n\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nChipmakers sold off on Friday, led by an -18% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL) to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after it reported Q2 data center revenue of $1.49 billion, below the consensus of $1.52 billion. Also, Lam Research (LRCX) closed down more than -4%, and Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed down more than -3%. In addition, ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp (KLAC), Intel (INTC), ON Semiconductor Corp (ON), and Micron Technology (MU) all closed down by more than 2%.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) closed down more than -8% to lead losers in the S&P 500, and makers of computer hardware are lower after reporting Q2 operating income of $2.28 billion, below the consensus of $2.30 billion. Also, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) closed down more than -5% and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) closed down more than -2%.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) closed down more than -7% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 net sales after it warned of a potential pullback by consumers.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) closed down more than -3% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials after warning that it faces a larger-than-anticipated tariff headwind of as much as $1.8 billion this year.\n\nDollar General (DG) closed down more than -2% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS after it said it expects \"more pressure\" in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in Q3 and warned of tougher gross margin comparison in Q4.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks fell Friday after the price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) dropped more than -3% to a 7-week low. As a result, Galaxy Digital (GLXY) closed down more than -4%, and Coinbase Global (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) closed down more than -1%.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) closed up more than +9% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 net revenue of $1.76 billion, better than the consensus of $1.72 billion, and forecasting Q3 revenue of $180 billion-$1.81 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.77 billion.\n\nAmbarella (AMBA) closed up more than +16% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 15 cents, well above the consensus of 6 cents, and raising its 2026 revenue growth estimate to 31%-35% from a May forecast of +19%-25%.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) closed up more than +10% after reporting Q4 revenue of $876.4 million, well above the consensus of $838.6 million.\n\nSentinelOne (S) closed up more than +6% after raising its 2026 revenue forecast to $998 million-$1 billion from a previous forecast of $996 million-$1 billion.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) closed up more than +5% after PepsiCo increased its stake in the company to approximately 11% on an as-converted basis and will nominate an additional director to serve on Celsius Holdings' board of directors.\n\nManaged healthcare stocks gained on Friday.

  "summary": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) and Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down by -0.64%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) also fell by -1.22%. Tech stocks, including Marvell Technology and Dell Technologies, saw their shares drop more than -18% due to disappointing Q2 data center revenue and lower profit margins. The August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and the University of Michigan's US consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower. Despite these losses, US consumer demand remains strong, with July personal spending rising by the most in four months and inflation pressures rising. Fed Governor Christopher Waller and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly supported the idea of a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates further rate cuts over the next three to six months. The chances for a second -25 bp rate cut are currently at 88% and are discounting the chances at 55-29%.",

Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Relative Strength Index is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the Relative Strength is above 80, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is above 80%. The market is in extreme overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 80' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 80%. The market has entered extreme overbought territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 80' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 80%. The market has dropped from extreme overbought territory, indicating a possible trend reversal. \"\n- If the Relative Strength is above 70, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is above 70%. The market is in overbought territory. Watch for a potential trend reversal.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 70' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 70%. The market has entered overbought territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 70' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 70%. The market has dropped from overbought territory. Beware of a potential mean reversion.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 50' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 50%. The market is indicating support for a bullish trend.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 50' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 50%. The market is indicating support for a bearish trend.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 30' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 30%. The market has bounced from oversold territory. Beware of a potential mean reversion.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 30' with today's session, the following displays: \" Relative Strength just crossed below 30%. The market has entered oversold territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength is below 30, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is below 30%. The market is in oversold territory. Watch for a potential trend reversal.\"\n-\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 20' with today's session, the following displays: \" Relative Strength just crossed above 20%. The market has bounced from extreme oversold territory, indicating a possible trend reversal.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 20' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 20%. The market has entered extreme territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength is below 20, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is below 20%. The market is in extreme oversold territory.

Its slope indicates the strength of the trend. Longer averages are used to identify longer-term trends. Shorter averages are used to identify shorter-term trends. Many trading systems utilize moving averages as independent variables and market analysts frequently use moving averages to confirm technical breakouts.\nWhen prices are rising they are usually above the average. This is to be expected since the average includes data from the previous, lower priced days. As long as prices remain above the average there is strength in the market."

  "argos_summary": "The S&P 500 fell 0.64%, Nasdaq 1.22% and Dow 0.20% on Friday, led by a sharp selloff in tech names such as Marvell and Dell amid weaker Q2 data. Market weakness was reinforced by a lower-than\u2011expected August MNI Chicago PMI, revised\u2011down Michigan consumer sentiment, and sticky core PCE inflation, though July personal spending rose and Michigan inflation expectations eased, providing some support. Fed officials Waller and Daly signaled dovish policy, boosting expectations of a 25\u2011bp rate cut at the September FOMC and further cuts in the next 3\u20136 months, which is reflected in futures pricing. Tariff tensions grew with Trump threatening new tech and steel/aluminum duties, while U.S. 10\u2011year yields edged up to 4.23% amid these mixed signals.
