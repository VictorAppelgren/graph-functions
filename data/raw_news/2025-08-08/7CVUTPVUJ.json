CAROL: WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO THE MARKET TRADE. WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FANNIE AND FREDDIE SOARING, IS AN IPO COMING? MICHAEL MCKEE WILL BE WITH US IN JUST A MOMENT. WE MENTIONED GEOPOLITICS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS PRETTY BUSY, LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SOME ANNOUNCEMENT. WE ARE IN DIRECT -- WE ARE WONDERING DOES THE U.S., RUSSIA, AND UKRAINE DO A DEAL? JESS: THE PORK WORKS CEO WILL JOIN US. MARK MAHANEY JOINS US. NONE OUT OF THE -- NONE OTHER THAN CHIPS. CAROL: SO MANY OF THE COMPANIES THAT REPORTED EARNINGS THIS WEEK , THE MAG SEVEN, HE COVERS THEM ALL. FIRST UP, LET'S GET TO THE TRADE ON THIS FRIDAY. LET'S TURN THINGS OVER TO CHARLIE PELLETT CHARLIE: RED HEADLINE ON THE BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL SERVICE, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL CLARIFY MISINFORMATION ON GOLD TARIFFS. THE GOLD ORDER TO BE POSTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ACCORDING TO A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL. THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHED. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL CLARIFY MISINFORMATION OM -- ON GOLD TARIFFS. KEEP IT WITH BLOOMBERG AND AS WE GET THE DETAILS WE WILL PASS THEM ALONG. WE HAVE THE DOW UP TO 52, UP 0.5% THE S & P TRADING AT A RECORD. NASDAQ UP BY 1%. 10-YEAR, 4.27%. GOLD DOWN 0.2%. $33.90 AN OUNCE ON THE PRECIOUS METAL. THE WHITE HOUSE WILL CLARIFY GOLD TARIFFS, ACCORDING TO A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL. AGAIN RECAPPING, STOCKS HIGHER, S & P UP 0.8%. STAY WITH BLOOMBERG FOR THE LATEST ON ANY DEVELOPMENT SURROUND GOLD. CAROL: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE DO SEE GOLD FUTURES SLIPPING ON THAT HEADLINE. THE WHITE HOUSE TO CLARIFY MISINFORMATION COMING FROM AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL. WE ARE SEEING FUTURES A LITTLE BIT LOWER, DOWN ABOUT 0.1% AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE WILL CLARIFY TARIFFS. IN OUR 3:00 HOUR, WE WILL DIG INTO WHY THIS HAS CREATED SUCH A STIR WHEN IT COMES TO GOLD TRADING. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AT 3:00 P.M. WALL STREET TIME. IN THE MEANTIME, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CHECKED OUT SHARES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. JESS: SOARING. CAROL: OFF THE CHARTS. JESS: INCREDIBLE WHERE THEY HAVE COME AND GONE SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS CAROL: IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT AND IT FEELS LIKE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY LESSON. THE NEWS THAT HAS THE MOVING, FANNIE MAE IS UP ABOUT 20%. FREDDIE MAC IS UP ABOUT 22%. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAID TO BE PREPARING TO -- TO SELL SHARES IN AN OFFERING THAT COULD START THIS YEAR. WITH THE LATEST ON THAT IN HISTORY LESSON, BLOOMBERG CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL MCKEE. MIKE: WE ARE BRINGING IN THE OLD GUY FOR THIS. [LAUGHTER] CAROL: LIKE A FINE WINE, MIKE, YOU JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER. MIKE: YOU LOOK AT FANNIE MAE WAS STARTED IN 1938, IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. FREDDIE MAC CAME AROUND DESK, ALONG IN 1970. THEY BASICALLY BUY MORTGAGES FROM BANKS AND MORTGAGE LENDERS AND PACKAGE THEM INTO SECURITIES AND SELL THEM TO INVESTORS AND THAT WAY THE BANKS HAVE MORE SPACE ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS TO MAKE LOANS. BECAUSE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC HAVE SOLD THESE OFF TO INVESTORS, THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO GET THE YIELD, THEY CAN PREDICT ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEIR MORTGAGE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE SO THEY CAN KEEP MORTGAGE RATES GENERALLY FAIRLY STABLE. ALONG THE WAY FROM THE TIME FANNIE MAE WAS CREATED, THEY CREATED THE 30 YEAR MORTGAGE AND WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY BOUGHT A LOT OF REALLY BAD MORTGAGES IN THE RUN-UP TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THEY WENT BANKRUPT IN THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO BAIL THEM OUT. AND THEY PUT THEM IN CONSERVATORSHIP IS WHAT THEY'VE DONE. THE WAY THEY DID IT WAS THEY STILL LEFT SHARES OUTSTANDING. A LOT OF HEDGE FUNDS GOT INTO THE BUSINESS OF BUYING UP FANNIE AND FREDDIE SHARES AND HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THEM FOR 17 YEARS NOW AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD NO DESIRE TO BRING THEM OUT OF CONSERVATORSHIP, BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEMS BOUND AND DETERMINED TO DO IT. IT'S COMPLICATED, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT. BOY, IF YOU WERE BILL ACKMAN OR JOHN PAULSON. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE PRETTY HAPPY TODAY. JESS: TRUMP ALSO MET WITH THE CEOS OF BANK OF AMERICA, CITIGROUP EARLIER THIS WEEK AND LAST WEEK BLOOMBERG REPORTED HE MET WITH JAMIE DIMON AND DAVID SOLOMON. HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE TO PULL OFF A POTENTIAL FEAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AN IPO? MIKE: IT'S NOT SO MUCH SELLING THE SHARES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT OWNS 80% OF THE SHARES RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE COMPANIES INTO RECEIVERSHIP AND BASICALLY BANKRUPT THE EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS? WHICH IS WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO WITH THE COMPANY THAT WILL COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. OR DO YOU LEAVE THEM WITH EQUITY IN THE NEW COMPANY AND THEY MAKE A HUGE PROFIT? THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND BEFORE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPLICIT GUARANTEE BY THE GOVERNMENT, RATES WERE LOW. YOU DIDN'T DEMAND AN EXTRA PREMIUM, BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY WERE INSURED. YOU WERE GOING TO GET PAID EITHER WAY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD STEP IN. IF THE GOVERNMENT STEPS OUT AND LET'S THIS BE A PRIVATE COMPANY, MAY BE MORTGAGE RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP AND THINGS LIKE THE MORTGAGE RATE LOCK WHEN YOU LOCK IN A MORTGAGE, THAT COULD GO AWAY. THERE ARE LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD BE HANDLED AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S VERY COMPLEX. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BANKS MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A LEAD UNDERWRITER. SOMEBODY HAS TO BE THE LEAD. AND NOT JUST PAULSON AND BILL ACKMAN. [LAUGHTER] CAROL: IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE HE THINGS WE ARE SAYING THIS YEAR COMPLICATED BUT I DO WONDER, IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT ENTITY IF THEY ARE PUBLICLY HELD AND IT'S NOT THAT QUASI-PUBLIC-PRIVATE THAT WE HAVE SEEN. CORRECT? MIKE: YES AND NOBODY EXACTLY KNOWS HOW THIS WOULD PLAY OUT BECAUSE YOU WOULD WORRY RATES WOULD GO UP IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE. DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO STAY IN THE GUARANTEE BUSINESS IF IT'S A PRIVATE COMPANY AND WE ARE BASICALLY SUBSIDIZING THEIR LOW RATES AND PROFITS? THIS ADMINISTRATION IS VERY MUCH A FREE MARKET, GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF BUSINESS STUFF , SO THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF THIS, AS ARE SOME OF DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST CAMPAIGN DONORS. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY WORRY -- WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE. CAROL: MIKE MCKEE, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. NOT HOLD, JUST MARK. [LAUGHTER] JUST ONE OF THE STORIES WE'RE WATCHING OUT OF THE NATION'S CAPITAL. A LOT HAS TO DO A GEOPOLITICS. WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW AIMING TO REACH A DEAL THAT WOULD AND THE WAR IN UKRAINE. ISRAEL SAYING IT WILL TAKE CONTROL OF GAZA CITY. A TENSE CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND INDIAN PRIME MINISTER MODI THAT MAY BE UNRAVELING DECADES OF U.S. POLICY. BLOOMBERG NEWS'S SENIOR REPORTER IN WASHINGTON. BUSY DAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. TOP OF MINE FOR MANY IS WHAT IS GOING ON POTENTIALLY BETWEEN PRESIDENTS TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN. > > BLOOMBERG IS REPORTING WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW ARE WORKING TOWARD A POSSIBLE DEAL THAT WOULD HALT THE WAR IN UKRAINE IN EXCHANGE FOR ALLOWING RUSSIA POTENTIALLY TO OCCUPY SOME OF THE TERRITORY THAT IT SEIZED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS DURING THE INVASION OF UKRAINE. THIS IS ALL OF COURSE COMING AHEAD OF A POTENTIAL SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN, POTENTIALLY AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK. WE KNOW THIS COULD VERY WELL REFLECT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY STEVE WITKOFF AND PUTIN EARLIER THIS WEEK WEDNESDAY AND MOSCOW. COMING OUT OF THAT MEETING, THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THE TALKS ENDED WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT RUSSIA WANTED. CLEARLY, THE IDEA OF SEIZING TERRITORY OR BEING ABLE TO OCCUPY TERRITORY AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EASTERN DONBAS REGION AS WELL AS CRIMEA, THIS HAS LONG BEEN A GOAL OF AND RUSSIA. NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT EUROPEAN ALLIES AND UKRAINE WOULD SIGNOFF ON THIS OR SUPPORT THIS ARRANGEMENT. CAROL: WE ARE TALKING WITH JENN OUT OF D.C. WANT TO TAKE YOU TO SOME LIVE SHOTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE. WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SEVERAL MEETINGS GOING ON. HE'S GETTING READY TO GREET THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES. HE'S PARTICIPATING IN A BILATERAL MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR PRESS CONFERENCES POTENTIALLY OUT OF THAT. SOMETHING WERE MONITORING. -- SOMETHING WE ARE MONITORING. WE WILL GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND/OR COVER THOSE HEADLINES. I WANT TO GO TO THIS MEETING HERE SHE'S MEETING WITH. -- HE IS MEETING WITH THE LEADERS OF AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA TO END DECADES OF WAR. IMPORTANT BUT IT HASN'T BEEN TOP OF MIND. JENNIFER: WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE DEALS FOR U.S. AUDIENCE IS THESE PACKED -- PACTS THAT WILL BE SIGNED GIVES THE U.S. THE RIGHTS TO DEVELOP A TRANSIT ROUTE THROUGH THE REGION THAT HAS BEEN AN CONFLICT FOR DECADES. THE U.S. IS SET TO GET THESE -- THIS ABILITY TO ACCESS THIS REGION ACROSS SOUTHERN ARMENIA TO GET TO AN AREA THAT BORDERS TURKEY. IT IS EVENING -- IT IS EVEN BEING BRANDED IN TRUMP'S HONOR, ACCORDING TO ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. THE IDEA IS THAT THIS IS A WIN FOR THE U.S. OPENING OF NEW TRADE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARMENIA BUT ONLY IN PARTNERSHIP OR REALLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U.S. THERE WILL BE COMMERCIAL TALKS LATER, POTENTIAL HE NEXT WEEK. THIS IS BEING PORTRAYED BY THIS WHITE HOUSE AS KIND OF A WIN FOR WASHINGTON AS WELL AS A WIN FOR AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA, POTENTIALLY ENDING DECADES OF CONFLICT AND AT THE SAME TIME DELIVERING A SETBACK TO RUSSIA, IRAN AND CHINA WHO HAVE A -- YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE CONFLICT IN THE REGION. JESS: YOU MENTIONED RUSSIA, TALK TO US MORE ABOUT THE RIPPLE EFFECTS. JENNIFER: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY, AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA HAVE BEEN IN CONFLICT SINCE THE WANING YEARS OF THE USSR. THE CONFLICT THERE IS SEEN BY WHITE HOUSE AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUTIN TO USE LEVERAGE IN THE REGION. CONFLICT AND THE REGION IS SOMETHING HE BENEFITS FROM. YOU SEE THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING TO DEFUSE CONFLICT ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY FOND OF TALKING ABOUT THE DEALS, THE PIECE DEALS HE IS TRYING TO SECURE. THIS IS ONE THAT ALIGNS WITH THE INTERESTS IN KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA AND LIMITING ITS INFLUENCE OVER ALL. BY THE WAY, I JUST NOTE THAT SOME OF THE DEALS WE ARE LIKELY TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT TODAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE, BUT HE HAS DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS BEING INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING GET A TREATY BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO AND RWANDA, CEASE-FIRES BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL, AND OF COURSE THE CONFLICT WITH INDIA AND PAKISTAN. CAROL: ANYTHING ELSE ON THE RADAR? I ASKED NA\u00cfVELY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH. ANYTHING ELSE YOU'RE WATCHING FOR FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY? JENNIFER: LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RUSSIA RELATED SANCTIONS AND WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT WAS A 10-DAY THREAT 10 DAYS AGO TO IMPOSE LEVIES AGAINST RUSSIAN OIL PURCHASERS. HE HAS TAKEN ACTION AGAINST INDIA AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HE WILL TAKE ACTION AGAINST CHINA OR TAKE ACTION TO CHOKE OFF MOSCOW'S OIL REVENUE. CAROL: IT'S SO INTERCONNECTED AND SO MANY WAYS. JENN, THANK YOU. THERE IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ON THE GEOPOLITICAL BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR THEME. JOINING US NOW IS WENDY CUTLER, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE JOINING US FROM SAN DIEGO. WE JUST DID KIND OF A RUNDOWN IN TERMS OF ALL THE STUFF THAT IS GOING ON. I WANT THAT WHITEBOARD, U.S., CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA, IRAN./ TALK TO US ABOUT THE NEWS FLOW ABOUT GEOPOLITICS AND THE U.S. ROLE IN WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO AND MAYBE WE START WITH RUSSIA. IT IS CURIOUS BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING WILL GET DONE TO END THE WAR. IT DOES SEEM THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN WILL STAND PRETTY PACKED WHEN IT COMES TO IT -- HIS DEMANDS. WENDY: IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS WILL ALL DEVELOP BUT IT'S CLEAR THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO USE HIS OFFICE TO TRY TO BROKER A CEASE-FIRE. WHAT I'M WATCHING ON THE TRADE FRONT IS HOW THIS MAY IMPACT OUR RELATIONS WITH INDIA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE IN A 21 DAY PERIOD WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS THREATENED TO INCREASE INDIA'S TARIFFS BY AN ADDITIONAL 25%, TAKING THEM TO 50% DUE TO THEIR PURCHASES OF RUSSIAN OIL. IF THERE IS INDEED SOME PROGRESS MADE WITH RUSSIA, THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPENING TO REMOVE THIS THREAT AND IMPENDING TARIFF HIKE. JESS: TALK TO US MORE ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN FOR INDIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA OR CHINA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AS WELL. WENDY: INDIA IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE SPENT 20 IN YEARS TRYING TO STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA. THE PAST TWO WEEKS, THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN SPIRALING DOWNWARD. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO REBUILD AND IN MANY RESPECTS INDIA IS GOING TO GRAVITATE NOT AN A MAJOR WAY, BUT GRADUALLY MORE TOWARD CHINA AND RUSSIA, VIEWING US AS AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER. CAROL: THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU. LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE REMIND US ABOUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THE U.S. CONTINUE TO HAVE POSITIVE RELATIONS AND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA. REMIND US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT COULD BE AT RISK IF INDIA IS MUCH MORE ALIGNED WITH CHINA RATHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. WENDY: WELL, WE'VE LOOKED TO INDIA AS THE COUNTERWEIGHT TO CHINA, ON THE STRATEGIC FRONT AND THE ECONOMIC FRONT. ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT WE'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING OUR COMPANIES TO LEAVE CHINA IN ONE OF THE DESTINATIONS THEY'VE BEEN GRAVITATING TOWARD IS INDIA. MANY U.S. COMPANIES ARE NOW EXPANDING THEIR OPERATIONS IN INDIA AND IF RELATIONS START GOING SOUTH, THIS KIND OF THROWS THINGS UP IN THE AIR AND THE LAST THING THE U.S. BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEEDS RIGHT NOW IS MORE UNCERTAINTY. THERE'S ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY WITH ALL OF THE TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING OUT ON A DAILY BASIS. JESS: DO YOU THINK THERE'S BEEN LONG-TERM DAMAGE WITH THAT BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP? WENDY: ABSOLUTELY. AGAIN, YOU SPEND YEARS AND YEARS BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP, BUILDING TRUST, BUT IT CAN TAKE JUST A MATTER OF HOURS OR DAYS TO BREAK THAT TRUST. REBUILDING IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN A MATTER OF HOURS OR DAYS AND WE ARE NOT JUST SEEING THIS WITH INDIA. I'M JUST BACK FROM JAPAN AND I'M HEARING THE SAME THING. THE JAPANESE HAVE BEEN A VERY STRONG ALLY AND ARE LOOKING AT THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN IN THEIR VIEW JERKED AROUND IN THESE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING SOME KIND OF PLAN B WHERE THEY BECOME LESS RELIANT ON THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND HARD TO REBUILD TRUST IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. CAROL: WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE? WHEN THE PRESIDENT DID COME BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE EARLIER THIS YEAR HE LOOKED SET TO BUILD ON THE WARM TIES WITH PRIME MINISTER MODI. HE CALLED THE RELATIONSHIP THE BEST IT'S EVER BEEN BETWEEN TWO LEADERS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE PRIME MINISTER CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP, MY DEAR FRIEND. IS THIS JUST, I DON'T KNOW, GAMESMANSHIP? UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE HEAR, WHAT WE SEE SOMETIMES HAVE A NEW SET OF HEADLINES SHOWS SOMETHING EVERY DIFFERENT. SHOULD WE TAKE THIS AT FACE VALUE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BREAKING DOWN OR IS IT JUST THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS BETWEEN LEADERS OF TWO REALLY IMPORTANT COUNTRIES? WENDY: A FEW WEEKS AGO EVERYBODY WAS SAYING WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF A VERY EARLY TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA AND THERE WAS A LOT OF OPTIMISM AND SOMEHOW THE TRADE DEAL GOT DERAILED. I COULD BE THE U.S. WAS ASKING FOR MORE BUT A COMBINATION OF INDIA COULDN'T MEET OUR LAST FEW REQUESTS PARTICULARLY IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR WHICH IS VERY SENSITIVE FOR THEM. I DON\u2019'T THINK THAT IS THE WHOLE PICTURE. OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT MADE THE PRESIDENT EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED. MAYBE HE GOT THE NUMBERS OF HOW MUCH OIL CAN -- HOW MUCH OIL INDIA CONTINUES TO BUY FROM RUSSIA AND THAT SOMEHOW RUBBED HIM THE WRONG WAY. BUT AGAIN, THE WORDS HE HAS BEEN USING TOWARD INDIA, I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST TURN AROUND OVERNIGHT. IT'S PRETTY DEEP RIGHT NOW AND IF YOU TALK TO THE INDIAN OFFICIALS OR THE INDIAN PUBLIC, I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DEEP-SEATED ANGER AND FRANKLY, THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SPIRALED SO QUICKLY EITHER. JESS: WHAT ARE YOUR EYES ON NEXT ? AUGUST 12 IS THE DECISION DATE FOR CHINESE TARIFFS COMING UP SOON. WENDY: EXACTLY, NEXT TUESDAY IS KEY. I'M COUNTING THAT WE WILL ROLL OVER THE TARIFF TRUTHS WE ACHIEVED WITH CHINA 90 DAYS AGO AND THEN I THINK WE'LL SEE A CONTINUATION OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN DO SOME KIND OF DEAL IN A LEAD UP TO A POSSIBLE MEETING OR VISIT THE PRESIDENT TO CHINA AROUND THE KOREA AIPAC MEETING IN LATE OCTOBER. CAROL: WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU TO KIND OF WRAP UP HERE, WENDY, AND THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND WE'LL SEE WHAT ALTERNATELY HAPPENS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY COME BACK TO THE TABLE AND THEY BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN, BUT I GUESS IF THERE IS A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS HOW IT SEEMS RIGHT NOW IN THE LAST -- AND THAT LASTS LONGER TERM, WHAT IS THE COST TO THE UNITED STATES? WENDY: WITH INDIA? CAROL: YES. WENDY: THE COST IS WE HAVE DAMAGED A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PARTNER THAT IS ONLY BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT TO DIVERSIFY AWAY FROM CHINA. THIS DOES PRESENT SERIOUS CONCERNS. CAROL: HOW MUCH IS CHINA WATCHING THIS IN YOUR VIEW? WENDY: VERY CLOSELY AND I WOULD EXPECT CHINA WILL MAKE OVERTURES TO INDIA RIGHT NOW IN AN EFFORT TO BRING INDIA MORE IN THEIR CAMP. NOW, LET'S KEEP IN MIND, CHINA AND INDIA RELATIONS HISTORICALLY HAVE NEVER BEEN GOOD SO I DON'T EXPECT INDIA TO MOVE TO THE CHINA CAMP, BUT I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HEDGE THEIR BETS AND VIEW THE U.S. AS LESS RELIABLE AND GRAVITATE BOTH TOWARD RUSSIA AND CHINA, FRANKLY. CAROL: THE FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM POSSIBLY TALKING SHOWS THAT THINGS COULD POSSIBLY BE SHIFTING. WENDY, SO GLAD TO GET SOME TIME WITH YOU ON THIS FRIDAY. WENDY CUTLER BACK WITH US. VICE PRESIDENT OF ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE JOINING US FROM SAN DIEGO. THANK YOU AGAIN. FOLKS, COMING UP IN A MOMENT, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE COMPANY UPWORK, WE HAVE THE COMPANY CFO JOINING US IN JUST A SECOND. WE HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE WE WRAP UP TRADING AND WE SEE STOCKS RALLYING. LET'S TURN THINGS OVER TO CHARLIE. CHARLIE: WE DO HAVE THE S & P 500 INDEX AT A RECORD RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH GOLD. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS SUGGESTING IT WILL ISSUE A NEW POLICY CLARIFYING THAT IMPORTS OF GOLD BARS SHOULD NOT FACE TARIFFS. THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDS TO POST AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CLARIFY WHAT THAT OFFICIAL CALLED MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE TERRIFYING -- TARIFFING OF GOLD AND OTHER PRODUCTS. STOCK SETTING TO RECORDS AMID SOLID CORPORATE RESULTS AND HOPES THAT RUSSIA AND THE U.S. WILL REACH A DEAL TO END THE WAR IN UKRAINE. THE S & P, 6392, THAT'S A RECORD. IF IT CLOSED THERE, IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE OLD HIGH. THE DOW UP 0.6%. MAG 7 INDEX SURGING BY 1.5%. THE MAG 7 INDEX IS AT A RECORD. GOLD FLAP ON -- FLAT ON THE DAY. U.S. TEXAS INTERMEDIATE ALSO LITTLE CHANGED. HIGHEST IN 10 YEARS AFTER BOOSTING GUIDANCE, GILEAD SCIENCES UP BY 8.3%. APPLE EXTENDING ITS THREE-DAY RALLY TO 14%, THE HIGHEST SINCE MARCH, UP ANOTHER 4.5%. HELPING LIFT OUR INDEX TO A RECORD. FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS, SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. I'M CHARLIE PELLETT, THAT'S THE BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. CAROL: WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO EARNINGS BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN ON OUR RADAR OF LATE. WE ARE TALKING GEOPOLITICS. WANT TO GO TO UPWORK, SHARES RALLYING FOLLOWING THEIR QUARTERLY UPDATE. THEY REPORTED SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS THAT BEAT EXPECTATIONS AND RAISED THEIR FULL-YEAR FORECAST. $1.7 BILLION MARKET CAP COMPANY CONNECTS BUSINESSES AND INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS, FREELANCERS AND OTHERS, FOR REMOTE WORK OPPORTUNITY. THE STOCK DOWN MORE THAN 20% YEAR TO DATE AND 10% OF THE FLOAT IS SHORT. THE COMPANY IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE LABOR FORCE. LET'S GET TO IT WITH THE CFO AT UPWORK/ SHE JOINS US FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND SHE WILL BE FEATURED IN AN UPCOMING EDITION OF THE BLOOMBERG CFO BRIEFING UPDATE. ALSO WITH US IS THE BLOOMBERG NEWS SENIOR EDITOR WHO WRITES THE BLOOMBERG CFO BRIEFING NEWSLETTER. ERICA, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. YOUR STOCKTON SORE ON YOUR LATEST QUARTERLY OUTLOOK. TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND WHAT IS DRIVING GROWTH. ERICA: THANKS SO MUCH, GREAT TO BE HERE. WE HAD A STANDOUT QUARTER IN Q2 IN SO MANY WAYS. I THINK THE MOST DISTINCTIVE THING IS THE AI CATEGORY OF WORK. SO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES OF WORK DEVELOPING IN AI AND ON OUR PLATFORM, OUR AI CATEGORY GREW 30% YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THAT WAS AN ACCELERATION FROM THE FIRST QUARTER. ONE OF THE OTHER DRIVERS IS ALSO THE AI ENABLEMENT IN OUR PLATFORM. IF YOU THING ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS IN GENERAL, POSTING A JOB, FREELANCERS BIDDING, THE INTERVIEW ASSESS, WE HAVE NOW ENABLED AI ACROSS THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND WE ATTRIBUTE $80 MILLION IN VOLUME ON OUR PLATFORM FROM INCREASED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES. > > THANKS FOR JOINING US. I WANTED TO FOLLOW-UP, YOUR PLATFORM OPERATES ALL AROUND THE WORLD, NOT JUST AN INDICATOR OF JOB MARKETS IN THE U.S., BUT ALSO OTHER COUNTRIES. LOOKING AT YOUR U.S. BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR, WHAT DOES THE GROWTH YOU'VE SEEN IN THE LATEST QUARTER TELL YOU ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET MORE BROADLY? ERICA: IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, NINA, AND GOOD TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN. OVERALL IN THE LABOR MARKET WRIT LARGE, THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY PERSISTENT HEADWINDS HITTING THE LABOR MARKET. THE BLS DATA COMING DOWN. PUBLIC STAFFING, WE LOOK AT THE PUBLIC MARKET, PUBLIC STAFFING COMPANIES, THEY REPORTED A 4% DOWN ORDER IN Q2 AND ARE PROJECTING EVEN MORE NEGATIVE GROWTH. WE'RE REALLY PLEASED THAT THAT KIND OF SHOWS THE STRENGTH AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM. I WOULD SAY THE VAGARIES OF THE BLS DATA IN GENERAL, IF THAT IS TELLING US ANYTHING, IT'S TELLING US THINGS ARE REALLY UNCERTAIN OUT THERE. THAT UNCERTAINTY IS AFFECTING OUR CLIENTS AND PEOPLE IN SMALL BUSINESSES IN GENERAL WHO ARE UNSURE ABOUT WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER. JESS: WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR SHARE PRICE ROUGHLY BEING DOWN 17% YEAR TO DATE, WHY IS THAT AND WHAT YOU THINK INVESTORS ARE TELLING YOU WHEN IT COMES TO CHIEF CONCERNS RIGHT NOW? ERICA: YOU KNOW, IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT THE MARKET IS SAYING RIGHT NOW. THE REALITY IS SOME OF THESE BROADER LABEL -- BROADER LABOR MARKET CONCERNS ARE AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE STANDING OUT FROM THE CROWD. I THINK IN GENERAL, THERE'S BEEN THIS CONCEPT OUT THERE THAT AS THESE REALLY EXCITING ADVANCES IN AI COME FORWARD, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO START TO SUBSTITUTE WORK AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CERTAIN CATEGORIES AT THE VERY LOWEST AND OF THE TYPES OF WORK THAT ARE GETTING DONE IN WRITING AND TRANSLATION, YOU DO CAI SUBSTITUTION, BUT PLATFORMS LIKE OURS, WHERE WE SUPPLY MUCH LARGER, MORE COMPLEX WORK OF SKILLED WORKERS, WE ARE SEEING AI ENHANCE WORK AND START TO AUGMENT AND ACCELERATE CATEGORIES THAT SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE. -- DISRUPTED. VIDEO AND ANIMATION, CONTRACT LAW, ALL THESE CATEGORIES ARE BEING ADVANCED BY AI. NINA: I THINK CAROL HAS A FOLLOW-UP YOU SAID ONE THING ABOUT THE BLS I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT, AS THE CFO OF THE BUSINESS THAT'S LABOR RELATED I'M WONDERING WHAT MAKE OF THE FIRING OF PRESIDENT TRUMP OF THE COMMISSIONER OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS RECENTLY? ERICA: WELL, IT'S HARD TO COMMENT ON THOSE DECISIONS. YOU KNOW, THESE TYPES OF DATA GET REVISED ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE LARGER VISIONS -- AND THESE WERE LARGE REVISIONS. IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY SURPRISING. CAROL: BUT IS IT A DATA POINT YOU RESPECT AND HAVE LOOKED AT AND COMPARED TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR WORLD? ERICA: LOOK, AS A BUSINESS IN THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDUSTRY WATCH THE LABOR MARKET VERY CAREFULLY. WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY THAT OUR VOLUME RELATED TREND HAS SOME CORRELATION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE JOBS REPORT AS A LAGGING INDICATOR. WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE STRENGTH WE ARE SEEING IS STARTING TO BUCK THAT TREND OF WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE. WE ARE RELYING ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR PLATFORM AND TECH TO OFFSET WHAT CONTINUES TO BE A VERY UNCERTAIN OPERATING MARKET. CAROL: NINA WAS RIGHT, I WANT TO GO BACK TO AI FOR MOMENT. I'M BLOWN AWAY THAT YOU SAY AI IS ENHANCING YOUR WORK AND YOUR PLATFORM IN A BIG WAY. I THINK THERE IS THIS FEELING THAT COULD EVEN AI MAKE WHAT YOU GUYS DO OBSOLETE AT THIS POINT? BUT EDUCATE, AS WE THROW SO MUCH ABOUT AI INTO ONE BUCKET, HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS DRIVING THINGS IN YOUR BUSINESS. ERICA: AI IS DRIVING THINGS IN OUR BUSINESS IN TWO WAYS. THE FIRST IS AI ENHANCEMENTS ON OUR PLATFORM, MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR CLIENTS, LOOKING FOR GREAT TALENT TO GET WORK DONE. IN THE PAST, THEY WOULD HAVE TO WRITE UP A JOB POST, POST THE JOB, INTERVIEW FREELANCERS, A SERIES OF FREELANCERS, AND THE FREELANCERS THEMSELVES HAVE TO WRITE A PROPOSAL. NOW ALL OF THAT IS DONE BY AI. IT TAKES WHAT USED TO TAKE HOURS DOWN TO MINUTE. -- MINUTES. THAT'S A HUGE ADVANCEMENT IN FINDING A GREAT MATCH TO GET THE WORK YOU WANT DONE DONE QUICKLY. THE EVEN MORE INTERESTING TRENDS ARE AROUND HOW AI IS ADVANCING EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY OF WORK. WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON OUR PLATFORM IS FREELANCER JOB DESCRIPTIONS KEPT POPPING UP SAYING, I'M IN AI VIDEO ANIMATOR, ARTIST, IT'S NOT JUST ENGINEERING OR LLM BUILDING OF WHICH WE HAVE NEARLY 250,000 AI SKILLED TALENT ON OUR PLATFORM. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS IT'S ENABLING ARE FREELANCERS TO GET WORK DONE FASTER, TO GET WORK DONE BETTER. CLIENTS ARE LOOKING FOR FREELANCERS WHO ARE USING AI TO GET WORK DONE. CAROL: LISTEN, WE JUST HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS. I KNOW NINA HAS ONE LAST QUESTION QUICKLY. NINA: JUST WONDERING, YOU COMPLETED TWO TRANSACTIONS RECENTLY, DID ANY OF THE MACRO UNCERTAINTY INFLUENCE THE DEALMAKING FOR THOSE TRANSACTIONS? ERICA: THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. I DON'T THINK THE MACRO UNCERTAINTY REALLY PLAYED INTO IT AT ALL. THESE TWO GAME CHANGING TRANSACTIONS WE DID, THESE ARE REALLY ADDING DIGITALLY NATIVE CAPABILITIES TO OUR ENTERPRISE OFFERING TO INTEGRATE KIND OF AN INCREDIBLE AI-ENHANCED PLATFORM WITH OUR TALENT AS WELL AS A BROADER CONTINGENT LABOR SOLUTION THAT WILL ENABLE ENTERPRISES TO AGAIN QUICKLY AND EASILY GET THROUGH THE REDTAPE TAPE OF COMPLIANCE AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO HIRE THE LABOR THEY NEED. CAROL: THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU'RE SO REAL. . ERICA GESSERT, CFO OF UPWORK. AND OF COURSE NINA. COMING UP, FROM ALPHABET TO AMAZON TO UBER AND ZILLOW, MARK COVERS THEM ALL AND HE IS OUR GUEST. \u266a CHARLIE: WE DO CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG AT BLOOMBERG.

WANT TO ASK YOU BROAD, MACRO. IT SEEMS SO MUCH OF OUR WORLD IS BEING UPENDED OR THERE IS UNCERTAINTY WHEN IT COMES TO VARIOUS POLICIES. TECH COMPANIES, SECTORS CALLED OUT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE HAD THE INTEL CEO CALLED OUT IN A NEGATIVE WAY BY THE PRESIDENT. HOW DO YOU THING ABOUT THIS ADMINISTRATION BROADLY IN TERMS OF POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT ARE IMPACTING, COULD IMPACT THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND THE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL? > > WELL, SHOOT, I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION. THE FACT OUR THIS IS THE MOST ACTIVIST ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS MAY BE SINCE FDR. I DON'T KNOW. I'M A STUDENT OF U.S. HISTORY, BUT YOU ARE STRETCHING ME THERE. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY ACTIVIST ADMINISTRATION. MAYBE THE MOST OBVIOUS FACTOR IS TARIFFS WHICH ARE AT THE END OF THE DAY ATTACKS THAT EITHER AMERICAN BUSINESSES OR AMERICAN CONSUMERS WILL PAY. THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE OR ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE. THIS IS ALL THE BACKDROP THAT CEOS ARE PAID TO DEAL WITH BUT IT IS UNUSUALLY HIGH IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR CONTROL THAT IS LIFTING THE BULL MARKET IN TECH STOCKS AND IT IS GENAI AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN TERMS OF REDUCED COSTS AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AND OFFERINGS. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN OVERHYPED AT TIMES BUT COMPANIES HAVE HAD REALLY GOOD STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THEY ARE PERCEIVED AS GENAI WINNERS. JESS: HAVE TO BRING UP THE SEMI CONDUCTOR IN CHIPMAKER STOCKS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PRIDE -- PRESIDENT BIDEN'S POLICIES VERSUS TRUMP'S CALL FOR 100% TARIFFS ON IMPORTED CHIPS. WILL THAT MAKE FOR ROBUST DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF CHIPS? MARK: I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A THOUGHTFUL, EDUCATED ANSWER FOR THAT. YOU ARE ASKING WHETHER YOU WANT TO PROMOTE U.S. MANUFACTURING AND HIGHLY STRATEGIC AND -- INDUSTRIES, WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO USE INCENTIVES AND SUBSIDIES. I THINK THAT CRUDELY EXPLAINS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION POLICY OR WHETHER IT IS GOOD TO USE TARIFFS AND BROWBEAT COMPANIES TO COME BACK TO THE U.S., I'M NOT SURE. BOTH ARE ACTIVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES INTO BUSINESSES. IT IS AN INTERESTING STEP UP. WE HAD A LAISSEZ-FAIRE ECONOMY, GENERALLY GOVERNMENT STAYS OUT OF THE WAY OF BUSINESS. LOOK, I'M OUT HERE IN TECH LAND. MOST OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL RUN BY ENTREPRENEURS, THEY COME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD, THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE U.S. AND CREATE THESE BUSINESSES. THEY HAVE DONE IT ON THEIR OWN, THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME HELP THERE, BUT IT HAS CREATED A GOOD SITUATION FOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND I HOPE WE DON'T SPOIL THAT. CAROL: LET'S GET TO SOME OF THE NUMBERS. ZILLOW WAS OUT THIS WEEK. UBER, YOU RAISED YOUR PRICE TARGET. DOORDASH. WHAT COMPANY RESULTS SHOW TO YOU A MORE INTERESTING INVESTMENT THESIS AS A RESULT? EITHER THIS WEEK OR LAST WEEK WE GOT SOME OF THE MAJOR TECH NAMES? MARK: I LIKE THE SET UP ON THE QUESTION. WHERE I THOUGHT WE HAD SOME SURPRISINGLY INSTRUCTIVE RESULTS, I THOUGHT DOORDASH WAS IN THAT LIST. WE HAD SOME RECORD HIGH OPERATING MARGINS. META WAS DEFINITELY IN THAT LIST. MOST OF THE OTHER NAMES I THOUGHT, THOSE OF THE TWO STAND OUT COMPANIES. MAYBE BOOKING.COM. THE OTHER NAMES, WE HAD GOOD PRINTS OUT OF NAMES LIKE GOOGLE, OUT OF NAMES LIKE AMAZON. BUT THE REALLY STRONGEST, CLEANEST PRINTS, THERE WERE A FEW AND I WOULD PUT BOOKING, DOORDASH, YEAH, THOSE WOULD PROBABLY BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. IF YOU JUST STEPPED BACK. THESE COMPANIES GIVE YOU A VERY BROAD READ INTO THE ECONOMY INTO CONSUMER DEMAND AND SOME ENTERPRISE DEMAND AND IF I USE ONE SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE THE EARNINGS SEASON, IT'S RESILIENCE. IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAD A POSITIVE INFLECTION BUT THE OVERALL VIEW IS THAT SPEND HAS BEEN RELATIVELY RESILIENT AND HAS BEEN RELATIVELY ROBUST. THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR. SO FAR, SO GOOD. CAROL: YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH META. THEY ANNOUNCED A $29 BILLION FINANCING IN THE RACE FOR AI INFRASTRUCTURE ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR. THAT MAJOR SPEND AND THE TALENT GRAB, YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF IT? MARK: WELL, I GUESS IF THEY KEEP PUTTING UP FUNDAMENTAL RESULTS LIKE THEY ARE DOING WHERE THEY ARE USING AI TO IMPROVE THEIR COST STRUCTURE , YOU ARE GETTING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND A RETURN ON ALL THAT AI SPEND. THEY TOOK THEIR REVENUE GROWTH AND ACCELERATED IT TO 20%. THAT DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE. THERE WERE USING AI TO BETTER TARGET AD CAMPAIGNS AND SO MARKETERS ARE GETTING A BETTER RETURN ON META AD SPENDS. CONSUMERS ARE FINDING THE SERVICES BETTER, THEY ARE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH META AND INSTAGRAM. THERE IS NOTHING MORE OBJECTIVE THAN TIME SPENT. META HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE ALL THAT AI SPEND TO IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCT AND SERVICE. IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT TO INVEST AND SPEND MORE. CAROL: WE'VE GOT TO RUN. I PER SHEET YOU GOING MACRO WITH US AND DRILLING DOWN ON SOME OF THE COMPANIES. MARK MAHANEY, AUTHOR OF \"NOTHING BUT NET: 10 TIMELESS STOCKPICKING LESSONS.\" JOINING US OUT THERE OUT WEST. WE ARE WATCHING THE WHITE HOUSE, LOOKING FOR HEADLINES, SEEING IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESIDENT MIGHT MAKE SOME FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS ON WHETHER IT IS TRADE TARIFFS AND THE GEOPOLITICS GOING ON. WE WILL GET YOU TO STOCKS ON THE MOVE WHEN WE CONTINUE. \u266a CAROL: YOU'RE LISTENING TO BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION. ALMOST COMING UP ON THE LAST HOUR OF TRADING. GETTING READY TO WRAP UP THE DAY AND THE WEEK. WE'VE GOT A RALLY UNDERWAY SO WE ARE NEAR OUR HIGHS UP ABOUT 0.8%. A GAIN OF ABOUT ZERO POINT 9%. I'M CAROL MASSAR ALONG WITH JEFF. -- JESS. LET'S GET TO NATALIA WAS STOCK MOVERS AT THIS HOUR AND ONE REPORTED EARNINGS AFTER THE CLOSE LAST NIGHT. > > THE TICKER IS TTD. THIS IS CURRENTLY THE WORST PERFORMER IN THE S & P 500. THE COMPANY CAME OFF EXPECTATIONS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO IMPRESS INVESTORS. WE SAW AT LEAST FOUR DOWNGRADES. SOME OF THEM CITING CONCERNS ABOUT REVENUE GROWTH AND COMPETITION COMING FROM AMAZON SPECIFICALLY. THEY SAID AMAZON DID SOME IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DEMAND-SIDE PLATFORM WHERE THEY CAN TARGET THE SPECIFIC AUDIENCE. THE STOCK IS REALLY SINKING. JESS: WE SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER OVER ON THE EQUITIES TEAM, SO I KNOW ANOTHER WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING, SWEET GREEN, WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHY IS IT DOWN SO MUCH RIGHT NOW? > > IT LOOKS LIKE U.S. CONSUMERS ARE BECOMING MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS AND PICKIER WHEN THEY BUY A MEAL. WE KNOW THIS SALAD CHAIN, THEY SELL SALADS WITH THE AVERAGE COST OF $15 TO $20. THE STOCK IS DOWN BY 24%. JESS: THAT WAS CLOSE TO WHERE PRICED ITS IPO A FEW YEARS AGO. [LAUGHTER] > > THAT'S A GOOD POINT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST DROP ON RECORD. THEY SLASHED GUIDANCE, MISSED ESTIMATES. LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. ONE ANALYST FROM WILLIAM BLAIR SAID POTENTIALLY THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL AT SOME POINT BEFORE THE END OF 2026. SHARES ARE DOWN BY AROUND 70%. CAROL: IT IS NOW JUST UNDER $10 A SHARE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS COMPETITION OR ALL. I LIKE SWEET GREEN. I'VE EATEN THERE. I WONDER IF IT IS A TELL ON INCREASING COMPETITION WHEN IT COMES TO LUNCH? JESS: IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THOSE PLACES WITH SALADS ARE GETTING PRICIER PRICIER. THERE'S ONE CLOSE TO ME WHERE I LIVE IN MANHATTAN AND I FEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT TO GO AS MUCH IF I'M SPENDING CLOSE TO $20 FOR SALAD. I COULD DO SOMETHING ELSE. CAROL: IT'S A LOT YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 20% OF THE FLOAT IS SHORT. INVESTORS, THAT NEGATIVE SENTIMENT CONTINUES. WE HAVE AN IPO STORY TODAY. > > IT'S EXCITING THAT THE IPO MARKET IS SOMEWHAT RECOVERING. IT IS A POSITIVE STORY. THIS IS AN AI SOFTWARE PLATFORM FOCUSED ON HEART DISEASES. IT RAISED MORE THAN $300 MILLION BUT IT IS STILL UNPROFITABLE AS A BUSINESS. THIS POTENTIALLY GIVES HOPE FOR INVESTORS WHO LIKE BIOTECH IPOS FOR MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES. ONE OF THEM IS A SURGERY IMPLANT MAKER. ANOTHER IS AN AI SOFTWARE FIRM, BOTH OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE TRADING BELOW THEIR OFFERING PRICES. WE SEE A REVIVAL, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT CRYPTO OR AI, BUT THIS IS A POSITIVE STORY IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. DON'T NOTE IT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE. CAROL: I DON'T KNOW THIS COMPANY, BUT THERE PLATFORM IS TO MAKE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE A SCREEN ABLE -- SCREENABLE DISEASE. WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT GOING INSIDE THE BODY AND CREATING WHAT YOUR PARTICULAR CONDITION ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE AND GETTING A BETTER HANDLE ON IT. JESS: BRAVE NEW WORLD. THE THALIA ALSO COVERS OUR ECM COLUMN FOR ALL THINGS IPOS. WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES SEE THINGS HAPPENING FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND IN 2026? > > WE EXPECT SOME KIND OF REVIVAL. ONE OF THE NEAREST IPO'S THAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT WEEK, WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES, BUT THIS IS A CRYPTO NAME. I HEAR MORE AND MORE IN BACKGROUND CONVERSATIONS THAT 2026 WILL BE A YEAR OF IPOS. THIS WAS THE SAME THING WE HEARD ABOUT. 2025 JESS: RIGHT. CAROL: SOMETHING TO KEEP A WATCH ON. CHECK OUT OUR NEW STOCK MOVERS PODCAST. FIVE MINUTE EPISODES OF THE BIGGEST WINNERS AND LOSERS ON APPLE, SPOTIFY, OR ANYWHERE YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. WE ARE HEADING TOWARD OUR LAST HOUR OF TRADING ON THIS FRIDAY AND FOR THE WEEK OVERALL. WE SHOULD POINT OUT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP AN EYE ON D.C. AND THE NATION'S CAPITAL. THE PRESIDENT WAS SEVERAL MEETINGS. YOU CAN SEE VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS MILLING ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE. WE KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER OF ARMENIA HAS ARRIVED AND WE ARE WAITING ON THE AZERBAIJAN PRIME MINISTER AS WELL. HE'S EXPECTED TO BE THERE AND THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE SIGNING A TRILATERAL AGREEMENT. WE WILL BE WATCHING THAT AND BRINGING YOU THE HEADLINES. THAT WILL DO IT FOR THIS HOUR.",
