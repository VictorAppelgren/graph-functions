      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best short-term stocks to invest in.\nThe latter half of the 2025 market is caught between conflicting signals. July\u2019s controversial jobs report indicated the nonfarm payrolls rising by just 73,000, with three-month average job gains now less than a third of last year\u2019s pace, pointing to a economic slowdown in the U.S. According to CNBC, this has prompted Goldman Sachs to reduce the growth forecast to just 1% for the remainder of 2025 citing weaker job growth and reduced consumer spending in the face of tariff-related inflation.\nOn the other hand, despite these warnings, the market remains resilient and continues to thrive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by just 1.7% over the past month. And with President Trump\u2019s announcement on the matter, optimism is brimming around possible Fed rate cuts and a breakthrough in U.S.-EU trade talks. Inflation concerns have been toned down, leading the traders to assign a nearly 90% probability of a rate cut in September. The improved sentiment has created short-term opportunities for investors to capitalize on.\nShort-term opportunities often emerge in uncertain macro environments, and right now, the mix of market resilience and shifting Fed expectations is building such a setup. With that in mind, let\u2019s look into our picks for the 11 best short-term stocks to consider. The top 5 might surprise you.\nOur Methodology\nWhen putting together our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in, we followed a few criteria. Primarily, we considered small caps and above for making this list. All the stocks on our list have a 1-year negative performance and a positive performance this week, which are used for recognizing their short-term return-generating potential. For ranking the stocks, we have used their 1-year negative performances. All the data used in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of August 7, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n11. Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR)\nPerformance 1 Year: -2.32%\nEnergizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR) ranks among our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in. The company sees mixed analysts\u2019 opinions amid the company\u2019s release of the Q3 earnings report for 2025.\nMissouri-based company, Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR), is among the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of primary batteries and portable lights. With a comprehensive portfolio that includes brands like Energizer, Eveready, Rayovac, and Varta, the company markets automotive and personal care products to retailers, distributors, and direct consumers across various channels in over 165 countries.\nIn its 2025 third-quarter earnings report, released on August 4, 2025, the company announced that it exceeded its outlook across net sales, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted EPS. Particularly, the recent acquisition of Advanced Power Solutions NV (APS NV) contributed $20.8 million to Net Sales. In addition to this, Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR)\u2019s \u201cProject Momentum\u201d delivered approximately $12 million in savings during the quarter, indicating successful internal operational efficiency initiatives.\nAcknowledging the growth, analysts, including Truist and UBS, raised their price target on the stock. Truist raised the price target from $30 to $35 while UBS raised it from $23 to $29. On the other hand, Canaccord Genuity maintains a Hold rating on Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR), signaling mixed opinions on the stock.\nThe company gained 27.23% this week, sharply reversing its modest annual decline of 2.32%, increasing its appeal to investors seeking short-term investments in the consumer staples sector.\n10. Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER)\nPerformance 1 Year: -12.17%\nTeradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) earns a rank in our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in. The company experienced an upward movement in stock price following better performance in the Semiconductor Test segment and the launch of Magnum 7H.\nHeadquartered in Massachusetts, Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) designs, manufactures, and sells automated test equipment for semiconductors and electronics. The company also focuses on robotics solutions, including collaborative and mobile robots through subsidiaries like Universal Robots and Mobile Industrial Robots.\nOn July 29, 2025, Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) reported its second-quarter 2025 results, with revenue of $652 million surpassing the company\u2019s mid-point guidance ranges. The Semiconductor Test segment, which generated $492 million in revenue due to System-on-a-Chip (SOC) applications for artificial intelligence (AI), was the primary contributor. The company\u2019s CEO, Greg Smith, has made the following statement:\n\u201cThe exact timing of program ramps and capacity adds remain uncertain, but we believe that AI will drive strong second half performance for Teradyne.\u201d\nFurthermore, on August 4, 2025, Teradyne launched the Magnum 7H, a next-generation memory tester specifically designed for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) devices integrated with GPUs and accelerators in high-performance, generative AI servers. Currently, in the production and shipping process of the Magnum 7H system to HBM manufacturers, the company claims that its new launch solidifies its market leadership by supporting current and future HBM technologies.\nTeradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER)\u2019s stock price jumped 18.09% this week, hinting at strong near-term sentiment despite a 12.17% drop over the past year."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at 10 stocks with huge catalysts on the horizon.\nWhen the president of the US leaves a meeting with the Federal Reserve sounding confident that interest rates will fall, investors cannot help but take notice. On July 25, 2025, Donald Trump signaled that the Fed is finally leaning in favor of monetary easing, just as the White House ramps up pressure to accelerate the process. As CNBC reports, the U.S. President believes Fed Chair Jerome Powell is ready to recommend rate cuts. The cuts could potentially shake up equity markets in the coming months.\nWith futures markets increasingly pricing in a potential cut before year-end, the market is set for a major shift in capital flows. Companies that could benefit from declining rates, such as those engaged in consumer lending, housing, and capital-intensive growth plans, may see a substantial upside in the coming months. The resulting optimism is already attracting big-name investors, and institutional positioning suggests that this is not a speculative move but a strategic one.\nIn addition to the potential rate cuts, there are companies poised to benefit from some huge catalysts that may either be market-specific, industry-specific, or company-specific. Recognizing these stocks allows investors to make informed decisions with their money.\nAnd so, in this article, we spotlight 10 stocks with massive catalysts on the horizon. Stay with us as we count them down from 10 to 1. The top 5 might bring a change to your portfolio.\nOur Methodology\nWe have put together our list of 10 stocks with huge catalysts on the horizon by looking at potential industry or company-specific catalysts from credible sources, including the company\u2019s press reports and official news sites such as CNN and CNBC.

We gathered this information from the Insider Monkey database.\nAll the data used in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of July 28, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10.

(NYSE:ACA) manufactures infrastructure-related products and services. Operating in three segments \u2014construction products, engineered structures, and transportation products \u2014the company serves a variety of infrastructure markets, including construction, energy, and transportation.\nArcosa, Inc. (NYSE:ACA)\u2019s Engineered Structures business has been gaining massive orders owing to the rise in the number of grid hardening and reliability initiatives. Specifically, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has enabled the company to achieve $1.1 billion worth of new orders through 2028. A notable portion of these orders is for wind energy projects expanding in the Southwest.\nNew towers are being delivered with the help of the new plant introduced in New Mexico in 2024, thus acting on the massive order intakes and strong backlogs. Barclays and Oppenheimer stick to their Buy rating on the stock, despite President Jesse Collins\u2019s significant sale of 8,616 shares of the company\u2019s stock in a transaction valued at $744,388.\nWith 23 hedge funds backing the stock with a moderate level of institutional interest, Arcosa, Inc.
