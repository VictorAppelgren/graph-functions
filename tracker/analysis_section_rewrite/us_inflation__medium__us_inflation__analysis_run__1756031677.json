      "feedback": "The draft shows breadth and plausibility but falls short on a disciplined, 3–6 month horizon map, a transparent causal chain, and explicit triggers/invalidations; it threads many themes (AI productivity, Pacaso/mogul real estate, HeartSciences, UAS, tires, Japan wage dynamics) with thin linkage to risk, timing, and asset flows, and it occasionally cites non‑ID specifics or conflates distinct sources. To upgrade to world‑class, implement: 1) a tight scenario map keyed to 0–3 and 3–6 month windows, pairing each catalyst (Pacaso expansion, mogul performance, HeartSciences FDA/reimbursement, AI‑driven wealth tools like Range, UAS job growth, BoJ wage momentum, durable consumer tech like budget tires) with a clear causal chain (policy/liquidity -> flows into AI/tech platforms -> asset prices and cash flows) and explicit timing; 2) explicit triggers and invalidations with thresholds (e.g., Pacaso announces 10 new destinations and 21% YoY gross volume growth sustained into 6 weeks; HeartSciences FDA/Medicare milestones cut regulatory risk; Range AI engine delivers X bps annual productivity, sustaining disinflation pressures; BoJ wage growth persists); also specify invalidation if any trigger underperforms by a defined delta; 3) base case and 1–2 alts anchored in numbers from sources: for AI productivity, cite 1–1.5% annualized uplift (Range/World Economic Forum context) and translate into 3–6 month implications; for Pacaso/mogul, cite 21% YoY volume growth, 18.8% cash‑on‑cash yields, 1.8T TAM, and 40% of Americans wanting a vacation home; for HeartSciences, note Medicare reimbursement start and FDA breakthrough signals; for UAS, cite 97% rise in UAS jobs and salary; for Japan, quantify wage/term‑premium risk; 4) rigorous reconciliation of conflicts (AUVSI’s defunct projection versus current UAS data; distinguish long‑horizon industry claims from 2025 data); 5) maximize first‑principles grounding by tying each channel to cash flow, earnings, or valuation levers rather than qualitative statements; 6) sharpen quantification, avoiding generalities and citing exact ranges or point estimates; 7) tighten the citation map to use only IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL (V8TEZOR8R, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK) and remove stray “HeartSciences” tagging unless you map it to a source ID; 8) present a succinct watch‑list with concrete data releases (inflation prints, wage data, UAS hiring data, Pacaso/mogul fundraisings or deal updates, HeartSciences regulatory milestones, tire maintenance spending signals) and 9) end with clearly labeled base case, 1–2 alts, risk factors, watch signals, and a defined confidence level. This will yield a coherent, presentation‑ready horizon frame with verifiable data points and precise invalidation triggers.",
