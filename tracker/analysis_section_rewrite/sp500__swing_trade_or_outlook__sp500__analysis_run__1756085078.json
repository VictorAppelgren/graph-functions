      "feedback": "The draft shows solid macro framing and credible Ford-specific data, but it violates the SECTION FOCUS in two crucial ways: it does not present exactly four Movers & Scenarios lines (2 Up, 2 Down) formatted as Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and it folds a separate Swing Trade plan into the same prose with inconsistent horizons; it also drifts into alt-asset narratives (Netflix/KO/Alphabet) that dilute focus from Ford’s regime-driven path. Actionable edits: (1) reconstitute Movers & Scenarios into exactly four lines—two Up and two Down—each strictly as “Up | [0–3 weeks] or [3–6 months] | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %,” anchoring probabilities to explicit material (e.g., tariff regime around 10% baseline with China levies up to ~34% [SGB2PAZGK], Ford EV metrics (losses ~$1.3B, adj margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%, forward P/E ~8–10.3x, dividend ~5.2%) [65UUBU0OR][22PL3Q360]). Remove the extra 2–6 weeks/entry-line from the movers block and place any near-term trade mechanics in the separate Swing Trade plan. (2) Add a concise first-principles frame (policy incentives -> capex schedules -> productivity -> cash-flow stability -> equity risk premia -> asset prices) and tie each mover to a node in that chain, with the Up line reflecting Regime A impulses (tariff pass-through and capex lift) and the Down line reflecting Regime B/C risk (higher discount rates, slower growth); cite the regime links (SGB2PAZGK) where you invoke them. (3) Keep the focus exclusively on Ford as the tradable asset for the Swing Trade plan; if including a Trade/Outlook Plan, deliver 1–2 lines only after the four movers, using Ford-specific figures and the material’s thresholds (e.g., EV-trajectory risk, ROIC, P/E band) to define Entry/Stop/Target and Trigger; avoid mixing Netflix/KO/Alphabet in the main outline. (4) Tighten quantification and avoid filler by replacing generic watch items with concrete thresholds (e.g., “Q2 EV losses persist ~$1.3B; adj EBIT ~4.3%; ROIC ~10.1%; dividend ~5.2%” [65UUBU0OR][22PL3Q360]); attach IDs after facts to satisfy the citation discipline. (5) Ensure the Swing Trade plan is a separate, succinct 1–2 line block if Ford is tradable, with clearly stated Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %, derived from the same Ford metrics and regime signals (no unresolved alt narratives). (6) Finally, prune the draft’s extraneous base-case paragraphs and watch-list sections so the deliverable is a tight, four-line mover block plus a one- or two-line trade outlook, with consistent formatting and no trailing citation lists.",
