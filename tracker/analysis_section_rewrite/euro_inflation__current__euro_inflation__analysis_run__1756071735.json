      "feedback": "The draft correctly flags the 0–3 week tension between a -0.3% Q2 contraction and a PMI of 50.9, but the causal chain and market logic should be sharpened for world‑class quality; upgrade by (1) tightening the core causality: Q2 demand/industrial weakness drags GDP, while a still‑animated PMI reflects pockets of activity that, if sustained, can prevent a hard downturn but do not imply durable expansion (cite 52EQBV548); (2) locking the 0–3 week horizon to explicit near‑term catalysts: the next S&P Global PMI release (August) and the Bundesbank monthly report, plus any revisions to Q2, with clearly stated implications for momentum (52EQBV548); (3) prescribing a concrete reaction function: if PMI stays above 50 in the upcoming release, expect range‑bound German assets and continued stagnation; if PMI slips below 50 or the Q2 contraction is revised more negative, anticipate renewed risk‑off and wider risk premia (52EQBV548); (4) explicit thresholds and invalidation: 50.0 is the key demarcation; 50.9 is the current reading; invalidate the baseline if PMI decisively falls under 50 or Q2 is revised beyond -0.3% (52EQBV548); (5) articulate a three‑scenario framing (baseline stagnation with resilience, upside from stronger external demand, downside from fading PMI) and keep all quantitative anchors tied to the cited numbers; (6) inline‑cite 52EQBV548 after the GDP, PMI, and Bundesbank statements, and drop the unrelated travel article to maintain focus and credibility; (7) flag any date/data consistency caveat (the piece reports 2023 Q2 data in a 2025 context) and phrase conclusions as “as reported by Reuters in 52EQBV548” for transparency.",
