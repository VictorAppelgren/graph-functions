  "description": "Chamelo\u2019s tint-changing smart sunglasses are as fun as they are practical, but these premium shades aren\u2019t for everyone.",
  "content": "I first spotted Chamelo\u2019s Shield sunglasses at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and I was immediately intrigued. I\u2019ve long dreamed of sunglasses that could adapt to changing light on the fly \u2014 something I wouldn\u2019t have to constantly take off and on while cycling through shifting weather, sun and shade. The Chamelo Music Shields promised exactly that, with tunable tinting, a sleek and sporty design and built-in open-ear speakers.\n\nOn paper, and in the hands of brand ambassador and NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury, they felt like the future of smart glasses: sleek, stylish and surprisingly practical.\n\nAfter over three months of wearing three different models nearly every day \u2014 on commutes and rides; in rain, sun and supermarkets; and even at night weaving through city traffic \u2014 I came away with a mix of admiration and a few key frustrations. They\u2019re ambitious, well-designed (if a little limited in style options) and genuinely fun to wear and show off. But they\u2019re not without quirks. If you\u2019re considering a pair of these unique wearables, here\u2019s what stood out, what fell short and how they held up in the real world.\n\nWhat I liked about them\n\nI wore Chamelo\u2019s Music Shields, Shields and Primes for over three months, logging more than 300 miles of cycling through New York City, New Orleans and San Francisco. I wore them on bright days, in the rain, on night rides, while running errands and during the Five Boro Bike Tour (a 40-mile ride across NYC). These weren\u2019t just reviewed; they became part of my daily routine (and still are).\n\nRight out of the box, the fit and weight impressed me. The Primes were the lightest at 1.1 oz, followed by the Shields at 1.3 oz, and the Music Shields at 1.7 oz (unsurprising given the speakers and battery). The Music Shields were especially comfortable, with no slipping, pinching or pressure. And when you\u2019re flying down a city street dodging traffic, the last thing you want is to fidget with your glasses. Manhattan motorists already seem to be trying to run you over for sport \u2014 this is one way to ensure they don\u2019t succeed.\n\nSurprisingly rich sound and even better battery life.\n\nThe built-in open-ear audio quality was another win. I didn\u2019t expect much, but the volume and clarity surprised me. They get loud \u2014 louder than Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans \u2014 and stay clear, even in noisy environments. Taking calls hands-free was seamless; everyone I spoke with could hear me perfectly, and I never had trouble hearing them.\n\nI streamed podcasts through Midtown traffic, took calls while pedaling across bridges and listened to music on subway platforms, all while staying aware of my surroundings and without annoying the people nearby. (There\u2019s a special place for people who blast music on speakers in public. Don\u2019t be that person.)\n\nThe Music Shields\u2019 function button powers them on, pairs them via Bluetooth and controls playback as well as your phone\u2019s assistant. I had full conversations with people while secretly listening to The Clash, Miles Davis, The Meters or a podcast. When I finally told them \u2014 and demoed the glasses \u2014 the most common response was, \u201cHoly sh*t I had no idea, I didn\u2019t hear a thing!\u201d\n\nChamelo\u2019s lenses use liquid crystal film to adjust tint, either manually or automatically, depending on the model. The transition is quick and smooth. I loved this most on the Primes and Shields, which feature AutoPilot, an ambient light sensor that adjusts tint automatically.\n\nWhether I was riding through tree-covered paths or walking into dim caf\u00e9s, the glasses just adapted. No swiping. No thought. They take a second or two to adjust, which is actually a plus \u2014 you don\u2019t want them flickering as you ride through alternating light and shade. Every model I tested features 100% UV protection at every tint level, so you won\u2019t have to worry about keeping your eyes safe from the sun.\n\nWith daily use, I charged the Music Shields every two days. Chamelo claims about 6.5 hours of continuous audio and up to 100 hours of tint adjustment on the Music Shields, and that was mostly accurate in my testing. At full (borderline uncomfortably loud) volume, the battery dropped to about 4 hours of continuous use, but their claim on just tint adjustment levels was spot-on.\n\nQuick charging was another bonus. Thirty minutes gave me enough power to last the whole day, especially on the Shields and Primes, which don\u2019t have built-in audio and can last a whopping 70 hours of tint adjustment on the Primes (true to Chamelo\u2019s claims) and 52 hours on the Shields.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, these don\u2019t scream, \u201cI\u2019m wearing smart glasses.\u201d The Primes have a classic Wayfarer-esque look, more Ray-Ban than RoboCop. The Shields and Music Shields lean sportier, but not over the top.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like about them\n\nWhile I\u2019ve come to use Chamelo\u2019s lineup daily \u2014 mainly the Music Shields because I can\u2019t give up built-in audio on rides \u2014 they\u2019re not perfect.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the limited tint range, which varies on each model (the Music Shields are 63\u201317%, Shields are 54\u201317%, and Primes are 45\u20139% visual light transmittance). It\u2019s decent but could be better \u2014 none go fully clear or super dark, which makes nighttime use less than ideal and can still leave you squinting in bright sun.\n\nAnother gripe is that the Music Shields lack AutoPilot. Instead, you just get a manual touch slider for tint, which can be inconsistent, especially if your fingers are sweaty, it\u2019s raining or you\u2019re in motion. There\u2019s no feedback (haptic, audio or visual), so you can\u2019t tell if your adjustment registered. Often, I\u2019d swipe thinking I had more range, only to realize I was already at max or minimum. In my testing, about three out of 10 swipes didn\u2019t register. The Shields and Primes, on the other hand, had perfect responsiveness with 10 out of 10 swipes registered.\n\nStyle options are also limited. The frames worked for me, but Chamelo\u2019s small lineup may not fit all head sizes or style preferences. To their credit, they\u2019ve been adding more, including the new Prismatic series with color-changing tint (which I haven\u2019t tried).\n\nLastly, the charging cables. While the magnetic USB-A to Pogo Pin charging cable is great, each model requires its own unique cable. Juggling three pairs meant juggling three different chargers that look very similar but are incompatible.\n\nIf you only own one pair, no problem. But if you collect sunglasses like I do (20 pairs in active rotation and counting), fumbling around trying to find the right cable for a particular pair is annoying, to say the least.\n\nAfter three months and 300 miles, it\u2019s clear Chamelo is onto something. These aren\u2019t perfect smart, variable-tint glasses, but they do fill a real need in a stylish, functional way.\n\nThe Music Shields are ideal for cyclists and commuters who want music, voice assistant access and variable lenses, though the lack of AutoPilot and limited tint range are misses. The Primes were my favorite for daily wear, with lightweight, stylish and smooth AutoPilot transitions, but no speakers. The Shields are a great outdoor exercise option with AutoPilot for those who don\u2019t need audio.\n\nFor runners, cyclists, commuters or just fans of smart sunglasses, Chamelo\u2019s lineup is worth the money. They\u2019re priced slightly on the premium side, but not outrageously so.\n\nThey\u2019re not perfect, but the fact that the Music Shields have become my default riding glasses even after testing ended says a lot. More importantly, they\u2019ve made my rides safer, smoother and a hell of a lot more fun.\n\nCNN Underscored editors thoroughly test all the products we cover, and we take smart sunglasses just as seriously as we do laptops and all other tech. We\u2019re made up of an experienced team of editors and writers who provide full transparency about our testing methodology. In addition to his 15-plus years of experience producing content all over the globe (including no shortage of trips spent trying out tech gadgets), senior video producer Enrique Perez is an avid lifelong cyclist who truly put these sunglasses through their paces over several months.",

      "text": "Silicon Valley thinks it\u2019s finally found the next big thing in tech: smart glasses \u2013 the same thing Google tried (and failed at) more than a decade ago.\nBut Google Glass may simply have been ahead of its time. Now tech companies believe technology has finally caught up, thanks in part to artificial intelligence\u2014and they\u2019re going all-in on truly \u201csmart\u201d glasses that can see and answer questions about the world around you.\nThe latest example: Snap announced this past week it\u2019s building AI-equipped eyewear to be released in 2026.\nThe renewed buzz around smart glasses is likely the combination of two trends: a realization that smartphones are no longer exciting enough to entice users to upgrade often and a desire to capitalize on AI by building new hardware around it.\nThat\u2019s why, although smart glasses aren\u2019t entirely new, advancements in AI could make them far more useful than the first time around. Emerging AI models can process images, video and speech simultaneously, answer complicated requests and respond conversationally.\nAnd that could make smart glasses finally worth wearing.\n\u201cAI is making these devices a lot easier to use, and it\u2019s also introducing new ways people can use them,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager covering wearable devices for market research firm The International Data Corporation.\nMeet the new class of smart glasses\nGoogle, Snap, Meta and Amazon have previously released glasses with cameras, speakers and voice assistants.\nBut the Google Glass of a decade ago never caught on. The screen was tiny, the battery life was short and the \u201cglasses\u201d themselves were expensive and unfashionable. More modern glasses like Amazon\u2019s Echo Frames, Meta\u2019s original Ray-Ban Stories and early versions of Snap\u2019s Spectacles made it easier to listen to music or take photos hands-free. Yet these still didn\u2019t do anything you couldn\u2019t already do with a smartphone.\nThis newer crop of smart glasses is far more sophisticated.\nFor example, when I tried prototype glasses based on Google\u2019s software last year, I asked Google\u2019s Gemini assistant to provide cocktail ideas based on liquor bottles I had been looking at on a shelf. The glasses will also remember what you\u2019ve seen and answer questions based on that: During its I/O developers conference in May, a Google employee asked Gemini for the name of a coffee shop printed on a cup she has looked at earlier.\nWith the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, users can perform tasks like asking whether a pepper they\u2019re looking at in a grocery store is spicy or translate conversations between languages in real time. Two million pairs have been sold since their 2023 debut, Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica said in February.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been several years of various failed attempts,\u201d said Andrew Zignani, senior research director of ABI Research\u2019s Strategic Technologies team. \u201cBut there\u2019s finally now some good concepts of what\u2019s working.\u201d\nAnd market research indicates the interest will be there this time. The smart glasses market is estimated to grow from 3.3 million units shipped in 2024 to nearly 13 million by 2026, according to ABI Research. The International Data Corporation projects the market for smart glasses like those made by Meta will grow from 8.8 in 2025 to nearly 14 million in 2026.\nWhat\u2019s coming next\nSnap didn\u2019t reveal many details about its forthcoming \u201cSpecs\u201d glasses but did say they will \u201cunderstand the world around you.\n\u201cThe tiny smartphone limited our imagination,\u201d Snap wrote in a blog post announcing the glasses. \u201cIt forced us to look down at a screen, instead of up at the world.\u201d\nApple is also said to be working on smart glasses to be released next year that would compete directly with Meta\u2019s, according to Bloomberg. Amazon\u2019s head of devices and services Panos Panay also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of camera-equipped Alexa glasses similar to those offered by Meta in a February CNN interview.\n\u201cBut I think you can imagine, there\u2019s going to be a whole slew of AI devices that are coming,\u201d he said in February.\nAI assistant apps, like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Search and Gemini apps, are already laying the foundation for smart glasses by using your phone\u2019s camera to answer questions about your surroundings. OpenAI is putting its tech in everything from a mysterious new gadget co-designed by Apple veteran Jony Ive to future Mattel toys.\nGoogle said last month that it would bring more camera use to its search app, a sign that it sees this technology as being key to the way people find information in the future. Apple this past week announced updates to its Visual Intelligence tool that let users ask questions about content on their iPhone\u2019s screen, in addition to their surroundings, by using its camera.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently reiterated his belief that smart glasses could become critical to how people use technology during testimony in a federal antitrust case.\n\u201cA big bet that we have at the company is that a lot of the way that people interact with content in the future is going to be increasingly through different AI mediums, and eventually through smart glasses and holograms,\u201d he said in April.\nDo people actually want smart glasses?\nStill, tech giants need to get regular people to buy in. This includes potential privacy concerns, which played a big role in Google Glass\u2019 demise. Recording video with camera-equipped glasses is more subtle than holding up your phone, although Meta and Google\u2019s glasses have a light on the front to let other people know when a wearer is capturing content.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge will be convincing consumers that they need yet another tech device in their life, particularly those who don\u2019t need prescription glasses. The products need to be worth wearing on people\u2019s faces all day.\nAnd these devices likely won\u2019t come cheap. Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans usually cost around $300, roughly the price of a smartwatch. While that\u2019s not nearly as expensive as the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro headset, it still may be a tough sell as people spend less on ancillary tech products. Global smartwatch shipments fell for the first time in March, according to Counterpoint Research, perhaps a sign that customers aren\u2019t spending as much on devices they may not view as essential.\nYet tech firms are willing to make that bet to avoid missing out on what could be the next blockbuster tech product.\n\u201cMany in the industry believe that the smartphone will eventually be replaced by glasses or something similar to it,\u201d said Ubrani the IDC analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen today. It\u2019s going to happen many years from now, and all these companies want to make sure that they\u2019re not going to miss out on that change.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Chamelo\u2019s Music Shields, Primes, and Shields combine variable\u2011tint lenses, lightweight design, and in\u2011built audio to create a practical, stylish option for cyclists, commuters, and outdoor enthusiasts. Over three months and 300 miles of real\u2011world use, the glasses impressed with smooth AutoPilot tint transitions, 100\u202f% UV protection, and surprisingly clear open\u2011ear sound, though the Music Shields lack AutoPilot and offer a limited tint range that can leave users squinting in bright or dark conditions. Practical drawbacks include inconsistent manual tint control on the Music Shields, a small style lineup, and the need for separate charging cables for each model. Despite these quirks, the reviewer finds the Music Shields the go\u2011to pair for rides and recommends the Primes for everyday wear, while noting the broader smart\u2011glasses market is poised for growth as AI and camera\u2011enabled devices from Google, Meta, Snap, Apple and Amazon enter the fray.",
