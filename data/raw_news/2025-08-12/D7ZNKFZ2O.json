  "title": "The 3 Dire Wolves Who Were Brought Back from Extinction Meet for the First Time in Captivating Video",
  "description": "Colossal Biosciences provided an update on the three dire wolves the genetic engineering company brought back from extinction, detailing what happened when the animals met face-to-face for the first time.",
  "content": "Until recently, Colossal Biociences has kept the three dire wolves it brought back from extinction separated, with the two males, Romulus and Remus, in one habitat, and the one female, Khaleesi, in another.\n\nOn August 12, the biotechnology and genetic engineering company committed to its ongoing de-extinction project , shared an update video about the three revived animals, including footage of all the dire wolves meeting face-to-face for the first time.\n\nIn the clip, Khaleesi meets her brothers individually first, starting with Romulus, before all three get a chance to play together. Trainers noticed that during Romulus and Khaleesi's time together, Khaleesi darted towards a stack of logs in the habitat and climbed under them when her brother started chasing her. This was likely a safety precaution Khaleesi took to feel more comfortable and in control around her larger brother. \n\n\"She's a really smart little dire wolf,\" says the trainer featured in the footage. \"She's small enough that she can make it under some of the logs, and Romulus couldn't, so that helped her control the interactions.\"\n\nAfter some time under the logs, Khaleesi comes back out to continue playing with her brother; occasionally returning to the logs when she wants a safe space.\n\nIn the footage, the trainer also notes that the wolves\u2019 ears were \u201cup the entire time\u201d during their play session, a good sign indicating comfort and happiness.\n\nOnce Khaleesi got to know Romulus, she was introduced to Remus. The trainer notes in the video that both the dire wolves were excited to meet and that Remus was more gentle with his sister than Romulus.\n\nAfter two successful meetings, all three of the dire wolves were able to play together.\n\n\"From here on out, we are going to alternate introducing her to one brother,\" says the trainer in the clip. \"So, like, one day she'll get to hang out and play with Remus, and the next day it'll be Romulus. And we'll just alternate over and over, to give her a sense of confidence.\"\n\n\"We want her to feel like she's controlling all of her interactions with them. So we're going with a cautious approach,\" they add.\n\nOnce Khaleesi grows slightly larger, Colossal Biosciences will consider housing the three dire wolves together, but only if the animals appear confident and comfortable with each other.\n\n\"We want to make sure that nobody is injured, no one is scared,\" the trainer explains.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\nColossal Biosciences first announced the arrival of the three dire wolves back in April, in a statement from CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm.\n\n\"Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,\" said Lamm at the time. \"It was once said, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' Today, our team gets to unveil some of the magic they are working on and its broader impact on conservation.\"",

The First Step in Reviving a Prehistoric Mammoth Starts with Adorable Rodent (Exclusive) Although scientists say the woolly mouse project won\u2019t go on indefinitely, don\u2019t worry \u2013 there\u2019s already people from the team waiting to adopt them By Susan Young Susan Young Susan Young is a reporter for PEOPLE. She started working for PEOPLE in 2008, covering entertainment, human interest, crime, health and breaking news stories. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on March 5, 2025 01:50PM EST 1 Comment Scientists at the Dallas-based Colossal Biosciences have taken a big step towards their goal of bringing back the woolly mammoth by creating what they've dubbed Colossal Woolly Mouse\"I'm excited,\" Beth Shapiro, Chief Science Officer at Colossal, tells PEOPLE of the new mice, which have been genetically modified to have woolly mammoth traits\u201cIn the next six months, we\u2019ll see if our woolly mice are actually happier in cooler environments, which is the predicted effects of these changes,\u201d she adds Behold, the woolly mouse. Scientists at the Dallas-based Colossal Biosciences have taken a small step towards their goal of bringing back the woolly mammoth: Colossal Woolly Mouse. \"I'm excited,\" Beth Shapiro, Chief Science Officer at Colossal, tells PEOPLE, explaining that this is \"really our first validation\" that they actually can create living animals that have been genetically modified to have woolly mammoth traits. \"It's the first time that we've succeeded,\" she adds. Like woolly mammoths, these mice have curlier hair \u2014 which is the same color of the mammoth mummies found in the permafrost \u2014 as well as a gene that should impact the way their bodies metabolize fat. Colossal Wooly Mouse. Colossal Biosciences To be clear, there was not a prehistoric, or even historic woolly mouse. But, in order for the scientists to prove they were on the right track in the quickest possible time, they chose to perform the experiment with mice rather than actual elephants \u2014 which are the closest living relative to the woolly mammoth. From left, scientists Anna Keyte, Beth Shapiro, Sara Ord and Woolly Mouse house. Colossal Biosciences (4) \u201cElephants have a 22-month gestation and then it takes another decade to reach sexual maturity,\" explains Shapiro, who pointed out that that's a \"long time\" to wait to see if their experiment would in fact lead to elephants having a woolly coat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" she adds. But since mice only have a 20-day gestation, that made them a more ideal choice. Chart of woolly mammoth and Colossal Woolly Mouse. Colossal Biosciences A unique feature of the mammoth are clumps on their back filled with fat to help keep the animal both insulated and energized during long, frigid months in largely barren landscapes. The Colossal woolly mouse is the first living animal engineered to express multiple cold-adapted traits using mammoth gene orthologs (genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene and normally retain the same function). As such, they represent a living model for studying cold-climate adaptations in mammals. \u201cIn the next six months, we\u2019ll see if our woolly mice are actually happier in cooler environments, which is the predicted effects of these changes,\u201d Shapiro says. According to Colossal, their efforts \u2014 which ideally will result in creating a hybrid species that's virtually genetically indistinguishable from woolly mammoths \u2014 could also lead to breakthroughs in the fight against elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses. EEHV is a highly-dangerous and fatal condition that wreaks havoc in young Asian elephants. Beth Shapiro. Colossal Biosciences In addition to the mammoth, Colossal is working on two other \"de-extinction\" projects: bringing back the Dodo and the Thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger. Along with Shapiro, Anna Keyte, who is leading the Dodo efforts, and Sara Ord, who is heading the Thylacine project, say it's difficult to explain to their families exactly what they do for a living. But they try to put it into terms that allow people to understand this is more than just making a real-life Jurassic Park or creating a new exotic pet. Right now, Keyte is thinking a lot about the implications of bird flu, which has taken out some recovering populations of birds. \u201cIt has been really bad for California condors, so one of the things we think about in our de-extinction pipeline is not only bringing back species we\u2019ve lost, but making them resilient to the challenges of today,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. Sara Ord. Colossal Biosciences Ord notes that there is also perhaps a moral or ethical angle to bringing back species that were killed off through human interference. The Thylacine, a carnivorous marsupial, was aggressively hunted to extinction in the course of about 100 years. The Australian government signed a species protection act in July 1936, but just two months later the last animal, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, died. \u201cIt's an example of a human caused extinction,\" says Ord. \"And so how responsible are we to bring back this species that we drove away?\" One of the 'World's Rarest' Fish, Thought to Be Extinct, Rediscovered After 85 Years The team leaders of the three de-extinction projects are all women, something you would not have seen in the scientific world even a few years ago. Women have been underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) for many years. Women remain underrepresented in STEM occupations, with two-thirds (65%) men and about one-third (35%) women. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of women in the STEM workforce increased 31%, from 9.4 million to 12.3 million. (National Science Foundation, 2022) Shapiro tells PEOPLE she\u2019s been watching the proportion of women in the system grow. \u201cIt brings a different set of viewpoints that we really need,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're trying to solve some of the hardest problems in biology. It is going to take that sort of diversity of experience, diversity of viewpoints. It\u2019s not just the technology that\u2019s going to make that happen.\u201d Colossal Wooly Mouse. Colossal Biosciences As for the woolly mice, where do they go from here? \u201cThis is not a project that will go on indefinitely. It served a purpose of testing genotype to phenotype, which we got positive results,\u201d says Ord. But do not fear for the living mice, because there are plenty of takers once their work is done. \u201cThe CEO Ben Lamm made the comment \u2018Don\u2019t let Sara know because she\u2019s going to be adopting all of them,' \u201d Ord says with a laugh. \u201cWe all are not only passionate about the science, but passionate about the animals. And that holds all the way to the wooly mouse.\u201d Leave a Comment Read more: Human Interest Human Interest News"

People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 8, 2025 01:18PM EDT 1 Comment Colossal Biosciences says gene-editing technology helped it essentially revive the extinct dire wolves famously seen in Game of ThronesThe company's headline-grabbing work has attracted a range of supporters, including celebrities Joe Manganiello\"With Colossal\u2019s work to protect and conserve the environment, it would be unethical not to support them,\" Manganiello tells PEOPLE Dire wolves have made a prehistoric comeback \u2014 more or less \u2014 all thanks to a leading genetics company. The canine, last seen in the real world nearly 13,000 years ago and made famous through Game of Thrones, has essentially been brought back from extinction, according to Colossal Biosciences, which recently created modified gray wolves that have the characteristics of dire wolves. For actor Joe Manganiello (no stranger to wolves himself) and the team at Colossal, learning about the legendary animals and how to care for them has been quite the wild ride. \u201cGiven some of our proprietary extraction tools and technologies, we knew about some aspects of the dire wolf, but we didn\u2019t know it had an arctic-like fur and that its tail is thick like a fox,\u201d Ben Lamm, Colossal's CEO, tells PEOPLE. The company says it uses gene editing to modify the traits of existing animals as part of its de-extinction project \u2014 not quite Jurassic Park, but close enough. In the case of the dire wolves, the Colossal scientists relied on DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull in order to better understand what made up the animals' DNA. Then, through gene editing, they birthed modified gray wolves that are, in effect, like modern-day dire wolves. The result? Romulus, Remus and Khalessi, yes, a nod to Thrones \u2014 three young dire wolves now living in a nature preserve in North America who carry the traits of these long-lost giant canines.

Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences Caring for a species that hasn\u2019t existed in thousands of years took time and a team of experts. \u201cI have a fortunate, really experienced team that has worked with everything from critically endangered elephants and lions and tigers to the Perdido Key mouse to the Hawaiian kingfisher,\u201d Matt James, the chief animal officer at Colossal, tells PEOPLE. He adds, \u201cThey bring a wealth of knowledge, and we extrapolate everything we know about close living relatives. In the case of the dire wolf, that's the gray wolf. ... We wrote a 165-page document that outlines how you care for a dire wolf, covering everything from what they eat to how much space they require to learning how you manage social groups of a species that's never been studied.\" One of the 'World's Rarest' Fish, Thought to Be Extinct, Rediscovered After 85 Years The project has garnered notable support, including from Manganiello, 48, and, in the past, Tom Brady \u2014 adding an extra layer of excitement to this endeavor. \u201cI've had a lifelong obsession with biology and genetics. It\u2019s a bit of a hobby of mine,\u201d Manganiello shares, explaining his interest in extinct species. \u201cBecause of that obsession, mixed with the fact that, yes, I played a werewolf for many years, I was contacted by Ben Lamm at Colossal,\" the actor continues. \"We talked, and then I was invited to the laboratory in Dallas and then from there, I was invited to invest and actually join the board of advisors.\" \"So I got to meet [co-founder] George Church and hold an 11,000-year-old apex predator,\" Manganiello says. \"I mean, come on. There is no bucket list for things like this.\u201d Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences Despite the excitement, Manganiello acknowledges some public concerns about attempting to bring back extinct species.

(Colossal has been working with other species and recently unveiled the woolly mouse.) The former True Blood star adds, \u201cI know that there's the question of playing God, and just because we can do it, should we?\" But \"the fact is, because of the choices we've made as a society, we are eradicating our environment at a global scale, and at a rate that needs to be slowed,\" he says. \"With Colossal\u2019s work to protect and conserve the environment, it would be unethical not to support them.

Eighteen months ago, we decided we should create a dire wolf. Now, we\u2019re talking about dire wolves that already exist.

Credit : Courtesy of Colossal Biosciences NEED TO KNOW Colossal Biosciences shared a growth update on the world's first \"de-extinct\" dire wolvesMale pups Romulus and Remus weigh over 90 pounds at six months, outgrowing standard gray wolvesSlightly younger female pup, Khalessi, currently weighs 35 pounds and will likely join Romulus and Remus' pack soon The world's first revived dire wolves are growing up, and fast. The three dire wolves, two males named Remus and Romulus and one female named Khaleesi, are showcased in a six-month growth report from Colossal Biosciences, published on June 20. Colossal brought back the species as part of its ongoing de-extinction project. Matt James, Colossal's Chief Animal Officer, shared in the update video that the project is going to plan, with the new dire wolf pups hitting all their milestones. Romulus and Remus are preparing for their first annual vet appointments. The medical check-ins are exciting and necessary for the Colossal team, as they provide an opportunity to draw blood from the dire wolves and perform CT imaging, which will grant the team a more in-depth picture of what is happening with the animal's skeletal and muscular systems. \"Today, Romulus and Remus, at a little over six months old, weigh a little more than 90 pounds, which is about 20% larger than a standard gray wolf,\" James shared in the video update. \"So we can really tell that the dire wolf genes are kicking in and we're getting these nice large wolves that are much more representative of what we see in the ancient specimens.\" The two male dire wolves are well over double the size of the pups the public first met when Colossal introduced the animals in April. Romulus and Remus. Khaleesi, who James noted is a bit younger (about three months old) and more petite than her brothers, currently weighs around 35 pounds, making her roughly 15% to 20% larger than a standard gray wolf at that age. According to Paige McNickle, who manages the dire wolves\u2019 daily care team, Remus has begun to take on the role as leader of the pack, and Romulus is effectively \u201cstepping down and being more subordinate.\u201d \u201cRemus really likes to watch things, and he figures stuff out,\u201d explained McNickle. \u201cHe\u2019s also a little bit smaller, so sometimes that\u2019s interesting to think that the smaller of the two would be the more dominant. But he\u2019s crafty and he\u2019s always watching.\u201d Romulus, whom McNickle described as \"the beta,\" likes to go out first when the dire wolves eat and play, which McNickle called \"very much a beta trait,\" since it allows pack leaders to lead from the back. \"It may not stay that way as they continue to grow up,\" McNickle added. \"That may change. It could change when we add Khaleesi into the mix. As they're still young, that pack dynamic isn't set. It's still very fluid.\" As for the dire wolves' eating habits, McNickles reported that the animals are eating adult-sized portions of high-quality dog kibble, ground meat, and organ meats. Romulus and Remus. As the animals get older, McNickle confirmed, they'll be given whole prey items to assist in nurturing \"their abilities and instincts\" of eating in the wild. For now, Khalessi is being kept separate from Remus and Romulus and will join the pack as soon as she's big enough to do so safely. In the meantime, the animals can see and smell each other through a gate, to give the team an idea of the collective temperament. \"Before we make the introduction of bringing Khaleesi into the group with the boys, we're going to be looking for really strong indicators that they are socially compatible,\" explained James. \"We're really excited about that.\" Romulus and Remus. Following their de-extinction of the woolly mouse, Colossal announced the arrival of its dire wolves in a statement on Monday, April 7. \"Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,\" Colossal CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm said at the time. \"It was once said, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'

On Tuesday, July 8, Texas-based biotech company Colossal Biosciences announced a new initiative to genetically recreate the South Island giant moa, which vanished around 600 years ago due to overhunting and habitat loss. Jackson and his longtime partner Fran Walsh have contributed $15 million to the effort, marking their first public investment in the company. South Island giant moa. Colossal Biosciences \"Thinking of Colossal as just a de-extinction company is failing to understand their full potential, for these same scientific breakthroughs will also be used to rescue multiple endangered species currently on the brink of extinction,\" said Jackson, per Colossal's website. \"As far as the health of [the] natural world goes, this is the most positive news any of us could hope to receive. It's great \u2014 I'm feeling like an excited kid again.\" The project also includes a collaboration with the Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre at the University of Canterbury, representing New Zealand's principal M\u0101ori tribe in the South Island.

Colossal Biosciences Jackson, who owns one of the world's largest private moa bone collections, became involved after connecting with Colossal CEO Ben Lamm about two years ago, explained Jackson. That conversation led to a broader partnership. The early stages of the giant moa project will focus on recovering ancient DNA from well-preserved bone specimens and comparing it to the species' living relatives, like emus, to isolate the moa's unique traits. \"We are in the very early stages,\" said Colossal's chief scientist, Beth Shapiro, noting that birds pose specific challenges. Unlike mammals, bird embryos develop inside eggs, which complicates any future surrogate process. Still, the team hopes to eventually bioengineer a bird that closely resembles the extinct moa in size and form. South Island giant moa. Colossal Biosciences Colossal's announcement comes on the heels of its headline-making claim that it produced three dire wolf pups last year by modifying gray wolf DNA. The company is also working on reviving the woolly mammoth, dodo, and Tasmanian tiger. Its method \u2014 dubbed \"de-extinction\" \u2014 uses ancient DNA, CRISPR gene editing, and cloning to reintroduce lost genetic traits into modern species. While the moa project is still in its foundational phase, the company says it has committed \"a large investment\" to ecological restoration in New Zealand. The goal is to rehabilitate former moa habitats to support native wildlife, though no timeline has been given for when a moa-like bird might be born.

Archaeologist Kyle Davis, an expert in moa remains, says the collaboration has \"reinvigorated the interest\" in M\u0101ori traditions and mythology tied to the iconic bird. But not all scientists are convinced. Critics argue that true de-extinction isn't technically possible; at best, researchers can create a hybrid species with some similar traits. Others worry that investing in long-gone animals may divert attention and resources from critically endangered species that are alive today. Peter Jackson (left), Bam Lamm (right) holding moa bones. Colossal Biosciences \"This is intellectually interesting, but should be a low priority,\" said Scott MacDougall-Shackleton, an avian biologist, to CNN Science, pointing to the hundreds of threatened island bird species urgently needing conservation. Lamm maintains the technology is meant to complement, not replace, traditional conservation. \"I think that we could have a scalable de-extinction system that isn't going to replace conservation, but it is kind of that additional backup that I think we need, especially in these dire cases,\" he said.\" Close Leave a Comment Read more: Human Interest Animals"

  "argos_summary": "Colossal Biociences has successfully introduced three revived dire wolves, Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, allowing them to interact for the first time after being kept separate. The company, which uses genetic engineering to bring back extinct species, shared footage of the wolves playing together, highlighting Khaleesi's cautious behavior around her larger brothers. As the wolves grow, Colossal plans to house them together, ensuring their comfort and safety. Additionally, Colossal is working on other de-extinction projects, including the woolly mammoth and the giant moa.",
