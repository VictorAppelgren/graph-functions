  "title": "Rees-Mogg clashes with Price Andrew biographer over \u2018gossip\u2019 behind new book",
  "description": "The book, called Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has made a series of claims about Prince Andrew\u2019s life",
  "content": "The author of a new biography about the Duke and Duchess of York has clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg over the book, which the GB News host branded as \u201csalacious gossip\u201d.\n\nThe book, called Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, written by Andrew Lownie, has made claims about the disgraced duke\u2019s life.\n\nIt includes accusations of affairs, fights with Prince Harry and of being \u201cunbelievably cruel\u201d to royal staff.\n\nBut the author was confronted by Mr Rees-Mogg over the sources he used in the joint biography, which has been serialised in the Daily Mail.\n\nWhen asked at the beginning of the interview why he had written the book, Mr Lownie said: \"There was a strong story there, especially with Andrew being in the news over [Jeffrey] Epstein \u2014 but what really interested me was how they leveraged their royal status for private gain, and the damage that did to the monarchy.\"\n\nBut the author was then questioned on the reliability of his sources, with Mr Rees-Mogg accusing him of predominantly using newspaper reports.\n\nDuring the interview, Mr Rees-Mogg asked Mr Lownie about a claim made in his book regarding the duke allegedly hiring an escort. He asked the author if his source, quoted as \u201cthe comedian Katy Brand has a story from a friend\u201d, was sound.\n\n\"Sometimes, that is all we have,\" Lownie said, to which Mr Rees-Mogg replied: That\u2019s my point. You\u2019ve got salacious gossip, starting with an unfounded allegation against Prince Philip. Would you have written it while he was alive and could have sued you for libel? You\u2019re making sleazy claims without solid evidence.\"\n\nThe author defended his sources, highlighting that he had interviewed 300 people, including on-the-record diplomats, naval personnel, and special royal representatives.\n\nAt the end of the heated exchange, Mr Rees-Mogg thanked the author for his \u201chatchet job\u201d.\n\nExtracts of the book have grabbed headlines in recent days, with a series of claims made about the duke and duchess and their relationships to the royal family.\n\nThe book has claimed Prince Andrew called a staff member in the Royal Household a \u201cf***ing imbecile\u201d for not referring to the Queen Mother by her full title in 2005.\n\nAccording to the book, Prince Andrew\u2019s catchphrase when dealing with royal staff was \u201cI want this done and I want this done now. Do it!\u201d\n\nMr Lownie also claims in his book that the relationship between the Duke of York and his younger nephews, William and Harry, was \u201cproblematic\u201d.\n\nThe Duke of York is alleged to have accused Prince Harry of going \u201cbonkers\u201d for marrying Megan Markle.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex told The Daily Telegraph that Prince Andrew did not \u201cever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry\u201d.\n\nThe spokesperson also denied the book\u2019s claim that the pair had ever gotten into a physical fight.",

      "text": "Prince Andrew\u2019s tragedy? He\u2019s been spoiled by neglect\nFor years, the Duke of York\u2019s monstrous behaviour was shielded from the world \u2013 but the intensely private and upsetting revelations in a new biography cannot be the start of a public rehabilitation, says Harry Mount\nHas there ever been such a drive-by shooting of a living figure by their biographer? A new book about Prince Andrew is so stuffed with allegations about sex and acts of stupidity that, even before it is published later this month, many have been left wondering if its author has simply gone too far.\nCertainly, there are many breathtaking allegations contained in Andrew Lownie\u2019s biography of the duke \u2013 his appalling treatment of Buckingham Palace staff, yet more links to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, how he was once given a bloody nose at a family gathering by Prince Harry, which Harry has strenuously denied. There are also several upsetting and intensely private revelations that appear to pass the legal threshold for a defamation lawsuit.\nThe Duke of York might yet choose to hit back at his tormentors in the courts. Were he to do so, it isn\u2019t hard to see how such an episode might help him plot his long-desired return to public life. Could this book be the Duke\u2019s first step on that road to rehabilitation?\nFew feel any sympathy towards Andrew, who for years has been an isolated figure. After he was so bovine to those around him, most friends have long since fled. With the death of Her late Majesty, he lost his main channel of support. His eldest brother, the King, tries to be supportive, but has to excuse him from all major state occasions.\nWhile we should resist the opportunity to rehabilitate Andrew, the most eye-popping allegations carried in the extract from the biography offer a glimpse of how he ended up an outcast in disgrace. Put simply, he is a man who has been spoiled by neglect.\nThe prince once had everything you could desire: palaces, money, status and, so the biography says, over 1,000 women who were prepared to go to bed with him. Throw in the fact that Andrew was always his mother\u2019s favourite, but that he lacks any of her legendary charm and intelligence, and you\u2019re left with a lethal cocktail of entitlement. It is fitting that the new biography is named Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\nThe miracle of the royal family over the last century came about thanks to Elizabeth II, who would have been 100 next year. Despite being in a similar hallowed position to her son at her birth, she escaped the dark taint of entitlement. That was partly luck. She was 10 when her uncle Edward VIII abdicated, and she became heir to the throne.\nUntil then, she was unlikely ever to become monarch, on the presumption Edward would have children. And so, for those 10 precious years, for all her fame, she wasn\u2019t treated with the crippling flattery of deference. She had the close, loving attention of her parents, themselves relatively insulated from the royal limelight.\nAs her nanny, Marion Crawford, aka Crawfie, revealed in The Little Princesses (1950), little Princess Elizabeth was also blessed with a decent, responsible, hard-working character with an obsession for order. She would line up her shoes neatly every night.\nNone of this for young Andrew. His mother\u2019s admirable sense of duty meant she was often absent from the nursery. His father, Prince Philip, was confident Andrew would get the same tough, no-nonsense education he\u2019d had at Gordonstoun. But Philip, despite his royal blood as a Greek prince, had had none of the entitled upbringing that would doom his son. Exiled from his Greek birthplace, shuffled from pillar to post as a boy, cut off from his Nazi in-laws, Philip developed an extraordinarily tough, self-denying approach to life.\nIn his royal cocoon, Andrew remained insulated from criticism, protected by a nation\u2019s reverence for his mother and the monarchy in general. An entitled buffoon like Andrew could get away with his monstrous behaviour for years as long as it was shielded from the world. To be fair, he was undeniably heroic as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands \u2013 and, ridiculous as it seems now with the benefit of hindsight, the nation cheered when he married Sarah Ferguson in 1986.\nBut those decades of spoiltness meant that, when the criticism started to trickle, and then pour, he was pathetically equipped to deal with it.\nMore intelligent souls learn the great lessons of being privileged: never being rude, and being able to say sorry even when not meaning it. Not Andrew.\nAnother disturbing allegation in the Lownie book is Andrew\u2019s response to a long-term royal employee who gets the Queen Mother\u2019s title slightly wrong \u2013 to which the Duke of York is reported to have responded: \u201cYou still don\u2019t know the proper way to refer to my grandmother? You f***ing imbecile. Get out!\u201d\nThat strain of moron was never going to be able to handle Emily Maitlis\u2019s 2019 grilling on Newsnight. In fact, characteristically, he thought afterwards it had all gone very well. And so, as the book says, Andrew was a pathetic mouse to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s rattlesnake when the two fatally flawed sex-obsessives first crossed paths.\nAll the good fairies were at baby Andrew\u2019s side at his 1960 birth \u2013 but so too were the devil triplets: stupidity, entitlement and indulgence by neglect.\nHarry Mount is author of \u2018How England Made the English\u2019 (Penguin \u00a312.99)\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

It all happened so fast. So very fast. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor.\n\u201cI landed on the dog\u2019s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.\u201d\nHarry writes that William left but returned \u201clooking regretful, and apologised\u201d. When William left again, Harry claims his brother \u201cturned and called back: \u2018You don\u2019t need to tell Meg about this.\u2019\u201d"
