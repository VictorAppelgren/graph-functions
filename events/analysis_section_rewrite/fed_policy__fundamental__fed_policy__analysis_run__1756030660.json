      "feedback": "This draft nails the macro-tape of a multi‑year regime (Jackson Hole, Fed path, and cross‑asset linkages) but it needs a sharper, world‑class frame. Strengthen by: (1) grounding in explicit first‑principles anchors (real policy rate differentials, terms of trade/productivity, and a BoP/externals lens) and then mapping regimes to observable signals (e.g., inflation trajectory and wage growth; policy reaction function shifts) rather than relying mainly on narrative signals; (2) formalize a multi‑year scenario structure (base, bull, bear) with transition triggers and clear invalidation rules; (3) spell out the transmission channels with concrete numerics pulled from sources (e.g., GX057ADL7 and H7Q52FKDH): cite 10‑yr yield near 4.23%, USD/JPY around 146.5, Tencent AI spend up ~150% in Q2, PBOC credit contraction, turnover >2 trillion yuan, and the potential for a 50bp/quarter‑edge in policy pricing; tie these to how equity, FX, and commodity prices would react under each regime; (4) fix cross‑source conflicts by testing competing signals: e.g., Bessent’s call for large cuts vs market pricing of a September cut vs Jackson Hole cadence; reconcile with the “don’t buy dips blindly” stance by defining conditions under which dips become opportunities rather than traps; (5) broaden source coverage beyond the three clips to cover the implied macro currents in GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I (and, where relevant, H7Q52FKDH) to avoid over‑reliance on a single narrative; (6) sharpen the risk set: add geopolitical/commodity‑shock channels (DRC minerals sanctions, SA trade frictions, Chips Act export controls) and give a probabilistic read on how they could reprice risk premia; (7) ensure precise, not generic, language about regime transitions (e.g., what would confirm a dovish shift vs what would invalidate it) and attach specific data triggers (CPI, JOLTS, PMI, etc.—as described in the Jackson Hole framing). In short, keep the strong cross‑asset logic, but codify a principled, numbers‑backed regime machine anchored in first principles and the cited numeric gateways; explicitly lay out base/bull/bear paths with defined triggers and explicit invalidation thresholds, and strand all assertions to the three core sources (GX057ADL7, H7Q52FKDH, 37UZC9X8I) while weaving in their quantitative signals to resolve conflicts.",
