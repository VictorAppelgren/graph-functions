      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still reads like a collection of bullet‑points rather than a coherent, first‑principles structural thesis. To reach world‑class quality, first strip out the aviation‑radar anecdote (BS3876D03) – it offers no causal link to market pricing and only dilutes focus. Re‑frame the Japanese‑bank narrative around the invariant anchors you’re required to cite: Japan’s near‑zero real interest rate differential relative to the U.S. (PA57YBYVQ), the country’s improving terms‑of‑trade from export‑growth, and the BoP surplus that fuels capital‑flow incentives. Show the causal chain: demographic slowdown → policy shift to “asset‑management centre” → overseas M&A (Mizuho, MUFG) → capture 5‑10 % of global AUM by 2030 → earnings lift 8‑12 % p.a. (cite PA57YBYVQ for the 1.3 T AUM figure and the 5‑10 % target). For Ford, anchor on the structural shift from ICE to EV: Q2 adjusted margin 4.3 % and ROIC 10.1 % (W2622L6WW), $1.3 B EV loss (W2622L6WW), forward P/E 10.3, 5.18 % dividend (W2622L6WW). Quantify the upside: if EV profitability turns positive, total return could rise to 5‑7 % (cite W2622L6WW for the 10‑year return vs. S&P). For CEO pay, use the 7.7 % rise to a $19 M median (O4ZEED2EB) and tie it to the policy reaction function of equity‑market performance: a 10 % market drop would compress pay growth to 2‑3 % (O4ZEED2EB). Structure the write‑up in a single paragraph: start with the base case, then list key risks (Fed tightening, EV cost drag, regulatory lag), watch signals (Fed minutes, EV sales, M&A announcements, CEO comp releases), and a confidence rating (moderate). Ensure every numeric claim is followed by a source ID (e.g., (PA57YBYVQ), (W2622L6WW), (O4ZEED2EB)) and avoid generic statements. This will tighten the causal chain, satisfy the section focus, and deliver a concise, data‑driven analysis.",
