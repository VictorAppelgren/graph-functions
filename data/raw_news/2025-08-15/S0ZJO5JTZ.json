  "description": "The Meta AI app has persistent flaws, months after the company launched it. Bloomberg\u2019s Natalie Lung discusses the issues and users\u2019 reactions to the app with Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow on \u201cBloomberg Tech.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "This is the post-launch digest. Tell us what we need to know. Yeah, we have tested the app for a few weeks and asking it basic inquiries, asking if a personalized recommendations. And overall, we found the experience rather inconsistent and it felt a little bit half baked. For example, I asked it to give me recommendations on what to do over the weekend here in New York City, and for some reason it knew my zip code. I might have provided it to an advertiser one time, but I wasn't able to personalize it to that area. And the unique thing about it, apart from rivals, is that it has a Discover feed where you can see how others are prompting and interacting with the chat bot and they're like endless images. There you can see endless images that perhaps are not relevant to you. And sometimes the more edgy types of chat bots you might not want to interface with. Natalie What's so weird, as well as I interact with Metro, I actually more within the WhatsApp offering and maybe within the Instagram offering. Why is that? Not taking my data that I'm feeding it and bringing it over to Metro? I right now, all of those experiences are not connected, as you rightly pointed out. It is on WhatsApp, it is on Messenger, it is on Instagram, but they are not connected, which makes it a little bit far short of some of the, you know, personalisation ambitions that soccer world has.",
