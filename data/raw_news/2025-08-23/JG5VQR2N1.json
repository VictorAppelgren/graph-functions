  "title": "If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Skellerup Holdings (NZSE:SKL) Presents An Opportunity",
  "description": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even...",
  "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Skellerup Holdings (NZSE:SKL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Skellerup Holdings with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow Quickly Is Skellerup Holdings Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Skellerup Holdings grew its EPS by 4.4% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Skellerup Holdings remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 6.9% to NZ$353m. That's a real positive.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skellerup Holdings\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Skellerup Holdings.\n\nAre Skellerup Holdings Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's a necessity that company leaders act in the best interest of shareholders and so insider investment always comes as a reassurance to the market. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own Skellerup Holdings shares worth a considerable sum. To be specific, they have NZ$23m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 2.3%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.",
