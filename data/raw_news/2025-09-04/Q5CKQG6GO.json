  "title": "Ready to ditch Windows 10? I debunked 7 Linux myths so you can switch with confidence",
  "description": "No, Linux isn't ugly. Let's bust this and several other myths that might keep you from adopting it as a Windows 10 replacement.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\u2022 Linux has suffered from a litany of myths over the years.\n\u2022 If you're on the fence, you'll be glad to know those myths aren't true.\n\u2022 Linux is easy, beautiful, and ripe for desktop users.\n\nI've been using Linux since the original Jurassic Park movie was released, and it seems every year I have to set some people straight on the truth about the open-source operating system. Since the early days, there have been myths about Linux that spread like a virus and threaten to prevent users of all types from adopting the operating system.\n\nThe thing about myths is that they are often not based in reality. I've already covered some of the Linux myths (six of them to be exact), and it's time to take on a few more. This is especially important with Windows 10 support coming to an end. You might have a Windows 10 computer that doesn't support Windows 11, and the idea of having to purchase new hardware doesn't exactly sit well with your budget. Because of that, you might be on the fence about Linux.\n\nAlso: The easiest way to try out Ubuntu Linux\n\nLet me see if I can tip you over to the greener pastures known as Linux.\n\nOnce upon a time, this was very true. Even though I was able to get the original Diablo working under Linux (back in the early 2000s), it was quite a challenge. Thanks to the likes of Steam, Proton, and other platforms, gaming on Linux has come a very long way. According to GamingOnLinux, the Steam market share for the open-source operating system has been (with just a few exceptions) steadily climbing since 2018, and the trend continues.\n\nAlso: The 6 Linux distros I recommend most for gaming in 2025 - including my favorite\n\nAccording to XDA, Linux usage on Steam has tripled in the last three years. Thanks to Steam, you no longer have to go through the steps of installing Wine and other pieces of complicated software to run your favorite games. I've installed Steam on many a Linux PC and found it works perfectly well (and is incredibly simple). Don't let the myths about gaming on Linux bust you.\n\n2. The Linux desktop is too different\n\nI'll admit there are some Linux desktop environments that are vastly different from what you're used to. Just take a look at GNOME, i3, Enlightenment, OpenBox, Xfce, or AfterStep and you'll see what I mean. Not one of those desktops looks or behaves like what you're used to. However, there are Linux desktops that look and feel almost identical to what you're used to. Consider KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, Pantheon, or Budgie, and you'll find desktops that look and feel very much like what you're used to.\n\nAlso: While Windows 10 users panic, Ubuntu makes extending support easy - here's how\n\nThere are some desktop distributions created to look specifically like Windows 10 or 11, such as AnduinOS and RefreshOS. If you fear change, but know that change is imminent, you don't have to worry that Linux is so vastly different that the migration will be even remotely challenging.\n\n3. Linux is too different from Windows\n\nHow do you interact with Windows? Most likely, you use a mouse and click on things. Guess what? The same thing holds true for Linux. You can single-click, double-click, and right-click your way through the day with ease. Linux has all of the tools you'll find in Windows, such as file managers, task managers, clickable icons, desktop menus, panels, system trays, user management tools, an app store, automatic updates, cross-platform support, and so much more. If Windows has it, Linux does as well.\n\nAlso: 6 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\n\nI've compared Linux and Windows, and every time I find Linux does the same things, only easier. Here's another thing to consider: nearly every task you do is handled through a web browser, and Linux has plenty of those. In the end, Linux is an operating system with the goal of making your life easier, more efficient, and more productive. Sound familiar?\n\nFirst off, I want to get something out of the way because there will be some people who will complain that \"Linux is just a kernel.\" Let's set that aside because it can easily confuse new users. Okay? Good. With that said, I've used nearly every operating system created (with the exception of OS/2), and I can say, without hesitation or doubt, that Linux is the most stable operating system I've ever used. In fact, just last night MacOS on my iMac decided to go haywire, causing me to do a hard reboot. The OS wouldn't respond, and there was nothing I could do but press and hold the power button until it restarted.\n\nAlso: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them all\n\nSure, that can also happen on Linux, but when it does, I can secure shell into my desktop and solve the problem without rebooting. The thing is, that rarely happens. There's an app on Linux called uptime, and it tells you how long since your machine's last reboot. I've seen reports of Linux machines running for over 2,000 days without needing a reboot. Try doing that with Windows or MacOS and see how far you get. Linux is very, very stable.\n\n5. There are too many choices, which can confuse users\n\nYes, Linux brings with it a lot of choices. There are a lot of distributions, kernels, desktop environments, browsers, terminal apps, email clients, package managers... the list goes on and on. But other than kernels and desktop environments, all operating systems have a lot of choices.\n\nAlso: My 10 favorite Linux distributions of all time, ranked\n\nWhen I am approached by a new user who feels there are too many options to know where to start, I point them to the major distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora) and tell them to try one of those and stick with the defaults. Those distributions have done a great job of making a lot of choices for the users (which desktop environment, package manager, browser, etc.) to alleviate this concern. Sure, there are a lot of things to choose from, but that doesn't mean you have to worry that you must make every choice. Linux isn't an a la carte menu, where you have to piece everything together. Pick a distribution and use it. Simple.\n\n6. Linux is only for servers and developers\n\nLinux powers more services than you can imagine -- most of which are on the server level. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Facebook, X, Uber, and so many more depend on Linux. In fact, if it weren't for Linux, those companies wouldn't be nearly as successful as they are. Linux is also a very popular operating system for developers of all sorts.\n\nAlso: 5 lightweight Linux distributions that will bring your old PC back to life\n\nCase in point, 53.4% of worldwide developers use Linux. Does that mean Linux is only for servers and developers? Absolutely not. Maybe back in the late 90s that would have been true, but today's Linux is as much about the user as it is the service. If Linux were dedicated to servers and developers, we wouldn't have so many different user-friendly desktop environments and simplified GUIs.\n\nThis is about as far from the truth as it gets. There are Linux distributions that ship with gorgeous desktops, some of which make MacOS and Windows look like trash. Consider Ubuntu Budgie, elementaryOS, FerenOS, Pop!_OS (with COSMIC desktop), Garuda Linux, KDE Neon, and XeroLinux and you'll find desktop distributions that are as beautiful as they are user-friendly.\n\nAlso: New to Linux? 5 desktop environments I recommend you try first - and why\n\nOn top of that, nearly every Linux desktop environment can be themed and highly customized. You can tweak the UI to look old-school or more modern than any desktop available. I've had Linux desktops that used transparency in ways no other desktop could dream about. I've tweaked Ubuntu Budgie until it was as stunning as any OS I've ever used.\n\nModern Linux is far more beautiful than either MacOS or Windows.",

      "text": "5 lightweight Linux distributions that will bring your old PC back to life\nDo you have an old PC lying around? Maybe your Windows 10 PC won't support Windows 11, and you're not interested in purchasing a new machine. What do you do?\nYou can turn to a lightweight Linux distribution. This type of operating system typically has very low system requirements and can make older machines feel as if they're brand new.\nAlso: 10 Linux apps I install on every new machine (and why you should, too)\nAlthough there are some distributions that claim to be lightweight, I'm limiting my choices to those whose system requirements are equal to or less than a 1GHz CPU, equal to or less than 2GB of RAM, and a minimum of 10GB storage. I've also only chosen those distributions that don't skimp on the features in favor of speed. But which distribution should you choose? Let me help you with that.\n1. Linux Lite\nLinux Lite is probably the best of all lightweight Linux distributions. Based on Ubuntu LTS and designed with user-friendliness in mind, Linux Lite uses the Xfce desktop to create a UI that's clean and simple but doesn't miss out on features.\nAlso: This lightweight Linux distro is the best (and easiest) way to revive your old computer. Here's how\nOnce installed, you'll find Linux Lite includes the apps you need to get started, such as Chrome, LibreOffice, GIMP, Photo Manager, Deja Dup Backups, VLC media player, a USB image writer, an onscreen keyboard, Timeshift (for restore points), and more. If it doesn't include the app you need, there's always the Synaptic Package Manager GUI to help you find what you're looking for.\nThe system requirements for Linux Lite are:\n- CPU: 1GHz or faster\n- 1GB of RAM\n- 8GB of drive space\nLinux Lite can be downloaded and installed for free.\n2. AntiX\nAntiX is another lightweight distribution, but I wouldn't recommend it to those new to Linux. AntiX is geared more toward those with at least a bit of Linux experience. The reason for that is AntiX opts for the zzzFM-IceWM window manager. Even though the developers have configured the window manager to look fairly familiar, if you go to make any changes to the look and feel, you'll find it's not quite as simple as KDE Plasma or GNOME.\nAlso: Why this lightweight Linux distro won't win any popularity contests but is perfect for power users\nAntiX ships with plenty of pre-installed apps, such as Firefox, LibreOffice, Firejail, plenty of media players, and more. More than anything, though, AntiX is crazy fast, which means an aging computer will feel like you just purchased it off the shelf.\nThe system requirements for AntiX are:\n- CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2\n- 1GB or more RAM\n- 10GB or more drive space\n- Graphics: Any graphics card with 3D acceleration\n3. Bodhi Linux\nNot gonna lie -- I do love me some Bodhi Linux. The Moksha Desktop is a fork of Enlightenment, and it looks gorgeous. Of all the lightweight distributions, Bodhi is, by far, the most unique. But don't think that uniqueness makes Bodhi Linux challenging to use. You'd be surprised at how easy this distribution is.\nAlso: Bodhi Linux can make an old computer feel brand new\nOne of my favorite features of Bodhi Linux is the right-click mouse menu. Right-click anywhere on the desktop, and a menu will appear where you can launch applications and much more. The right-click menu is the same as the desktop menu, so it's very efficient. Although Bodhi Linux doesn't include much in the way of eye candy, you'll find plenty of beautiful themes to choose from.\nThe Bodhi Linux system requirements are:\n- CPU: 1.0GHz or faster\n- 768MB of RAM\n- 10GB of drive space\n4. BunsenLabs\nBunsenLabs Linux will surprise you with how it is functional and user-friendly. On top of that, it's beautiful. This distribution is a continuation of the beloved CrunchBang Linux and uses a Debian base, the OpenBox window manager, the tint2 panel, Conky, and jgmenu. All of those bits come together to form a lightweight Linux distribution that not only performs incredibly well but looks very modern.\nAlso: This Linux distribution surprised me with its minimalistic yet highly-functional operating system\nOn top of all this, it shouldn't take you any time to get up to speed with how the distribution works. Even better, BunsenLabs Linux includes a desktop mouse menu that is similar to the one found in Bodhi Linux.\nThe system requirements for BunsenLabs Linux are:\n- CPU: 1GHz or faster\n- 2GB of RAM\n- 20GB of drive space\n5. Lubuntu\nLubuntu is another distribution based on Ubuntu LTS. This take, however, uses the LXQt desktop, which is one of the most full-featured of all the lightweight desktop environments. LXQt is very fast and easy to use. Anyone who's worked with Windows of any iteration will find LXQt familiar. Lubuntu is an official spin of Ubuntu and retains things like Snap package support, a stable kernel, a similar set of pre-installed software, and access to the standard Ubuntu repositories.\nAnd although the Lubuntu desktop may give you early-2000s vibes, that doesn't mean it's too old-school for use. Lubuntu even includes KDE Plasma's Discover app store, so you won't have any problem installing all of the apps you need. The best thing about Lubuntu, however, is the speed. This lightweight Linux distribution will blow you away with how fast it runs, even on older hardware.\nSpeaking of which, the system requirements for Lubuntu are:\n- CPU: 1GHz or faster\n- 1GB of RAM\n- 5GB of drive space\nAlso: Lubuntu is Linux for those looking to simplify and speed up their desktop experience\nAny one of the above Linux distributions will give your aging PC new life -- so, if you're looking at the end of Windows 10 and your computer won't support Windows 11, instead of throwing that machine away, install one of these distributions and keep that computer around for a few more years."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-reasons-why-ive-stuck-with-ubuntu-based-linux-distros-for-the-last-20-years",
      "text": "6 reasons why I've stuck with Ubuntu-based Linux distros for the last 20 years\nIt was October 2004, and I'd been using Red Hat Linux (way before it became Fedora) for years. I was fairly certain that would be my distribution until the world ended. I'd become comfortable with Red Hat. Sure, it had its quirks and was sometimes a bit more difficult than it needed to be (remember, it was over 20 years ago), but it was stable and I'd grown to know it well.\nBut then a new distribution arrived on the scene... Ubuntu. Oddly enough, the first version to hit the market was 4.10, aka \"Warty Warthog.\" I'd not heard much about Ubuntu, but my curiosity was piqued, so I decided I would install it over Red Hat and see what was what. Since that moment, I've pretty much stuck with Ubuntu-based distributions for more than 20 years.\nAlso: The easiest way to try out Ubuntu Linux\nIn fact, other than testing, I can't remember the last distribution I used that wasn't based on Ubuntu. What makes Ubuntu so special that I've refused to even consider switching to another distro with a different base? Let me tell you.\n1. Reliable updates\nOver the two decades I've been using Ubuntu-based distributions, I believe I've only experienced one issue where an update wasn't successful, and the only reason that happened was because the OS I was updating had been dramatically customized to the point it was almost unrecognizable. With that upgrade, I did wind up having to scrap it and do a fresh installation, but again, that was one instance over a span of 21 years. Not a bad track record.\nAlso: While Windows 10 users panic, Ubuntu makes extending support easy - here's how\nOther than that, every upgrade I've executed on an Ubuntu-based distribution went off without a hitch. With Ubuntu (and Ubuntu-based distributions), I never hesitate to run upgrades (minor or major) because I know they'll work. With that in mind, why would I ever want to switch to a different base? It's that much of a no-brainer.\n2. Ease of installation\nUbuntu has, for a very long time, offered the best installation experience of all Linux distributions. This is especially true with the latest version of the installer. Not only is the latest installer incredibly simple to use, but it's also one of the most elegantly designed. Many Linux installers still look as if they were designed in the early 2000s.\nAlso: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them al\nSome might say that the look of the installer shouldn't matter, but I disagree. The installer app is the first thing new users experience, and it should be something that not only makes them feel comfortable but also gives them the impression that Linux is just as modern as macOS and/or Windows. And, similar to the upgrades, I've never experienced an Ubuntu installation go sideways.\n3. Hardware support\nUbuntu (and Ubuntu-based distributions) has some of the best hardware support available. I can plug almost anything in, and it will be automatically recognized. Hardware support has become one of the big selling points for Ubuntu, and I've personally rarely experienced a situation where the distribution couldn't recognize a peripheral or internal device.\nYes, there have been instances where I've had to locate a driver for something, but the good thing about using Ubuntu is that, if a company has created a Linux driver for a device, you can be certain they've created one for Ubuntu. In fact, I've experienced some situations where Ubuntu was the only distribution a company developed for.\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and the latest Ubuntu update put a smile on my face\nI will say this: Fedora is a more cutting-edge distribution, which means it often gains support for newer hardware faster than Ubuntu, but the advantage it has over Ubuntu-based distributions is slim.\n4. Software availability\nSimilar to hardware support, I've run into situations where companies have developed ports of their software, but only for Ubuntu. Beyond that, Ubuntu has some of the largest software repositories of any distribution. On top of that, you get Snap out of the box (at least with some Ubuntu-based distributions), which means you have even more software available to install. Add Flatpak and AppImages, and the amount of software you can install is staggering.\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\nThat's not to say that Ubuntu has more software than any other distribution. It would be next to impossible to calculate that because there are so many repositories (official and unofficial) for nearly every distribution available. But Ubuntu-based distributions get the edge because when third-party companies develop for Linux, you know they'll release a version of their software for Ubuntu.\n5. A vast community\nBecause there are so many Ubuntu-based distributions, there's a massive community out there for support and interaction. But we're not just talking about users. There is a vast number of contributors across various projects for Ubuntu, which means it enjoys serious active development. Thanks to Ubuntu's widespread usage, this isn't going to be shrinking any time soon.\nAlso: 10 things I always do after installing Ubuntu to instantly improve the experience\nIt could be said that the large number of distributions based on Ubuntu (and there are a lot) means the community is watered down because it is spread out across so many \"flavors.\" I would argue that's not an issue because a user of, say, elementaryOS could still be helped by a user of Ubuntu, thanks to the similar base. When using an Ubuntu-based distribution, you can be certain that there's a forum, mailing list, user, or website available to help you out of a jam.\n6. Ubuntu is for the average user\nWhen I think of Ubuntu, I think of an operating system for the masses. This isn't a niche distribution; it's created so that everyone can use and enjoy it. Ubuntu is intentionally designed so that the average user can log in and immediately understand how the desktop works. Yes, the design of the desktop might be a bit different from what you're accustomed to, but it's still easy enough that it won't stump you.\nAlso: Why this Linux distro is my new favorite Windows replacement\nTo me, that's an important distinction, because Linux needs to attract as many users as possible, especially with Windows 10 support coming to an end.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Summary\n- Linux usage on Steam has nearly tripled in 3 years, now at 2.69%.\n- SteamOS is not the only lead contributor; other distros are also gaining in popularity.\n- Steam Deck's success has significantly boosted Linux gaming adoption.\nI remember when \"gaming\" and \"Linux\" were words that never gelled well in a sentence together. It was pretty much Windows or bust if you wanted to play games. There were some valiant efforts to get Linux users gaming, but it was mostly when (or if) a developer made a version that worked on Linux. If they didn't, you were out of luck.\nThese days, things are far different. Not only can you game on Linux, but one of the best-selling gaming handhelds on the market uses it. This has helped with the adoption rates for Linux on Steam as people give something other than Windows a try, and surprisingly, it's not just SteamOS doing all of the work.\nA YouTuber claims that Windows was actively causing handhelds to run poorly, at least versus SteamOS\nWindows? Causing performance issues? Say it ain't so.\nLinux reaches a new all-time high on Steam\nAs spotted by the aptly named Gaming on Linux, the number of people using Steam on a Linux operating system has really excelled in the past few years. Before the Steam Deck's release in February 2022, Linux users on Steam accounted for around 0.8-1% of the total user base. Since then, Linux usage has been on the up and up, reaching 2.69% of the share. That's almost triple what it was around three years ago.\nSo, what's causing people to game on Linux? The obvious answer is SteamOS, the Steam Deck's operating system. Anyone hopping on their Steam Deck and playing games counts as a Linux user, which definitely helped with the rise. However, Gaming on Linux notes that only 31% of Steam's Linux gamers are using SteamOS.\nHere are the full stats:\n- SteamOS Holo 64 bit 30.95% -2.83%\n- Arch Linux 64 bit 10.09% +0.64%\n- Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.76% +1.56%\n- Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.42% +1.01%\n- Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.63% +0.01%\n- Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.30% -0.14%\n- CachyOS 64 bit 2.54% +2.54%\n- EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.44% -0.02%\n- Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.43% -0.18%\n- Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.17% -0.06%\n- Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) 64 bit 1.99% -0.28%\n- Other 23.27% -2.27%\nSo there you have it; not only is SteamOS carrying the torch for gaming on Linux, but other distros are joining in on the fun too. It's especially cool seeing Linux Mint on the rise, given how I fell in love with the OS after being a Windows fanboy for so long."

      "text": "While Windows 10 users panic, Ubuntu makes extending support easy - here's how\nYou have probably heard Windows users around the globe bemoaning the fact that their operating system of choice will soon no longer be supported. There are ways to extend that support, but they can be complicated and/or costly.\nIf you think the same thing holds true for aging Ubuntu installations, think again. Unlike Windows, extending the support for Ubuntu 20.04 is actually quite simple, thanks to a service called Ubuntu Pro.\nAlso: The easiest way to try out Ubuntu Linux\nBefore you think it, home users can do this for free, thanks to Extended Support Maintenance (ESM). With ESM, you get 10 total years of vulnerability management for critical, high, and (some) medium security issues for every piece of software that ships with Ubuntu. That 10 years means that, with Ubuntu 20.04, you would still have 5 years left (since 20.04 was released in 2020).\nOf course, a simple question comes to mind: Why are you using a release of Ubuntu that is five years old? It might be running perfectly, and you either do not have the time or inclination to upgrade.\nBefore I continue, I will say this: You should upgrade. I have run countless Ubuntu upgrades over the years and have never had an issue. So, if you are using Ubuntu on a desktop, I would highly recommend you stay up to date with the latest releases, or at least migrate from Long Term Support (LTS) release to LTS release (such as 20.04 to 22.04 to 24.04).\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and the latest Ubuntu update put a smile on my face\nWhat is really surprising about the ESM feature is that it is free for personal usage. That is right -- if you use Ubuntu only for yourself, you can attach a desktop machine to your Ubuntu Pro account, and it will enjoy vulnerability updates for 10 years.\nBut how do you do it? It is actually quite simple.\nSign up for a Ubuntu Pro account\nThe first thing you must do is sign up for a Ubuntu Pro account.\nAlso: How to install Ubuntu Server in under 30 minutes\nTo do that, head over to the official Ubuntu Pro site and create a new account (remember, it is free). Once you have created your new account, you are ready to connect your aging operating system to ESM.\nAdd ESM to Ubuntu\nWhile on your Ubuntu Pro account, click on Your Subscriptions.\nAlso: How I turned traditional Ubuntu Mate into a modern, minimal desktop - and you can too\nIn that tab, you will see a token that is specific to your account and the command required to attach a machine. The command will be in the form sudo pro attach TOKEN (where TOKEN is the token assigned to your account).\nOnce you run the command, you will see the following:\nSubscription: Ubuntu Pro -- free personal subscription\nWhen you see that, your Ubuntu 20.04 machine is now covered for vulnerabilities until 2030.\nAlso: Why this Linux distro is my new favorite Windows replacement\nKeep in mind that ESM is not limited to version 20.04. You can attach any LTS version of Ubuntu to extend the support. This will work on versions 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04, giving each release up to 10 years of support (from the original release date). With ESM, 22.04 is supported until 2032, and 24.04 is supported until 2034.\nAlso: Look, no patches! Why Chainguard OS might be the most secure Linux ever\nThat should give you plenty of time to decide when/if you want to upgrade to the next LTS (hint: You can always wait until the first point release is made available, such as 24.04.1, so any bugs are worked out).\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-macos-like-linux-distros-that-can-rescue-your-old-intel-mac-before-support-ends/",
      "text": "5 MacOS-like Linux distros that can rescue your old Intel Mac before support ends\nYou might have heard that several iterations of Intel-based Macs will no longer be supported by Apple. Although when Tahoe is released and Intel-based Macs start losing support, Apple will continue providing critical security updates for those machines for roughly three more years, during which time they will not receive any new features.\nAfter that three-year period ends, those Intel-based Macs will receive nothing. But there's hope\u2026 in Linux.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nYes, you can install Linux on Macs. The process is very similar to how you install Linux on any laptop or desktop (as I showed you in I rescued my dying 2017 MacBook Pro with Ubuntu and it works like a charm (mostly)). Although not every feature worked for me (I had to use a Wi-Fi dongle to get wireless to work), you'll find that certain Mac devices fare better than others.\nIf that sounds appealing, you might want to consider a Linux distribution that resembles MacOS in some ways. No, you won't find a MacOS clone, but there are some distributions that, thanks to their desktop layouts, can get you up and running with a bit less stress.\n1. elementaryOS\nAlthough elementaryOS might not have quite the elegance found in MacOS (it could certainly use a bit of glass and blur, in my opinion), it's always one of the first Linux distributions I think of when someone mentions a MacOS-like OS. elementaryOS has the same layout (dock and top bar), a consistent UX throughout the desktop, runs like a champ, and is simple to use.\nThis distribution is designed and developed totally with the user experience in mind, and the developers have done a fabulous job following through on that. With every app blending into the theme, elementaryOS feels so similar to earlier versions of MacOS. The elementaryOS development team has even posted very strict guidelines that developers must follow to get their apps onto the desktop.\nAlso: 6 features I wish Linux would borrow from MacOS\nThe elementaryOS distribution is based on Ubuntu, so it includes a rock-solid foundation, the simplicity of the apt package manager, and Flatpak for the installation of all the apps you need. You can download and install elementaryOS for free (although a donation is helpful) from the official site.\n2. ZorinOS\nIf you use the free version of ZorinOS, you get four desktop layouts. If, however, you pay for the Pro version ($47.99), you get six other layouts, one of which looks very much like MacOS. On top of all that, ZorinOS mixes in a bit of transparency (but not background blur) to give it more panache.\nUnlike elementaryOS, ZorinOS also ships with several preinstalled applications, including LibreOffice, Brave browser, and Evolution groupware suite. ZorinOS also enjoys an Ubuntu foundation, so it will have solid hardware recognition, an outstanding package manager, and will run like a champ.\nAlso: I converted this Mini PC from Windows to Linux, and it came alive. Here's how\nJust remember, if you want the MacOS-like layout, you have to pay for the Pro version. Of course, you could also use the free version, choose the GNOME layout, and install the GNOME Dash To Dock extension to get a MacOS-like look.\n3. Ubuntu Budgie\nI've been a fan of Ubuntu Budgie for a long time. Ubuntu Budgie brings together two of my favorite Linux things -- the Ubuntu distribution and the Budgie desktop. What's not to love? One nice feature of Ubuntu Budgie is that you can easily switch between a MacOS-like dock or a Windows-esque panel, and several other layouts. Ubuntu Budgie also ships with several themes you can use, including those based on previous releases of MacOS (such as WhiteSur and Mojave).\nIf there were a Linux distribution that could make me switch from my current favorite, Pop!_OS, it would be Ubuntu Budgie. In fact, a few years ago, I did switch from Pop!_OS to Ubuntu Budgie. It wasn't until I purchased a new System76 Thelio desktop that I switched back to Pop!_OS.\nAlso: How to download files on Linux without a web browser - and why this way is faster\nYou can download and install Ubuntu Budgie for free. Just grab an ISO from the official download site, burn it to a USB flash drive, boot it, and install this fantastic OS.\n4. Pop!_OS\nPop!_OS might be an odd choice for a MacOS-like distribution, but the proof is hard to deny. The default Pop!_OS layout includes a dock and a top bar. How MacOS is that? Verily, I would say quite. But Pop!_OS isn't just about having a pretty MacOS-esque face. Pop!_OS is about power and the ability to download different versions for NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. That alone makes a huge difference, because you won't have to spend time locating the proper drivers for your hardware. It also makes Pop!_OS a great distribution for gaming, or other video-intensive tasks.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested for students, hobbyists, and pros\nI would recommend Pop!_OS for just about any use case, and if you like the look and feel of MacOS, this would be a great option to install on your no-longer-supported Mac. You can download and install Pop!_OS for free from the official download site.\n5. pearOS\npearOS is probably the closest thing to a MacOS-looking desktop you'll find on Linux. During installation, you also choose between NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. pearOS uses KDE Plasma and Latte Dock to achieve the MacOS look, and boy, does it achieve its goals. With plenty of blur and transparency, your PearIntosh will surprise you with how much it resembles MacOS. I will warn you, though, that pearOS can be a bit tricky to install. It's not the installation process that's challenging; it's that installing it as a virtual machine poses some issues. Because of that, your best bet is to give it the ol' college try on your Intel-based Mac and hope that it succeeds. If it does, you're in for a treat, because pearOS is gorgeous.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that pearOS ships with a bare minimum of applications, so you'll need to open the app store immediately and start installing the apps you need.\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 5 factors to help you decide between Linux or MacOS\nYou can download an ISO of pearOS from the official download site and install it for free."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-10-favorite-linux-distributions-of-all-time-ranked/",
      "text": "My 10 favorite Linux distributions of all time, ranked\nLinux is on the rise. I believe the popularity of the open-source operating system will continue to increase and possibly even hit the 10% mark by the end of 2025. Some say that's a pipe dream, but I believe.\nBecause of the popularity of Linux, I thought I would create a list of my all-time top 10 distributions that I've used over the years. Some of these distros are no longer with us, while some of them are still thriving.\nAlso: 8 ways I quickly leveled up my Linux skills - and you can too\nAre you ready to take a journey with me? Let's go.\n1. Pop!_OS\nPop!_OS has been my go-to Linux distribution for some time now. Part of the reason for that is because I've been using System76 computers for the past decade and have found Pop!_OS to run extremely well on them. After all, System76 does ship those machines with Pop!_OS as the default operating system. The performance of Pop!_OS and the System76 hardware is truly something to behold.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nOf all the Linux distributions I've used, Pop!_OS has been the most efficient, while also being a beautiful desktop operating system. Of course, System76 is about to unleash the COSMIC desktop version of Pop!_OS, which I believe will elevate the operating system to even higher levels of performance and ease of use. If you want a do-all Linux distribution, you cannot go wrong with Pop!_OS. One factor to keep in mind, however, is that you aren't going to revive old machines with Pop!_OS, so you'll want a system with plenty of resources.\n2. Ubuntu Budgie\nIf I had to migrate away from Pop!_OS, the one distribution that would be first on my list would be Ubuntu Budgie. This distribution does borrow some of GNOME's underpinnings, but there is no mistaking that this distribution stands on its own. Ubuntu Budgie is gorgeous. And even though the developers have created a wonderful layout that should please anyone, Budgie also happens to be highly configurable.\nAlso: 6 reasons why I've stuck with Ubuntu-based Linux distros for the last 20 years\nYou can pretty much make this desktop look and feel exactly how you want. I often consider migrating from Pop!_OS to Ubuntu Budgie. The only reason holding me back is how well Pop!_OS performs on the System76 hardware; otherwise, you can bet I'd be running Ubuntu Budgie.\n3. Rhino Linux\nIf there is one distribution that could beat Ubuntu Budgie in the looks department, it's Rhino Linux. Early on, Rhino used the Xfce desktop to achieve this beautiful look, but the developers recently announced they would be adding new spins, which will most likely see all of them looking as good as the default.\nAlso: These 6 Linux file managers are way better than your default\nRhino Linux also happens to be a rolling release distribution, which means it will always have the latest greatest software. It isn't just a pretty face. With this Linux distribution, you get multiple package managers, so you can not only enjoy tons of available software, but you can also install it with your favorite tools.\n4. Bodhi Linux\nBodhi Linux holds a special place in my heart because its Moksha desktop is based on one of my favorite desktop environments, Enlightenment. Bohdi Linux is also fast and lightweight, making it a great option for reviving old hardware.\nTwo of my favorite elements of the Bodhi Linux desktop are the desktop menu (which can be accessed from anywhere on the desktop) and the ability to shade windows. And then there are the themes\u2026 so many themes. You can play around with the look and feel of Bodhi until it is exactly the way you want it. Bodhi Linux is based on Ubuntu, so you know it's reliable.\nAlso: This lightweight Linux distro makes switching from Windows 10 easy\nOne thing I will say about Bodhi Linux that might give some users pause is that it's not exactly the best distribution for those who are new to Linux because the desktop does take some getting used to.\n5. elementaryOS\nelementaryOS is another distribution that holds a special place in my overstuffed heart. This Linux distribution looks beautiful from every angle. No matter what you do or open, you know you're using elementaryOS. elmentaryOS also takes your privacy seriously, with the help of a feature called Secure Session.\nAlso: 8 ways every Linux distro could make things a lot easier for newbies\nIf you ever wanted a Linux distribution that looks and feels like MacOS, elementaryOS is what you want. The developers have gone out of their way to ensure that every aspect of the OS retains a consistent look and feel. I would also go so far as to say that elementaryOS is one of the best distributions for new Linux users.\n6. Ubuntu\nIt's a rare occasion that you'll see a best of Linux list that doesn't include Ubuntu. Anyone looking to hop off the Windows 10 train would be smart to consider Ubuntu, especially given its extended support. Ubuntu is such a good Linux distribution that pretty much every distro I've used over the years has been based on it. That's a persuasive selling point.\nAlso: 6 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nUbuntu isn't just easy to use; it also has great hardware support. If you are thinking about migrating from Windows 10 to Ubuntu, I would suggest you try dual-booting with Ubuntu first. If you like what you see, then eventually you can scrap Windows 10. Ubuntu is fast, reliable, and has offered a consistent desktop UI for a long time.\n7. Fedora\nFedora is that Linux distribution that I loved to hate or hated to love. Prior to the distribution finally finding its footing (around version 40), Fedora was doggedly slow. When v40 hit, Fedora proved that it could perform alongside the best distributions. All of a sudden, Fedora was fast, faster than any Linux distribution I'd used (that wasn't a lightweight offering).\nAlso: The 6 Linux distros I recommend most for gaming in 2025 - including my favorite\nFedora defaults to GNOME, but there are spins for several different desktop environments you can try. One of my favorite spins is Fedora KDE, which is beautiful while still performing like a champ.\n8. Ubuntu Server\nIf I'm deploying a server, you can bet the first distribution I'm going to use is Ubuntu Server. Even though Ubuntu Server doesn't have a GUI, it's still one of the easiest server operating systems you can install. Ubuntu Server is also very easy to manage, rock solid, and secure.\nAlso: 8 ways every Linux distro could make things a lot easier for newbies\nOut of all the server distributions on the market, Ubuntu Server vastly simplifies the software installation process with both apt and snap. If the software you want isn't found in the standard apt repository, you can easily add more repositories to expand the selection of available apps.\n9. ZorinOS\nZorinOS is exactly what a desktop operating system should be. It's also one of those distributions that I will always recommend for new users (and those migrating from Windows) because you get to choose the desktop layout as soon as you log in. Choose from a Windows-esque layout, a GNOME-like desktop, and others. You can even purchase the Pro edition, which includes 10 total layouts (one of which resembles MacOS).\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners in 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nBack in 2023, I proclaimed that ZorinOS was the best distribution of the year. If you want an operating system that is effortless to use, beautiful, and allows you to easily switch between layouts, ZorinOS is the one for you.\n10. Mandrake Linux\nThis is the only distribution on the list that no longer exists. Mandrake Linux was a special distribution because it was one of the first that focused on being user-friendly. Although Mandrake went the way of the dinosaurs, it lives on in distributions like Open Mandriva.\nAlso: 7 things every Linux beginner should know before downloading their first distro\nI'll confess that Mandrake Linux is on the list because I remember partying with the development team at my first-ever Linux conference. That team not only knew how to have fun, but they also knew that the future of Linux was listening to the users and taking their needs and concerns very seriously. Mandrake Linux was one of the many reasons why I continued using Linux and have been using it for nearly 30 years. So, to anyone who worked on that wonderful distribution, I tip my metaphorical hat to you.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

It's reliable, secure, user-friendly, and free. What more do you want?\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nI know: You want an operating system that looks and feels like Windows 10. That makes perfect sense because you've been using Microsoft's OS for a long time, and change is often hard.\nWhich distribution is right for those seeking a seamless transition from Windows to Linux? There are quite a few choices out there, and I'll show you what I consider your six best options.\n1. KDE Neon\nSlight resemblance to Windows 7 and fully configurable\nKDE Neon is the flagship distribution for highlighting the KDE Plasma desktop environment. The great thing about KDE Plasma is that it can be configured to look and feel just about any way you like. Out of the box, KDE Plasma does bear a slight resemblance to Windows 7, but you can tweak it to look more like Windows 10 or Windows 11 if you like.\nAlso: 7 things every Linux beginner should know before downloading their first distro\nKDE Neon benefits from an Ubuntu base, so it's very user-friendly and handles hardware recognition like a champ. And anyone coming from just about any version of Windows will feel right at home on the KDE Plasma desktop environment. For those who'd like to eventually work with a desktop that looks nothing like Windows, KDE Plasma can easily make that happen. Turn the bottom panel into a dock and add a top bar, and you have a desktop similar to MacOS. KDE Plasma is that flexible.\nLike nearly all Linux distributions, KDE Neon can be downloaded and installed for free.\n2. Linux Mint\nA very user-friendly operating system\nLinux Mint might not be themed like Windows 10 or Windows 11, but it is certainly within the realm of Windows-ish desktops. For example, you'll find a panel, a Start menu, a system tray, and clickable icons, all on top of a very user-friendly operating system.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nAnother reason to go the Linux Mint route is that it benefits from the same level of hardware recognition as Ubuntu. That makes perfect sense, given that Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. Linux Mint uses the Cinnamon desktop environment by default, but you can download editions that use MATE or Xfce. For those migrating from Windows, I recommend sticking with the default Cinnamon desktop, as it will be the most familiar and reliable.\nLinux Mint is a free distribution and has a very robust community. The developers listen, and the release schedule is very reliable.\nYou can download Linux Mint for free on as many machines as you need.\n3. Zorin OS\nPro edition looks and feels like Windows 11\nAlthough the goal of Zorin OS isn't to replicate Windows 10, it does offer several desktop layouts, including a very Windows-like UI. If you pay for the Pro edition ($47.99), you get additional layouts, such as one that looks and feels like Windows 11.\nAlso: I put Linux on this 8-inch mini laptop, and it's filled a niche role for me\nHere is one of the primary reasons I am including Zorin OS: You can start out using the Windows 11-like layout and, as you grow accustomed to the open-source OS, switch to a desktop that resembles MacOS or one of the straight-up Linux environments (such as GNOME or KDE Plasma). The Zorin OS desktop is based on GNOME, but the developers have made it far more flexible than your average GNOME desktop.\nThe free version of Zorin OS comes with four desktop layouts, and the Pro version adds six more. Of those 19 layouts, four are Windows-like (Windows Classic, Windows, Windows List, and Windows 11).\nZorin OS Core can be downloaded and installed for free, and the Pro license can be purchased from the official Zorin OS site.\n4. blendOS\nSlightly Windows 11-like but also immutable\nblendOS might not be on your radar, but it should be. Not only does this Linux distribution bear a slight resemblance to Windows 11, but it's also immutable (meaning it's very secure), and includes several options for installing apps. You will find pacman, apt, Flatpak, Podman, and even blendOS's own unique \"blend\" tool.\nBecause of this, you will find tons of applications to install. You can also enable Android app support as well as dnf (the Fedora package manager) support from within the System app. Because blendOS is immutable, the chances of you wrecking the OS are slim. Additionally, you can select a version with GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon, Deepin, MATE, or LXQt.\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 'End of 10' makes converting your PC to Linux easier than ever\nFor those coming from Windows, I'd recommend either KDE Plasma or the Deepin desktop. The one caveat to using blendOS is that I wouldn't recommend it for users with very little computer skills. If you know your way around Windows well enough (as in you've used it for a long time and are comfortable with most aspects of the OS), you shouldn't have much trouble with blendOS. The only thing you won't find out of the box is Wine (for Windows apps) or Steam (for games), but you can install both with ease.\n5. AnduinOS\nNew kid on the block\nAnduinOS is the new kid on the block, but it also happens to be one of my favorites on the list. This Windows-like desktop is based on Ubuntu and uses the latest version of GNOME to create a rather Windows 11-like desktop.\nAlso: 8 ways every Linux distro could make things a lot easier for newbies\nOne thing to keep in mind with this distribution is that it's not filled with tricks, bells, and whistles to fool you into believing you're using Windows. AnduinOS is more about creating a desktop and workflow that Windows users can easily adapt to. By using the combination of Ubuntu (currently version 25.04) and GNOME (currently version 48), AnduinOS creates a desktop that performs brilliantly and reliably. If you want to use Windows apps on AnduinOS, you'll need to install Wine, but other than that, it's ready to go out of the box and is a treat to use.\nAlthough AnduinOS is marketed as a desktop Linux distribution aimed at developers, it really can be used by average users as well. I find the desktop to be similar enough to Windows 11 that anyone who's used that OS will feel right at home here.\n6. RefreshOS\nOutstanding option\nRefreshOS came out of nowhere recently and surprised me with how well it could serve anyone migrating from Windows. This distribution uses a minimal KDE Plasma desktop, configured in the same way as the traditional Windows desktop. It has a panel, a Start menu, and a system tray with a simple and elegant theme that is sure to please anyone. RefreshOS offers the rock-solid stability of Debian and the user-friendliness of Ubuntu, which makes it the perfect combination for users coming over from the world of Microsoft operating systems.\nAlso: Should you ever pay for Linux? 5 times I would - and why\nAs far as preinstalled apps, you get LibreOffice, GIMP, a calendar, a contact manager, KMail, VLC media player, and much more. RefreshOS is a Linux distribution that allows you to hit the ground running immediately after installation, so there's no tweaking or post-install work required. Just log in and do your thing. The only gotcha with RefreshOS is that the developers opted not to include either the Snap or Flatpak universal package managers, which means that if you want proprietary apps like Slack or Spotify, you'll have to install either Snap or Flatpak first.\nOther than that, RefreshOS is an outstanding option for Windows users making the switch to Linux or for anyone who's curious about the open-source operating system.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nDenmark's Minister of Digitalization, Caroline Stage, has announced that the Danish government will start moving away from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice. Why? It's not because open-source is better, although I would argue that it is, but because Denmark wants to claim \"digital sovereignty.\" In the States, you probably haven't heard that phrase, but in the European Union, digital sovereignty is a big deal and getting bigger.\nAlso: This city is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for OnlyOffice and Linux - here's why\nA combination of security, economic, political, and societal imperatives is driving the EU's digital sovereignty moves. EU leaders are seeking to reduce Europe's dependence on foreign technology providers, primarily those from the United States, and to assert greater control over its digital infrastructure, data, and technological future.\nWhy? Because they're concerned about who controls European data, who sets the rules, and who can potentially cut off access to essential services in times of geopolitical tension.\nFor example, after the EU-based International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallan, for war crimes, President Donald Trump issued ICC sanctions. This order allegedly prompted Microsoft to lock the ICC's Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, out of his email accounts, according to reports.\nThis came after Microsoft chairman and general counsel, Brad Smith, had promised that the company would stand behind its EU customers against political pressure. Recently, however, Smith stated that Microsoft had not been \"in any way [involved in] the cessation of services to the ICC,\" according to Politico. When pressed, Microsoft failed to further explain how the email disconnection occurred.\nWhether or not Microsoft cut services to an organization in response to Trump's order, the fear that it could do so in the future remains. Before the Danish government announced its move, Denmark's largest cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, had already announced plans to phase out Microsoft software and cloud services. As Henrik Appel Espersen, chairman of the Copenhagen Audit Committee, who spearheaded this move, said, \"If we suddenly can't send emails or communicate internally because of a political fallout, that's a huge problem.\"\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nIn particular, the Danes are worried about Trump's policies and that US political decisions could put public IT services at risk. After all, Greenland, which Trump has said many times he wants to unilaterally take over, is a Danish territory.\nDenmark's Minister of Emergency Situations, Torsten Schack Pedersen, has warned Danish companies and agencies to reduce dependence on American-based cloud services. \"We recommend that companies and authorities create exit plans for the use of, for example, cloud services, and that they also ensure that they have strong ownership of the data.\"\nDenmark is not the only EU country with serious doubts about continuing to work with American tech giants. Bart Groothuis, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, recently said, \"\"=\"\"> since \"Europe has a 'problem' with American cloud.\"\nIt's not all about politics, though. Money issues have also played a decisive role. Copenhagen's Microsoft software bill has soared from 313 million kroner in 2018 to 538 million kroner -- about $53 million in 2023, a 72% increase in just five years.\nAlso: Should you ever pay for Linux? 5 times I would - and why\nAll that said, no one expects this to be an easy transition. Making the jump from Azure, Office, and Windows to a third-party EU-based cloud system such as NextCloud, LibreOffice, and Linux will take time and effort.\nNor is everyone a believer in moving to open-source software. Mette Harbo, IT director in the Capital Region of Denmark, thinks it's impossible for Denmark to move off Microsoft software or achieve digital sovereignty.\nStill, as David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), a Dane, inventor of Ruby on Rails, and co-owner of the software developer company 37Signals, has said, \"=\"\"> in the world. It's also one of the most Microsoft-dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there.\"\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them all\nI remember back in the day when Linux was a challenge, even for computer scientists. It was all text-based; you had to manually format the hard drive, understand how networking functioned, and use the command line like a magician.\nToday's Linux is a far easier experience. In fact, there are some Linux distributions that are so easy to install that anyone, regardless of skill, can do it. With that particular breed of distribution, the hardest part is burning an ISO to a USB drive. Even so, from the start of the ISO download to logging into your new Linux system, it should only take about 10 minutes -- depending on the speed of your internet connection for downloading the ISO and the performance of your machine.\nAlso: 5 factors steadily fueling Linux's desktop rise\nSo, which distributions are the easiest? I've chosen five, all of which you can install without knowing anything about Linux.\n1. Ubuntu\nYou may or may not love Ubuntu, but there's no denying that the development team has created one of the easiest OS installers on the market. With the latest iteration, 25.04, installation has become even easier. Prior to 25.04, Ubuntu used the Ubiquity installer, but with 25.04, Canonical released the new Ubuntu Desktop Installer. I love what the team has done with this and wish every distribution's installation process were this painless.\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and the latest Ubuntu update put a smile on my face\nIn addition to being painless, it is also one of the fastest OS installations available. I've installed Ubuntu on virtual machines with only 3GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores, and from start to finish the installation took 2 to 5 minutes. Installing that OS on a machine with double that power will almost always veer toward the lower end of that range. But speed is not the only selling point. It's easy on a level that most operating systems cannot touch -- even the others on this list.\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\nInstalling Ubuntu for the desktop is a point-and-click affair that your child or your grandparents can handle. Seriously, what Canonical has done for the Linux installation process should have the open-source community jumping for joy.\n2. Zorin OS\nUnlike Ubuntu, Zorin OS sticks with the Ubiquity installer, and there's nothing wrong with that. There are few installers as easy as the Ubuntu Desktop Installer, and I would place Ubiquity just below Canonical's new installer. Because of that, Zorin OS earns a spot on this list.\nAlso: Zorin OS is exactly what a desktop operating system should be\nThe Ubiquity installer is very similar to a traditional app\u2010installation wizard. You get a desktop window (often with the desktop environment provided by the distribution) and a pop-up window that walks you through the installation. You'll be asked the usual questions: keyboard layout, whether to enable updates and third-party software, and installation type (just stick with the default unless you plan on dual-booting Windows and Linux). You'll then be prompted to create a user. That's it.\nAlso: 5 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nAs for time, it's not as fast as Ubuntu, but we're still talking about 5 to 10 minutes from start to finish. I've clocked a Zorin OS installation at around 5 minutes on a pretty beefy desktop with a very fast network connection. Even with average hardware and network speeds, the Zorin OS installer is still fast.\n3. Linux Mint\nYou can't have a list about Linux with \"easiest\" in the title and not include Linux Mint.\nGuess what? Linux Mint also uses the Ubiquity installer. If you've installed any Ubuntu release prior to 25.04 (or Zorin OS), then you've used Ubiquity and know how easy it is to use. Like Zorin OS, the installation is very fast. The difference between the Linux Mint and Zorin OS installations (besides different themes) is that the Linux Mint installation is a bit faster.\nAlso: Linux Mint 22.1 is primed and ready for release and I'm excited\nThese installations are so similar that they could be interchangeable. The theme for the Linux Mint installer is darker than Zorin OS's, but otherwise it's pretty much the same. You'll be asked to select the language for the installation, a keyboard layout, whether you want to install third-party multimedia codecs (I suggest you do), and the installation type (erase disk and install Linux Mint or a custom option -- go with the default).\nAlso: The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested for students, hobbyists, and pros\nWhen the installation begins, you'll then be required to select your region (which it will most likely auto-detect) and create a user. That's it. In 3 to 5 minutes you'll have a running Linux Mint desktop.\n4. Pop!_OS\nSystem76 created its own installer for Pop!_OS, and it is as easy as any on this list. Once you boot the image, the installer walks you through language selection, keyboard layout, installation type (such as \"Erase and Install\" for a clean installation or \"Custom (Advanced)\" for manual partitioning), and user account setup. Click through those questions -- and select your answers -- and the installation is off. Within 5 to 10 minutes you're ready to reboot into your new Linux operating system.\nAlso: The new COSMIC Linux desktop from System76 is out of this world\nThe Pop!_OS installer is every bit as easy and fast as the others on the list, and it's just as elegant as the new Ubuntu Desktop Installer. Even better, with the new COSMIC desktop, to be released sometime in the near (hopefully) future, the Pop!_OS installer will look even better. The wonderful thing about Pop!_OS is that it gains more polish with every release, and the installer isn't overlooked in that evolution.\nAlso: These 6 lightweight Linux apps let older PCs run blazing fast\nYou can install Pop!_OS within 5 to 10 minutes.\n5. elementary OS\nHere's another Linux distribution that uses its own custom installer and, like Ubuntu, the installer is a thing of beauty, with an elegance and simplicity few operating systems can touch. That should come as no surprise, given how stunning the elementary OS desktop is. The installer has the same look and feel as the desktop.\nAlso: elementary OS 8 continues the tradition of a beautiful, user-friendly desktop\nThis is another point-and-click affair with just a few simple questions to answer (pretty much the same questions as the other installers). One thing I really appreciate about elementary OS is that from installation to the desktop, there is so much UI continuity. When you run the installer, you can pretty much guess what the desktop is going to look and feel like.\nWith elementary OS, the installation (from start to finish) will take you around 5 to 10 minutes tops.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "New to Linux? 5 desktop environments I recommend you try first - and why\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Not all Linux desktop environments are created equal.\n- Some desktops are better suited for skilled Linux users.\n- There are some desktops that make new users feel right at home.\nOne aspect of Linux that has always been a strength is choice. As a user, you have the choice of making the open-source OS exactly what you want it to be. There are options for just about everything, from the kernel all the way up to the desktop environment.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops right now\nAlthough the choice of kernel might not make things easier for new users, the desktop environment certainly will. Some Linux desktops simply aren't built for those new to the platform. For example, the tiling i3 window manager is not for the faint of heart. As far as GNOME is concerned, it's an easy-to-use desktop, but it's different enough that many users might struggle to understand how it works at first.\nChoosing the right desktop environment can make or break your experience. Choose the wrong desktop and you'll find yourself more frustrated than not. On the other hand, if you choose a desktop that's perfectly at home in the hands of new users, that experience will be easy enough to keep you on board with Linux.\nAlso: This Linux distro puts more than 20 desktops a click away\nBut which of those desktop environments are best suited for new users? Let me offer you my top five, each of which makes for an ideal new user environment.\n1. KDE Plasma\nWhen you first log into KDE Plasma, you'll find everything looks familiar... but with a bit more panache.\nKDE Plasma offers a similar layout to the desktops you've used since you first placed your fingers on a keyboard. It has a desktop menu, a panel, a system tray, clickable icons, notifications, and all of the things that come together to make a newbie-friendly desktop. On top of that, KDE Plasma is gorgeous, so you won't feel like you're using a Linux desktop from the early 2000s.\nAlso: 4 ways the latest KDE Plasma release is better than ever - and how to try it yourself\nOne of my favorite aspects of KDE Plasma is that it can be a new user's nirvana, but also grows with the user as they gain more and more experience. At first, you'll leave the default settings and probably won't change much. As you learn more about Linux, you may find yourself digging into the Settings app and tweaking the desktop to better suit your new Linux skills or simply to create an amazingly beautiful desktop. KDE Plasma is very good at that.\nKDE Plasma also makes it easy to connect your phone to the desktop with KDE Connect (with file manager integration). In other words, this desktop simplifies nearly everything without compromising aesthetics.\nKDE Plasma ships as the default desktop environment for distributions such as Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Fedora KDE Spin, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Mandriva, and Manjaro KDE.\n2. Cinnamon\nImagine KDE Plasma without the modern looks. That's how I see Cinnamon.\nThis desktop environment came about after the GNOME developers evolved from the 2.x series to GNOME 3 (Shell). Some were outraged at the dramatic shift, and a crew of developers decided they'd create a new desktop based on GNOME 2. Cinnamon is perfectly suited for those who don't want to change how they interact with their computer and don't really care as much about aesthetics. That's not to say Cinnamon is ugly... it's not.\nIt is, however, fairly plain-looking, especially when compared to KDE Plasma. That being said, Cinnamon is also a lightweight desktop, which means it is perfectly suited for older hardware. This could be a boon to those who want to try Linux and have an older spare machine lying around. Cinnamon offers a similar UI to KDE Plasma, complete with a desktop menu, panel, system tray, and clickable icons. On the other hand, Cinnamon isn't nearly as configurable as KDE Plasma.\nAlso: How to replace Windows with Linux Mint on your PC\nIf you're looking for a lightweight desktop environment that harkens back to Windows XP or 7, and you don't care about a bunch of bells and whistles, Cinnamon is perfectly suited for you.\nCinnamon ships as the default desktop environment for distributions such as Linux Mint, Fedora Cinnamon, Manjaro Cinnamon, EndeavorOS (can be selected during installation), and Solus.\n3. MATE\nMATE (pronounced Ma-Tay) is another continuation of GNOME 2, so it has a lot of similarities to Cinnamon.\nThe way I see MATE is a less modern version of Cinnamon. With MATE, you get two different panels -- one on the bottom and one on the top. But don't let the simplicity fool you, as there are tweaks to be had. You can change the theme, fonts, create more panels, customize the defaults, add applets, and more.\nAlso: Want to learn Linux? These 5 games make it fun - and they're free\nWhen you use MATE, you will feel as if you've been transported to the early 2000s, when GNOME 2 was all the rage. And although MATE might look a bit old-school, it is in active development. The developers are dedicated to the desktop retaining that GNOME 2 look and feel, so chances of it getting a more modern touch are slim. One of the best things about MATE is that it is perfectly suited for users of all Linux skill levels. It's super easy for new users, and those familiar with Linux will appreciate the speed and simplicity of the desktop, so they can concentrate more on getting things done.\nMATE is available as a desktop environment option for distributions like Linux Mint, Debian, Kali Linux, Fedora MATE-Compiz, SparkyLinux, Ubuntu MATE, PCLinuxOS, and MocaccinoOS.\n4. Pantheon\nIf you like the MacOS desktop, you'll enjoy Pantheon with equal gusto.\nPantheon looks and feels very much like the MacOS UI (minus the new Glass theme), but is much more lightweight (so it'll feel faster). Pantheon includes a top bar, a dock, and a desktop menu, so if you've used MacOS, you'll feel right at home with Pantheon. This desktop environment is often considered a minimal desktop, but I find that not to be quite true, as Pantheon includes all the features you need to work efficiently and simply. If you like a modern-looking desktop but want to stick with something familiar, Pantheon is a great option. This Linux desktop is immediately familiar and simple to use.\nAlso: 5 reasons to switch to an immutable Linux distro today - and which to try first\nOne thing about Pantheon is that it's not very customizable. That's actually a good thing for new users, especially given that MacOS takes the same approach. Don't be fooled, however; you can customize Pantheon... especially the dock (Plank). Another thing I really respect about Pantheon is that the development team is good about listening to users and adopting the most wanted features.\nPantheon is the default desktop environment for elementaryOS, but it can also be installed on Arch Linux and Debian.\n5. Budgie\nI love Budgie. I really do. Not only is it beautiful, but it's also highly customizable. If you can imagine a new layout, Budgie can comply. However, out of the box, Budgie looks very much like a Windows desktop. Budgie includes a bottom panel, a desktop menu, a system tray, and clickable icons. At the same time, Budgie can be morphed into a desktop that resembles MacOS... or something completely different, all the while looking about as good as a desktop environment can.\nAlso: 6 reasons why I've stuck with Ubuntu-based Linux distros for the last 20 years\nEven though Budgie sticks with a typical desktop layout, it still manages to look very modern. Like KDE Plasma, Budgie can grow with the user. Stick with the default layout at first and, as you learn more about Linux, dive into the customizations and make it look and behave exactly how you want. There's also the Budgie Welcome Wizard, which helps new users get familiar with the desktop. That's a big plus in my book.\nYou may not see the Welcome Wizard at first login, but you'll find it in the menu, and I highly recommend using it.\nBudgie ships as the default desktop environment for Ubuntu Budgie but can also be selected with RebornOS, EndeavorOS, and installed on most Linux distributions."

But you know what I mean.\nShall I continue?\nI know many people who would love to try Linux but won't because they either don't have a spare computer or are afraid the installation will be too difficult. Allow me to allay those fears. First, a Linux installation doesn't require a spare machine. Second, Linux (especially a distro like Ubuntu) has become so easy to install that just about anyone can do it.\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and the latest Ubuntu update put a smile on my face\nHowever, if you're still unsure, I want to show you a way to test Ubuntu Desktop that is so easy that you'll wonder why you didn't try it before.\nAre you ready for this?\nIt's all about VirtualBox.\nWhat is VirtualBox?\nVirtualBox is an application that allows you to install \"guest\" operating systems on your \"host.\" The host is the operating system on which you've installed VirtualBox, and the guest OS is the operating system that is installed as a virtual machine. The guest does not interfere with the host, so even if something goes wrong with the guest, it won't affect the host.\nVirtualBox is free and can be installed on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. The installation of VirtualBox is as simple as downloading the installer for your OS and running it. You can find VirtualBox package for your platform on this download page. On Linux, you can install VirtualBox from your distribution's standard repositories.\nIf you can install an app, you can install VirtualBox.\nThe easy way of installing Ubuntu\nWhat you'll need: The only things you'll need are VirtualBox installed and a downloaded ISO of Ubuntu Desktop.\nIt's time for me to demonstrate just how easy it is to install Ubuntu Desktop with VirtualBox. With the help of Unattended Installation, it's pretty much a setup-and-go affair. Let me show you what I mean.\n1. Add the new VM\nThe first thing to do is add the new virtual machine. To do this, open VirtualBox and New.\n2. Configure your guest\nIn the resulting pop-up, you need to first configure the following sections:\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\n- Name and operating system: This is where you'll give the guest a name and locate the ISO you downloaded (via the ISO image drop-down). In the case of Ubuntu, when you select the downloaded ISO image, all the other fields in this section will auto-populate.\n- Hardware: Configure the guest with at least 3GB of base memory and two processors.\n- Hard disk: Drag the hard disk size handle until it's at least 20 GB. I typically go for 100 GB because I know I'll delete the virtual machine to reclaim hard disk space.\n3. Configure the unattended install\nThis is the feature that makes installing Ubuntu so easy on VirtualBox. Expand the Unattended Install section. In this section, fill out the necessary information. You can add your username, set a password, and customize the hostname and domain name. You can name the hostname anything you like (such as ubuntu). You don't have to customize the domain name. When you're done, click Finish.\nAfter clicking Finish, the new virtual machine will start and -- get this -- automatically install the OS with the details you've supplied. (You can watch it happen or step away until it's done.) When the installation finishes, you'll be prompted to restart.\nOnce the virtual machine has restarted, you'll be presented with the login window, where you can log in with the account you created in the Unattended Installation section.\nAlso: Why this Linux distro is my new favorite Windows replacement\nHow simple is that?\nOne thing to keep in mind is that not every Linux distribution supports VirtualBox Unattended Installations. If you go to install an OS and the Unattended Installation section is grayed out, unfortunately, you'll have to run the install manually.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Apple quietly makes running Linux containers easier on Macs\nWith so much news at 2025's Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, you might be excused for missing that Apple quietly revealed it was releasing and open-sourcing a new open-source containerization framework and a shell tool called Container. Both are designed to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines (VMs) directly on MacOS.\nAlso: ZDNET's WWDC 2025 recap with Sabrina Ortiz and Jason Hiner\nThis framework is optimized for Apple Silicon and will be natively integrated into the forthcoming MacOS 26 (Tahoe). You can, of course, already run Linux in containers with such third-party container tools as Docker, Podman, and Orbstack. You can also easily run Linux on your older Intel-powered Mac or, with more effort, run Asahi Linux on M-powered Macs.\nApple Container is written in Swift and licensed under Apache 2. Apple claims these \"Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized Linux kernel configuration and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.\" You'll need a minimum of any Mac with Apple Silicon inside, MacOS 15, and Xcode 26 beta. These containers are compliant with the Open Container Initiative.\nAlso: Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nThe framework uses a custom init system called vminitd, also written in Swift, to manage process launching, filesystem mounting, and host-container communication.\nUnlike other container approaches, which run multiple containers in a single, often resource-heavy Linux VM, Apple's container framework spins up a separate lightweight VM for each container. These VMs are based on Kata Containers, a well-known and well-regarded OpenInfra Foundation project.\nEach container gets its own isolated Linux kernel environment, enhancing security and privacy. The minimal root filesystem excludes most core utilities and dynamic libraries, reducing the attack surface and maintenance overhead.\nEvery container can also be assigned a dedicated IP address, removing the need for port forwarding and improving network isolation. However, if you try running Container in the current MacOS 15, Sequoia, you can only create the container network with the first container that starts.\nAlso: How Red Hat just quietly, radically transformed enterprise server Linux\nSince the network XPC, Apple's basic interprocess communication helper, provides IP addresses to containers, and the helper has to start before the first container, the network helper and vmnet can disagree on the subnet address, resulting in containers that are completely cut off from the network. In short, this is bad news.\nHowever, this issue will be fixed by the time Tahoe, which is currently in developer beta, ships. For now, though, if you're trying to run the containers in MacOS 15, you can expect some problems.\nYou may be asking yourself, \"Why is Apple taking this approach?\" Well, the strategy will help developers working on Linux projects, so there must be a demand for it.\nAlso: Java at 30: How a language designed for a failed gadget became a global powerhouse\nApple's move tacitly acknowledges the central role of Linux containers in modern software development by providing a seamless, high-performance, and secure experience for Mac-using Linux developers. Which, come to think of it, is much like what Microsoft did for Windows-based Linux developers with its Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nBy offering native, open-source tools, Apple is positioning MacOS as a first-class platform for container-based development, optimized for its own hardware and developer ecosystem."

Recently, I discovered an Arch-based Linux distro called SDesk, and there couldn't be a clearer use case for it.\nFirstly, SDesk is fairly straightforward and doesn't do all that much to separate itself from the ever-growing list of Linux distributions. Sometimes, that's a good thing. I wasn't sure what to expect after installing and logging into this desktop distribution, but when I did, everything was immediately familiar.\nAlso: Why Denmark is dumping Microsoft Office and Windows for LibreOffice and Linux\nSDesk opts for the GNOME desktop, which is configured to resemble a \"standard\" desktop that would be familiar to both Windows and MacOS users. On the interface, you'll find a panel, a menu, a top bar, favorites, and desktop icons. On the top bar, there's the Workspaces button (far left), the time/date (which, when clicked, opens notifications and calendar), and the system tray.\nThe list of pre-installed applications is also fairly standard, including:\n- LibreOffice (office suite)\n- Geary (email)\n- GNOME Music (music player)\n- GNOME Video (video player)\n- Octopi (GUI package manager)\n- GNOME Maps\n- Swirl (web browser)\nOf course, if you don't find the app you need, you can always install it with Octopi or Flatpak.\nThe one curiosity I encountered was Swirl, which isn't based on either Chromium or Firefox. In fact, I haven't had much luck digging up any information about this web browser at all. I can tell you that Swirl is fairly minimal and has very little in the way of settings. It works fine, but I'm not ready to recommend a browser for which I can't find much information. You can always install Chromium or Firefox using Octopi. I installed Firefox and it runs quite well.\nWhat I like\nI really appreciate how the developers created a GNOME layout that should appeal to most users. It's clean, it's easy, and it looks quite good. It's also helpful that the distribution ships with most of the tools you'll need (the primary being a web browser and an office suite). I would, however, suggest you install Firefox or Chromium (as I mentioned earlier).\nThe performance is also quite good. I found applications responded instantly, nothing stalled, and apps installed quickly. This is fairly typical of Arch-based distributions, so I wasn't at all surprised.\nAlso: 5 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nThere's also window snapping, which SDesk does well. Most Linux desktops have this feature, but some limit the basic configuration to half of the display. SDesk takes this a step further and allows you to drag a window to any of the four quarters of the screen.\nWhat I don't like\nSDesk is a fairly new distribution, which means it can be a bit rough around the edges. Let me explain.\nAfter the usual round of testing (installing applications, tinkering with the settings, etc.), I ran an update and rebooted the machine. Upon reboot, I went to log in, and the desktop locked up. This happened after selecting the default user that popped up in the login window. I did a quick test (after a hard reboot) and clicked \"Not Listed.\" After typing my password, I was able to successfully log in. I'm sure this is a bug that the developers will soon fix.\nAlso: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You've got 5 months to act - here are your options\nAnother issue was multimedia playback. Out of the box, SDesk doesn't have the codecs to play MP3 or MP4 files. Fortunately, this issue was easily resolved by installing the VLC media player like so:\nsudo pacman -S vlc\nOnce I installed VLC, I could play whatever I needed.\nBottom line\nOther than those two caveats, I found SDesk to be a take on Arch Linux that is viable for just about any user. As with any Linux desktop OS, there really wasn't much I couldn't do. After installing a few simple apps, I found SDesk could serve just about any purpose.\nIt's a beautiful, simple, fast, and reliable OS. What more do you need from a desktop operating system? You might even find yourself preferring it over your Windows desktop. You can download an ISO for SDesk here.\nSince publishing this story, SDesk has released version 19.1. I'll be deep-diving into that in the near future, so stay tuned to ZDNET."

      "text": "The 6 Linux distros I recommend most for gaming in 2025 - including my favorite\nLinux isn't the first platform most folks associate with gaming. Back in the day, Linux was lucky to get Frozen Bubble or Tux Racers. But then came Loki Games to prove gaming could be a real thing for the open-source operating system. (But then Loki folded, and that was that.)\nBut there was still Wine. And then Proton. And then SteamOS.\nAlso: How to install Steam on Linux to start playing thousands of games\nToday, gaming on Linux is no longer an afterthought. Case in point: Some distributions are built specifically for gaming (and others are perfectly suited for the task). I've come up with six of my favorite distributions for gaming, so you don't have to hunt them down.\nPut your fingers on the keypad and slip on your headsets -- 'cause we're going gaming.\n1. Bazzite\nBazzite is a Linux distribution designed specifically for gaming -- and it's quickly become my favorite for this purpose. Part of what makes Bazzite so good for gaming is that it includes everything necessary to play Steam games right out of the box.\nAlso, Bazzite includes support for HDR & VRR; uses the System76 CPU scheduler for improved gameplay; adds community-developed tools and tweaks to streamline the gaming and streaming experience; includes a proprietary driver for GeForce GUPs; adds Waydroid to run Linux games; and offers LUKs full-disk encryption and game controller support.\nAlso: 5 lightweight Linux distributions that will bring your old PC back to life\nAnother key aspect of Bazzite is that it's a SteamOS clone. For those unfamiliar with SteamOS, the operating system powers the SteamDeck, so it's ideal for gaming on Linux. In fact, I'd have to say that Bazzite is the single best Linux distribution for gaming.\nHowever, remember that Bazzite isn't a 1:1 clone of SteamOS. The biggest difference is that Bazzite is based on Fedora, whereas SteamOS is based on Arch.\nYou can download and use Bazzite for free from the official site, which also allows you to select an ISO based on your hardware (so you'll get the best possible experience).\n2. Drauger OS\nDrauger OS is based on Ubuntu and ships with tons of optimizations and modifications intended to improve gaming performance and the gaming experience. You'll find simple changes (such as a custom Plasma desktop) to far more complicated optimizations (such as a custom kernel with lot latency enabled and a scheduling frequency from 250Hz to 1000Hz).\nAlso: My 6 must-have Linux apps for productivity and why they make work easier\nEverything in Drauger OS has been tweaked to make it an ideal gaming platform. In fact, the developers make no bones about the fact that Drauger OS is designed explicitly for gaming. This isn't your normal desktop OS. It's not aimed at productivity, shopping, socialization, project management, or development.\nDrauger OS supports several gaming platforms (such as Steam, Lutris, PlayOnLinux, etc.), works with several different game controllers, offers higher frame rates, and reduced screen tearing, as well as an overall increase in performance. The one downfall of Drauger OS is that the installation is a bit of a departure from the standard Ubuntu offering. The installation isn't hard, it's just\u2026 different.\nDrauger OS is free to install and use.\n2. Ubuntu Game Pack\nIf you prefer a more traditional Ubuntu desktop but still want something geared toward gaming, Ubuntu Game Pack is a great option. This distribution supports multiple gaming platforms, offers a GameMode with several optimizations, and includes the usual Ubuntu user-friendliness and all the apps found in the standard repositories. Ubuntu Game Pack includes Steam, Lutris, Itch.io, and Game Jolt, as well as PlayOnLinux, CrossOver, Wine, DoxBox, ScummVM, and more. Some of those options are free, while others are pay-to-play or subscription-based.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops you can buy: Expert tested\nAlthough there are no pre-installed games, you'll find a wealth of options via the various services. Ubuntu Game Pack ships with a custom GNOME desktop environment. The real focal point of Ubuntu Game Pack is GameMode, which gives Ubuntu the necessary tweaks to make it a viable gaming solution. GameMod is a daemon/lib combination that allows for certain optimizations, such as CPU governor, I/O Priority, process niceness, kernel scheduler, screensaver inhibiting, GPU performance mode (for NVIDIA and AMD), GPU overclocking (NVIDIA), CPU core pinning or parking, and customized scripts.\nUbuntu Game Pack can be installed and used for free.\n3. Fedora Game Spin\nIf you'd like a gaming-specific spin on your favorite Fedora distribution, look no further than Fedora Game Spin. However, there is a catch in that it's only for open-source games. But the good news is that there are hundreds of available games. The bad news is that they tend to look and feel like cheap knock-offs of other games.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of operating systems. Fedora 40 beta is the fastest I've tried\nYou'll find games like Extreme Tux Racer, Wesnoth, Hedewars, Colossus, BZFlag, Freeciv, Warzon 2100, MegaGlest, and Fillets. There are games ranging from first-person shooters, real-time and turn-based strategy, and puzzle games. In the end, if you're looking for varied free games, Fedora Game Spin might be a great option. And when you combine that with Fedora's inherently great performance, this spin becomes even more appealing.\nFedora Game Spin can be installed and used for free.\n4. Regata OS\nRegata OS is about achieving as much performance as possible so your favorite games play as expected. Regata OS includes GameMode as well as AMD FSR (to help boost frame rates while delivering a high-resolution experience).\nAlso: These 5 Linux file managers are way better than your default\nIf you have a laptop with hybrid graphics, Regata OS can run some applications with the dedicated GPU by default on AMD and NVIDIA-based laptops. Regata also supports Vulkan for faster performance and improved video quality.\nMoreover, you'll find support for Steam and Game Access, which allows you to run games from Origin, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and the Epic Games Store. Unlike other gaming-specific distributions, Regata OS can also serve as a great desktop solution for productivity and other uses.\nYou can download and install Regata OS for free.\n5. Pop!_OS\nPop!_OS isn't a gaming-specific distribution but it does such a great job with GPU hardware that it's an easy solution. Pop!_OS supports hybrid graphics and even offers separate ISO versions for AMD and NVIDIA hardware. Because of that separate ISO option, you don't have to worry about the challenges of installing graphics drivers on Linux, as Pop!_OS takes care of it for you.\nAlso: I used to be a regular Linux distro hopper, but now I stick with Pop!_OS: 5 reasons why\nThe one caveat of Pop!_OS is that it doesn't ship with gaming platforms pre-installed. That's okay because you can grab software like Steam from the Pop Shop. Even better, if you're running Pop!_OS on System76 hardware, you can be certain the OS is perfectly optimized for your hardware.\nYou can download and install Pop!_OS for free.\nAnd there you have it -- six Linux distributions geared toward gaming. One of these options should have you gaming like a champ in no time."

It's reliable, secure, user-friendly, and free. What more do you want?\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nI know: You want an operating system that looks and feels like Windows 10. That makes perfect sense because you've been using Microsoft's OS for a long time, and change is often hard.\nWhich distribution is right for those seeking a seamless transition from Windows to Linux? There are quite a few choices out there, and I'll show you what I consider your six best options.\n1. KDE Neon\nSlight resemblance to Windows 7 and fully configurable\nKDE Neon is the flagship distribution for highlighting the KDE Plasma desktop environment. The great thing about KDE Plasma is that it can be configured to look and feel just about any way you like. Out of the box, KDE Plasma does bear a slight resemblance to Windows 7, but you can tweak it to look more like Windows 10 or Windows 11 if you like.\nAlso: 7 things every Linux beginner should know before downloading their first distro\nKDE Neon benefits from an Ubuntu base, so it's very user-friendly and handles hardware recognition like a champ. And anyone coming from just about any version of Windows will feel right at home on the KDE Plasma desktop environment. For those who'd like to eventually work with a desktop that looks nothing like Windows, KDE Plasma can easily make that happen. Turn the bottom panel into a dock and add a top bar, and you have a desktop similar to MacOS. KDE Plasma is that flexible.\nLike nearly all Linux distributions, KDE Neon can be downloaded and installed for free.\n2. Linux Mint\nA very user-friendly operating system\nLinux Mint might not be themed like Windows 10 or Windows 11, but it is certainly within the realm of Windows-ish desktops. For example, you'll find a panel, a Start menu, a system tray, and clickable icons, all on top of a very user-friendly operating system.\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try one of these 8 Linux distros for free\nAnother reason to go the Linux Mint route is that it benefits from the same level of hardware recognition as Ubuntu. That makes perfect sense, given that Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. Linux Mint uses the Cinnamon desktop environment by default, but you can download editions that use MATE or Xfce. For those migrating from Windows, I recommend sticking with the default Cinnamon desktop, as it will be the most familiar and reliable.\nLinux Mint is a free distribution and has a very robust community. The developers listen, and the release schedule is very reliable.\nYou can download Linux Mint for free on as many machines as you need.\n3. Zorin OS\nPro edition looks and feels like Windows 11\nAlthough the goal of Zorin OS isn't to replicate Windows 10, it does offer several desktop layouts, including a very Windows-like UI. If you pay for the Pro edition ($47.99), you get additional layouts, such as one that looks and feels like Windows 11.\nAlso: I put Linux on this 8-inch mini laptop, and it's filled a niche role for me\nHere is one of the primary reasons I am including Zorin OS: You can start out using the Windows 11-like layout and, as you grow accustomed to the open-source OS, switch to a desktop that resembles MacOS or one of the straight-up Linux environments (such as GNOME or KDE Plasma). The Zorin OS desktop is based on GNOME, but the developers have made it far more flexible than your average GNOME desktop.\nThe free version of Zorin OS comes with four desktop layouts, and the Pro version adds six more. Of those 19 layouts, four are Windows-like (Windows Classic, Windows, Windows List, and Windows 11).\nZorin OS Core can be downloaded and installed for free, and the Pro license can be purchased from the official Zorin OS site.\n4. blendOS\nSlightly Windows 11-like but also immutable\nblendOS might not be on your radar, but it should be. Not only does this Linux distribution bear a slight resemblance to Windows 11, but it's also immutable (meaning it's very secure), and includes several options for installing apps. You will find pacman, apt, Flatpak, Podman, and even blendOS's own unique \"blend\" tool.\nBecause of this, you will find tons of applications to install. You can also enable Android app support as well as dnf (the Fedora package manager) support from within the System app. Because blendOS is immutable, the chances of you wrecking the OS are slim. Additionally, you can select a version with GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon, Deepin, MATE, or LXQt.\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 'End of 10' makes converting your PC to Linux easier than ever\nFor those coming from Windows, I'd recommend either KDE Plasma or the Deepin desktop. The one caveat to using blendOS is that I wouldn't recommend it for users with very little computer skills. If you know your way around Windows well enough (as in you've used it for a long time and are comfortable with most aspects of the OS), you shouldn't have much trouble with blendOS. The only thing you won't find out of the box is Wine (for Windows apps) or Steam (for games), but you can install both with ease.\n5. AnduinOS\nNew kid on the block\nAnduinOS is the new kid on the block, but it also happens to be one of my favorites on the list. This Windows-like desktop is based on Ubuntu and uses the latest version of GNOME to create a rather Windows 11-like desktop.\nAlso: 8 ways every Linux distro could make things a lot easier for newbies\nOne thing to keep in mind with this distribution is that it's not filled with tricks, bells, and whistles to fool you into believing you're using Windows. AnduinOS is more about creating a desktop and workflow that Windows users can easily adapt to. By using the combination of Ubuntu (currently version 25.04) and GNOME (currently version 48), AnduinOS creates a desktop that performs brilliantly and reliably. If you want to use Windows apps on AnduinOS, you'll need to install Wine, but other than that, it's ready to go out of the box and is a treat to use.\nAlthough AnduinOS is marketed as a desktop Linux distribution aimed at developers, it really can be used by average users as well. I find the desktop to be similar enough to Windows 11 that anyone who's used that OS will feel right at home here.\n6. RefreshOS\nOutstanding option\nRefreshOS came out of nowhere recently and surprised me with how well it could serve anyone migrating from Windows. This distribution uses a minimal KDE Plasma desktop, configured in the same way as the traditional Windows desktop. It has a panel, a Start menu, and a system tray with a simple and elegant theme that is sure to please anyone. RefreshOS offers the rock-solid stability of Debian and the user-friendliness of Ubuntu, which makes it the perfect combination for users coming over from the world of Microsoft operating systems.\nAlso: Should you ever pay for Linux? 5 times I would - and why\nAs far as preinstalled apps, you get LibreOffice, GIMP, a calendar, a contact manager, KMail, VLC media player, and much more. RefreshOS is a Linux distribution that allows you to hit the ground running immediately after installation, so there's no tweaking or post-install work required. Just log in and do your thing. The only gotcha with RefreshOS is that the developers opted not to include either the Snap or Flatpak universal package managers, which means that if you want proprietary apps like Slack or Spotify, you'll have to install either Snap or Flatpak first.\nOther than that, RefreshOS is an outstanding option for Windows users making the switch to Linux or for anyone who's curious about the open-source operating system.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "What's new in GNOME 47? 6 features that make it a worthy upgrade\nGNOME is one of many Linux desktop environments and has been accepted as the default for some distributions. GNOME is a minimal take on the desktop that offers maximum efficiency. Although it might look a bit different to others, it serves the same purpose and can be customized to suit how you work.\nAlso: The top 5 GNOME extensions I install first (and what they can do for you)\nSoon, a new version of GNOME will be released (v47) and although it doesn't offer any game-changing features, the desktop does add enough improvements to make it a worthy upgrade.\nHere are the six features that will have a lasting impact on your experience.\n1. Custom accent colors\nFor some, GNOME isn't the most beautiful desktop on the market. I enjoy the aesthetic because I tend to lean toward minimalism. With the next release, the developers have finally added custom accent colors. This feature has been one of the more anticipated additions for a while.\nAlso: 5 quick tweaks make your GNOME desktop so much easier to use\nAlthough custom accent colors won't make GNOME more efficient or effective, they will make the desktop more pleasing to the eye. When you change the accent color, elements like borders, buttons, dropdowns, and other features will adopt the new highlight. It's a subtle addition, but it makes a big difference to the look of the GNOME desktop.\n2. Hardware encoding for screencasts\nThis is a significant improvement for video playback for both Intel and AMD hardware. GNOME 47 leverages Video Acceleration API (VA-API) and the vapostproc library and can now offload color conversion to hardware.\nThis feature means video playback will be considerably smoother and will reduce the load placed on the CPU.\nAlso: How to change DNS servers on a GNOME-based Linux distribution (and why you should)\nAnother addition is the use of Direct Memory Access Buffer (DMAbuf) with the explicit modifier API, which results in much-improved memory management/data transfer between the CPU and GPU.\n3. A new build option for Wayland\nCompiling GNOME used to require X11 to build. As for X11's replacement, Wayland, you couldn't build GNOME with it. That situation changes when 47 releases, by way of a new build option that enables compiling Mutter (the GNOME compositor) without depending on either X11 or Wayland. The options used for this are -Dx11=false -Dxwayland=true -Dwayland=true.\n4. Better performance\nGNOME 47 does a much better job of handling asynchronous processes and jobs. To achieve this boost, the gnome-initial-setup-copy-worker job launches the first time a user logs in and copies a set of files to the home directory. Thanks to this change, GNOME no longer depends on the slower GNOME Virtual Fiel System or GNOME's abstraction layer, which should bring about a significant performance increase.\n5. Improved default applications\nSeveral of the default GNOME applications have received improvements. At the top of that list is GNOME Calendar's new support of ICS file importing via drag and drop. Files also receives some love with a brand new file chooser, a redesigned sidebar, and more flexible bookmarks. The Epiphany web browser now includes features such as autofill, a bookmarks search bar, a privacy reporting feature, importing passwords from a CSV file, and setting an image as wallpaper.\n6. Network connection management\nThe Network View is revamped, with a new Network tab introduced in the Files sidebar. This new option displays connected devices, previous devices, and available network devices, so users will have an easier time managing network connections.\nAlso: How to choose the right Linux desktop distribution for you\nThere are plenty of smaller updates, plus the usual slew of bug fixes and security patches. You can read more about the upcoming GNOME 47 release in the official updated modules and changes document.\nAt the moment, GNOME 47 is in beta but will reach stable release candidacy on 14 September, so the official release should be coming soon. When the next iteration is released, you'll be able to read more about it on the official GNOME Release page or the GNOME Discourse site."

      "text": "XeroLinux could be the most beautiful Linux desktop on the market\nOver the decades, I've witnessed countless Linux desktop distributions, each of which attempts to set itself apart from the competition. Some of them, such as ZorinOS and Deepin Linux, have done a fairly remarkable job of doing just that. Since I started covering Linux back in '99, I've proclaimed distributions such as Elementary OS, ZorinOS, Deepin Linux, and Garuda Linux to be offering the most beautiful desktop on the market.\nHowever, I've recently happened upon a new release of XeroLinux that makes a very strong case to claim that coveted spot.\nXeroLinux is an Arch-based distribution that uses the KDE Plasma desktop to create an environment that is not only gorgeous, but also just as user-friendly as you've come to expect from the modern Linux desktop.\nAnd the latest release of XeroLinux makes its case with a default color scheme that would have made Prince break into an unearthly guitar solo while dancing in the rain.\nThat's right, it's all purple and it's glorious.\nWhat makes XeroLinux so special?\nTo begin with, the developers of XeroLinux have made the wise choice of following Hick's Law. For those that don't know, Hick's Law (aka Hick-Hyman Law) is named after William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, who studied the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individual's reaction time to any given stimulus.\nAlso: I tested out an AI art generator and here's what I learned\nFrom that study, they determined the more stimuli available lengthens the time it takes a user to make a decision. When a user suffers a deluge of options, they must take extra time to first interpret what they've been presented, and then act upon that.\nThere's even a formula for Hick's Law, which is RT = a + b log2 (n), where:\n- RT is reaction time.\n- n is the number of stimuli present.\n- a/b are arbitrarily measurable constants.\nDid the developers succeed at their task? I believe they have. When you look at the XeroLinux desktop, you'll find it contains not too few items and not too many. Instead, XeroLinux strikes that perfect combination that would prevent new users from getting overwhelmed, and seasoned users from getting underwhelmed.\nI'm going to skip all of the magic that happens under the hood, because most users really don't care about those bits, so long as everything runs well. Trust me when I say, XeroLinux runs as smooth and silky as any Arch-based distribution.\nWhat truly makes XeroLinux so special is how the developer doesn't stick with a default KDE Plasma layout (because that would be boring). Instead, the developer opts to give the desktop a decidedly MacOS feel with a dock and a top bar. Even without a single customization, everything looks and behaves to perfection.\nThe developers have taken great care to include everything on the desktop to make it easy to interact with the OS, but one of my favorite bits is the global menu that appears in the top bar for the application you're currently working on. Instead of an app taking extra space by housing its menu bar within the app window, XeroLinux kicks it off to the top bar, so you have access to the menu no matter where the window is. I've always been a fan of global menus, as they free up space in the app window and help standardize your workflow.\nOther things that help set XeroLinux apart include:\n- Both Pamac and Synaptic are available for software installation.\n- A simple-to-navigate desktop menu.\n- Flatseal flatpak GUI for easy installation.\n- A drop-down terminal window (Yakuake).\n- Plenty of animations.\n- Grub customizer.\n- Quick-access dark and light theme switching.\n- Tons of configuration options.\n- XeroLinux Configuration tool (for easy system updates and help setting up things like Samba and Nvidia graphics).\nNot everything's perfect\nI did run into a couple of small issues with XeroLinux, all easily solved. The first involved the Flatseal app. When I first opened the app, I was unable to search for installable Flatpak applications or do anything with the app. However, once I installed a Flatpak app from the command line (\"flatpak install spotify\"), Flatseal behaved as expected.\nThe other troubling issue was the Pamac GUI software installer. One of the first things I did was attempt to install LibreOffice with the Pamac GUI. Things did not go so well, and Pamac had some problems synchronizing package databases. Eventually, after the system detected that updates were available, the databases fell into sync, and I was then able to install LibreOffice (and plenty of other software). The process was a bit slower than I'd have liked, but it wasn't terribly challenging to resolve.\nAlso: What's new in LibreOffice and how do you install it in MacOS?\nThe thing about XeroLinux is that it's such a beautifully designed desktop, you're willing to forgive any slight hiccups that occur. And given most of the hiccups wound up resolving themselves, it's hard to find even the slightest fault in this outstanding Linux desktop operating system. I highly recommend downloading an ISO of XeroLinux and giving it a try. I'm confident you'll like what you see."

      "text": "6 Linux myths, busted\nI've been covering Linux and open-source since 1999 (the year of Prince). During that long stretch, a year hasn't gone by that I haven't experienced someone (or a group of someones) still believing the myths that seem to be forever churning about the open-source operating system.\nAlso: The 3 most Windows-like Linux distros you can try because change is hard\nIt would be impossible to calculate the hours I've spent trying to help people understand that the vast majority of those myths simply are not true. Hopefully every time I do, someone's eyes are opened, and they see what they've been misunderstanding.\n1. Linux requires the use of the terminal\nWhen I first started using Linux in 1997, the terminal was an absolute necessity. There was no way around it. I had to write scripts to keep a modem connected, install software from source, manage users and permissions, and just about everything from the terminal. Sure, there were GUI apps for some of those tasks, but those graphical tools weren't up to snuff.\nThat was then, and this is now.\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and I recommend this distro to newbies and experts alike\nI've tested this myth. I've made myself refrain from using the Command Line Interface (CLI) for weeks at a time and never once felt it was something I had to use. How is that possible? The desktop environments and various settings apps have come a very long way over the years, to the point that they've become equally as effective as the terminal.\nEven with servers, there are now web-based tools like Cockpit that make it possible to do much of what used to be required of the command line. That doesn't mean you can just as easily skip the terminal when using Linux on a server, though. In that case, yeah, you had better learn CLI. But on the desktop? No.\nDo yourself a favor and go a week without opening the terminal on desktop Linux and see how it goes. You'll be surprised that tasks every average computer user requires can be managed without having to echo >> \"Using the terminal.\"\n2. Linux users don't want Microsoft-like desktops\nI, for one, opt to go a very non-Microsoft route for my desktop environment. But the average computer user who's spent years (or decades) with Windows and is looking to migrate to an alternative? They need familiarity.\nAlso: This Linux distro is so Windows-like, it even comes with Microsoft apps\nThere's a reason why the old adage \"people fear change\" is bandied about\u2026 because, for the most part, it's true. Most people who'd like to migrate away from Microsoft aren't doing so because they hate the interface. The majority of users don't care what the interface looks like, only that it works and is easy to learn.\nThat's the very reason why Linux distributions that look like Windows (and MacOS) exist. Developers know that some users simply aren't going to adopt Linux if what they see is totally foreign to them. The beauty of those distributions is that they lure users to Linux and then allow them to grow from the standard Windows interface. But the important idea is to woo users over with something familiar that's also better.\n3. Linux is totally virus-free\nIt used to be that viruses didn't stand a chance against Linux. For the most part, that's still true. However, it doesn't mean that Linux is 100% safe from malicious software, URLs, and code. The way I see it is that if your computer is connected to a network, it's vulnerable. But instead of having to constantly worry about these threats, just make sure you're installing software from reputable repositories, and don't click on random links (especially from within email).\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 5 factors to help you decide between Linux or MacOS\nI've used Linux for decades and, on the desktop, have never once suffered a virus, malware, or ransomware. I have, on one occasion, dealt with a nasty rootkit on a Linux server, but that's a different story altogether.\n4. Linux doesn't have the software you need\nConsider this -- there are multiple routes to installing software, including:\n- Standard repositories\n- Third-party repositories\n- Source\n- Snap\n- Flatpak\n- AppImage\n- Wine\n- Steam\nAll told, there is a wealth of apps available for Linux.\nAlso: Leaving Windows 10 for Linux? 5 security differences to consider first\nBut here's the thing: the majority of users spend their time in a web browser (6.36 hours a day on average, according to Statista). If we're talking about a typical workday, that doesn't leave much time for other applications.\nIf you need to use MS Office, Office365 works great in most browsers. Do you use Spotify for music? It's there. What about Slack? Yup. Microsoft Teams? You know it.\nThe truth is Linux does not lack software. If you do run into a Windows app that doesn't have a Linux version, you can always try running it with Wine (which is a compatibility layer that allows for the installation of Windows software on Linux).\n5. Linux is hard\nWhen I first started using Linux, it was quite challenging. But over the past two decades, desktop Linux has become so easy anyone can use it.\nAlso: I converted this Mini PC from Windows to Linux, and it came alive. Here's how\nMy father was not terribly adept with computers. When he purchased his first computer, it had Windows 7, and he had nothing but problems. I installed Ubuntu Linux over Windows, and it was smooth sailing. He was able to use it with ease. Part of the reason why he picked it up so quickly was because he was never told it was hard. He went into it assuming it would be easier than what he had, and that assumption proved to be true.\nI've watched Linux evolve since the early days, and what we have today is exponentially easier than it was back then.\n6. Linux doesn't support many peripherals\nI have peripherals that will not work on MacOS. I have peripherals Windows cannot detect unless I track down the proper driver. For example, my Brother laser printer gives MacOS fits, and Windows simply cannot see it until I install a driver, which takes me a while to track down.\nAlso: System76 just took everything that was good in Pop!_OS and made it even better\nLinux, on the other hand, sees it immediately and works without installing any sort of driver. At the same time, I've had scanners that I couldn't get work, no matter what I did.\nThe thing about peripherals is that they are all hit-or-miss. Printers are a nightmare. Back when I was doing PC support, I probably spent 80% of my time solving printer problems, and in every single instance, the problem was caused by Windows. Most peripherals were designed with Windows in mind because Microsoft's desktop OS is the most widely used on the planet. Even so, Windows can struggle to work with some peripherals.\nFrom my perspective, this is a crap shoot, regardless of what OS you're on. That being said, since 1997, I've only had a handful of peripherals that I could not get to work with Linux, and that is a pretty good track record."
