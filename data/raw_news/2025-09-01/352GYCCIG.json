  "description": "Steven Kleinveld, CEO and co-founder of applied AI lab Skylark, argues that vibe coding won't replace developers \u2014 it'll upgrade them.",
  "content": "Founders\u2019 takes is a new series featuring expert insights from tech leaders transforming industries with artificial intelligence. In this edition, Steven Kleinveld, founder of applied AI lab Skylark, argues that vibe coding won\u2019t replace developers \u2014 it\u2019ll upgrade them.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk lately that AI is going to replace developers. With the rise of tools that let you prompt your way into building apps, people are starting to wonder: \u201cAre developers even still needed?\u201d The short answer: yes \u2014 more than ever.\n\nThe hype around no-code and \u201cvibe coding\u201d makes it seem like anyone can build a solid MVP overnight. And sure, tools like Lovable, Bolt, and Canva Code are great for testing ideas quickly. But once things get more complex, these tools hit a ceiling\u2026\n\nYou still need someone who knows how things actually work \u2014 backend logic, data flows, design systems, UX decisions. The stuff that makes a product good, not just functional. That\u2019s where developers come in \u2014 and not just any developers, but those who know how to work with AI, not fear it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end of developers. It\u2019s a shift in how they work. It\u2019s well documented that LLMs such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Google\u2019s Gemini, and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT have been drastically improving. As a result of this, the quality of AI tooling has skyrocketed, allowing developers to work with superhuman efficiency, thus becoming more valuable. This moment in tech isn\u2019t about replacing developers; it\u2019s about how they evolve.\n\nAI won\u2019t replace developers. But developers who use AI will replace the ones who don\u2019t\n\nJust to be clear, AI is amazing at taking care of the repetitive stuff \u2014 generating code snippets, filling in boilerplate, even giving you a head start on a frontend. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can build a reliable, secure, and scalable product from scratch.\n\nAs the CEO of Skylark, an applied AI lab, I\u2019m well aware of how quickly the field is evolving. But it will still be years before AI models master all three elements \u2014 reliability, security, and scalability \u2014 without a human in the loop.\n\nDevelopers who get AI get supercharged\n\nThe real winners in this AI wave? Developers who know how to work with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a backend developer, AI can help you with front-end tasks you\u2019re less confident in. If you\u2019re full-stack, you can use it to speed up your workflow and focus on the tricky parts you enjoy most. It\u2019s like having a really fast assistant \u2014 but you still need to be the one steering the ship.\n\nThe key is knowing what you\u2019re good at, what you\u2019re not, and where AI can fill in the gaps. That\u2019s what makes a developer \u201cAI-savvy.\u201d And in my view, that\u2019s becoming one of the most valuable skills out there.\n\nVibe coding is fun, but it won\u2019t take you all the way\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen the trend of prompting an AI to \u201cjust build this\u201d and hoping it works. It\u2019s fast, it\u2019s playful, and sometimes it\u2019s surprisingly good. But it can also lead to what I call \u2018AI drift\u2019: when your product slowly shifts away from your original idea because the AI starts adding unnecessary features or misinterpreting what you want.\n\nThis is where experienced developers make the difference. They know when something\u2019s off. They know when to stop the AI and fix things. They know how to spot bugs or security issues the AI missed. Non-technical folks often miss these signs \u2014 and that\u2019s where things can break, fast.\n\nSo no, AI isn\u2019t replacing developers. It\u2019s giving the best ones extra gear.\n\nOf course, not every founder will be technical. But even non-tech founders will need to understand how AI works and, more importantly, what its limits are. Knowing how to prompt an AI is one thing. Knowing when the output is wrong is a whole other skill.\n\nDevelopers who learn how to work with AI will only become more valuable. They\u2019ll build faster, smarter, and with fewer people, but they\u2019ll still be the ones driving the process.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a developer wondering if AI is coming for your job, I\u2019d say: don\u2019t worry. Just get familiar with the tools, stay sharp on your skills, and figure out how AI can make you better.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end of the road \u2014 it\u2019s a new chapter. And developers are still very much the main characters.",

  "argos_summary": "Founders\u2019 takes interview with Steven Kleinveld, founder of Skylark, argues that AI will not replace developers but will upgrade them. He notes that no\u2011code and vibe\u2011coding tools can quickly build MVPs, yet they hit a ceiling when complexity, security, and scalability are required. Developers who learn to work with LLMs and other AI tools become super\u2011charged, adding value and staying indispensable. The piece underscores that the future of software is human\u2011led and AI\u2011accelerated, with developers as the main drivers.",
