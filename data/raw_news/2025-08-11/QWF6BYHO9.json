  "content": "THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON August 11, 2025 Dear Representative Garcia: The District of Columbia is facing a crisis of violent crime. Our Nation's capital should symbolize American greatness, but violent crime and ineffective local policies threaten law and order in the heart of our Republic. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States. As President of the United States, I have the obligation to ensure the safety and security of all Americans, including those who live and work in our Nation's capital. I must also ensure that our Federal institutions operate efficiently, without the preventable diversion of Federal resources to address the violent crime epidemic. Pursuant to my authority under section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740), I have determined that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation's seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Accordingly, I informed the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) of this decision on August 11, 2025. The Mayor will provide to me the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes until I have determined, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the emergency has ended or for the maximum period permitted under section 740. Sincerely, The Honorable Robert Garcia Committee on Oversight and Government Accountability House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515",
