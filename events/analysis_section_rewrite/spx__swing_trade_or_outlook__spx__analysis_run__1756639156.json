      "feedback": "Your draft meets the 4‑line scenario requirement but needs a few tightening edits to hit the exact format and provide actionable trade details.  \n\n1. **Add the canonical handle** – in each scenario line, embed “spx” in the driver or watch field (e.g., “Fed cuts early + tech earnings slowdown + sticky inflation (spx)”) so the mapping rule is satisfied.  \n2. **Provide numeric trade levels** – replace the textual placeholders in the trade plan with concrete numbers: Entry = 5,200, Stop = 5,020 (≈ 3.5 % of entry), Target = 4,600 (≈ 10 % decline). Keep the R/R 3:1 consistent with these figures.  \n3. **Keep the probability and confidence in the final column** – move the “Probability %” and “Confidence 0–100” to the end of the trade line, exactly as the spec dictates, and drop any extra parentheses around the citations.  \n4. **Remove the extra “Down” line** – the draft currently has 5 lines; keep only the 4 scenario lines and the single trade line.  \n\nAfter these edits the output will read:  \n\n```\nUp | 3‑6 months | Resilient tech earnings + delayed Fed cut + inflation easing (spx) | Q3 earnings of AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, Fed policy statements | 20%\nUp | 3‑6 months | 10‑yr Treasury yield falls below 4.3% (spx) | 10‑yr yield data, core PCE revisions | 15%\nDown | 3‑6 months | Fed cuts early + tech earnings slowdown + sticky inflation (spx) | Fed policy meeting September 20, core PCE > 3%, tech earnings releases | 60%\nDown | 3‑6 months | 10‑yr Treasury yield rises above 4.3% + core PCE > 3% (spx) | 10‑yr yield, core PCE data | 25%\nDown | 3‑6 months | 5,200 | 5,020 | 4,600 | 3:1 | 10‑yr yield < 4.3% or core PCE < 2.5% | Fed policy meeting September 20 | 60% | 70\n```\n\nThese changes enforce the strict line format, provide clear numeric trade parameters, and satisfy the handle‑mapping requirement.",
