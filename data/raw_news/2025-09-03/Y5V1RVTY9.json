  "description": "The hack has caused severe disruption at manufacturing plants globally, with some staff told not to come into work.",
  "content": "M&S hackers claim to be behind Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack\n\nA group of young English-speaking hackers are claiming to be behind the cyber attack which has halted the global production lines of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR). The group is bragging about the hack on the messaging app Telegram, sharing screenshots apparently taken from inside the car maker's IT networks. The gangs is also responsible for a wave of cyber attacks on UK retailers including M&S in the spring - and are calling themselves \"Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters\". \"Where is my new car, Land Rover,\" the hackers - who are thought to be teens - posted to taunt the company.\n\nThe BBC has approached JLR for comment. In private text conversations with one of the criminals, who claims to be the spokesperson for the group, they said they are trying to extort the car company for money. But the hacker would not say if they have successfully stolen private data from JLR or installed malicious software onto the company's network. The hacker wouldn't provide any more evidence they are responsible for the hack -and they are known to lie to get attention. But two images posted by the group show apparent internal instructions for troubleshooting a car charging issue and internal computer logs. One security expert has speculated the screenshots suggest the criminals have access to information they should not have. \"Based on the information provided by the attackers and open source intelligence, the attack has access to JLR's internal systems and network,\" security researcher Kevin Beaumont said. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner's Office said: \"Jaguar Land Rover has reported an incident and we are assessing the information provided.\"\n\nCar production at sites including the Halewood plant in Merseyside and another in Solihull have been heavily disrupted since the attack was discovered on Sunday. Staff have been sent home and JLR has said it's working to get manufacturing back online. The company has not disclosed the nature of the attack. \"We took immediate action to mitigate its impact by proactively shutting down our systems, it said in a statement. \"We are now working at pace to restart our global applications in a controlled manner. \"At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\" The hackers chose the name Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters to reflect the merging of various youth-orientated cyber criminals who are all associated with a network called The Com. Earlier this year the National Crime Agency warned of the growing threat from cyber criminals in The Com. The newly named group is a mixture of hackers who have been part of the groups Shiny Hunters, Lapsus$ and Scattered Spider - all notorious young hacking groups of the last few years that emerged from The Com. The Telegram channel used by the criminals now has nearly 52,000 subscribers. The group has been bragging about hacks and sharing incomprehensible in-jokes for days. It's the forth such Telegram channel as previous ones have been closed down. Scattered Spider is name of a loosely linked group of hackers responsible for high profile attacks on M&S, Co-op and Harrods in April and May. In July the National Crime Agency arrested 4 people in connection to the hacks. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, and three males - aged between 17 and 19 - were detained in London and the West Midlands. All have since been released on bail.",

      "text": "What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it?\n- Published\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.\nIt is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.\nBut the rise of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology's environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.\nWhat is AI and what is it used for?\nAI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason.\nHowever, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nThis could be trying to anticipate what product an online shopper might buy, based on previous purchases, in order to recommend items.\nThe technology is also behind voice-controlled virtual assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, and is being used to develop systems for self-driving cars.\nAI also helps social platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X decide what posts to show users. Streaming services Spotify and Deezer use AI to suggest music.\nThere are also a number of applications in medicine, as scientists use AI to help spot cancers, review X-ray results, speed up diagnoses and identify new treatments.\nWhat is generative AI, and how do apps like ChatGPT and Meta AI work?\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can seem like it has been made by a human.\nIt does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nChatGPT and Chinese rival DeepSeek's chatbot are popular generative AI tools that can be used to produce text, images, code and more material.\nGoogle's Gemini or Meta AI can similarly hold text conversations with users.\nApps like Midjourney or Veo 3 are dedicated to creating images or video from simple text prompts.\nGenerative AI can also be used to make high-quality music.\nSongs mimicking the style or sound of famous musicians have gone viral, sometimes leaving fans confused about their authenticity.\nWhy is AI controversial?\nWhile acknowledging AI's potential, some experts are worried about the implications of its rapid growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs, and worsen global financial inequality.\nProf Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist regarded as one of the \"godfathers\" of AI development, has expressed concern that powerful AI systems could even make humans extinct - although his fear was dismissed by his fellow \"AI godfather\", Yann LeCun.\nCritics also highlight the tech's potential to reproduce biased information, or discriminate against some social groups.\nThis is because much of the data used to train AI comes from public material, including social media posts or comments, which can reflect existing societal biases such as sexism or racism.\nAnd while AI programmes are growing more adept, they are still prone to errors - such as creating images of people with the wrong number of fingers or limbs.\nGenerative AI systems are known for their ability to \"hallucinate\" and assert falsehoods as fact, even sometimes inventing sources for the inaccurate information.\nApple halted a new AI feature in January after it incorrectly summarised news app notifications.\nThe BBC complained about the feature after Apple's AI falsely told readers that Luigi Mangione - the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson - had shot himself.\nGoogle has also faced criticism over inaccurate answers produced by its AI search overviews.\nThis has added to concerns about the use of AI in schools and workplaces, where it is increasingly used to help summarise texts, write emails or essays and solve bugs in code.\nThere are worries about students using AI technology to \"cheat\" on assignments, or employees \"smuggling\" it into work.\nWriters, musicians and artists have also pushed back against the technology on ethical grounds, accusing AI developers of using their work to train systems without consent or compensation.\nThousands of creators - including Abba singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, writers Ian Rankin and Joanne Harris and actress Julianne Moore - signed a statement, external in October 2024 calling AI a \"major, unjust threat\" to their livelihoods.\nHow does AI effect the environment?\nIt is not clear how much energy AI systems use, but some researchers estimate the industry as a whole could soon consume as much as the Netherlands.\nCreating the powerful computer chips needed to run AI programmes requires lots of power and water.\nDemand for generative AI services has also meant an increase in the number of data centres which power them.\nThese huge halls - housing thousands of racks of computer servers - use substantial amounts of energy and require large volumes of water to keep them cool.\nSome large tech companies have invested in ways to reduce or reuse the water needed, or have opted for alternative methods such as air-cooling.\nHowever, some experts and activists fear that AI will worsen water supply problems.\nThe BBC was told in February that government plans to make the UK a \"world leader\" in AI could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain.\nIn September 2024, Google said it would reconsider proposals for a data centre in Chile, which has struggled with drought.\nAre there laws governing AI?\nSome governments have already introduced rules governing how AI operates.\nThe EU's Artificial Intelligence Act places controls on high risk systems used in areas such as education, healthcare, law enforcement or elections. It bans some AI use altogether.\nGenerative AI developers in China are required to safeguard citizens' data, and promote transparency and accuracy of information. But they are also bound by the country's strict censorship laws.\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government \"will test and understand AI before we regulate it\".\nBoth the UK and US have AI Safety Institutes that aim to identify risks and evaluate advanced AI models.\nIn 2024 the two countries signed an agreement to collaborate on developing \"robust\" AI testing methods.\nHowever, in February 2025, neither country signed an international AI declaration which pledged an open, inclusive and sustainable approach to the technology.\nSeveral countries including the UK are also clamping down on use of AI systems to create deepfake nude imagery and child sexual abuse material.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

      "text": "What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep children safe online\n- Published\nThe way people in the UK might navigate the internet is changing.\nUnder the Online Safety Act, platforms must take action - such as carrying out age checks - to stop children seeing illegal and harmful material from July.\nServices face large fines if they fail to comply with UK's sweeping online safety rules. But what do they mean for children?\nHere's what you need to know.\nWhat is the Online Safety Act and how will it protect children?\nThe Online Safety Act's central aim is to make the internet safer for people in the UK, especially children.\nIt is a set of laws and duties that online platforms must follow, being implemented and enforced by Ofcom, the media regulator.\nUnder its Children's Codes, platforms must prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography from 25 July.\nThis will see some services, notably porn sites, start checking the age of UK users.\nOfcom's rules are also designed to protect children from misogynistic, violent, hateful or abusive material, online bullying and dangerous challenges.\nFirms which wish to continue operating in the UK must adopt measures including:\nchanging the algorithms which determine what is shown in children's feeds to filter out harmful content\nimplementing age verification methods to check whether a user is under 18\nremoving identified harmful material quickly and supporting children who have been exposed to it\nidentifying a named person who is \"accountable for children's safety\", and annually review how they are managing risk to children on their platforms\nFailure to comply could result in businesses being fined \u00a318m or 10% of their global revenues - whichever is higher - or their executives being jailed.\nIn very serious cases Ofcom says it can apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.\nWhat else is in the Online Safety Act?\nThe bill also requires firms to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including:\nchild sexual abuse\ncontrolling or coercive behaviour\nextreme sexual violence\npromoting suicide or self-harm\nselling illegal drugs or weapons\nterrorism\nThe Act has also created new offences, such as:\ncyber-flashing - sending unsolicited sexual imagery online\nsharing \"deepfake\" pornography, where artificial intelligence is used to insert someone's likeness into pornographic content\nWhy has it been criticised?\nA number of campaigners want to see even stricter rules for tech firms, and some want under-16s banned from social media completely.\nIan Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation - which was set up in memory of his daughter who took her own life aged 14 - said he was \"dismayed by the lack of ambition\" in Ofcom's codes.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have also called for stronger protection from the dangers of social media, saying \"enough is not being done\".\nThey unveiled a temporary memorial in New York City dedicated to children who have died due to the harms of the internet.\n\"We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,\" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast.\nThe NSPCC children's charity argues that the law still doesn't provide enough protection around private messaging apps. It says that the end-to-end encrypted services which they offer \"continue to pose an unacceptable, major risk to children\".\nOn the other side, privacy campaigners complain the new rules threaten users' freedom.\nSome also argue age verification methods are invasive without being effective enough.\nDigital age checks can lead to \"security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship,\" according to Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch.\nHow much time do UK children spend online?\nChildren aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, according to Ofcom research, external.\nIt found that nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok.\nAbout half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom.\nHowever, the Children's Commissioner said that half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing \"hardcore, misogynistic\" pornographic material on social media sites.\nChildren also said material about suicide self-harm and eating disorders was \"prolific\" and that violent content was \"unavoidable\".\nWhat online parental controls are available?\nThe NSPCC says it's vital that parents talk to their children about internet safety, external and take an interest in what they do online.\nTwo-thirds of parents say they use controls to limit what their children see online, according to Internet Matters, a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies.\nIt has a list of parental controls available, external and step-by-step guides, external on how to use them.\nThese include advice on how to manage teen or child accounts on social media, video platforms such as YouTube, and gaming platforms such as Roblox or Fortnite.\nHowever Ofcom data suggests that about one in five children are able to disable parental controls.\nInstagram has already introduced \"teen accounts\" which turn on many privacy settings by default - although some researchers have claimed they were able to circumvent the promised protections.\nWhat controls are there on mobile phones and gaming consoles?\nPhone and broadband networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18.\nSome also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones.\nAndroid, external and Apple, external devices also offer options for parents to block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing.\nGame console controls also let parents ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases, external.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

That target is eight years ahead of the government's original goal of 2033, a date Mr Johnson described as \"laughably unambitious\".\nLast year, a government report estimated, external the cost of covering the UK with full-fibre broadband by the old deadline of 2033 would be about \u00a333bn.\nWhat difference could it make?\nWith more people using data-intensive streaming services, smart devices and video calls, we need more data.\nThe average household used 240 gigabytes of data a month in 2018, up 26% on the previous year, telecoms industry regulator Ofcom, external said.\nIt also said there could be several other benefits to consumers and businesses, external:\nCreating jobs focused on infrastructure\nIncreasing companies' productivity\nReducing the need to commute by making remote working easier\nFaster connections make it quicker to download films, play online games or use streaming services.\nWhat is full-fibre broadband?\nBroadband is a term for high-speed connections carrying internet data and other types of traffic.\nThere are three main types of broadband connection that link the local telephone exchange to your house:\nADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) uses copper cables to a street-level cabinet or junction box and on to the house\nFTTC (fibre to the cabinet) uses a faster fibre optic cable to the cabinet, but then copper cable from there to the house\nFTTP (fibre to the premises) uses a fibre optic cable to connect to households without using any copper cable\nCopper has been the backbone of the internet infrastructure, as it's used in the telephone network across the UK and goes into most homes.\nBut it's old and slower than fibre optic cable, which is made from glass or plastic and uses pulses of light to transmit data.\nOn the other hand, digging up and replacing copper with fibre optic cable to reach into people's homes is expensive and involves a lot of work.\nHow fast is full-fibre?\nCurrently, the UK government defines superfast broadband as having speeds greater than 30 megabits per second (Mbps). A megabit is the standard measurement of internet speed.\nUltrafast is defined as a speed greater than 100Mbps.\nA connection using both fibre and copper (FTTC) can reach speeds of up to about 66Mbps.\nBut a full-fibre connection (FTTP) - with no copper - can offer much faster average speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbps) - that's 1,000Mbps. It could potentially offer speeds in terabits per second in future. (One terabit equals 1,000 gigabits.)\nThere are other types of very fast connection as well. Virgin Media uses a different type of cable for the last section that comes into your house, which in theory can offer speeds of up to 10Gbps.\nThere is also a service called G.fast, which uses a special pod to boost the speed of the standard copper cable connection.\nWhere can you get the fastest connections?\nThe availability of the fastest broadband is still very limited.\nIn February, Virgin Media began a small trial of broadband in Cambridgeshire using fibre optic cable to give households speeds of 8Gbps (gigabits per second).\nLast year, another company, Hyperoptic, tested speeds of up to 10Gbps in a home in east London.\nAt the moment, the UK ranks well behind some other European nations including Latvia, Lithuania and Spain, where roughly half of all homes have access to the fastest connections, external.\nCould 5G mobile offer similar speeds?\nOne of the companies planning to launch the new faster 5G mobile services believes they will be so fast that many homes in the UK won't need a fixed broadband connection.\nThree UK told the BBC last year that there would be enough capacity on 5G to match the speeds of the fastest fibre cable connections. Ofcom suggests that in time 5G could offer speeds of 20Gbps, external.\nOne advantage of 5G is that it uses a wireless link for the connection to your house, instead of cabling.\nThis could be particularly useful in rural areas which have lagged behind in the provision of faster broadband.\nBut some experts caution this may also be a disadvantage as the wireless signal would not be as stable as a fixed-line connection and could drop out at times.\n- Published25 July 2019\n- Published25 March 2019"
