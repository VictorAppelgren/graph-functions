  "title": "Want Healthier Kidneys? 13 Superfoods You Should Add to Your Grocery List",
  "description": "These affordable foods will keep your kidneys healthy and you probably already have them in your fridge.",
  "content": "Your kidneys are working nonstop, whether you know it or not. They clear waste from your blood, balance fluid levels, regulate hormones and even influence things like blood pressure and energy.\n\nAs important as kidney health may be, it doesn't always get the focus it should. The CDC estimates that more than 1 in 7 adults in the US are living with chronic kidney disease, and many don't even know it. That's why prevention and daily care are so important.\n\nTaking simple steps now can help protect your kidneys and keep them functioning well for years to come. Fortunately, you don't need to make dramatic lifestyle changes to support kidney health. Incorporating a handful of nutrient-rich superfoods into your regular meals can make a significant difference. These foods help reduce inflammation, support healthy blood flow and ease the load on your kidneys so they can keep doing their job. If you're looking to give your kidneys the boost they need, these 13 simple additions to your diet are a great way to start.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\nYour diet and gut health also play a major role in your wellness, especially when it comes to keeping your kidneys healthy. There are 13 superfoods you should keep in mind when considering natural ways to give your kidney health a boost.\n\nRead more: 6 Important Blood Tests You May Need for Your Overall Health\n\nThis nutrient-dense vegetable is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more.\n\nPlus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.\n\nFish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\n\nIf you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has a chart you can use to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.\n\nLike cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.\n\nYou can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.\n\nCranberries help to prevent urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.\n\nPlus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.\n\nWe've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries deliver.\n\nWith high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits.\n\nBe advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.\n\nRich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. A study from Harvard University found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.\n\nBeyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.\n\nAnother antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin \u2014 an active compound found in garlic \u2014 worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.\n\nPlus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.\n\nFrom the same family as garlic, onions give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.\n\nThey also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.\n\nCauliflower brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.\n\nCauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.\n\nEgg whites are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.\n\nArugula is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.\n\nYou can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.\n\nApples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.\n\nBetter yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.",

      "text": "Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?\nOn call\nQ. I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil?\nA. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor.\nRegardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none.\nStill, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases.\nKeep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.\nImage: \u00a9 fcafotodigital/Getty Images\nAbout the Author\nHoward E.

      "text": "| Dark Green Leafy Vegetables |\nLin Yan\nPeople have been eating leafy greens since prehistoric times. But it wasn't until the first Africans arrived in North America in the early 1600s that America got its first real tastes of dark green leafy vegetables, which they grew for themselves and their families. So, over the years, cooked greens developed into a traditional African American food. Ultimately, they became essential in Southern regional diets and are now enjoyed nationwide.\nDark green leafy vegetables are great sources of nutrition. Salad greens, kale and spinach are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K, and broccoli, bok choy and mustard are also rich in many of the B-vitamins. These vegetables also contain an abundance of carotenoids-antioxidants that protect cells and play roles in blocking the early stages of cancer. They also contain high levels of fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium and calcium. Furthermore, greens have very little carbohydrates, sodium and cholesterol.\nThe dark greens supply a significant amount of folate, a B vitamin that promotes heart health and helps prevent certain birth defects. Folate is also necessary for DNA duplication and repair which protects against the development of cancer. Several large studies have shown that high intakes of folate may lower the risk of colon polyps by 30 to 40 percent compared to low intakes of this vitamin. Other research suggests that diets low in folate may increase the risk of cancers of the breast, cervix and lung.\nThe vitamin K contents of dark green leafy vegetables provide a number of health benefits including: protecting bones from osteoporosis and helping to prevent against inflammatory diseases.\nBecause of their high content of antioxidants, green leafy vegetables may be one of the best cancer-preventing foods. Studies have shown that eating 2 to 3 servings of green leafy vegetables per week may lower the risk of stomach, breast and skin cancer. These same antioxidants have also been proven to decrease the risk of heart disease.\nPerhaps one of the most appealing benefits of dark green leafy vegetables is their low calorie and carbohydrate contents and their low glycemic index. These features make them an ideal food to facilitate achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight. Adding more green vegetables to a balanced diet increases the intake of dietary fiber which, in turn, regulates the digestive system and aids in bowel health and weight management. These properties are particularly advantageous for those with type-2 diabetes.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends increasing average intakes of fruits and vegetables, particularly those that provide more vitamins, minerals and fiber. Dark leafy greens fulfill this need. Many varieties of greens are available in the American markets-the most popular are collards, mustard greens, turnip greens, chard, spinach and kale.\nEating dark green leafy vegetables is vital to a healthy, balanced diet. There are many ways to enjoy a meal with leafy greens:\nMake a salad: Keep salads interesting by varying their colors, textures and varieties. Perk them up with small tender leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, spinach and arugula mixed with different kinds of tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots.\nWrap it up: Make a wrap with tuna, chicken or turkey and add romaine lettuce, spinach, arugula, and other veggies for some extra flavor.\nAdd to soup: Add greens with larger, tougher leaves such as collard greens, kale or mustard greens into your favorite soup.\nStir-fry: Add chopped spinach, bok choy or broccoli to chicken or tofu stir-fried with olive or canola oil with some garlic, onion or ginger.\nSteamed: Steaming collard greens, mustard greens, kale or spinach until they are slightly soft.\nIn an omelet: Add steamed broccoli and/or spinach to an egg-white omelet for a vitamin and iron rich meal."

      "text": "Tiny but mighty, blueberries are rich in health benefits\nIn the summer, there\u2019s nothing quite like digging into a bowl of fresh, juicy blueberries \u2014 and these delicious tiny fruits pack a big nutritious punch.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nDietitian Julia Zumpano, RD, LD, has the scoop on the benefits of eating blueberries.\nAbsolutely. In fact, blueberries are one of the healthiest fruits for you, Zumpano says. \u201cStudies show that they help protect against aging, cancer and damage to your DNA.\u201d A standard serving of 100 grams (3/4 of a cup) provides 65 calories and 15 grams of carbohydrates.\nHere are a few reasons why blueberries are such a healthy option.\nStress isn\u2019t good for your body \u2014 especially oxidative stress. This kind of stress occurs due to the presence of molecules called free radicals. Produced naturally as a result of metabolism or because of exposure to toxins, cigarette smoke and alcohol, free radicals don\u2019t get along with your body. In fact, they damage cells.\nAntioxidants are key to reducing the impact of oxidative stress. \u201cAntioxidants create a barrier or a shield around the cell to help protect it from being damaged,\u201d Zumpano explains. As it happens, blueberries are very high in antioxidants \u2014 specifically anthocyanins, which are also found in chokeberries and elderberries.\nAccording to a 2004 study, a cup of cultivated blueberries (berries grown to eat) has 9,019 antioxidants. Lowbush (or wild) blueberries have 13,427 total antioxidants per cup.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to being low in calories, blueberries are nutrient-dense. They\u2019re good sources of vitamin C and vitamin K, as well as manganese.\nA cup of blueberries provides the following recommended daily intake of vitamins and minerals:\nVitamin C is known for boosting your immune system and fortifying other body functions, while vitamin K helps your blood clot properly. Manganese, meanwhile, can also help with blood clotting, while promoting bone and muscle strength.\nBlueberries are high in soluble fiber. \u201cSoluble fiber binds around the bile in our guts and helps remove that bile,\u201d Zumpano says. Bile is waste that\u2019s made of several things \u2014 including cholesterol, bile acids, salts, metals, and bilirubin (a substance produced after breaking down red blood cells) \u2014 which is why removing it is so important.\n\u201cWhen soluble fiber binds around the bile, it helps to remove that bile, composed of cholesterol with the body\u2019s waste, therefore can lead to a reduction in cholesterol, which therefore leads to it preventing or reverse reducing your risk of heart disease,\u201d she continues.\nBecause blueberries are high in fiber and lower in sugar when compared to other fruits, they don\u2019t cause your blood sugar to spike. For people with certain health conditions, scientists suspect this positive effect could aid with blood sugar management. A 2016 review of animal and human studies concluded that more human studies were warranted, though, on the effect of blueberries on insulin resistance, which can lead to diabetes. A later 2020 study of men living with Type 2 diabetes found that eating blueberries daily lowered certain cardiometabolic health parameters, such as triglycerides.\nA 2019 study of people living with metabolic syndrome found that eating blueberries daily had a positive impact. Although insulin resistance was unchanged, people saw a reduction in other areas. \u201cEating blueberries helps reduce blood pressure in people who have metabolic syndrome because it helps the body produce more nitric oxide, which relaxes your blood vessels,\u201d Zumpano notes.\nThere\u2019s no downside to eating blueberries every day because they\u2019re so healthy. But Zumpano says you\u2019ll get the most benefits from fresh, uncooked organic berries. While delicious, blueberry pancakes or muffins aren\u2019t quite as healthy.\n\u201cAntioxidants can be harmed by heat,\u201d Zumpano explains. \u201cYou don\u2019t kill the fiber, and you still have the vitamins and minerals. But heat can affect the antioxidant content. So raw, fresh and organic blueberries are the best way to go.\u201d\nIf you do buy non-organic blueberries, Zumpano also recommends washing them before eating. \u201cI usually soak all my berries that are non-organic in lemon juice, or filtered water with baking powder,\u201d she says. \u201cI let them soak for a couple of minutes, and then drain and rinse them.\u201d\nThe lemon juice tends to make them taste better, she adds. \u201cSome of the berries get mushy after the baking soda. If it\u2019s a rougher vegetable or something with a skin, like an apple or a cucumber or carrots, I\u2019ll be more likely to use baking soda. However, berries tend to hold their share and texture better when cleaning with a filtered water with a small amount of lemon juice.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBlueberries are also a versatile fruit suitable for meals at any time. You can enjoy them in cereal, oatmeal, smoothies or salads. \u201cOrganic frozen berries can be a little less expensive,\u201d Zumpano says. \u201cYou can put them in hot oatmeal and let them defrost allowing their juices to release natural sweetness and flavor. Throw them in a smoothie, or just snack on them frozen for a refreshing snack for great ways to enjoy them.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nAdvertisement\nHigh in vitamin A, antioxidants, fiber and potassium, this winter squash helps protect your eyes, heart and gut\nThis glorious green superfood is full of vitamins, minerals and lots of other healthy stuff\nHigh in antioxidants, this superfood offers many health benefits, including improving digestion and lowering cholesterol\nCoconut is a good source of healthy fat, fiber and essential minerals like manganese\nThis fruit has clear nutritional benefits \u2014 but there\u2019s little evidence it can prevent or treat illness\nThis handy fruit is packed with nutrients that can benefit your heart, gut and immune system\nBite into a slice of papaya to enjoy a taste of the tropics and disease-fighting nutrients\nIf you\u2019re feeling short of breath, sleep can be tough \u2014 propping yourself up or sleeping on your side may help\nIf you fear the unknown or find yourself needing reassurance often, you may identify with this attachment style\nIf you\u2019re looking to boost your gut health, it\u2019s better to get fiber from whole foods"

Whether you're following a keto diet or prefer vegan meals, trying to save some money on a ballooning grocery bill or just need dinner on the table fast, there\u2019s a meal kit out there that can help.\nOur Picks\nAs CNET's kitchen, cooking and food expert, I've spent more than 100 hours testing over 30 meal kit and prepared meal delivery services. My standards for healthy food are high, and my tolerance for overpriced services that don't deliver is low. This is all baked into how we test meal kits here at CNET. Rest assured that you'll get great food and value for your money with any of our recommended picks.\nFor this round of meal delivery testing, I've enlisted a vegan wellness editor, Anna Gragert, and one of our flex editors, Corin Cesaric, who is new to cooking, to get their unique takes on each meal kit service. For even more testing power, we had our entire New York office taste every prepared meal service to crowdsource opinions on the best and worst.\nWhat's the best meal kit delivery service overall?\nAfter the latest round of testing, Blue Apron holds the top spot on our list of best meal kit delivery services for 2025. Prices range from $8 to $12 per serving, depending on the plan. It\u2019s not the cheapest option out there, but it consistently delivers flavorful, easy-to-make meals -- including steak and salmon -- without requiring an upgrade. While others on our list impressed for special diets and recipe variety, my fellow editors agree that Blue Apron is the best meal kit service for most people.\nFor those who don't care to cook, there are services that send fully cooked meals ready to heat and eat. CookUnity earns the top spot as the best prepared meal service thanks to its huge selection of excellent and interesting meals. If money is not a concern, MealPro earned the best overall marks from our group of testers, but the price of meals -- between $15 and $22 each -- keeps it out of the top spot.\nWe've tested more than 30 options to bring you the 9 best meal kits and meal delivery services for 2025.\nBest meal kit delivery services right now\nPros\n- Steak and seafood options are included in a standard meal plan\n- As cheap as $8 per serving if you choose more than two recipes per week\n- Good for families\n- Recipes are elevated but not fussy\n- No subscription required\nCons\n- Fewer total recipe options than other services\n- Doesn't allow for much customization\n- Not good for vegan diets\nWhy we picked Blue Apron:\nHaving tested dozens of meal delivery services, Blue Apron represents the best overall value for any meal delivery service. We love Blue Apron's family-style and oven-ready meals, which take roughly 5 minutes to prepare and net four or five servings -- perfect for feeding a crew or meal planning for the week. We found the recipes inventive without being overly complicated. Of the more than 15 meal kits we've made from Blue Apron, none of them have been bad.\nBlue Apron is no longer a subscription service, so you can order meals without the commitment. The running menu choices available range from simple pasta dishes to more daring global cuisine, with high-end recipes including nice cuts of beef and fresh seafood at no extra cost. Meal kits range between $8 and $15 a serving.\nWho is it for:\nBlue Apron recipes are somehow more thoughtful and elevated than other meal kit companies that cost the same. That said, they're still not difficult to execute. This meal kit service is great for those with high food standards but prefer unfussy recipes.\nWho should avoid it:\nThere are very few vegan options per week, and recipes aren't meant to be substituted, so this isn't the best pick for plant-based eaters.\nPros\n- The most affordable meal kit service\n- Most recipes were either good or better\n- Not a ton of plastic waste\n- Super simple recipes that kids can help with\nCons\n- No seafood and very few plant-based options\n- Recipes are basic and get repetitive\n- Very little customization allowed\n- Not the healthiest\nWhy we picked it:\nAt just $8 per serving -- even cheaper with a sign-up offer -- and an emphasis on hearty meal options and generous portion sizes, all three editors who tested it agree that EveryPlate is the best cheap meal kit service.\nEveryPlate keeps overhead costs low (often cheaper than if you bought the groceries yourself) by offering just a dozen or so easy meal kit recipes to choose from each week. No swaps or substitutions are allowed. These options include a few options for those on vegetarian and other special diets, but you'll find lots of meat and potatoes and other classic comfort meals, including meatloaf, burgers, crispy chicken strips, and pasta.\nIf you're looking to try an easy meal kit service without risking much dough, you can score meals for as low as $2 a serving with free shipping on your first order.\nWho is it for:\nThose looking to get dinner on the table quickly and without blowing their budget. EveryPlate's meal kits are simple, quick to make, and comforting -- but that doesn't mean they're not also great. We liked nearly all of the 14 meal kits we made from EveryPlate, and with the lowest price per serving of any subscription, it's a great pick for those trying to keep the family fed without putting the budget at risk.\nWho should avoid it:\nAfter enough time, the recipes can feel repetitive. EveryPlate doesn't mix it up as much as pricier services and relies on a lot of the same meal bases -- chicken breast, pork chops, and ground beef. There are about 15 recipes per week, which is far fewer than services like HelloFresh and Home Chef. There aren't any seafood options and very few plant-based offerings.\nBest prepared meal service\nCookUnity\nPros\n- Had a solid hit rate with our testers\n- Good value if order more than 10 meals\n- Tons of healthy menu options per week\n- Healthy food to service most diets and nutrition plans\n- Just heat-and-serve\nCons\n- Some meals contain extremely high levels of sodium\n- Expensive if you only choose a few meals per week\n- Meals were hit or miss\nWhy we picked it:\nThis prepared meal service focuses on gourmet fare made by chefs with both local and national acclaim. While some of our testers found the food too salty, CookUnity was generally at a higher level than the others we tested, with tender meat, fresh veggies, and a huge range of gourmet recipes to choose from. It may not have reached the culinary heights of our splurge pick for prepared meals, MealPro, but at around $13 per meal, CookUnity represents a better value considering the quality.\nFood is delivered fresh -- not frozen -- although most of the meals would be easy to freeze and save for later. I liked almost everything I tried, with recipes ranging from very healthy to more comfort-style food. There are plenty of options for vegetarians, too, but remember that the menu varies depending on where you live since it pulls from local chefs to create the weekly offerings.\nWho is it for:\nThose seeking variety and quality in their prepared meals. There are seemingly endless options, and the food is aimed at those with a more refined palate and an adventurous culinary spirit. The best thing about CookUnity is the sheer volume of meal options you can choose from culinary masters of different cultural backgrounds and culinary styles. There's always something different on the Cook Unity menu, although each one is specific to a region, meaning someone in New York City may not have all of the same options as someone in Chicago.\nWho should avoid it:\nAnyone following a low-sodium diet should exercise caution when choosing CookUnity meals. Some contained more than 3,000 mg of salt, which is about 170% of the daily recommendation for adults.\nUse promo code CNET30 for a 30% discount on your first purchase.\nBest meal kits for variety\nHelloFresh\nPros\n- More than 70 weekly recipes\n- Good for keeping to specific diets or eating plans\n- Our wellness editor loved the vegan and vegetarian options, more than 15 per week\n- Recipe variety is great for families with picky eaters\nCons\n- Some recipes are a little boring and uninspired\n- Extra $10 for shipping\nWhy we picked it:\nHelloFresh offers more convenience, selection, and family-friendly options than any other meal kit service. The weekly menus offer endless combinations, and swaps and substitutions are allowed to please even the most particular eaters in your family. This meal kit service's portion sizes are generous, and there are meals to fit eating plans and diets of all kinds. There are dozens of keto meals, low-calorie options, and as many as 15 plant-based meal kits for those eating vegan or vegetarian.\nHelloFresh is also fairly affordable. Most plans cost $10 per serving, but there's no real discount for ordering a large plan. HelloFresh recipes are quick and easy to follow, even for beginner cooks.\nWho is it for:\nHelloFresh has the most recipes per week, well over 70, of any meal kit service we tried, making it a good option for families and homes with children (or choosy adults). Our vegan editor said HelloFresh had the best plant-based recipes of any service she tested, including Purple Carrot.\nWho should avoid it:\nThese meal kits may challenge more experienced home cooks. We found some of the recipes a bit basic, with lots of comfort pasta dishes and simple cuisine. But if you're feeding a family of four or five, basic may be just what the doctor ordered.\nBest vegan meal kits\nPurple Carrot\nPros\n- Interesting and filling vegan recipes\n- Fresh and high-quality ingredients\n- Great for learning to cook vegan food\n- Not a lot of processed meat substitutes\nCons\n- No options for meat eaters\n- Expensive if you only choose 2-serving meals\nWhy we picked it:\nFor authentic, organic, plant-based cooking, Purple Carrot delivered big with a bounty of interesting recipes and fresh ingredients. Several of us here at CNET have tried Purple Carrot and the inventive meatless meal kits have become a clear staff favorite. A hearty lentil soup and herby cauliflower steak were among our favorites.\nPurple Carrot also had the freshest produce of any service we tried, with much of it coming from organic farms. There aren't many options for keto dieters but this meal kit subscription is a dream for vegans looking to get dinner on the table with less fuss.\nInterestingly, Purple Carrot wasn't our vegan wellness editor's favorite -- she chose HelloFresh -- but others agreed that this service offers the best quality and variety for those avoiding meat in their daily diet.\nWho is it for:\nThis service is ideal for those looking to learn the ropes of vegan cooking. Out of all the vegan meal kits I've tried, Purple Carrot provides the best base for cooking vegan cuisine and its mainstays, such as lentils and grains. There are about eight recipes to choose from each week.\nWho should avoid it:\nMeal kits are pricey, with plans starting out at $11 per serving. There are also fewer recipes to choose from each week, but that means quality control is far higher than services that offer many recipes in a given menu.\nPros\n- The best service for salad eaters\n- At around $12 per salad, it's cheaper than most fast-casual options\n- Good variety of classics and more inventive recipes\n- Shipping is free on orders over $65\nCons\n- Salads can't be frozen, so you have to eat them the week of delivery\nWhy we picked it:\nGardencup is a subscription-based meal delivery service that delivers ready-to-eat salads, grain bowls, soups, snacks and produce cups in portable, insulated plastic jars. You order 6 or 9 meals to be delivered weekly or bi-weekly and lunch is handled for your busy week. Simply pop the top, shake with the included dressing and toppings, and lunch is served. Salads range from $11 to $14, with the majority featuring grilled chicken, clocking in at about $12.\nWe found Gardencup's salads fresh and filling, with tender chicken, shrimp and steak over crisp greens and veggies. Classics like chicken Caesar, chicken bacon Cobb and steakhouse wedge are available alongside more inventive salads like the 3-meat Italian and Mexican shrimp with cilantro and lime.\nWhile we didn't try any, there are heartier power cups with grain and pasta bases, such as a pesto pasta chicken bowl and soba noodles with garlic shrimp. These are priced similarly to the salads, with premium proteins costing a bit more. Soups and snacks can be added to any order and range between $5 and $10.\nWho is it for:\nThis is the working person's answer to $18 fast-casual meals or unhealthier choices that loom in workplace cafeterias and fast food joints. A delivery of Gardencup means light, healthy meals are never far away and you don't have to scramble to make sure you're fed at lunchtime.\nWho should avoid it:\nWhile $12 for a meal salad is cheaper than most restaurant or takeout fare, it's still more expensive than making your lunch at home, so those on a tight budget may opt to assemble their workday lunches from scratch.\nBest healthy meal kits\nGreen Chef\nPros\n- Healthy recipes and mostly organic ingredients\n- Allows you to swap the protein in certain recipes\n- Higher quality meals and recipes\nCons\n- At $12 per serving, it's more expensive than most on our list\n- Premium recipes incur up-charges\nWhy we picked it:\nThis meal kit service impressed all three of our testers, including our vegan wellness editor, Anna Gragert. Green Chef costs a bit more than others on the list but uses mostly organic meats and produce, and offers interesting and healthy recipes for the discerning home cook. The recipes we tried were healthy, tasty, and easy to cook.\nGreen Chef allows for swaps and upgrades so you can slide beef into a fish recipe or even spring for organic chicken in place of non-organic. Some swaps are free while others incur a surcharge, some of them fairly steep, but it's all outlined on the intuitive website and easy to decipher before placing a weekly order.\nWho is it for:\nIt may be one of the pricier options but I like Green Chef for its versatility in the different specific diet plans available. The healthy meal kit service also has the most organic ingredients of any meal kit service, including produce, meats and fish, and offers paleo, keto, pescatarian, vegan and vegetarian recipes as well as gluten-free meal kits.\nWho should avoid it:\nMeal kit plans are all $12 per serving, no matter how many or few you order. That's about double the cost of our top budget pick, EveryPlate. For that reason, Green Chef isn't a good choice for the budget-conscious customer.\nPros\n- Nearly all the meals we tested were good or better\n- Interesting use of international cuisine and flavors\n- Affordable, especially for the family plan\n- Lots of healthy whole foods\nCons\n- The pizzas were just OK\n- Extra $10 for shipping on orders of less than 12 items\nWhy we picked it:\nThis plant-based service was one of the best-prepared meal services we tried, and not just among vegan options. Our wellness editor, who eats only plant-based food, found every recipe to be at least good, often great. It's also affordable because family meals start at just $6 a serving, making it one of the better services for feeding a crew. Single-serving meals clock in at about $10 or $12 each.\nWe sampled more than 15 of Mosaic Food's plant-based prepared meal offerings, which include rice bowls, noodle dishes, flatbreads, oat bowls, and smoothies. Of the food I ate, this vegetarian-prepared meal delivery service had an astoundingly high hit rate. some standouts included the bean and jackfruit chili, tomato olive and feta ragout and a tangy Thai noodle dish.\nMost meals arrive fresh but can be frozen and thawed later for a quick lunch or a healthy, meatless dinner.\nWho is it for:\nDiscerning eaters of plant-based food. Mosaic uses global flavors and employs creative use of meat substitutes such as tofu, jackfruit, cauliflower and vegan sausages to create tasty and satisfying vegetarian meals.\nWho should avoid it:\nThere are no meat options and very few low-carb meals. If you're trying to cut calories or carbs, this might not be the best meal service to try.\nPros\n- The highest quality food of any prepared service we tested\n- Restaurant-level meals including tender brisket and hearty lasagna\n- You can make a one-time order\nCons\n- Expensive with some meals costing more than $20\n- Some meals, such as the salmon, didn't microwave well\n- Must order at least 18 meals\nWhy we picked it:\nIf money is no object, this meal delivery service has the goods. We tested the gourmet prepared meals in our New York office and many of them were of restaurant quality. According to MealPro's website, the meals are cooked daily so they can be delivered as fresh as possible and the proof was in the pudding. From tender brisket ($21.49) and pork carnitas ($16) to a hearty spinach lasagna ($15), this service had our test group clamoring for more.\nYou can order one box at a time or opt in or out of recurring orders but you have to order either 18 or 21 meals, so plan some space in your freezer. Meals are priced individually and most are between $12 and $20, making it one of the most expensive meal services we tried but also the best in terms of pure taste and quality.\nOrders of 21 meals ship free to West Coast states, while shipping to other states varies based on distance from the California fulfillment center.\nWho is it for:\nIf your standards are high, MealPro delivered the best-tasting prepared meals of any service we tried. If the cost isn't an issue, this is a great way to stock your fridge and freezer with high-end meals for those nights you don't want to cook.\nWho should avoid it:\nThis is not a meal service for bargain shoppers. Most meals are about $15 and many of the premium recipes are $20 or more, which is comparable to takeout.\nRecent updates\nJuly 2025\nMealPro was tested and added to the list as best gourmet prepared meal delivery service\nGardencup was tested and added to the list as best salad delivery service\nHelloFresh was retested and recategorized as best meal delivery for recipe variety\nMeal kits and prepared food services compared\n| Brand | Service Type | Focus | Good For | Price per Serving |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Blue Apron | Meal kit | Overall Value, Variety | Vegetarian, Low-Calorie, Gluten-Free, Pescatarian | $8-$12 |\n| Purple Carrot | Meal kits | Vegan, Organic | Vegan, Vegetarian, Paleo, Gluten-Free | $11-$13 |\n| Mosaic Foods | Prepared meals | Vegetarian, Global Flavors | Vegan, Vegetarian, Healthy, Low-Fat, Families | $6-$12 |\n| HelloFresh | Meal kits | Family-Friendly, Variety | Vegetarian, Keto, Paleo, Gluten-Free, Diabetic, Pescatarian | $10-$12 |\n| Green Chef | Meal kits | Organic, Diet-Specific (Keto, Paleo, etc.) | Vegan, Vegetarian, Organic, Gluten-Free, Diabetic, Pescatarian, Mediterranean | $12 |\n| MealPro | Prepared meals | Gourmet Cuisine | Healthy, Low-Calorie, Pescatarian, Vegetarian, Whole30 | $14-$22 |\n| CookUnity | Prepared meals | Gourmet, Chef-Curated, Variety | Healthy, Gourmet, Low-Calorie, Pescatarian, Vegetarian, Keto, Paleo, Diabetes-Friendly, Gluten-Free, Whole30 | $11-$14 |\n| EveryPlate | Meal kits | Cheap, Simple, Comfort Food | Family-Friendly, Comfort Food, Picky Eaters, Healthy Quick and Easy | $6 |\n| Gardencup | Prepared meals | Salads, Bowls, Lunches | Healthy, Light, Vegetarian, Vegan, Low-Calorie, Low-Carb | $11-$14 |\nFactors to consider when choosing a meal delivery service\nMeal kit vs. prepared meal delivery\nThe first big decision you'll make is whether you want meal kits, which require some prep and cooking, or a prepared meal service that sends fully cooked meals that are ready to heat and eat. Meal kits will demand more of your time and energy but they'll also cost a little less per serving. Some meal kits can actually save you money over groceries. Prepared meals require almost no time and energy, other than what it takes to actually eat the food, but typically run a few bucks more per serving.\nCost\nAfter you've picked between meal kits or meal delivery, you'll want to find a service within your budget. There are meal kits with recipes for as cheap as $5 a serving with basic menus and no-frills recipes. More expensive services include recipes with more exotic ingredients, high-end cuts of meat, and organic produce, but can cost as much as $15 a serving. Here I've outlined all the best cheap meal delivery services for 2025.\nHealthiness\nMost meal delivery services have healthy options, and some are much healthier than others. If you're keen on eating low-calorie, low-carb, plant-based or pescatarian food, certain meal kits and meal delivery services will be better than others. Our list of the healthiest meal delivery services for 2025 is a good place to find all the most nutritious options.\nNumber of meals per week\nLastly, you'll have to decide exactly how much food you'll want sent to you per week. If you can't imagine yourself cooking more than twice per week, don't order more than two meal kits because they typically won't last more than a week in the fridge. Most meal kit services offer plans as small as two meals per week and as many as six.\nMost prepared meals either arrive frozen or can be frozen after unboxing. That means it's less of an issue if you order too many meals on your first go around. However, some fresh food delivery services, including Gardencup, Thistle, and Sakara Life, are not meant to be frozen.\nMost services allow you to change the number of meals or servings in your plan even after you've started. With nearly every service, the more meals you order per delivery, the cheaper it is per meal.\nHow we tested meal kits: A trio of CNET editors tried every service\nAll the meal delivery services may look delicious in their website glamour shots, but that's certainly not enough to convince us. To settle on this list of the best meal delivery services, three CNET editors cooked at least three meal kits from every service. Our trio included a meal delivery expert who has been reviewing meal kits for more than five years, a vegan editor from our wellness team to evaluate healthiness, and an editor who is new to cooking to gauge ease of execution for those at the start of their home cooking journey.\nAfter completing the meal kits, we compared notes and married our opinions on each to curate this list of the best services for every type of cook and eater. We consider how each meal kit tastes, how easy it is to prepare and the portion size. We also evaluate the website and how easy it is to navigate, along with determining how easy it is to pause, cancel or change your order at any given time.\nTo learn more, I have an in-depth look at how we test meal kits here at CNET.\nHow we test prepared meals\nIn this latest round, to test each prepared meal service, we ordered at least seven meals from each to our New York office and had 10 designated testers try them. We logged their ratings and any hot takes or consensus opinions about the meals in general. I tried at least five from each service on my own and weighted the group results against my own ranking. We chose a range of meals from the various menu and meal plan offerings and took note of the ordering process, recipe variety, portion size, taste and healthiness.\nWe reheated meals according to the instructions. If there were none, we would have heated them the way we would if left to our own devices. Often that meant warming gently in a nonstick skillet or reheating in the office air fryer.\" target=\"_self Many of the meal delivery services offer a microwave heating option, but we almost always found that it produced worse results than my trusted methods, even if they typically take a few seconds longer.\nOther meal delivery services we tested\n- Sunbasket: Sunbasket's meals were solid, but the high price keeps it off our list for 2025.\n- Home Chef\" target=\"_self: This meal delivery service has a huge selection of recipes, and we liked many of them, but some kits arrived disheveled, and the food was hit or miss.\n- Factor: This was a previous pick on our best list, but in 2025, we found the meals bland, salty, and often dry or overcooked.\n- Eat Clean Bro: This healthy prepared meal service offers high-protein meals for the fitness-minded. It wasn't bad, but we liked other options at this price range better.\n- Eat Clean: Not to be confused with Eat Clean Bro, this healthy prepared meal service had meals that were excellent and others that tasted so strange, we didn't finish them.\n- Martha Stewart & Marley Spoon: This is another meal kit service aimed at foodies. The quality is high, but so are the prices.\n- BistroMD: These meals are intended to promote weight loss, but the cost is high and the flavors aren't good enough to justify the price.\n- Daily Harvest: Daily Harvest's semi-prepared smoothies, bowls, and soups are good and fairly affordable, but the meals are inconsistent and contain a lot of sodium.\n- Thistle: This fresh meal delivery service is great for flexitarians who prefer fresh food over frozen, but the cost per meal keeps it off our list.\n- Gobble: This meal kit service sends mostly prepped ingredients to save even more time making dinner.\n- Splendid Spoon: This is a good service to try if you want premade smoothies, but be prepared to pay about $10 for each one.\n- Dinnerly: This meal kit service is one of the cheapest, but the recipes were inconsistent.\n- Territory Foods: The food was some of the best we tried, and I found the recipes diverse and interesting. Ultimately, the cost -- meals costing $12 to $23 -- kept it out of the top.\n- Sakara Life: This fresh food service was tasty and good for a cleanse, but it's also one of the most expensive meal subscriptions we've come across.\n- Trifecta Nutrition: Trifecta's vegan meals are healthy and tasty, but also very expensive.\n- Hungryoot: We really liked this hybrid service, but it leans more toward grocery delivery than meal kit.\n- Snap Kitchen: Snap Kitchen has solid prepared meals, mostly under 450 calories. The portions were a bit small, and some meals were underwhelming.\n- FlexPro Meals: These frozen keto meals were some of the worst we tried.\n- Nutrisystem: Although it's affordable, we disliked most of the meals we tried from this frozen meal subscription.\n- Rootberry: This vegan meal delivery service is reliable, but the food is not to the level of others on our list.\n- ModifyHealth: This low-FODMAP prepared meal service is designed to help those with GI issues. The meals we tried were tasty and well prepared, but they're expensive, and this niche service is not an obvious pick for the average person.\nWho are meal kits good for?\n- Families seeking an easier way to make home-cooked meals. Meal kits help you avoid the nightly debate about what you're going to make for dinner and save a trip to the grocery store if you're missing breadcrumbs or flour.\n- Those trying to eat healthier. Meal kit services all offer in-depth nutritional information, including carbs, calories, sugar, sodium and protein. Many meal kit services even offer specific diet plans that filter out foods that don't fit a dietary preference or restriction, such as gluten-free, diabetes-friendly, keto or carb-conscious and paleo meals.\n- Anyone who wants to learn to cook. With all the ingredients sent along and easy recipe instructions, meal kits are a low-pressure way to learn to cook.\nWho is prepared meal delivery good for?\n- Those looking to save time. Meal delivery is great for anyone who wants easy meals and fewer evenings spent cooking but doesn't want to pony up the dough for expensive takeout.\n- Those looking to eat better. Many prepared meal delivery services cater to Whole30, keto, paleo, vegan, vegetarian, and organic eaters and can help you regulate fat, sugar, carbs, and calories every week.\n- Families, in some cases. Certain meal kits with larger serving sizes are good for families. Mosaic Foods, for instance, has family meals that net out to just $6 a person. Meal kit services also have family plans that cost less per serving than buying meal kits for one or two people.\nMeal delivery service FAQ\nAre meal delivery services worth it?\nIf you're looking to cut some of the legwork out of dinner, meal kits and prepared meal services are definitely worth it. The most budget-friendly services cost about the same as buying all the groceries you'd need to make the same meal, with the convenience of having all the ingredients or a box of fully prepared meals sent to your home each week.\nWhat's the difference between meal kits and prepared meal delivery services?\nMeal kits provide pre-portioned ingredients and recipes that you cook at home. Prepared meal delivery services send fully cooked meals that only need to be heated.\nAre meal kits cheaper than buying groceries?\nIf you score one of the cheaper, budget-friendly meal kits you can get meals as low as $5-$8 per serving. That's cheaper than eating out or getting restaurant food delivered and is about the same cost as buying the groceries needed to make the same meals. Most meal delivery services run in the $10 to $12 per serving range, while the more premium services, including Green Chef, Sunbasket and Pete's Real Food, cost more like $12 to $16 per serving.\nIn a previous story, we crunched the numbers to find out how much meal kits cost versus buying the same groceries.\nWhat's the most affordable meal delivery service?\nEveryPlate and Dinnerly are the most affordable meal kits, with plans that start at $6 or $7 per serving. Blue Apron and HelloFresh are also affordable, with plans as cheap as $8 a serving.\nThe cheapest prepared meal delivery service is Mosaic Foods since it has family meals that cost just $6 per serving.\nWhat are the most popular meal delivery services?\nIn reviews and best lists, Blue Apron and HelloFresh are two of the most popular meal kit services for 2024. Fresh N Lean and Factor are some of the most popular options for prepared meal subscriptions."

      "text": "Packed with antioxidants, this fruit can help keep your teeth, heart and gut healthy\nYou may only think of eating cranberries around Thanksgiving, but this fruit can add some zing (and plenty of health benefits) year-round.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nCranberries, which are mostly carbs and fiber, contain about 90% water. They also contain vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K and manganese.\nBut fresh cranberries tend to be sour and are rarely eaten raw. You\u2019ll mostly see cranberries in juice form, but cranberry juice also tends to include added sugars.\nSo is it worth it to add cranberries to your diet? And what\u2019s the best way to eat them?\nRegistered dietitian Candace O\u2019Neill, RD, LDN, talks about the benefits of cranberries and how to work them into your meals.\nCranberries can be very nutritious. \u201cThey\u2019re a powerhouse of antioxidants,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. Here\u2019s how cranberries can benefit your health.\nProbably the most known benefit of cranberry juice is that it can prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). But O\u2019Neill stresses that cranberries don\u2019t treat the infection once you have it.\n\u201cA-type proanthocyanidins prevent the binding of E. coli in the bladder, which is normally the first step of getting a UTI,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.\nIf you\u2019re someone who gets UTIs often, adding cranberries to your diet can be beneficial.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone who struggles with UTIs, including cranberries as a part of a healthy diet is something that you can do that won\u2019t harm you,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt could be a proactive approach.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nYou may not immediately think of cranberries as a way to prevent cavities, but research shows the same a-type proanthocyanidins that help prevent UTIs can help in other ways.\n\u201cResearchers think a-type proanthocyanidins are responsible for preventing bacteria formation in the mouth as well,\u201d explains O\u2019Neill.\nBy controlling those harmful acids in your mouth, cranberries could help prevent not only cavities, but also gum disease, tooth decay and oral cancer.\nCranberries have anti-inflammatory effects, thanks to their high amounts of antioxidants, especially anthocyanins and flavanols, which give cranberries their dark hue.\n\u201cAntioxidants have been shown to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases because they can help lower inflammation in our bodies,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended to consume enough servings of fruits and vegetables because those foods will use antioxidants.\u201d\nIf you eat an animal-based diet, cranberries can help put good bacteria into your digestive system.\n\u201cA-type proanthocyanidins, which are only found in cranberries, can help with reducing the bad microbes that live in your colon,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.\nMore research still needs to be done, but there\u2019s a chance that cranberries could help prevent colon and gastrointestinal cancers.\nFrom lowering blood pressure to improving your cholesterol levels, cranberries can help improve your overall heart health.\n\u201cThere\u2019s limited evidence that cranberries can potentially help improve someone\u2019s lipid profile by raising their HDL (good) cholesterol,\u201d notes O\u2019Neill.\nCranberries may also help lower your LDL (bad). O\u2019Neill says it\u2019s important to know that many of these studies used a low-calorie cranberry juice.\nAs you\u2019ve probably learned by now, a-type proanthocyanins are a powerful antioxidant. So researchers are starting to study if and how they may have anti-cancer properties.\n\u201cWe know in general that eating enough non-starchy vegetables and getting enough fruits in your diet reduces your risk of certain cancers,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.\nIt\u2019s a tricky question to answer, says O\u2019Neill. In their raw state, they can be healthy. But if you get your cranberry fix through juice or dried cranberries, be aware that there may be plenty of added sugar used in both forms.\n\u201cIn general, one serving of dried cranberries has around 25 grams of added sugar,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cThat\u2019s actually how much added sugar some people can have in a day.\u201d\nThat sugar is added to offset the tart flavor of cranberries. \u201cThey need that sweetness to be a little bit more palatable,\u201d explains O\u2019Neill.\nAdvertisement\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you need to avoid cranberry juice or dried cranberries. You just need to be smart about your sugar intake and pair cranberries with foods that contain less sugar.\nFor example, you can make trail mix at home by using lightly salted roasted nuts and dried cranberries instead of the candy pieces you typically find in store-bought trail mix.\nPair plain yogurt or oatmeal with dried cranberries instead of honey for a sweet treat. O\u2019Neill suggests looking for unsweetened dried cranberries, but says they are hard to come by. You may be able to find them at a health food store or online.\nWhen it comes to juice, most options are a \u201cjuice cocktail\u201d that combines cranberry juice with apple juice to make it sweeter.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re consuming it in that form, you\u2019re not getting 100% cranberry juice,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.\nAnd watch how much juice you consume. O\u2019Neill says the recommendation is no more than 4 to 8 ounces of juice per day. You can try this tip from O\u2019Neill: Dilute juice with sparkling water or plain water to add a touch of sweetness to your beverage.\nMost people can eat or drink cranberries with no issue.

      "text": "Eating three balanced meals per day is often touted as the healthiest way to maintain a healthy diet and get adequate nutrition. But if you're like me and have an unpredictable eating pattern, getting three meals in each day can be tough. I love to snack throughout the day, I don't like putting effort into cooking and I even skip meals until I'm so hangry I can barely think straight. I know that I'm not alone in struggling to make the three meals a day lifestyle work for me.\nAccording to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the proportion of people consuming three meals a day declined significantly from the 1970s to 2010 (73% to 59% in men and 75% to 63% in women). I'd venture to guess those numbers have gone down even more in the 12 years since that survey, as stress and burnout has reached a fever pitch in recent years.\nThis made me wonder how important is it to have frequent meals? Why aren't two meals (or the popular OMAD) safe? And why is it so hard to eat three meals a day? I talked to a nutrition expert and dove into the research to find out. Here's how my own eating habits have transformed for the better.\nThree meals a day: An origin story\nThough we now take it for granted, the division of your daily diet into three meals -- breakfast, lunch and dinner -- hasn't always been the standard, and it still isn't in some places in the world. Before industrialization, as New York University food historian Amy Bentley told The Atlantic, people in the US tended to eat just two large meals, fueling their bodies for rural, outdoor labor. In ancient Rome, the custom was to eat one large meal, plus two small, light meals.\nIn the US, our eating habits are now typically organized around our workdays or school days. But cultural norms aside, there's no scientific reason for you to eat exactly three meals every day.\n\"The number of meals in a day itself isn't key,\" said Marissa Kai Miluk, a registered dietitian nutritionist who specializes in stopping binge eating. \"Every person is different and there is research on all ends of the spectrum of how many times a day you 'should' be eating.\"\nOver the years, there have been studies that show benefits to eating more frequent meals, as well as studies that show the downsides of it. Some research has also found benefits to eating less frequent, bigger meals and -- you guessed it -- the downsides of it.\nWith that said, the three-meals-a-day recommendation didn't come out of nowhere. In one sense, it all comes down to math: The average adult human requires 2,000 calories per day, and you're only awake for so many hours. \"Across all peer-reviewed research and health practices, three meals a day is a general recommendation to encourage consistent, adequate energy intake,\" Miluk said. \"Unless someone is seriously lacking in time or safe access to food, I would not recommend eating less than three meals a day, as that would require a large intake in one sitting in order to meet basic needs,\" she added.\nStill, the math can change depending on your own health needs and schedule, not to mention a ton of other, less quantifiable factors -- like, in my case, a love for snacks.\nMore important than the number of meals, Miluk said, is consistency. Skipping meals, waiting all day to eat and other inconsistent eating patterns can have a range of unintended outcomes, from increased blood pressure to high or low blood sugar.\nSo how do you know if your eating patterns are healthy?\n\"Experiencing frequent mood swings, hanger, erratic cravings, insatiable hunger, eating with a sense of urgency and binges are common signs that you may need to reevaluate your eating patterns and relationship with food,\" Miluk explained.\nBut eating regular meals is, somehow, so much harder than it seems, at least for people like me.\nWhy eating three meals a day is so hard\nSometimes the choice to veer away from the three-meals-a-day schedule is just that -- a choice. But even if you'd love to eat a proper breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, it can be challenging. You can't always control when you get a moment to sit down and eat, or what food options are available. Mental health and stress can also affect appetite.\nLet's call a spade a spade: Eating is work. Preparing a meal takes physical and mental labor, in addition to time and money. Even the process of figuring out what to eat can feel like an insurmountable obstacle when you have a million other things on your mind. And that's before you account for diet culture, which makes meal times even more fraught and stressful by equating thinness to health, and health to a moral virtue. (If your goal is simply weight loss, meal timing and frequency involves a whole other type of math.)\nThere's a lot of pressure to eat the \"right\" number and type of meals and cook them all ourselves, using fresh, whole ingredients. On a budget. While working and taking care of loved ones. Easier said than done.\nSometimes it's more convenient to\u2026 not do all that, and just reach for a snack instead. While the number of people eating three meals a day has gone down over the past several decades, people are eating more calories overall; we're just getting more of those calories from snacks now.\nIn some countries, it's relatively easy to access nutritious food -- and this is key -- that you don't have to cook yourself. Local foodways in Mexico and Ghana, for example, make it easy to walk down the road and get a cheap, fully prepared (and delicious) meal made with local protein and produce, or a bundle of fresh local fruit. Not so in many places in the US.\nStill, the idea that you should cook all your meals yourself at home is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the past, only families that had space for a home kitchen and the means to hire help ate home-cooked meals every day. In cities, working-class people ate cooked food from small eateries and street vendors. Communal eating is also a treasured tradition in many cultures, both in the US and across the globe.\nThree meals a day isn't some magic number; it's just a benchmark to help ensure you're eating enough consistently -- and modern life in this country makes it extremely difficult. So what can you do about it?\n3 tips for eating 3 meals\nFirst things first: Accept that struggling to cook three meals at home every day is not a personal failing. But you don't necessarily have to wait for sweeping society-wide changes to relieve some of the frustration. Here are some tips that helped me, and might help you, too.\n1. Go back to basics\nAs you know by now, three meals a day is not a golden rule. But if you're struggling to eat regular meals at all, Miluk told me she usually advises her clients to prioritize eating three meals a day first and foremost.\n\"When your body doesn't trust that food will be consistently available, it goes into fight-or-flight mode,\" she explained. A daily meal schedule provides a \"solid foundation\" that allows you to rebuild trust in your body and reregulate your appetite.\nThat's not to say it'll be smooth sailing. I'm used to skipping lunch by accident or postponing dinner for way too long, and that didn't just go away. But having a clear goal in mind was incredibly helpful. Every time I was able to successfully eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, I learned what it felt like to enjoy life with consistent energy instead of brain fog and hangriness.\n2. Practice nonjudgment\nOver the years, I've tried a lot of different ways to outsmart myself and get my three meals in. But I can't truly say that I was able to succeed until I finally gave up on trying to always eat the \"right\" foods, the \"right\" way. Instead, I focused on what was realistic and convenient for me: How could I get the nutrients that I need, while taking all the barriers in my life into account?\nBy removing any judgment about what your three meals consist of, you may be more likely to actually eat them. For me, that meant adding a meal subscription and meal shakes to my daily routine. For others, it might mean grocery delivery, help with meal prep from your community, canned or prepared foods, food trucks or cheap easy produce (like bananas).\nFocusing not only on health, but on ease -- even when it meant eating stuff that I felt like I \"shouldn't\" eat -- changed everything for me. With each day, I remind myself that I'm worth all the money and the effort that it takes to feed myself. I forgive myself for living in a culture and era that doesn't make nourishing my body easy, and I commit to caring for myself in whatever ways I have to despite that.\n3. Check in with yourself\nAfter you've gotten comfortable with eating three meals a day, according to Miluk, you can focus on tuning into your own body's signals and using the hunger-fullness scale to maintain an eating schedule that works best for you. That means taking into account your food preferences, health needs and values, schedule and accessibility. A professional dietitian can help guide you along this journey, but remember that there is no one-size-fits-all prescription for when or what to eat.\n\"The key to knowing the optimal meal timing for yourself is tuning out the world around you and getting honest with yourself,\" said Miluk.\nHer recommendation for figuring that out is to ask yourself the following questions:\n- How do I feel when I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner consistently versus when I skip a meal?\n- Do my meals and/or snacks sustain me until my next meal or snack?\n- When I go long periods of time without a substantial meal or snack, do I notice any changes in my focus, energy or mood?\n- Do I pay attention to signs from my body for when I am hungry and when I am full?\n- Are there any patterns to my appetite that stand out? Does my appetite stay stable throughout the day or do I find I eat more at certain times of the day?\nFor me, it turns out that eating three meals a day is actually the most feasible way to reach my daily needs while working a 9-to-5 job. Given how often I get hungry and how much I like to eat in one sitting, that's just what makes sense. You might decide that living your best life means eating two ginormous meals as farmers used to, or snacking from morning to night. \"Some may consider themselves 'grazers' and there's nothing wrong with that,\" Miluk assured me.\n\"This is why trusting and tuning into one's own body is more important than any diet rule or handbook on health,\" she said. \"A scientific study could say that eating 12 times a day is the best for longevity, but who does that realistically apply to?\""

      "text": "Omega-3s are known to offer health benefits, the most popular being improved cardiovascular and cognitive health. It's also known to help reduce inflammation. Since your body cannot produce omega-3s on its own, adding them to your diet or increasing intake with supplements is very common. I'm sure you know at least one person who takes fish oil to boost their omega-3s. Taking these factors into consideration, we set out to learn more about potential benefits, evaluate side effects and understand whether omega-3s are right for your body.\nWhat are omega-3 fatty acids?\nOmega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat, are an essential part of the human diet. Unlike other fats that the body is capable of synthesizing (called non-essential fatty acids), omega-3s can't be made from scratch. They're vital for various bodily processes, such as making hormones for blood clotting, artery contraction and relaxation, and genetic functions. In other words, we need omega-3s, and we can only get them from food or supplements. There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids:\n- Eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA\n- Docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA\n- Alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA\nAdding omega-3s to your diet\nDifferent types of foods provide different omega-3 fatty acids. The first two types, EPA and DHA, are abundant in fish, which is why they're commonly called \"marine omega-3s.\" The third type, ALA, is common in a variety of food sources, including certain oils, nuts, leafy vegetables and some meats.\nSome of the best sources of omega-3s are:\n- Herring\n- Wild salmon\n- Bluefin tuna\n- Mackerel\n- Sardines\n- Anchovies\n- Lake trout\n- Striped bass\n- Walnuts\n- Flaxseed oil\n- Meat from grass-fed animals\n- Chia seeds\n- Canola oil\nFish, by far, is the best source of omega-3s. If you're vegan or otherwise don't eat seafood, you may need to work especially hard to get enough of these important fats in your diet. In that case, omega-3 supplements may be helpful, especially for EPA and DHA. Although your body naturally converts a small amount of ALA to DHA and EPA, it may be a good idea to make sure you're consuming fish or supplements that include these.\nScience-backed benefits of omega-3s\nScientists have noted a variety of benefits that may be associated with omega-3 fatty acids. Some of these have more evidence than others, so we'll look at the most notable benefits with some of the most promising scientific support.\nLower your risk of heart disease\nA wide array of studies has shown a connection between heart health and omega-3 fatty acids. These fats appear to have a positive impact on various aspects of cardiovascular health. Most notably, though, omega-3s have been correlated with more stable heart rhythm, lower blood pressure and heart rate, better blood vessel function, and lower levels of inflammation.\nReplacing saturated fats, such as red meat, butter and whole fat dairy, with unsaturated fats such as omega-3s may lower risk of developing heart disease.\nFight anxiety and depression\nAlthough more research is needed as to the exact correlation between mental health and omega-3 intake, there appears to be strong evidence that these fats can help to reduce depression and anxiety for many people. EPA, in particular, has shown promising results as a treatment for mild-to-moderate depression.\nEnhance eye health\nOmega-3s -- EPA and DHA in particular -- play a major part in building the cellular makeup of our eyes. Not only do they help during our early stages of development, but research suggests a steady, adequate intake of these fats can help prevent vision problems, such as macular degeneration later in life.\nPromote prenatal and infant brain development\nScientists are actively studying the general connection between omega-3s and brain health, particularly in the womb and during our early life. Some studies have shown that children of mothers who take omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and breastfeeding may have better mental processing capabilities than those who don't. Additionally, studies have shown that mothers who take DHA supplements can improve breast milk nutrition for infants, leading to better cognitive function and eyesight later in life.\nSlow cognitive decline\nBecause of the connection between omega-3s and general brain health, it's perhaps no surprise that some research supports that these fats may slow cognitive decline as we age. This may be particularly promising for helping to slow the effects of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, though more research is still needed in this area.\nScientists are still studying these and many other benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, including their effect on ADHD, metabolic syndrome and certain autoimmune diseases.\nDrawbacks to omega-3 supplements\nGenerally, doctors recommend that you get most or all of your omega-3 fatty acids from food sources. Broiled or baked fish (not fried) is the best thing to add to your diet, along with some of the other foods mentioned above.\nOmega-3 supplements, such as fish oil or cod liver oil, offer many of the same benefits as getting these fats through food sources, though. These supplements are generally considered safe when taken in moderation. However, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider.\nRisk of bleeding\nThere's some indication that omega-3 supplements may enhance the effects of anti-blood clotting medications, herbs and supplements. When taken together, it may increase your risk of bleeding or reduce your ability to stop bleeding.\nOther potential drug interactions\nMore research is needed as to how fish oil supplements interact with other drugs and dietary supplements. In particular, there may be adverse interactions between omega-3 supplements and drugs taken for blood pressure, birth control and weight loss.\nGeneral side effects\nSome users of omega-3 supplements have noted general discomfort associated with them. This may include heartburn, nausea and diarrhea.\nOther side effects of omega-3 supplements that some have noted include fishy aftertaste and bad breath, along with rashes in some cases. Those with seafood allergies should also consult their physicians before taking fish oil supplements.\nShould you take omega-3 supplements?\nOmega-3s are essential for cell growth and overall health, and it's critical to include them in your normal dietary intake. Ideally, it's best to do this through sources such as fish, walnuts, flaxseed oil and other foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.\nHowever, if you can't include these foods in your diet, omega-3 supplements are a relatively safe alternative. It's easy to find supplements that are packed with a balanced serving of all three major omega-3s, and they're relatively inexpensive. Keep in mind, though, that these should be taken in moderation and in consultation with your doctor. Some omega-3 supplements may interact with other drugs or supplements you're taking, and you may experience other side effects.\nAlthough more research is needed to fully discover all the benefits of omega-3s, one thing is clear: They're an important part of any balanced diet.\nBenefits of Omega-3 FAQs\nWhich foods are rich in omega-3s?\nFish, by far, is the best source of omega-3s. Anything ranging from bluefin tuna to small fish like anchovies should help your body. If you're vegan or otherwise don't eat seafood, you can try consuming walnuts or flaxseed oil. However, turning to omega-3 supplements will be your best bet to work these essential fats into your daily intake.\nDoes consuming fish oil for omega-3 have any side effects?\nIt's said that consumption beyond recommended dosage can lead to rashes, heartburn and nausea, among other side effects.\nWhile more research is required to understand how omega-3s from fish oil may interact with other drugs, they may interact with blood pressure medication -- further lowering blood pressure -- and when taken with anti-coagulants, they could possibly further increase the risk of bleeding."

      "text": "Bell peppers are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and fiber. They also possess antioxidant properties, which may help to protect against diseases such as cardiovascular disease and some cancers.\nBell peppers, or sweet peppers, come in different colors, depending on how ripe they are. People can choose from the least ripe green peppers through to yellow, orange, purple, or red, which are the ripest. They are part of the nightshade family and are native to North and South America. They are in season in the United States during the summer and fall.\nAll colors of pepper have nutritional benefits, but red peppers may have higher antioxidant and phytonutrient levels because they are riper than yellow or green peppers.\nLike all vegetables, bell peppers naturally contain small amounts of sugars. Red peppers are sweeter, while green peppers can taste more bitter.\nIn this article, we will look at the health benefits of bell peppers, analyze any risks in eating bell peppers, and offer suggestions for how to use them in cooking.\nBell peppers are high in vitamin C, especially red peppers.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), half a cup of raw, red pepper provides\nLike all vitamins, vitamin C is essential. This means the body cannot make it by itself, and it only receives it through diet.\nVitamin C is important for many functions in the body, including:\n- producing collagen in the body, which is essential for healing wounds and forming connective tissue\n- protein metabolism\n- supporting the immune system\n- increasing the absorption of non-heme iron (the form found in plants)\n- powerful antioxidant capacity, neutralizing free radicals and decreasing risk of cancer and other diseases associated with oxidative stress\nAdequate consumption will also help prevent conditions that happen due to a deficiency of vitamin C, such as scurvy.\nAccording to the NIH, half a cup of raw, red pepper provides\nThe form of vitamin A that orange and red peppers contain is called beta carotene, which the body converts into the active form of vitamin A. Beta carotene is what gives these peppers their orange and red colors.\nVitamin A plays an essential role in:\n- vision\n- immune function\n- reproduction\n- communication between cells\n- cell growth\n- normal functioning of organs\nOther sources of beta carotene include spinach and sweet potatoes.\nPeppers are also a\n- Vitamin B6: This vitamin supports the central nervous system and metabolism.\n- Folate: This vitamin, also known as vitamin B9, helps transform carbohydrates into energy and is essential for normal cell growth and development.\n- Vitamin E: This vitamin supports the immune system and keeps blood vessels healthy.\n- Fiber: This nutrient promotes gut and cardiovascular health by supporting regular bowel movements and reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\nBell peppers are an excellent source of antioxidants, including flavonoids, which help to protect against oxidative damage in the body.\nBell peppers contain a number of different antioxidants:\n- quercetin\n- luteolin\n- capsaicinoids\n- vitamin C\n- beta carotene\n- lycopene\nThese compounds help prevent oxidative cell damage, which may help to prevent certain diseases such as:\nThe flavonoids in peppers also help to protect brain cells by helping prevent oxidation of the essential fats within those cells.\nZeaxanthin and lutein are carotenoids in peppers that may help protect eye health.\nA 2020 study found some species of orange peppers have high levels of zeaxanthin. Yellow peppers contain high levels of lutein.\nAccording to the Arthritis Foundation, bell peppers may help to reduce the risk of developing some types of arthritis and other inflammatory health conditions. This is due to two factors: beta-cryptoxanthin and high vitamin C content.\nBeta-cryptoxanthin is a carotenoid in red and orange peppers. Consuming it could reduce a person\u2019s risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.\nBell peppers may help to protect bone and cartilage cells because of their high vitamin C levels. Consuming less than the daily recommended intake of 75 mg of vitamin C for females, and 90 mg for males, could increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Half a cup of the vegetable will provide a full day\u2019s worth.\nThere are some risks involved with bell pepper consumption in some people.\nBell pepper allergy\nIt is possible to have an allergy to bell peppers. An allergy to bell peppers is due to a cross-reaction between the vegetable and pollen.\nIf people think they may have an allergy to bell peppers, they can see their doctor for a skin prick test to check.\nNightshade allergy\nPeppers are part of a family of vegetables known as nightshades. Some people might find that consuming nightshades causes irritation to the gut or increases inflammation.\nBut some people can mistake an allergy for an intolerance. With an intolerance, a person may experience some digestive issues after eating the food. With an allergy, they could experience more serious issues, such as breathing problems or a rash.\nAccording to the Arthritis Foundation, there is no scientific evidence to suggest nightshades cause inflammation.\nA small 2017 study looked at the effects of a diet that eliminated nightshades, along with grains, legumes, and alcohol, on people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nThe study involved 18 adults with mild to moderate IBD. After 3 weeks, participants reported a significant reduction in some symptoms, such as frequency of bowel movements. But it is impossible to say whether these improvements were due to eliminating nightshades or another dietary component.\nIf people want to test whether nightshades trigger inflammatory symptoms, they can eliminate all nightshades from their diet for a couple of weeks. People can then gradually add nightshades back into their diet and observe any changes.\nBell peppers are a popular addition to many dishes. They also make a great snack on their own. Learn more about how to buy, store, and prepare them here.\nShopping\nWhen shopping, choose bell peppers with healthy, undamaged skins. Quality bell peppers should feel firm, with a smooth skin.\nAvoid peppers with visible damage, such as soft areas or wrinkled skin. Harmful microorganisms could enter the damaged vegetables and cause a person to experience health problems, such as food poisoning.\nStoring\nPeople can store bell peppers in the fridge in a plastic bag.\nPeople will usually need to use bell peppers within 5 days.\nEating raw\nPeople can eat peppers raw by slicing them and removing the stalk, white center parts, and seeds.\nRaw peppers can be delicious as part of dishes involving dips or salads.\nCooking\nPeople can also cook peppers by:\n- Roasting: Remove the core of seeds from the peppers and slice or keep them whole. Roast in a small amount of oil in the oven. If the skin blackens, remove the bell pepper from the oven and place it in a plastic bag to cool to help remove the skin.\n- Frying: Fry sliced peppers in a frying pan or wok with some oil, or add them to a stir-fry.\n- Grill: After deseeding, brush peppers with olive oil and a little salt and place on the grill.\n- Stuffed peppers: Hollow out a pepper by taking out the core, and then fill with a mixture of beans, cooked rice, tomato, and seasoning before baking in the oven until tender. Ground turkey or beef works well here, too.\n- Puree: Make a dip by pureeing roasted peppers with garlic, capers, herbs, oil, and lemon juice.\nPeople can also add sliced peppers to pizza toppings before cooking. They can add them to an omelet or put them into a sandwich or wrap.\nPaprika\nPaprika is a dried and powdered form of bell pepper. People can use paprika as a spice in cooking.\nPaprika has a sweet, smoky flavor.\nBell peppers offer many health benefits. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, especially the ripest peppers, which are red. Peppers are also a good source of vitamin A and fiber.\nBell peppers also have antioxidant properties, which may help to protect against diseases such as cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Compounds in bell peppers may also help to protect against inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis.\nIf people have a pepper or nightshade allergy, they may need to avoid bell peppers.\nBell peppers are a nutritious and easy addition to any meal. People can slice them and eat them raw, roast, grill, or fry them."

      "text": "What Are Onions?\nOnions are vegetables that belong to the genus allium and are closely related to garlic, shallots, and leeks. The average person consumes roughly 20 pounds of this pungent and versatile food per year, eating onions raw, cooked, pickled, or powdered.\nThey're rich in chemicals that can help protect your heart, lower your risk of some cancers, and make it easier for your body to make insulin. Onions are also one of the greatest vegetable sources of quercetin, a plant compound with many health benefits.\nTypes of Onions\nYou can choose from a variety of onions, including yellow, red, white, and green onions (also called scallions) and shallots.\nRed onions\nAll types of onions are good for you, but this dark reddish-purple variety, sometimes called purple onion, has especially high levels of quercetin and other helpful plant compounds known as flavonoids. Flavonoids give many fruits, vegetables, and flowers their colors.\nRed onions have a mild, sweet taste and add color and flavor to many dishes. Use them raw as a crunchy addition to salads, sandwiches, and salsa.\nYellow onions\nTry cooking these strongly flavored yellow-brown onions to tame their sharp taste. Saut\u00e9ing, roasting, grilling, or caramelizing them brings out their sweetness.\nWhite onions\nWhite onions are milder than yellow onions. Dice them to use raw in guacamole and as a garnish for tacos, or slice them to use as a pizza topping.\nShallots\nThese small, sweet onions have a subtle flavor with just a hint of garlic. Dice them finely to use in vinaigrettes, salads, and other dishes in which you'd like a mild onion flavor.\nScallions/green onions\nThese long, slender onions are often thinly sliced and used raw. Try them as a garnish for soups, baked potatoes, stir-fry, and other dishes to add a dash of color and a mild onion taste.\nBenefits of Onions\nScientists have linked onions to many possible health benefits, with most of them coming from the antioxidants in onions. Antioxidants help prevent cell damage in your body. Research shows that one particular antioxidant, called quercetin, protects health in several ways, such as fighting inflammation and boosting the immune system.\nOnions are also a good source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\nSome possible health benefits of onions include:\nLower risk of cancer\nMany kinds of onions contain chemicals that can help fight cancer.\nOne study found that people who ate the most onions were the least likely to have cancer of the colon, throat, and ovaries. Another showed that men who ate the most vegetables of the allium family were the least likely to have prostate cancer.\nSome researchers believe that quercetin and other antioxidants in onions are responsible for their cancer-fighting properties. A diet full of quercetin has been associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer.\nAntibacterial action\nOnions may kill a wide range of bacteria, according to some lab research. In one experiment, onion and garlic extracts slowed the growth of several microbes. More research is needed to show how onion affects bacteria in the body.\nDigestive health\nOnions have fructooligosaccharides, substances that act as prebiotics (food for your gut's healthy bacteria), which can help with digestion. They pass through the small intestine and feed the healthy bacteria in the large intestine.\nDiseases ranging from diabetes to colon cancer and depression have been tied to not having enough healthy gut bacteria.\nBone health\nOnions may play a role in preventing osteoporosis, a condition that weakens your bones. One study in people near or past menopause found that those who ate onions daily had greater bone density, resulting in stronger bones.\nLower risk of heart disease and stroke\nOnions contain organic sulfur compounds, which give them their sharp, strong taste and smell. These compounds can help reduce the level of cholesterol in your body and may help break down blood clots, lowering your risk for heart disease and stroke.\nYou should eat onions raw rather than cooked to get the most sulfur compounds from them.\nDiabetes control\nBoth quercetin and organic sulfur compounds found in onions are known to boost insulin production, making them a helpful vegetable choice if you have diabetes.\nLower risk of Alzheimer's disease\nOne study found that a long-term diet high in flavonoids decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nWhat about onions for hair?\nSome people use onion juice as a home remedy for hair loss, dandruff, itchy scalp, and other hair-related problems. But research on any possible benefits is scarce. One small study found a possible benefit in people who lost hair due to an immune disorder called alopecia areata. In that study, people who washed their hair with onion juice grew more hair than those who washed it with water.\nOnion Water\nSome people swear by drinking onion water to fight cold and flu symptoms. The idea may be that if onions can fight off inflammation and kill bacteria and viruses (at least in test tubes), onion water is a good way to get a potent dose. But there's no research to back up that idea.\nOnion water--made by chopping up peeled, clean onions and letting them sit in water for a while--probably won't hurt you. In fact, it may have the benefits of other waters infused with fruits, vegetables, or herbs: if you drink more liquid than you would otherwise, it can help keep you hydrated. But keep in mind that infused water will contain less fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients than the food it's made from. Also, you need to refrigerate it if you don't drink it all at once.\nOnion Nutrition\nNutrients per serving\nA one-cup serving of chopped, raw onion has:\n- Calories: 64\n- Carbohydrates: 15 grams\n- Protein: 2 grams\n- Fat: 0 grams\n- Fiber: 3 grams\n- Sugar: 7 grams\nOnions are also a good source of:\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin B6\n- Potassium\n- Manganese\n- Copper\nDisadvantages of Eating Raw Onions\nEating onions, especially raw onions, can have a few side effects, including:\nGas and bloating. The same substances in onions that feed the healthy bacteria in your gut can be hard for some people to tolerate. Onions are among foods that sometimes cause trouble for people with irritable bowel syndrome. If you think onions bother you, avoid or limit them, especially when they're raw.\nChanges in body odor. When your body breaks down the sulfur compounds found in onions, they can react to sweat on your skin, creating what is generally considered to be an unpleasant body odor. And, of course, they can also cause bad breath.\nFood poisoning. Health authorities in the U.S. have traced several outbreaks of salmonella and other bacteria to whole and diced onions. Outbreaks like these have been rare in onions, because their papery outer skin can protect against contamination, and the drying process that prepares onions for the market further decreases the chances of the growth of bacteria. To reduce risks further, keep cut onions in the refrigerator.\nOnions for Cooking\nWhole bulb onions are best kept in a cool, dry place, not in the refrigerator. The exception is onions that are already peeled. Those should be refrigerated. If you have too many onions to use in the near future, you can preserve them by freezing, pickling, canning, or dehydrating them. Note that if onions have been frozen, they should only be used for cooking.\nWhen you're ready to use them in your favorite recipes, try to prepare onions close to the time you will serve them. Their flavor lessens, and their smell grows stronger the longer they sit after cutting. Any cut onions you don't use need to go into the refrigerator.\nYou can saut\u00e9, braise, boil, steam, bake, grill, caramelize, roast, or fry onions. They offer a flavor boost to any dish and can be eaten at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Here are some ways to add more onions to your diet:\n- Mix diced onion, jalape\u00f1o, tomato, and cilantro with lime juice for a spicy guacamole dip.\n- Combine rice with caramelized onions and broth for a rice dish with a little sweetness.\n- Bread fresh-cut onions, then fry them to make delicious onion rings.\n- Mix grated onions with rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and vegetable oil for a refreshing salad dressing.\n- Add cooked onions to omelets, frittatas, and quiches.\n- Add onions to stir-fry dishes.\n- When making chili, add onions to kick up the flavor.\n- Try adding caramelized onions to savory baked goods such as cornbread, focaccia, and cheddar biscuits.\nCooking With Red Onion\nMany recipes call for red onions. Here are a few ideas to try:\nMake your own quick pickled red onions with vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Add them to salads, sandwiches, or other dishes.\nAdd red onion to make a classic tomato and cucumber salad.\nThrow red onion and green pepper on the grill with skirt steak for beef fajitas.\nAdd sliced red onion to your beef or veggie burger.\nToss chunks of red onion and other vegetables with a little olive oil and oven roast.\nAdd red onions to the classic combo of green beans and new potatoes.\nSub red onions for the green ones in tabbouleh.\nCooking With Green Onion\nGreen onions are best stored in the refrigerator. Before you cook with green onions, be sure to rinse them and trim off the roots and the top ends of the greens. All the rest of the white and green parts are good to eat -- raw, if you like -- and can be used in:\n- Soups and stews\n- Dips, sauces, and relishes\n- Stir-fries\n- Omelets and frittatas\nHow to Cut Onion\nMany recipes using onion call for chopped or sliced onion. Knowing the best way to cut an onion can improve your cooking--and keep you from getting nasty cuts.\nHere's the best step-by-step advice:\n- Make sure you have a sharp knife and a clean cutting board.\n- Cut off the stem end of the onion and peel off the skin.\n- Cut the whole peeled onion in half, from the root to the stem end.\n- Place the onion halves on the cutting board, cut side down.\n- For dicing or mincing, make evenly spaced lengthwise cuts, from the stem to root end, keeping the root intact. Carefully make one or two horizontal cuts through the onion, parallel to the cutting board. Then make cuts across your first cuts to make even pieces.\n- For slices or wedges, start with the same peeled onion halves and then make even cuts along the ridges.\n- For rings, start with a whole peeled onion on it's side and slice crosswise.\nFor any onion chopping task, keep the onion steady with the clawed fingers of your non-chopping hand to keep them clear of the knife.\nOnion chopping work-arounds\nIf chopping an onion is difficult for you, look into devices that make the task easier, such as finger guards, weighted knives, or assistive devices made especially for chopping onions or other vegetables. Using a food processor is another option.\nReducing onion tears\nWondering why cutting onions makes you cry? When you pierce an onion, it releases sulfur compounds that can irritate your eyes and cause tearing.\nTo prevent tearing up while you're cutting onions, try:\n- Chilling them for 30 minutes beforehand\n- Leaving the root end attached while you cut (It has the most sulfur compounds)\n- Wearing onion goggles, available from online retailers\n- Opening a window or using your cooking vent to clear the air\n- Using spring onions and sweet onions, such as Vidalias. They are less likely to cause irritation."

      "text": "If you have chronic kidney disease, it is crucial to track food and fluid intake because diseased kidneys can\u2019t remove waste products from the body as healthy kidneys can.\nHere are the top kidney-friendly foods that can help repair your kidneys and help you stay healthier longer:\n- Apples: Apples are a good source of pectin, a soluble fiber. It can lower cholesterol and glucose levels. It has high antioxidant levels. Fresh apples are also a good source of vitamin C.\n- Blueberries: Blueberries are a low-calorie source of fiber and vitamin C. Studies say it has the potential to protect against cancer and heart disease and provides brain health benefits.\n- Fish: Certain fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It is an essential nutrient to control blood clotting and build cell membranes in the brain. Studies say it may decrease the risk of an abnormal heartbeat, decrease triglyceride levels, and lower blood pressure slightly. They may potentially provide benefits in conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.\n- Kale: Kale is rich in vitamins A and C, calcium, and many minerals. It is also a source of carotenoids and flavonoids, which are beneficial for eye health and cancer protection. It also contains vitamin K, which is a natural blood thinner. It has a moderate potassium level. Therefore, people on dialysis must avoid it.\n- Spinach: Spinach is high in vitamins A, C, and K and folate. The beta-carotene found in spinach helps to boost your immunity and protect your vision. It is also a good source of magnesium.\n- Sweet potato: Sweet potato is low in sugar and high in soluble fiber. This helps you feel full.\nOther 25 healthy foods that can fight kidney disease include:\n- Cranberries\n- Arugula\n- Raspberries\n- Strawberries\n- Plums\n- Pineapples\n- Peaches\n- Cabbage\n- Cauliflower\n- Asparagus\n- Beans\n- Celery\n- Cucumber\n- Onions\n- Bell peppers\n- Radishes\n- Summer squash\n- Garlic\n- Egg whites without yolks\n- Shiitake mushrooms\n- Water\n- Olive oil\n- Skinless chicken has less potassium and sodium than the skin on\n- Macadamia nuts\n- Turnips are a great alternative to potatoes and winter squash\nWhat does a kidney-friendly diet do?\nYour kidneys' major function is to get rid of waste and extra fluid from your body through your urine. They also balance the body\u2019s minerals and fluids and make a hormone that regulates your blood pressure.\nA kidney-friendly diet will help protect your kidneys from further damage. You must limit some food and fluids, so other fluids and minerals such as electrolytes do not build up in your body. Also, you must ensure that you are getting the right intake of protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals in your daily diet.\nIf you have early-stage kidney disease, there are a few food items you must limit. But as your disease worsens, you must be more careful about your daily food intake.\nWhat are the ways to make a kidney-friendly and diabetic diet work together?\nIf you have diabetes along with kidney disease, you need to control your blood sugar to prevent more damage to your kidneys. A diabetic diet and a kidney-friendly diet share a lot of the same food items, but there are some important differences. There are some ways your kidney-friendly diet and diabetic diet can work together.\nBelow are a few food items that are good for you, if you\u2019re diagnosed with both diabetes and kidney disease.\n- Fruits: Berries, papaya, cherries, apples, and plums\n- Vegetables: Cauliflower, onions, and spinach\n- Proteins: Lean meats (poultry, fish), eggs, and unsalted seafood\n- Carbohydrates: Whole-wheat bread, sandwich buns, unsalted crackers, and pasta\n- Fluids: Water, clear soups, and unsweetened tea\n- If you drink orange juice to treat low blood sugar, switch to kidney-friendly apple juice. It will provide the same blood sugar boost with a lot less potassium.\n- Late-stage disease: Your blood sugar levels get better with late-stage kidney disease, possibly because of changes in how the body uses insulin.\n- Dialysis: If you are on dialysis, your blood sugar can increase because the fluid used to filter your blood contains a high blood sugar level. Your doctor will monitor you closely and decide whether you will need insulin and other diabetes medicines.\nYour doctor and/or dietician will help you to create a meal plan that helps you control your blood sugar level while limiting sodium, phosphorus, potassium, and fluids in the body.\nQUESTION\nSee AnswerWhat food items should you limit in kidney disease?\nMany food items that are part of a typical healthy diet may not be right for you if you\u2019re suffering from kidney disease.\nIf you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your doctor may recommend limiting certain food items such as:\n- Salt: Avoid table salt and high-sodium seasoning food items. Sodium affects your blood pressure and helps maintain the water level in your body. If you have ankle swelling, high blood pressure, breathing difficulty, and fluid build-up around your heart and lungs, you must avoid salt. You must aim for less than 1,500 milligrams of salt in your daily diet. Use spices or herbs instead of salt. Stay away from packaged food and read labels while shopping. Focus on fresh, home-cooked food. You will get used to food with less salt or no salt within a week or two.\n- Potassium: In kidney disease, high potassium levels can build up in your blood and cause serious heart problems. The right level of this mineral keeps your nerves and muscles working well. Avoid tomatoes, oranges, bananas, potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and whole-grain bread, as they are high in potassium. Eat apples, carrots, and salads. Your doctor may recommend a potassium binder to help your body get rid of extra potassium. The doctor may recommend eating foods such as apples, cranberries, strawberries, cabbage, cauliflower, and cucumber.\n- Protein: Though protein is important for your body, more protein makes your kidneys work harder and may worsen kidney disease. Consult your dietitian to determine the right combination and amount of protein for you. You may need to cut foods such as meat, seafood, and dairy products.\n- Phosphorus: Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones strong and healthy. In kidney disease, your kidneys can\u2019t remove extra phosphorus from your blood very well. It may weaken the bone and may damage your blood vessels, eyes, and heart further. You may even get heart disease. Avoid high phosphorus-containing food items such as meat, fish, dairy, beans, nuts, whole-grain bread, packaged foods, and dark-colored sodas. If you have late-stage kidney disease, your doctor may advise you to have less than 1000 milligrams of phosphorus-rich foods in your diet daily. Choose low-level phosphorus foods such as fresh fruits, veggies, corn, rice, and cereal.\n- Calcium: Your doctor may also advise you to avoid over-the-counter calcium supplements and to cut back on calcium-rich foods such as dairy foods. Foods that are high in calcium also tend to be high in phosphorus.\n- Fluids: Generally, you need to maintain the water level in your body. However, in early-stage kidney disease, you must limit your fluid levels. Because damaged kidneys do not get rid of extra fluid, too much fluid can be dangerous for you. It can even cause high blood pressure, swelling, and heart failure. It can also build up extra fluid around your lungs and you may have difficulty breathing. You must also need to cut back on some foods that contain a lot of water such as ice cream, gelatin, watermelon, and grapes.\nDepending upon the stage of your kidney disease, your doctor will advise you to reduce the potassium, phosphorus, and protein levels in your diet.\nHealth News\n- Louisiana Oysters Linked to Deadly Vibrio Outbreak\n- Good Sleep, Eating Right Tied To Better Mental Well-Being Among Young Adults\n- Hormone Therapy For Menopause Might Provide Memory Boost\n- Shingles Vaccine Might Protect Against Heart Attack, Stroke\n- CDC Scales Back Foodborne Illness Tracking\n- More Health News \u00bb\nWhat fruit is bad for kidneys?\nMost fruits are not harmful in individuals with healthy kidneys. When the kidneys are damaged or people suffer from renal disease, the filtration process is disrupted and waste products are retained in the body. Accumulation of waste or toxic substances in the blood may further damage the kidneys.\n- Foods heavy in minerals, such as salt, potassium, and phosphorus, stress the kidneys and may cause further renal damage.\n- Among these compounds, avoiding potassium-rich foods and high sodium diet is highly essential in situations, especially kidney damage.\n- Dietary modifications are recommended to avoid these substances that increase stress in the kidneys.\nThe kidneys are essential organs of the body that perform multiple functions, such as:\n- Filtration of toxic and waste substances from the body through the urine\n- Production of hormone that stimulates red blood cells production\n- Maintenance of the body\u2019s mineral balance\nAlthough fruits are typically quite beneficial to have in the diet, certain fruits are high in potassium and should be avoided by patients with renal disease, which include:\n- Bananas\n- Avocados\n- Citrus fruits and juices, such as oranges and grapefruit\n- Prunes and prune juice\n- Apricots\n- Dried fruits, such as dates and raisins\n- Melons, such as honeydew and cantaloupe\nThe citric acid in oranges may increase the risk of developing kidney stones in patients with kidney damage. Salt and salt substitutes that are made with potassium are to be avoided. If levels of potassium or other toxic substances increase in the body, the patient may undergo dialysis.\nDialysis is a procedure used to eliminate waste products and excess fluid from the blood when kidneys do not function properly. This procedure is usually performed by redirecting the blood into a machine for cleaning.\nHow to extract potassium from fruits\nIf possible, substitute fresh or frozen fruits with canned fruits. The potassium in canned products leaches into the water or juice, thus reducing potassium levels in the fruits. If a person includes this juice in their meal or consumes it, their potassium levels may rise.\nThe juice often has a high salt content, which causes the body to retain water. This can result in kidney issues. So, before consuming canned fruits, they must drain the juice and rinse the fruits thoroughly to reduce the salt and potassium content.\nSoaking in water and rinsing the fresh fruits thoroughly before consuming helps eliminate unwanted compounds.\nWhat are the effects of high potassium in the body?\nPatients with kidney damage or diseases may have high potassium levels in the body even after they consume the daily recommended dose.\nHealthy people aged 19 years and older should take at least between 3,400 mg and 2,600 mg of potassium per day, respectively. However, if the kidneys malfunction, the dose should be reduced.\nHyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the body) may lead to:\n- Abdomen pain\n- Diarrhea\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Muscle weakness\n- Numbness in the limbs\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)\n- Palpitations of the heart (fast or fluttering heartbeat)\nConsult a doctor if the symptoms worsen.\nSubscribe to MedicineNet's Daily Health News Newsletter\nBy clicking Submit, I agree to the MedicineNet's Terms & Conditions & Privacy Policy and understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet's subscriptions at any time.\nMedscape Medical Reference\nAmerican Kidney Fund https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/kidney-friendly-diet-for-ckd.html\nCDC https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/eat-well/what-to-eat.html\nNational Kidney Foundation https://www.kidney.org/content/7-kidney-friendly-superfoods\nNIDDK https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/kidney-failure/eating-right\nCleveland Clinic.

      "text": "Having your blood drawn might not be much fun, but regular diagnostic tests of your blood can detect diseases early for treatment and give your doctor and medical providers critical information about how well your body is functioning.\nThe proper frequency of these blood tests depends on your age and personal health status -- the most important thing is to ask your doctor which tests you need and when you need them.\nWith all the different types of blood tests out there, it's good to go into your health care provider with a sense of what the most popular tests do and how they work. To help you out, we spoke with doctors for their expert insights about some important blood tests you may want to talk to your doctor about.\n1. Complete blood count\nThe complete blood count routine test provides a snapshot of your body's blood production and immunity. The test measures a variety of components in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.\nDr. Soma Mandal, a board-certified internist at Summit Health in New Providence, New Jersey, says that getting a CBC test is \"recommended for individuals of all ages as part of a routine health examination or when symptoms suggest a potential health issue.\"\nDr. Maria Kn\u00f6bel, medical director of Medical Cert UK, agrees that this foundational test is appropriate for many patients. She says the test is ideal for anyone undergoing a routine health check-up. Still, she advises that you may want to get it if you're \"experiencing symptoms like persistent fatigue, unexplained bruising or frequent infections.\"\nA CBC blood test can indicate lots of things, including:\n- Allergies\n- Anemia\n- Certain cancers\n- Heart disease\n- Immune system disorders\n- Infection\n- Inflammation\n- Iron deficiency\n- Leukemia\n- Low platelets (can affect blood clotting)\n- Risk of clotting and bleeding\n- Vitamin deficiency\nMandal explains that each lab may have slight variations for what they consider \"normal\" test results. The ranges typically accepted as normal for adults are:\nRed blood cells: 4.5-5.9 million cells per microliter (men), 4.1-5.1 million cells per microliter (women)\nWhite blood cells: 4,500-11,000 cells per microliter\nHemoglobin: 13.8-17.2 grams per deciliter (men), 12.1-15.1 grams per deciliter (women)\nHematocrit: 40.7%-50.3% (men), 36.1%-44.3% (women)\nPlatelets: 150,000-450,000 platelets per microliter\n2. Lipid panel\nLipids are fats and fatty substances in your blood. One type of lipid is cholesterol, which is used as a source of energy. Too much \"bad\" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL) can damage your heart.\nYou may need to get this test if you have cardiovascular disease or other risk factors. Mandal states this test is essential for anyone \"at risk of cardiovascular diseases, including those with a family history of heart disease, smokers, people with hypertension or those who are overweight.\"\nKn\u00f6bel explains that a lipid panel measures total cholesterol and also breaks it down into HDL/LDL:\n- Triglycerides\n- LDL (bad cholesterol)\n- HDL (good cholesterol)\nShe says, \"Elevated LDL levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, while high HDL levels are generally protective. Elevated triglycerides can also indicate a risk for heart disease and may be associated with other conditions like diabetes.\"\nThe normal parameters for a lipid panel in adults are:\nTotal cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL\nLDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL\nHDL cholesterol: 40 mg/dL or higher (men), 50 mg/dL or higher (women)\nTriglycerides: Less than 150 mg/dL\n3. Basic metabolic panel\nThe basic metabolic panel (BMP) measures what Kn\u00f6bel calls \"critical aspects of your body's chemistry.\" This includes glucose, calcium and electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. The test also looks for kidney function indicators, such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.\n\"Glucose levels provide insight into blood sugar control,\" Kn\u00f6bel explains. \"Electrolyte imbalances can reveal issues related to dehydration, kidney disease or metabolic imbalances. Abnormal calcium levels can indicate issues with bone health or parathyroid function.\" BMP is often part of a routine exam. It also may be recommended for patients with diabetes or kidney disease or those at risk for these conditions.\nThe results of your BMP could indicate:\n- Dehydration\n- Deteriorating bone health\n- Diabetes\n- Hypertension\n- Kidney disease\nFor adults, Mandal says the normal ranges for results of this test are:\nBicarbonate: 23-30 mEq/L\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN): 7-20 mg/dL\nCalcium: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL\nChloride: 96-106 mEq/L\nCreatinine: 0.6-1.3 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70-99 mg/dL (fasting)\nPotassium: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L\nSodium: 135-145 mEq/L\n4. Hemoglobin A1C\nThe Hemoglobin A1C test, also called the HbA1c, is a blood test that measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Mandel explains that it's primarily used to diagnose and monitor diabetes and pre-diabetes. If you're overweight, have symptoms of diabetes, have a family history of diabetes or are over the age of 45, the doctor says you may also want to get this test. A daily sugar test gives you a short-term view of your blood sugar level. On the other hand, this test is a long-term view of how well your body is managing glucose.\nGetting an HbA1c test could reveal a few things about your health:\n- Diabetes\n- Poor blood sugar control (higher risk of diabetes-related complications)\n- Pre-diabetes\nNormal ranges for test results are:\nNormal: Less than 5.7%\nPre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%\nDiabetes: 6.5% or higher\n5. Thyroid function tests\nIf you are experiencing fatigue, weight changes, irregular heartbeat, hair loss or mood swings, you may want to get a thyroid function test. Typically prescribed only if you display symptoms such as those previously mentioned, this test measures the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone in your blood. Your doctors can use the results to see how well your thyroid (a small, hormone-releasing gland in the front of your throat) is functioning. Mandal tells us this test is commonly included in routine health screenings, especially in women older than 60.\nYour blood test may indicate:\n- High TSH levels/hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid)\n- Low TSH levels/hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid)\n- Abnormal levels of T3 and T4 (other thyroid disorders)\nDoctors typically consider the following normal ranges for test results in adults:\nTSH levels: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L\nFree T4 levels: 0.8-1.8 ng/dL\nFree T3 levels: 2.3-4.2 pg/mL\n6. 25-hydroxy vitamin D\nAccording to Mount Sinai, a hospital system in New York, some older patients can benefit from getting a 25-hydroxy test to check their vitamin D levels. People who are older than 65, have osteoporosis, get limited sun exposure and/or have celiac disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis may benefit from the test.\nMost people get ample vitamin D from the sun. Both skin production and gut absorption of the vitamin declines as we age. It's important to find out if you don't have enough vitamin D because it helps with everything from bone health to immunity and energy levels.\nThe 25-hydroxy vitamin D will reveal two things:\n- 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)\n- 25 hydroxy vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)\nThere is some disagreement among doctors about what a healthy range is for vitamin D but one generally accepted range is 20 and 40 ng/mL.\nBlood test FAQs\nWhy are blood tests important?\nBlood tests are important because they can help doctors monitor your health and the effectiveness of treatments. They can also help doctors diagnose different medical conditions and determine the best treatment path.\nIf my blood tests are normal, could I still have cancer?\nRoutine blood tests may not be able to detect most types of cancer so even if your blood tests come back normal, you could still have cancer. Cancers also require additional diagnostic and laboratory testing for confirmation. If you're concerned about a certain type of cancer, discuss this with your doctor.\nWhich blood tests need to be fasting?\nAccording to Harvard Health, fasting is often advised before tests such as glucose (blood sugar) and triglycerides, the latter of which is part of the cholesterol or lipid panel. Consult your doctor if you're confused about how long you should fast before your blood tests.\nThe bottom line\nIt's always important to discuss your health and any related concerns with your doctor before requesting any type of test. Based on your personal situation and health plan, your doctor may request blood work not on this list or say that you don't need some of the above tests.\nAs a general rule, many people can benefit from CBC, lipid panel, BMP and hemoglobin A1C even without any symptoms. Also, thyroid function and vitamin D tests should be considered if you experience any symptoms. If you're older, you may also want to talk to your physician about your vitamin D absorption.\nIf your labs are abnormal, you may need additional screening and more frequent repeat labs. If your labs are normal, these labs may only need to be repeated once a year while doing your annual exam with your primary doctor."

      "text": "Imagine \"little pets living inside your intestinal tract.\" That's how Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci describes the trillions of microbes in your gut. Those microbes not only impact your gut health and break down food but also affect your overall well-being, as they support your immunity, regulate inflammation in the body, and even produce vital compounds like vitamins and hormones.\nKnowing how crucial your gut health is to your overall health, it's important to pay attention when it gives you signs that it may be struggling. Cresci says there are things you can do to restore your microbiome's health.\nSigns of an unhealthy gut to watch out for\n\"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome,\" Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it measured.\nOther signs of an unhealthy gut may include:\n- Vomiting or an upset stomach\n- Fatigue\n- Trouble sleeping\n- Food intolerance\n- Skin irritation or problems\nResearch has linked skin issues like acne and psoriasis to the gut. Studies are also looking into how the gut biome impacts reproductive health and hormone levels.\nHow to keep your gut healthy\nIt's important to see a doctor to determine the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut and overall health is a good first step.\nCresci also said that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track.\n1. Eat gut-friendly foods\nThe gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.\nAccording to Cresci, foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber should be removed from your gut or eaten in lower amounts. \"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome,\" she said.\nBeyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a heart-healthy diet, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples.\n2. Make note of the medications you're taking\nIt's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of \"good\" bacteria thriving in your body. Some common side effects of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.\nOther medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the pH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter.\nBy keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.\n3. Find the right probiotics or supplements\nIn addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may seek a probiotic in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to mimic an intact microbiota. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and \"each strain has its own method of action.\"\nFor example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking them for bowel regularity.\n\"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is,\" she said.\nAlso, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat.\n\"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you,\" Cresci said. \"You have to do the other part too.\"\n4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep\n\"Get better sleep\" or \"exercise more\" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and squeezing in more physical activity are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health.\nExercise may help your gut in different ways, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are small ways you can get your body in the habit of moving every day or at least more frequently.\nGetting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the circadian rhythm, too. So, if we eat when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to process the nutrients of our food properly.\nLacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have negative mental and physical impacts.\n\"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa,\" Cresci said.\nPerhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, including exercising or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health.\n\"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes,\" Cresci said. \"So it kind of perpetuates itself.\""

      "text": "This superfood comes in all shapes and sizes\nCabbage may not be the most attractive vegetable, but it\u2019s full of nutritional goodness that can keep you feeling strong and healthy. From boosting your immune system to improving your digestion (sometimes with embarrassing results), cabbage and its health benefits deserve a place at your table.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nThis common leafy green vegetable comes in a range of colors, shapes and sizes that you can use for soups, salads, sandwiches and more. Eat it raw or stir-fried to get the most benefit. Find it fermented in gut-healthy foods like sauerkraut and kimchi \u2014 or chopped into coleslaw for a quick fix.\n\u201cCabbage is good for you. It\u2019s one of those foods that tastes better than it looks, and it has even more nutritional value than people expect,\u201d says registered dietitian Julia Zumpano, RD, LD. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s versatile, affordable and easy to find.\u201d\nZumpano explores the benefits of eating cabbage and how it can boost your health.\nMany people recognize cabbage for its bounty of fiber, vitamins and minerals. One cup of chopped, raw green cabbage is only 22 calories and delivers:\n\u201cCabbage is also a potassium-rich food, which can help lower high blood pressure,\u201d says Zumpano. \u201cThe more we learn about cabbage, the better it promises to be.\u201d\nResearch shows leafy green vegetables, in general, are good for you, but we need more studies to understand how cabbage specifically affects your body. Zumpano says many people believe the nutritional value of cabbage means it can have any of the following benefits.\nAdvertisement\nSome of cabbage\u2019s health benefits are due to anthocyanins, which are naturally occurring antioxidants. Anthocyanins not only add color to your fruits (think blueberries) and vegetables, but may also reduce inflammation.\nChronic inflammation (long-term swelling) is associated with heart disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and many other medical conditions. In animal studies, anthocyanins have been shown to help control inflammation.\nWe need more research, but one small human study showed that those who ate the most cruciferous vegetables had much lower inflammation levels than those who ate the least.\nVitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, does a lot of work for your body. It helps make collagen and boosts your immune system. It also helps your body absorb iron from plant-based foods.\nPacked with phytosterols (plant sterols) and insoluble fiber, cabbage can help keep your digestive system healthy and bowel movements regular. It fuels the good bacteria in your gut that protects your immune system and produces essential nutrients. That\u2019s especially true when you eat fermented cabbage in kimchi or sauerkraut.\n\u201cCabbage can help you stay regular,\u201d says Zumpano. \u201cIt can also help support safe and healthy weight loss.\u201d\nFiber is a nondigestible or absorbed carbohydrate, so it adds bulk to meals and takes space in your belly causing you to fill full faster and longer without ingesting carbs that you\u2019re absorbing.\nThe anthocyanins found in cabbage help with more than inflammation. Research suggests they add to the health benefits of cabbage by reducing your risk of heart disease. Scientists have found 36 different kinds of anthocyanins in cabbage, which could make it an excellent option for cardiovascular health.\nPotassium is a mineral and electrolyte that helps your body control blood pressure. One cup of red cabbage can deliver a healthy amount of potassium \u2014 as much as 6% of your recommended daily value. This could help lower your blood pressure, reducing your risk for heart disease.\nToo much \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol, can cause heart problems if it builds up in your arteries. Cabbage contains two substances \u2014 fiber and phytosterols (plant sterols) \u2014 that compete with cholesterol to be absorbed by your digestive system. They wind up reducing your bad cholesterol levels and improving your health.\nVitamin K is essential to your well-being. Without it, you\u2019d be at risk of developing bone conditions like osteoporosis, and your blood wouldn\u2019t be able to clot properly. Enter cabbage, a great source of vitamin K. One cup provides 85% of the recommended daily value.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cVitamin K helps keep our bones strong and our blood clotting well,\u201d says Zumpano. \u201cCabbage can give you that boost you need to make sure your levels are adequate, and your body stays protected against illness and disease. And you don\u2019t even need to eat that much cabbage to get great health benefits.\u201d\nEarly animal studies suggest that leafy green vegetables like cabbage have phytochemicals that may help protect against cancer. They contain antioxidants and plant compounds like glucosinolates. These sulfur-containing chemicals break down during the digestive process into substances that may help fight cancer cells and clear them from your body.\nExcited to add more cabbage to your diet? Just be careful not to go overboard. To maximize its health benefits, increase your cabbage intake slowly and allow your body to adjust. Also, stay hydrated to reduce constipation, which can cause excess gas.\nCabbage might not be the best choice for a romantic night out since eating too much can cause diarrhea, flatulence or abdominal discomfort. It also contains substances that can interfere with medications like blood thinners or cause hypothyroidism, a condition where your thyroid doesn\u2019t create enough thyroid hormone and causes your metabolism to slow down.\nAdvertisement\nIn most cases, you can avoid side effects by eating cabbage as part of a healthy diet. Talk to your healthcare provider if you experience symptoms or have any concerns.\nCabbage belongs to the Brassica oleracea species of vegetable, along with broccoli, cauliflower, kale and Brussels sprouts. The most common type is green cabbage. But hundreds of other varieties exist in red, white and purple hues, with a range of textures and sizes.\nSome forms of cabbage have subtle, delicate flavors, while others pack a peppery punch.

These natural substances, which give arugula its bitter taste and strong scent, may protect you against certain cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancers. Arugula may also fight inflammation. It has ample vitamin K, which is good for your bones and may help prevent osteoporosis.\nArugula Risks\nThere's little to suggest arugula is bad for you. But if you take medicine known as blood thinners, too much vitamin K could undo their effects. That's because vitamin K is important to the blood-clotting process.\nArugula Uses\nYou can use arugula just like you would other leafy greens, especially when you want a spicy bite: Try it:\n- As a pizza or baked potato topping\n- In pasta\n- In salads\n- In soups and sauces\n- Instead of lettuce in sandwiches\n- In omelets or smoothies"

      "text": "Whether you're looking to improve your overall health or boost your immune system, vitamin C is one of the most important nutrients you need to stay healthy and it's a go-to for many people when they think they are getting sick. People have sworn by it for ages (whether in food or supplements) and for good reason. Health experts, nutritionists and science all agree that not only is it a vital nutrient but it can help prevent infections and help you get better when you are already sick.\nVitamin C is an important antioxidant for immune health. It works by helping your body heal from and fight off infections, and can help keep you from getting sick and support you when you are sick. But did you know your body needs vitamin C for a ton of other things?\nWhy is vitamin C important?\nVitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect your body from harmful substances such as free radicals caused by oxidative stress, which are molecules that can damage cells. It's important to get vitamin C through supplements or food since your body can't make it on its own.\nBesides its protective, healing and antioxidant effects, vitamin C is also shown to help cancer patients improve their quality of life and exhibit fewer side effects from treatment. Vitamin C is also thought to protect cardiovascular health. One study showed that people who took at least 700mg of vitamin C per day had lower risk factors for heart disease.\nHow to get enough vitamin C\n\"Typically, I recommend eating a variety of fruits and vegetables for those seeking to boost their vitamin C content,\" dietician Jenn Randazzo tells CNET. Vitamin C is found in many foods including:\n- Citrus fruits and their juices\n- Red and green peppers\n- Broccoli\n- Strawberries\n- Cantaloupe\n- Baked potatoes\n- Tomatoes\n- Some foods and beverages that are fortified with vitamin C\n\"Because vitamin C content may be reduced by prolonged storage and cooking techniques, try to consume vitamin C foods either raw or steamed for a short period of time,\" Randazzo adds. Another way to ensure you get enough vitamin C is to add a supplement. This can be helpful during times when you want to prevent illness, boost your immune system or get extra vitamin C support if you're sick.\n\"If you're worried about getting enough vitamin C into your daily diet, it is available as dietary supplements as well (usually in the form of ascorbic acid),\" Randazzo says. \"However, some supplements have other forms, like sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, and other mineral ascorbates too. Research has not shown that any form of vitamin C is better than the others, so it's important that you use the form easiest to incorporate into your personal wellness routine.\"\nHow much vitamin C should you take?\nWhen it comes to vitamin C, many people think more is better. The recommended daily amount is about 65-90mg per day, and the upper limit is 2,000mg per day. Most supplements on the market provide much more than 90mg, and if you're eating foods with vitamin C and supplementing, you're meeting your 90mg requirement and then some.\nIf you're taking more vitamin C than is recommended, it's unlikely to hurt you since the vitamin is not stored in the body. \"For some, consuming too much vitamin C can cause stomach upset, like diarrhea, nausea or cramps,\" Randazzo says. In fact, if you are sick, your body needs much more vitamin C and your needs can increase due to inflammation and other factors. This is why it's important to talk to a health professional like a doctor or nutritionist to help you determine how much vitamin C you need to prevent or treat illness.\nVitamin C and immune health\nVitamin C plays an important role in immune health and helps your body's immune system in a few different ways. First, it supports the production of immune cells or white blood cells that you need to fight infections. Secondly, vitamin C functions as an antioxidant, which protects you from oxidative stress, which is linked to chronic health conditions and illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's.\nVitamin C and COVID-19\nVitamin C has been given to critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19, although there is no research to show it is effective at treating COVID-19 specifically. Studies are ongoing, but the National Institutes of Health still say there isn't enough evidence to recommend the use of vitamin C for COVID-19 patients.\nIt's important to remember that researchers and doctors don't have all of the answers about COVID-19 at this time. The best ways to reduce your risk of being infected with the coronavirus is to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, abide by any health orders from your local officials, and to take care of your health as much as you can overall.\nVitamin C and stress\nOne surprising fact about vitamin C is that it can help your body when under stress, whether that is physical or emotional. One study showed that vitamin C was helpful in reducing stress hormones in mice, which means it could help human bodies cope with the harmful effects of physical and emotional stressors.\nAnother 2015 study showed that vitamin C supplementation was helpful for people with anxiety. It helped mitigate the negative effects of anxiety in the body and showed promise for helping prevent future anxiety.\nGiven vitamin C's benefits for stress, anxiety, heart health and immunity, making sure you're getting plenty of vitamin C per day is a good step in the direction of better health."
