      "feedback": "The draft shows solid macro-framing, a coherent first-principles logic (AI-driven y*, disinflationary policy, regime map A/B/C) and a workable four-mover scaffold plus two Swing Trade lines, but it falls short of world-class precision in probability anchoring, citation discipline, and strict adherence to the exact format. Key gaps: (1) Probabilities for the Movers are not consistently tied to explicit material facts; many numbers are asserted without a traceable source, while some evidence (e.g., 85% odds of a September cut) sits in the text but isn’t mapped to the corresponding mover, so recalibrate each line to a single, evidence-backed probability with an ID after the figure (e.g., 85% odds of a rate cut per policy signals; 60% OBBA-progression path; 25% down-risk; 20% downside) and attach the exact IDs that justify them (OGK8WLL69, 17F49LURJ, 218AGGUXB, NL5YYTLF2, etc.). (2) The “What to watch” fields frequently carry compound assertions that would be better split: compress to one crisp driver phrase in Driver/Mechanism and a single, traceable watch-item in What to watch, keeping each line to the required five fields. (3) Ensure the Movers’ content aligns with a single, shared Regime-A/B/C probability matrix to avoid internal conflicts and to enable clean cross-asset transmission; explicitly map each mover to Regime A (disinflation with easing), B (sticky inflation), or C (growth/volatility risk) and cite sources for regime probabilities. (4) The Citations: density is high but inconsistently placed; place an ID after every numeric claim and every assertion that depends on a source, and prune any stray IDs that don’t back a stated fact to avoid conflicts. (5) The Swing Trades currently present two lines with ETH-price-style entries; confirm the tradability assumption and keep a single tradable asset (ETH or a clearly liquid crypto proxy) or, if you intend multiple assets, present one Outlook line instead of a second Swing Trade to satisfy the 1–2-line limit. (6) The content includes extraneous, non-format content (e.g., “0–14d” and “14–28d” lines) that overstep the four-mover plus two-swing-trade rule; remove or reframe to strict four movers and two trades only. (7) Tighten base-case coherence: ensure the 40–60% base-case confidence, the Range productivity lift, and the OBBA timing are consistently referenced across all four lines rather than appearing as separate, loosely connected paragraphs. (8) For transparency, predefine the exact invalidation rules per line (e.g., a break below X on Y horizon or a regime-shift signal) with clear triggers and a single, cited rationale per invalidation. (9) After revision, run a final consistency check to ensure every critical source is represented at least once in the Movers or trades, and reconcile any apparent conflicts (e.g., crypto-led demand vs. debt-financing strains) within the same Regime framework rather than as parallel, conflicting threads. Implementing these edits will yield four tightly argued, evidence-grounded Movers, two crisply executed Swing Trades on a single tradable asset (or a clearly justified exception), exact, source-backed probabilities, and a compact, citation-safe narrative aligned to the SECTION FOCUS and format constraints.",
