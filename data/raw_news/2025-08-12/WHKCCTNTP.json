  "description": "This is where you\u2019re going to find the best one-of-a-kind vintage and second hand souvenirs on your next European holiday, from London to Lisbon.",
  "content": "There\u2019s no souvenir like a really good vintage find. Whether it\u2019s a cheeky flea market gem or a high-end designer score, the thrill of the hunt when it comes to vintage shopping is amplified even further when abroad.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for vintage finds over traditional souvenirs, a new survey from global travel booking site Omio has highlighted the best cities in Europe for vintage shopping enthusiasts.\n\nHere are some of the best European cities for vintage shopping according to the survey:\n\nLondon has the most vintage stores in Europe\u2014by a long shot. The city has a total of 409 stores all across town with an average rating of 4.46 out of 5. The rating is lower than every other city on the list, which means that certain shops might be hit or miss, but with vintage shopping, the hunt is all part of the fun.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Paris\u2014the city of fashion\u2014ranks high on the list of the best vintage stores in Europe. Paris boasts 226 different vintage shops across the city with an average rating of 4.52. The best part of vintage shopping in Paris is that you\u2019ll frequently come across high-end designer vintage, like well-preserved Hermes scarves and Chanel shoes.\n\nThe third-best city in Europe for vintage shopping is Berlin; there\u2019s a reason the city is renowned for its edgy street style. The German city boasts a total of 165 vintage stores with an average rating of 4.57.\n\nThe first Italian city to make the list, Rome is another haven for vintage lovers. The Eternal City has a total of 102 vintage shops throughout the city with an average rating of 4.45. It has the second-lowest rating out of all cities on the list, so it might be worth doing some research on specific shops before heading out for the hunt.\n\nThe second Italian city to make the list, Milan is a close second to Rome with 101 vintage shops across the city. The average rating sits at 4.51\u2014but given its proximity to fashion week and high-end Italian fashion, you never know what you\u2019ll find at vintage shops in the city.\n\nBarcelona boasts 90 vintage shops across the city and has the fourth highest average rating, at 4.64. The smaller number of shops juxtaposed with the high average rating means that the city is one of the best for highly curated vintage shopping.\n\nThe second Spanish city to make the list, Madrid is right under Barcelona at 81 stores across the city. The average rating is also on the higher end, with 4.60 out of 5.\n\nThe city of Lisbon is considered the best in Portugal to go vintage shopping. It has a total of 54 vintage shops with an average rating of 4.55 out of 5.\n\nAthens is the only Greek city to make the list\u2014and it\u2019s definitely worth making a detour to the mainland if you\u2019re into vintage shopping. The city has a total of 46 vintage shops with an average rating of 4.75 out of 5, which is the highest on the list.\n\nAlthough Manchester boasts just 22 vintage shops in the city, it also boasts an average rating of 4.75 out of 5, the highest on the list, meaning it has the best vintage shopping experience with the least amount of effort.",
