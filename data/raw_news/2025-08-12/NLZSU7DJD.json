  "description": "Making AI more human",
  "content": "Imagine a health plan member interacting with their insurer\u2019s virtual assistant, typing, \u201cI just lost my mom and feel overwhelmed.\u201d A conventional chatbot might respond with a perfunctory \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d and send a list of FAQs. This might be why 59% of chatbot users before 2020 felt that \u201cthe technologies have misunderstood the nuances of human dialogue.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, an AI agent can pause, offer empathetic condolences, gently guide the member to relevant resources, and even help schedule an appointment with their doctor. This empathy, paired with personalization, drives better outcomes.\n\nWhen people feel understood, they\u2019re more likely to engage, follow through, and trust the system guiding them. Oftentimes in regulated industries that handle sensitive topics, simple task automation fails when users abandon engagements that feel rigid, incompetent, or lack understanding of the individual\u2019s circumstances.\n\nAI agents can listen, understand, and respond with compassion. This combination of contextual awareness and sentiment\u2011driven response is more than just a nice\u2011to\u2011have add-on\u2014it\u2019s foundational for building trust, maintaining engagement, and ensuring members navigating difficult moments get the personalized support they need.\n\nBeyond Automation: Why Empathy Matters in Complex Conversations\n\nTraditional automation excels at straightforward, rule\u2011based tasks but struggles when conversations turn sensitive. AI agents, by contrast, can detect emotional cues\u2014analyzing tone, punctuation, word choice, conversation history, and more\u2014and deliver supportive, context\u2011appropriate guidance.\n\nThis shift from transactional to relational interactions matters in regulated industries, where people may need help navigating housing assistance, substance-use treatment, or reproductive health concerns.\n\nAI agents that are context-aware and emotionally intelligent can support these conversations by remaining neutral, non\u2011judgmental, and attuned to the user\u2019s needs.\n\nThey also offer a level of accuracy and consistency that\u2019s hard to match\u2014helping ensure members receive timely, personalized guidance and reliable access to resources, which could lead to better, more trusted outcomes.\n\nThe Technology Under the Hood\n\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) and transformer architectures (GPT\u2011style models) have been pivotal to enabling more natural, emotionally aware conversations between AI agents and users. Unlike early sentiment analysis tools that only classified text as positive or negative, modern LLMs predict word sequences across entire dialogues, effectively learning the subtleties of human expression.\n\nConsider a scenario where a user types, \u201cI just got laid off and need to talk to someone about my coverage.\u201d An early-generation chatbot might respond with \u201cI can help you with your benefits,\u201d ignoring the user\u2019s distress.\n\nToday\u2019s emotionally intelligent AI agent first acknowledges the emotional weight: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2014losing a job can be really tough.\u201d It then transitions into assistance: \u201cLet\u2019s review your coverage options together, and I can help you schedule a call if you'd like to speak with someone directly.\"\n\nThese advances bring two key strengths. First, contextual awareness means AI agents can track conversation history\u2014remembering what a user mentioned in an earlier exchange and following up appropriately.\n\nSecond, built\u2011in sentiment sensitivity allows these models to move beyond simple positive versus negative tagging. By learning emotional patterns from real\u2011world conversations, these AI agents can recognize shifts in tone and tailor responses to match the user\u2019s emotional state.\n\nEthically responsible online platforms embed a robust framework of guardrails to ensure safe, compliant, and trustworthy AI interactions. In regulated environments, this includes proactive content filtering, privacy protections, and strict boundaries that prevent AI from offering unauthorized advice.\n\nSensitive topics are handled with predefined responses and escalated to human professionals when needed. These safeguards mitigate risk, reinforce user trust, and ensure automation remains accountable, ethical, and aligned with regulatory standards.\n\nFor people to trust AI in regulated sectors, AI must do more than sound empathetic. It must be transparent, respect user boundaries, and know when to escalate to live experts. Robust safety layers mitigate risk and reinforce trust.\n\nTone, cultural norms, and even punctuation can shift perception. Robust testing across demographics, languages, and use cases is critical. When agents detect confusion or frustration, escalation paths to live agents must be seamless, ensuring swift resolution and access to the appropriate level of human support when automated responses may fall short.\n\nIndustries under strict oversight cannot allow hallucinations or unauthorized advice. Platforms must enforce transparent disclosures\u2014ensuring virtual agents identify themselves as non-human\u2014and embed compliance\u2011driven guardrails that block unapproved recommendations. Redirects to human experts should be fully logged, auditable, and aligned with applicable frameworks.\n\nGuardrails must filter hate speech or explicit content while distinguishing between abusive language and expressions of frustration. When users use mild profanity to convey emotional distress, AI agents should recognize the intent without mirroring the language\u2014responding appropriately and remaining within company guidelines and industry regulations.\n\nAlso, crisis\u2011intervention messaging\u2014responding to instances of self\u2011harm, domestic violence, or substance abuse\u2014must be flexible enough for organizations to tailor responses to their communities, connect people with local resources, and deliver support that is both empathetic and compliant with regulatory standards.\n\nAs regulated industries embrace AI agents, the conversation is shifting from evaluating their potential to implementing them at scale. Tomorrow\u2019s leaders won\u2019t just pilot emotion\u2011aware agents but embed empathy into every customer journey, from onboarding to crisis support.\n\nBy committing to this ongoing evolution, businesses can turn compliance requirements into opportunities for deeper connection and redefine what it means to serve customers in complex, regulated environments.\n\nRegulated AI must engineer empathy in every interaction. When systems understand the emotional context (not just data points), they become partners rather than tools. But without vertical specialization and real-time guardrails, even the most well-intentioned AI agents can misstep.\n\nThe future belongs to agentic, emotionally intelligent platforms that can adapt on the fly, safeguard compliance, and lead with compassion when it matters most. Empathy, when operationalized safely, becomes more than a UX goal\u2014it becomes a business advantage.\n\nWe list the best enterprise messaging platform.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Here\u2019s why the future of AI is emotion\nCan AI evolve with human emotions?\nAI is going through its adolescent phase. It\u2019s strong, ambitious, and capable of remarkable things, but increasingly, it\u2019s hitting some growing pains. Some analysts suggest AI has stalled due to \"data scarcity,\" poor connectivity, or power limitations.\nHowever, the real reason might be simpler: AI, as we know it, lacks the fundamental ability to truly understand us, the user. It can process information at remarkable speeds, create photorealistic images, and draft fluent text, but it struggles with emotional intelligence.\nIt doesn\u2019t know when a user is frustrated, bored, anxious, or exhausted. It can't sense the moment to pause, clarify, or change course. As AI tools are increasingly deployed in emotionally sensitive domains like education, healthcare, wellness, and media, this emotional blindspot is becoming a significant limitation.\nChief Strategy and Operations Officer at Neurologyca.\nMaybe the next leap in AI won\u2019t come from more data or faster processing, but from teaching AI to notice what humans do when something isn't landing. Emotionally adaptive AI will do more than read prompts; it'll read the room.\nBy combining facial cues, gaze tracking, behavioral patterns, and physiological signals, the next generation of AI will be able to infer how someone feels and adjust its output accordingly. The result will be an AI that understands when to push and when to back off \u2013 when someone is ready to learn, when they\u2019re mentally overloaded, or when they\u2019re just not connecting.\nThis shift, from reactive logic to emotional awareness, could be what finally takes AI out of adolescence and into maturity.\nFaster AI Doesn't Mean Better AI\nWe\u2019re used to measuring AI in superlatives: bigger models, faster inference, smarter responses. But in the rush to scale up, we\u2019ve overlooked something more fundamental: human context. A model ten times larger won't necessarily give better answers if it can't tell when it has misunderstood the question, or when a user is losing patience and needs an empathetic ear.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nLogic-based accuracy doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to usefulness in the moment. When AI is deployed in settings where emotional nuance matters \u2013 like classrooms, clinics, and during deep conversations \u2013 raw intelligence isn't enough. An algorithm might make fast movie recommendations based on viewing history, but it doesn't know what you're in the mood to watch right now.\nThese environments don't just rely on information delivery; they rely on timing, tone, and emotional context. In a classroom, the difference between a student thriving and disengaging isn't about how many facts the system can present; it's about knowing when the student is overwhelmed.\nIn a mental health setting, offering the right coping strategy is fine, but what if the user is too burnt out to hear it? Traditional AI systems weren\u2019t built for this. They optimize for completion, not connection, and that\u2019s where their limitations become apparent.\nHumanizing AI\nAI's next milestone upgrade won't be faster models or smarter algorithms. It'll be emotional adaptivity and contextual awareness. This means two things for the future of AI. First, AI will be able to read your personal cues in real time, when you choose to allow it.\nMuch like how Apple Watch users see significant value in heart rate, sleep pattern, or activity levels analysis to provide personalized health insights, human context AI picks up on the silent signals we send all the time: the blink rate that suggests cognitive fatigue, the micro-expression that flashes when confusion sets in, or the subtle eye movement that hints at distraction.\nWith the right fusion of sensors and models, AI can now combine emotion and mood with biometric signals into a holistic understanding of how you're feeling and why.\nUnderstanding human emotional patterns\nSecond, and perhaps even more broadly, this understanding of human emotional and behavioral patterns can be anonymously \"crowdsourced.\" This vast dataset will level up large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, making them inherently more human-centric in their responses and decisions.\nThis means AI can deal more effectively with a wider range of situations, even in environments where real-time personal signals aren't being interpreted. It's about building a foundational emotional intelligence into AI, making all interactions more intuitive and responsive to general human needs and states.\nIn the same way a great teacher slows down when they detect confusion or injects some fun when they see the room glazing over, emotionally adaptive AI can recalibrate on the fly \u2013 repeating a step, simplifying a concept, or just pausing to give the user space. It\u2019s a shift from AI that reacts to what we say to AI that responds to how we feel. This opens the door to use cases that conventional AI simply isn\u2019t equipped for.\nIn healthcare and wellness, it can surface emotional and physiological patterns that can flag burnout, mood disorders, or stroke risk, without relying on bias-prone self-reporting. In gaming, it can power experiences that respond to how players feel, not just what they do, adjusting game difficulty or narrative flow in real-time. What unites these use cases \u2013 and countless others \u2013 is a shift from one-size-fits-all delivery to emotionally responsive systems that are in tune with humans.\nThe real breakthrough won't be in how much AI knows; it'll be in how well AI knows us.\nWe've listed the best IT Automation software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "How Agentic AI is changing the game in CX and beyond\nRevolutionizing CX with autonomous, personalized, and proactive interactions\nThe rise of agentic AI is revolutionizing customer experience (CX) by introducing autonomous decision-making, real-time adaptability, and goal-driven intelligence. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily reacts to inputs, agentic AI takes initiative \u2013 anticipating customer needs, personalizing interactions, and optimizing business processes at an unprecedented scale.\nThis shift is redefining how businesses engage with customers, turning interactions into intelligent, dynamic experiences. While traditional AI has already streamlined operations, it often struggles with complex decision-making. That\u2019s where agentic AI steps in. Rather than simply automating tasks or following predefined prompts, it operates autonomously \u2013 empowering customers to take control of their journeys while AI works alongside them.\nBy anticipating needs, making real-time decisions, and delivering hyper-personalized experiences, agentic AI strengthens customer relationships, enhances decision-making, and creates engagement that keeps customers coming back. In an era where expectations for personalization are higher than ever, companies that successfully integrate agentic AI gain a competitive edge, not just improving customer loyalty, but positioning themselves as industry leaders.\nAgentic AI is more than just a tool for personalized recommendations \u2013 it enables businesses to create truly dynamic experiences that can change and enhance in real time. It doesn\u2019t just react to past behavior; it proactively builds customer relationships. By anticipating preferences and needs, it shifts from being a support system to a driving force in customer engagement, transforming brand experiences and fostering lasting loyalty.\nGlobal CEO of HGS.\nMaking an impact across industries\nAgentic AI crosses industry boundaries, making a difference in industries like telecom, finance, healthcare, logistics, and more. It isn\u2019t just about enhancing efficiency but reshaping the way businesses operate.\nFor example, in telecom, customers are looking for speed and hyper-personalization everywhere they look. Agentic AI can transform customer service by automating issue resolution, predicting network outages, and delivering hyper-personalized support. AI-driven virtual agents can troubleshoot issues, anticipate service needs, and provide seamless, real-time assistance, enhancing both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\nSimilarly, in the finance industry, agentic AI can become indispensable for fraud protection and autonomous trading. By detecting anomalies and preventing fraud in real time, agentic AI can strengthen security and trust. In healthcare, it can offer personalized patient care through personalized treatment plans, resource optimization, and enhanced diagnostics. Logistics companies can leverage agentic AI to autonomously manage inventory, forecast demand, and plan delivery routes to enhance overall efficiencies.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWith agentic AI, businesses can unlock new levels of adaptability and responsiveness \u2013 using it not just as a tool, but as an active partner in driving innovation, solving challenges, and elevating customer experiences.\nEthical implications of Agentic AI\nWhile agentic AI is a powerful solution, it also raises key ethical concerns, much like traditional AI. Because agentic AI operates with a higher degree of autonomy, strong security, compliance, and transparency measures are even more critical. Its ability to act independently requires enhanced human oversight to ensure these agents align with intended outcomes and don\u2019t introduce unintended risks.\nAs these agents become more capable and influential, companies must develop clear policies to ensure their behavior serves their purpose, safely. Customers need confidence that agentic AI systems are acting in their best interest and that their personal data is protected. If these systems learn from biased data, they can unintentionally favor some groups over others. To overcome that challenge, companies must invest in their data programs and have ongoing monitoring and safeguards.\nAt the same time, human interaction still matters. While agentic AI can enhance efficiency by handling complex or repetitive tasks, customers still value real people for more nuanced conversations. Finding the right balance between automation and human support ensures businesses provide both speed and a personal touch.\nStaying competitive in the age of Agentic AI\nAgentic AI is at the forefront of the AI revolution, leading the charge in transforming customer interactions across industries. As its presence continues to grow and evolve, its role will expand further into business operations with even more intuitive AI assistants, deeper emotional intelligence, and enhanced real-time decision-making abilities.\nCompanies that don\u2019t move fast enough risk falling behind. Agentic AI isn\u2019t just another tool \u2013 it\u2019s reshaping how businesses function. Business leaders need partners who can help them not only adopt the technology but also rethink their workflows to stay competitive. Big software companies may push expensive licenses, consulting firms focus on billable hours, and outsourcing companies may resist change to protect their revenue.\nTo effectively leverage agentic AI\u2019s potential, businesses should seek partners committed to real improvements \u2013 ones who align their success with helping companies use it in meaningful, practical ways. Implementing agentic AI solutions is more than just new technology; it requires agility, responsible implementation, and a willingness to rethink how work gets done \u2013 all of which ultimately lead to more seamless, personalized, and satisfying experiences for customers.\nWe've featured the best AI website builder.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best privacy app for Android of 2025\nFree and paid services to protect online privacy\nWe list the best privacy apps for Android, to make it simple and easy to better manage and protect your privacy online when using an Android phone or tablet.\nUser privacy has become a big issue over recent years, as government regulations have tried to push back against the big increase in cookie tracking for data collection purposes. On top of this, Android phone users have the additional concern of rogue apps that might try to tap into your data directly.\nIn order to protect your privacy there are, of course, basic settings that can help mitigate some of these issues. However, if you're serious about privacy, anonymity, and security, then you'll probably need to go a step further.\nThere are dedicated Android antivirus apps out there, as well as encrypted messaging apps for Android to help keep communications secure.\nHowever, one of the best ways to protect your privacy is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, some of which are available specifically as a VPN for Android.\nAdditional options include authentication software, password management, browser addons, and keychains.\nBelow we list what we think are the best privacy apps and software tools for Android users currently available.\nWe've also featured the best Android emulators.\nThe best privacy apps for Android of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest privacy app for Android overall\nReasons to buy\nA VPN (virtual private network) app is the biggest no-brainer privacy boost you can give to your Android device. VPNs not only hide your IP address from the sites and apps that you use, they hide the sites and apps you use from your internet service provider.\nA VPN will also let you pretend to be in a different location, which is key for unblocking geo-restricted content.\nExpressVPN consistently ranks at the top of our list of Android VPNs. It\u2019s reliably fast, has 160 server locations in 94 countries, and its 24/7 customer support is second to none.\nThe service already used industry-standard encryption and a choice of various other protocols (including IKEv2, OpenVPN and L2TP/IPsec) to keep your data safe. But perhaps most exciting is that it has now begun rolling out its very own Lightway protocol that seeks to increase speed and reliability even further.\nBut away from the numbers and specifications, it\u2019s in our real-life testing where ExpressVPN really shines. For starters, it\u2019s fast. Really fast, with fantastic connection speeds across servers in multiple countries. And that was using OpenVPN in our tests - the aforementioned Lightway option should increase that further still.\nWe also love just how easy to use this service is. That might seem obvious, but not every VPN provider out there has worked out how to make its tools intuitive, regardless of what device you're using it on. From desktop and mobile, to TV streamers and browser extensions, ExpressVPN is very easy to set up and operate for both pros and inexperienced users.\nExpressVPN costs around $13 per month, but if you pay for a yearly subscription there is a substantial saving at around $8 per month for the first year.\nRead our full ExpressVPN review.\nBest privacy app for ad and tracker blocking\nReasons to buy\nThe Firefox browser app aims to make your internet surfing experience more private than most other browsers, with additional built in privacy and security settings.\nAdditionally, you can use Firefox add-ons to further increase your privacy. Once you\u2019ve installed Firefox from the Play store, open the menu and go to Tools > Add Ons > Browse all Firefox Add Ons.\nLook under the Privacy & Security section and you can find add-ons such as Ghostery, which prevents websites leaving \u2018tracking cookies\u2019 on your device to monitor your browsing habits, and the likes of script blockers and ad blockers amongst many other security-related bits and pieces.\nBest privacy app for private browsing\nReasons to buy\nMajor search engines like Google and Bing sometimes engage in leakage whereby your search term may be shared with third-parties like the sites you visit.\nThey also often save your search history with a timestamp and details of your device, meaning searches can be traced back to you. Sometimes they place virtual cookies on your device to record your search habits.\nDuckDuckGo works as a drop-in replacement for your default search engine. Searches do not leak to other websites and this engine records no information about what you look for. It\u2019s also ad-free. DuckDuckGo is compatible with Orbot (above), so you can hide your location from the sites you visit, too.\nRead our full DuckDuckGo review.\nBest privacy app for security\n4. Keepass2Android\nReasons to buy\nKeepass2Android is an Android version of the excellent password manager Keepass. Version 2 supports using key files as well as passwords, which is more secure. The password database can be stored on a remote folder (for example, in your Dropbox account) so you can access it both from your Android device and desktop computer.\nIf you prefer to keep your password database on the Android device only, there\u2019s also an offline version of this app \u2013 click on the second of the download links below.\nYou can use Android\u2019s copy/paste feature to enter passwords for any number of websites if you wish, or make use of Keepass2Android\u2019s built-in keyboard to enter passwords, which is safer.\nBest privacy app for open source\n5. Syncthing\nReasons to buy\nAs the name suggests, Syncthing is used to synchronize (or \u2018sync\u2019) files between two devices, for instance you can use it to back up photos on your Android device to your home computer.\nAfter installing the Android app and setting up Syncthing on a computer, any files or folders you select will be copied between devices via an encrypted connection.\nAs connections are peer-to-peer, you don\u2019t have to store your data with a third-party cloud service like Dropbox. Plus you can add as many devices as you like to share files between.\nSyncthing is open source, so its code can be checked for vulnerabilities by security boffins, and any problems should hopefully get fixed pronto.\nBest privacy app for encryption\n6. OpenKeychain\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpenKeychain is an implementation of OpenPGP (sometimes referred to as GPG). It allows you to generate a \u2018public\u2019 key which you give to others to allow them to encrypt and send messages to you, and a \u2018private\u2019 key which remains on your Android device and is used to decrypt incoming messages. Your private key can also digitally sign messages so people know they\u2019re really from you.\nIf you\u2019ve never used PGP/GPG before, a good non-geeky explanation of how it works is available here. This app is designed to integrate into the K-9 Mail app to allow for easy signing and encryption of all your emails.\nBest privacy app for dark web access\n7. Orbot\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOrbot has been developed by the Guardian Project as a way for your Android device to access the Tor network. When used along with its companion app, the Orfox browser, this lets you browse the web safely without worrying about sites tracking your location, as your connection is encrypted and routed through several different computers.\nFor extra security, use Tor hidden services. These are websites with the domain extension .onion which reside only in the \u2018dark web\u2019. For instance Facebook\u2019s address is http://facebookcorewwwi.onion.\nDo note, though, that as your data is being shunted through a number of computers, you may find your connection speed is much slower than usual. Such is the trade-off for tight privacy.\nWe've featured the best Linux distro for privacy and security.\nBest privacy app for Android FAQs\nWhich privacy app for Android is best for you?\nWhen deciding which privacy app for Android to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your privacy app.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best privacy apps for Android we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the software performed when accessed by different devices, as well as testing any additional tools that were provided. The aim was to push each privacy app to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best Large Language Models (LLMs) of 2025\nLLMs for business\nThe best Large Language Models (LLMs) make it simple and easy to set up, manage, and train your own AI models.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate natural and programming languages. LLMs can be used to help with a variety of tasks and each have their own degree of suitability and cost efficiency. For this guide we tested multiple individual models from the same foundational model where appropriate to find the best LLM.\nThis area of technology is moving particularly fast so while we endeavor to keep this guide as up to date as possible, you may want to check whether a newer model has been released and whether the cost efficiency for that model makes it a better choice.\nThese are the best LLMs of 2024 tested by us. We've picked one foundation LLM as best overall and selected individual models from a range of foundational models for each category.\nThe best LLMs of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest LLM overall\n1. OpenAI's GPT\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe majority of LLMs are based on a variation of the Transformer Architecture, a neural network architecture that was first documented in a 2017 research paper authored by 8 scientists working at Google. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer, also known as GPT, is one of several different foundational models used by tech firms to power the LLMs currently available on the market today. While there are several different types of GPT available today, the first, and arguably the most well-known, was introduced by OpenAI in 2018 as GPT-1.\nGPT models can be adapted by developers to tackle specific tasks and workloads, or used in a more general approach to cover a more broad range of applications. For example, Github Copilot uses a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 that is specifically tuned to help programmers write code, while the EinsteinGPT model built into Salesforce cloud aims to enhance the experience of their customers by improving productivity for employees.\nIn November 2023, OpenAI announced they would enable ChatGPT subscribers to create custom GPTs using their own datasets, training data and even allow them to access database systems to pull data for analysis in real-time. OpenAI also plans to allow developers to publish and monetize their custom GPTs for other users and developers to use, so we might see some interesting releases over the next few years that build upon the core GPT models already available today.\nOpenAI is at the forefront of GPT development, releasing several different versions for public use over the last few years. While each subsequent release of OpenAI GPT has contained incremental improvements to its intelligence and capabilities, this has come at the price of reduced performance, and an increase to response latency and cost to use.\nGPT-3.5 was very quick and cost effective, but could often make mistakes or demonstrate bias, GPT-4 improved the capabilities and intelligence of the model at an increase cost to use and higher response latency. The latest release, GPT-4o, bucks the trend by being the most intelligent version yet, while reducing the cost to use and improving latency by a considerable margin.\nOut of the box, the GPT models from OpenAI provide a fantastic \u201cjack of all trades\u201d approach that is sufficient for most use cases today, while those looking for a more specialized or task specific approach can customize them to their needs. This makes GPT models a great option for those who need something that just works, without the need to train the models on their own datasets for them to become effective.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that, like with all LLMs on the market today, GPT models aren\u2019t immune to providing false, biased, or misleading responses. While the most recent releases are becoming more accurate and are less likely to generate bad responses, users should be careful when using information provided in an output and take the time to verify that it is accurate.\nBest LLM for coding\n2. GitHub Copilot\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGitHub is one of the largest and most recognisable developer platforms in use today and is used by many individuals and enterprises to store, manage and share their codebases, so it makes sense that they have also created an LLM for coding to help developers enhance the speed and efficiency of their work.\nGitHub Copilot is a coding assistant powered by the GPT-4 model from OpenAI that can be accessed via an extension within several commonly used IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Additionally, unlike other coding assistants, GitHub Copilot has an advantage over the competition by being natively integrated into GitHub.\nOriginally released in October 2021 and powered by OpenAI Codex, a modified version of the GPT-3 model, GitHub Copilot is a coding assistant that provides developers with a range of different tools that help them to understand new and existing codebases or code snippets, write blocks code quickly and efficiently, and help troubleshoot issues. It can also help write test cases for automated testing and can help inspire you with solutions to problems you encounter.\nIn November 2023, GitHub Copilot was updated to use the GPT-4 model to further improve its capabilities. With the recent release of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model, it makes sense to speculate that GitHub Copilot could be updated to use the latest version in the future but there has been no confirmation if or when that may happen at the moment.\nOne of the most eye-catching features is GitHub Copilot\u2019s ability to use a prompt to generate code that can either be entirely new, or based on the project\u2019s existing codebase by suggesting entire blocks of code or auto-completing lines as you type them. GitHub states that the model has been trained using source code from publicly available code repositories, including public repositories on GitHub itself, and claims that GitHub Copilot can support any language that appears in a public repository.\nHowever, GitHub does mention that the quality of the suggestions GitHub Copilot can offer is dependent on the diversity and volume of the training data available for that language. This could mean that while GitHub Copilot will still try to assist developers with suggestions when working in more obscure or less used programming languages, the benefits developers may gain when using GitHub Copilot may be reduced compared languages that are more common and publicly visible.\nSubscriptions to GitHub Copilot are available today at 3 different feature levels and price points tailored to individual developers, small to large businesses, and Enterprises. If you\u2019d like to try before you buy, GitHub Copilot offers a 30 day free trial to the \u201cIndividual\u201d subscription tier.\nBest value LLM\n3. Meta LLama\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGiven Meta is included as one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d global tech firms, it should come as no surprise that they\u2019ve been working on their own LLM to support their products, large and small businesses, and other applications such as research and academics. The original version of Llama released in February 2023, but was only made available on a case by case basis to select groups within academia, governmental departments, and for research purposes. Llama 2, released in July 2023, and Llama 3, released in April 2024, are both available for general and commercial usage today.\nThe most attractive selling point for Llama 3 is how cost efficient the LLM is compared to others on the market. While it might not be quite as capable as the behemoth that is GPT-4o (though still quite comparable), it is still a very capable model that can match the performance of GPT-4 at a fraction of the cost.\nDepending on provider, Llama 3 costs an average of $0.90 per 1 million output tokens which is considerably cheaper compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4o, which sit at $30 and $15 respectively for the same quantity of tokens. This can make Llama 3 a very cost-effective solution for those who need to process a high volume of tokens and desire a high quality output, but have a limited budget.\nFrom its own internal testing, Meta has claimed that Llama 3 can also match Google Gemini and Claude 3 (though it\u2019s currently unclear how it stacks up against the recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet release) in most benchmarks, making the value proposition from Meta increasingly attractive when combined with how much it costs to use.\nIn addition to the significant cost reduction achieved, with LLaMA 3 is also open-source, allowing users to sign up to gain access to each of the different sized models, download them, and install them on their local systems or infrastructure instead of relying on cloud-based offerings from providers such as AWS or Azure.\nThis a considerable difference to many of the other popular models on the market which require you to exclusively utilize their services to make use of the models. The 8B (8 Billion parameter) version of Llama 3 is small enough that you could comfortably run it on a modern high end desktop, though you will need a large amount of RAM and GPU VRAM to make best use of it, though you do need considerably more for the larger 70B model. This essentially allows you to use the model for \u201cfree\u201d, aside from any initial hardware setup costs, which could be very useful to individuals, students and academics.\nAdditionally, those who may have concerns about privacy can avoid the potential risks commonly associated with sending data into the cloud for processing by hosting Llama 3 on local hardware, or owned infrastructure. Naturally the hardware you have available does factor into the overall performance of Llama 3 compared to using a cloud solution offered by providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS, but if your main goal is to keep your costs as low as possible, the performance sacrifice may be worth it.\nWhile the 8B and 70B Llama 3 models are highly capable, Meta is also working on a gigantic 400B version that Meta\u2019s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun claims will become one of the most capable LLMs in the world once released.\nBest LLM for business\n4. Claude\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in March 2024, Claude 3 is the latest version of Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM that further builds on the Claude 2 model released in July 2023. Claude 3 has 3 separate versions, Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, each with a different level of capability and cost to use. Claude 3 Opus is the highest level and most capable version of Claude 3 that Anthropic claims has set new industry benchmarks across a range of cognitive tasks and has a higher capacity for reasoning that other models on the market today.\nOne of the areas in which Claude 3 excels is the size of the context window which helps to improve the context of responses based on the conversation history. While the original release of Claude was limited to a 100,000 token context window, both Claude 2 and 3 have an expanded context window of up to 200,000 tokens.\nIn real terms, this translates to roughly 500 pages of text, or approximately 150,000 words. For comparison, the standard context limit for GPT-4 is 32K tokens, and both GPT-4o and Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro are limited to 128K tokens. There are several business cases where this large input limit can provide significant gains, such as identifying trends within a large dataset, summarization of long form answers from customer satisfaction surveys, screening job applications based on a given criteria, and helping to iterate upon an idea or design being discussed with Claude 3.\nAs well as its ability to process large datasets, Anthropic claims that Claude 3 Opus, the most expensive tier of Claude 3, is the most intelligent model on the market today, and can has demonstrated some level of awareness based on the tasks given to it. During testing, Alex Albert, one of Anthropic\u2019s prompt engineers, gave Claude 3 Opus a task similar to finding a needle in a haystack by asking it to locate a specific sentence hidden inside a random collection of documents.\nNot only was the model able to find the \u201cneedle\u201d, but Claude 3 Opus also mentioned that the sentence appeared out of place and suggested that it was likely placed there for testing purposes. This demonstrated a surprising level of awareness not usually found within LLMs, although it remains to be seen as to whether this was something akin to true awareness, or if it simply follows the pattern of mimicking human intelligence as most LLMs attempt to do.\nThe creators of Claude, Anthropic, have a very strong foundation on alignment, aiming to Claude a better choice for businesses that are concerned not just about outputs that might damage their brand or company, but also society as a whole.\nHowever, all of this does come at a rather large cost compared to the competition. For those not looking for API access, Anthropic provides a free subscription tier that includes limited access to a chat interface at claude.ai powered by the newly released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, however all 3 models are accessible with higher usage limits by subscribing to the Pro tier.\nBest LLM for chatbots\n5. Qwen\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Qwen-1.5 is an LLM from Alibaba tailored that aims to match or outperform Google\u2019s Gemini and Meta\u2019s Llama models in both cost and capability. As well as a base models, Alibaba have also released a counterpart model tailored for chat scenarios as Qwen-1.5-chat\nSimilar to Llama, Qwen-1.5 is an open-source model that anyone can download for free and install on their own hardware and infrastructure. This makes Qwen-1.5 a very competitive choice for developers, especially those who have limited budgets, as the main costs with getting this model up and running are initial hardware investment and the cost to run and maintain the hardware.\nTo help support developers, Qwen-1.5 offers several different sizes of the model to fit a wide range of devices and hardware configurations. The largest and most capable version of Qwen-1.5 chat currently sits at 72B parameters, while the lightest version is as small as 0.5B. Qwen-1.5 has an input token limit of 32K (the 14B model is limited to 8K), which is a on par with GPT-4 and is significantly larger than the 4096 input token limit of Llama 2.\nAlthough it has the same input limit as GPT-4, Qwen-1.5 has the same output token limit as Google\u2019s Gemini at 8192, which is one of the higher output limits for LLMs on the market today. It should be noted that, like with other models on the market, the capabilities of the model decrease as the parameter size reduces, so keep that in mind when selecting the model size for your specific use case.\nIn benchmarks, Qwen-1.5 consistently outperforms Llama 2 in most scenarios, whilst also achieving competitive results compared to GPT-4. This further increases the attractiveness of Qwen-1.5 as it can offer near GPT-4 levels of capability at a fraction of the cost, and you can fine tune with a custom dataset to tailor the model to your specific usage needs. Plus, as you train the LLM on your own machine, you get to keep hold of your own data.\nIn a customer support scenario, this would provide you with a bot that is far more capable of understanding the issue a customer might have than the more traditional keyword or rule based chatbots commonly seen on the internet today. Qwen-1.5 would then be able to respond intelligently to customer queries based on your knowledgebase to improve first contact resolution rates and escalate more difficult or advanced issues to second line support agents.\nTo further enhance its chat capabilities, Qwen-1.5 can accept and respond in an impressive 35 languages and can offer translation services in over 150 others. Like with other LLMs, the number of tokens for inputs and outputs depend on the language being used as some have a higher token-to-character ratio.\nWhile recommending Qwen-1.5 for chatbots might seem like a bit of a curveball, its important to remember the use case you are applying this LLM to. In the case of a customer support bot, you probably don\u2019t need advanced intelligence allowing users to have the long philosophical conversations that you might with something like GPT-4o as its way out of scope for what you intend to use it for.\nQwen-1.5-7B-chat is available for use today via a web interface over at huggingface.co, while the larger models can be downloaded to run locally.\nBest multimodal LLM\n6. GPT-4o\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpenAI is one of the most recognisable names when it comes to LLMs and is widely known for several models and products released over the last few years, including DALL-E for image generation, and ChatGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\nReleased in May 2024, GPT-4o is the latest offering from OpenAI that extends the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4 Turbo by adding full integration for text, image and audio prompts, while further reducing the cost to users, making it an attractive option for those looking to for a language model that can fill multiple roles. OpenAI claims GPT-4o is twice as fast, half the cost, and has five times the rate limit compared to GPT-4 Turbo.\nOne of most significant enhancements in GPT-4o is Voice Mode, which allows the model to process audio in real time, and output a realistic, tone appropriate response in human sounding voice that might make you question if you are speaking to a real person. The human voice output is certainly impressive when compared to most of the text to speech applications currently on the market and does a fantastic job of imitating how a person might speak in real life by adding inflections and nuances normally heard in regular conversation.\nAdditionally, GPT-4o can utilise a camera to analyze the environment around you to help add context to the responses given. OpenAI demonstrated the Audio Mode and Vision features in a video alongside the release announcement for GPT-4o, however these features are not yet fully available for general usage.\nFull text integration in GPT-4o adds incremental improvements to evaluation and reasoning compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo and offers live translation into 50 different languages. Like with Audio Mode, GPT-4o further improves the ability to recognise context and sentiment from text inputs, and provide accurate summarizations, allowing responses to be more accurate and be presented in the appropriate tone. As with previous versions of GPT, GPT-4o can store and refer to historic conversations and look them up in real time to lend further context to responses.\nOpenAI is already rolling out the text and image features of GPT-4o to ChatGPT. In a first for OpenAI, those using the free tier of ChatGPT will have access to GPT-4o, although in a limited capacity that resets daily, which is a fantastic step given GPT-4 required a paid subscription to use when it launched. Plus subscribers users will have access to message limits up to 5 times higher than before, and an alpha version of Voice Mode will be made available to Plus users in the coming weeks.\nAPI access to the new text and image capabilities of GPT-4o is available for developers to use today, while the new audio and video capabilities will be made available in the API to a select group of partners ahead of a full rollout to the wider audience, however there\u2019s no current announcement for a specific date as to when the new voice and video capabilities will be made available.\nBest LLM for translation\n7. Google Gemini\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Gemini 1.5 is an updated version of the original Gemini LLM released in December 2023 that offers improved capabilities and performance compared to the original. As of May 2024, there are 2 versions of Gemini 1.5 available to subscribers \u2013 Pro and Flash.\nWhile Gemini doesn\u2019t appear to directly translate text itself, the translations provided are a combination of the translations provided by Google Translate, the multilingual training data Gemini has access to, and the LLM capabilities of Gemini, to produce a more fluent and natural sounding output.\nThis results in translations that flow better, make more contextual sense, and are less awkward than the more literal translations typically offered by Google Translate on its own, resulting in a much better overall translation. This combined approach means that Gemini 1.5 can be used to translate any language currently available via Google Translate, however the level to which Gemini 1.5 is able to enhance the output to improve how fluent and natural sounding it is does depend on the level of multilingual training data available to the model for each individual language \u2013 though this is a similar limitation that other LLMs also have.\nWhile other LLMs, such as and GPT-4o, also provide some translation capabilities, one of the key areas that Gemini 1.5 has an advantage is cost. Costs can quickly mount up if large quantities of text need to be translated, so being able to translate quickly and cheaply is an incredibly important factor. While GPT-4o has demonstrated some impressive translation capabilities of its own, also costs $15 per 1 million output tokens for text output.\nBy comparison, Gemini 1.5 costs only $2 per 1 million, which is significantly cheaper. An important thing to note when translating large quantities of text is that while Gemini 1.5 can accept up to 1 million input tokens at a time, output is currently limited to only 8192 tokens. The number of tokens required for an output will heavily depend on the target language for the translation, with some languages having higher token-to-character ratios than others.\nExceeding this limit can result in error messages, or truncation that leaves your translation incomplete. To obtain translations that require an output larger than the token limit, you\u2019ll need to break down your requests into smaller chunks. While 8192 tokens per response might seem quite low when considering it equates to around 6000 words, GPT-4o is currently limited to 2048 output tokens per response.\nGemini 1.5 Pro is free to use with some limitations, though a subscription is required for access to the increased 1m input token limit and higher rate limits.\nHow to choose the best Large Language Model\nEssentially it comes down to bang for buck. ChatGPT-4o is brilliant and can do pretty much what all the others can but at a cost. Claude 3, while not trained specifically for coding like Copilot also has a good reputation for creating code. Another thing to consider is access to your data and who owns what. You can train your own chatbot with OpenAI by creating an assistant but at the end of the day that stays with OpenAI. If you use an open model you can keep hold of your data and completely own your own trained model.\nBest Large Language Model FAQs\nWhat are Token limits?\nToken limits are a restriction LLMs have based on the number of tokens they are able to process in a single interaction. Without limits, or by having limits too large, the performance of an LLM can be affected, resulting in slow response times. However, if the limit is set too low then the LLM may struggle to generate the desired output. If an output limit is exceeded, the LLM may truncate an output, leaving it incomplete, attempt to reduce the size of the output by providing a less detailed output, or could simply generate an error. Some LLMs have the ability to segment responses to overcome output limits, but this isn\u2019t a universal feature for all LLMs.\nWhat is a rate limit?\nA rate limit is the number of requests that a user can make over a given period of time, often in minutes, hours or days. Rate limits are usually imposed by providers to help reduce the load on infrastructure so they can continue to provide an optimal service level. Rate limits are usually defined within the subscription tier for each product, with more expensive tiers offering increased rate limits.\nRate limits for your chosen LLM will vary depending on the provider, so consult their pricing sheets to determine which tier offers the best value for your needs.\nHow to use a local LLM / Open source LLM\nUnlike providers such as OpenAI and Google which use subscriptions to provide access to their LLMs, and are hosted on their own infrastructure, individuals and enterprises can download open source LLMs and deploy them to their own infrastructure.\nUsers have the option to deploy the model to existing hardware they already own, or purchase cloud compute or VPS instances to provide increased performance if greater capability is required.\nFor enterprises, this can present a cost effective way of incorporating an LLM into their business, while keeping costs lower and reducing privacy and data security concerns by keeping information in house rather than submitting it to a third party.\nWhat are tokens?\nLLMs don't break up language into individual words. Instead, they break language into chunks of text. These chunks can be individual characters or phrases of multiple words . These chunks of text are called tokens.\nWhen you use an LLM through an API you are paying for the amount of tokens used. For multimodal LLMs it's slightly different. The amount of effort to take an image as an input is converted to an amount of tokens. So, while it is not measuring tokens, you are still charged tokens.\nSo, tokens can be seen as a unit of currency exchanged for work done by an LLM and also a unit representing an amount of text. The general rule to estimate how many tokens a prompt will use is 1 token = 4 characters. For example, \u201cMay the force be with you\u201d contains 25 characters and would require ~6 tokens. However, this is only an estimate, and using inputs in other languages could require more tokens for the same input.\nYou\u2019ll need to consult the documentation of your LLM of choice to learn more about how their specific Tokenizer works.\nWhat is an LLM?\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is form of artificial intelligence trained using massive sets of data to allow the model to recognize and generate text across a wide range of tasks. LLMs are build upon machine learning concepts using a type of neural network known as a Transformer Model.\nMore advanced LLMs are also capable of accepting and outputting images, videos and audio as inputs for the model to recognize. These models are known as a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nHow we tested the best LLMs\nTo test for the best LLMs we first set up an account with the relevant platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each LLM to see how useful its basic features were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best encrypted messaging app for Android of 2025\nThe best Android encrypted messaging apps keep your messages private\nIt\u2019s never a bad idea to keep your communications private, so we\u2019ve listed the best Android encrypted messaging apps to ensure your conversations stay between you and your friends and family, and away from any threat actors who could exploit your information. By testing these apps, our experts have determined the top choices for safeguarding your chats.\nThese secure communications platforms use encryption software, which scrambles your information into an unreadable form and protects your messages from unauthorized access. You can protect your professional information too by taking a look at our team\u2019s picks for the best secure email provider for additional peace of mind.\nUS authorities recently warned that all US citizens should be using encrypted services to protect against foreign attackers, after a string of high profile intrusions on even the most theoretically secure firms like the FBI and CISA networks, which have proved that everyone should be concerned about the safety of their information.\nTo help make this choice easy, our team has tested these apps to evaluate the encryption algorithms used and the privacy policies of the respective companies, as well as the ease of use and additional services they all offer.\nWe've also featured the best privacy tools and anonymous browsers.\nBest encrypted messaging apps for Android of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest encrypted messaging app for Android overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nYou're no doubt already familiar with WhatsApp as one of the best messaging apps out there, but you might not have realized that it offers end-to-end encryption for your messages \u2013 in fact, it uses the super-strong encryption protocol developed by Signal.\nThere's very little that WhatsApp can't do. As well as the standard text-based conversations, it's able to handle video calls, group chats, location sharing, and the transferring of files of various types. You can ping a lot of people at once with the Broadcast feature, leave voice memos, and more besides.\nWhatsApp's immense popularity works in its favor as well, because the chances are that the people in your contacts list already have it installed to keep in touch with friends and family. All those chats are fully encrypted by default \u2013 there's no way to turn this off.\nWhat might give you pause when it comes to using this app is that it is, of course, owned by Facebook, which means you're contributing to the data collection practices of the world's biggest social network. Facebook can't read your messages (the end-to-end encryption prevents that), but it can log other data about you for marketing purposes, like the location of your phone.\nRead our full Whatsapp review.\nBest encrypted messaging app for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSignal is widely regarded as the gold standard of encrypted messaging apps, not least because its encryption engine is open source and available for anyone to inspect. That doesn't make it any easier to hack, but it does mean there are a lot more pairs of eyes looking at the robustness of the encryption methods.\nBesides the industry-leading encryption on offer here, the app itself is fairly plain and basic in terms of visuals and appearance. It does support group chats though, as well as the sending of files and photos in addition to text, so you're going to be pretty well covered no matter what your needs.\nSignal can replace the default SMS app if you want it to, but basic SMS texts aren't encrypted \u2013 you and the person you're chatting with both need to have Signal installed for the encryption feature to function properly, otherwise Signal doesn't have enough control over both ends of the conversation.\nThe app also includes several other useful features on top of the tight security, such as video calling, and disappearing messages that vanish after a certain time period (perfect for those conversations you don't want to stay on the record).\nRead our full Signal review.\nBest encrypted messaging app for performance\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTelegram is almost as well-respected as Signal is, although its encryption methods aren't open source and thus haven't been as well audited by third-party security experts. What it does have in its favor is a slicker interface, if that's important to you.\nAnother caveat about Telegram is that end-to-end encryption isn't enabled by default, so you need to make sure the Secret mode is activated before you can be sure that no one else is going to tap into your communications. Other types of chat and file transfer are encrypted, but only for part of their journey to other parties.\nThose issues aside, Telegram impresses in most areas, with features like chat backups and disappearing messages (messages with expiry times attached). You can load up group chats, make video calls and more, and in use it's just as responsive and intuitive as the other messaging apps out there.\nIf you need all the bells and whistles of an instant messenger, like stickers and audio memos, and even a basic photo editor and best free video editing software, Telegram is a solid choice. Just be sure to enable the Secret mode for the most secure messaging.\nRead our full Telegram review.\nBest encrypted messaging app for anonymous messaging\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThreema is another secure messaging app that aims to keep your data out of the hands of corporations and governments. The app can be used anonymously, and it's not just messages but also phone calls that can be securely encrypted.\nWhile secure connections are the mainstay of many messengers, Threema goes one further by ensuring no contact details are saved on their servers, and any messaging data that goes through them is immediately deleted once sent.\nThe result is that local files remain on your phone, rather than in the open on third-party servers where the information could be intercepted by hackers or data-collection agencies.\nFor all its security considerations, Threema is still a fully-functional messaging app, that allows you to send images, files, videos, and locations, as well as create groups and set up polls among trusted users.\nThere's no need to sign in with an email or other personally identifiable information, reducing the amount of data required to use it. All in all, Threema offers a very secure experience with security and anonymity in mind.\nRead our full Threema review.\nWe've also featured the best mobile payment apps.\nBest encrypted messaging app for Android FAQs\nWhat is encryption?\nEncryption refers to the process of scrambling data into an unreadable form, which protects from unauthorized third-party access. Encryption services use different algorithms to render the messages unreadable, and only someone who knows exactly which algorithm you use, and exactly how it's set up, would be able to restore the original form of the messages. In real terms, encryption means that no intruders can see your information.\nWhy do you need an encrypted messaging app?\nTech and privacy experts have long recommended encryption and privacy tools in securing data, and have welcomed US authorities\u2019 advocacy for encryption communication software. Now more than ever, with seemingly constant threats from foreign actors, experts are urging citizens to switch to encrypted communication services.\nWhich encrypted messaging app is best for you?\nWhen considering which messaging app to use for encrypted communications, you should consider what you need from the app. If you need more advanced encryption tools, or send particularly sensitive messages, then you may find that the more privacy focused platforms fit your needs best. But, if you want a more basic option, then the free options with easy to navigate user interfaces might be more suitable.\nHow we tested the best encrypted messaging app\nOur team set up accounts for each of the relevant software platforms, and then tested the services to see how well the platforms performed when accessed through different devices, as well as testing out any additional tools available. The team made sure to make use of all advanced features to assess the platform's performance, as well as how useful the tools were, and how easy it was to understand the more advanced features.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "I\u2019m an AI expert and this is why strong ethical standards are the only way to make AI successful\nBias in AI is a complex issue, but not an unsolvable one\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) touches virtually every industry, but it\u2019s become a foundational element in today\u2019s customer experience (CX) strategies. Contact centers, customer support platforms, and digital engagement tools rely on AI to enable faster response times, more personalized interactions, and to uncover valuable insights from massive amounts of customer data. Conversational AI, real-time voice analytics, and intelligent routing are just a few of the innovations transforming how organizations connect with their customers.\nWhile there are plenty of benefits to AI, one thing remains true: AI will never be entirely free from bias. This is because AI is only as accurate as the data it was trained on - which is ultimately created, trained, and maintained by humans - humans, who unconsciously bring their own assumptions and blind spots into the AI systems they build.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean AI can\u2019t be trustworthy, responsible or fair. It simply means organizations need to implement strong guardrails and standards for monitoring and refining AI models to ensure fairness, inclusion, and neutrality. Mitigating bias is essential across industries, but is especially important in CX - not just for stronger performance and efficiency, but to build and maintain long-term customer trust and regulatory compliance.\nPresident and Head of Applications for Vonage.\nReducing AI bias improves agent performance and efficiency\nWhen using AI to automate customer service tasks or assist human agents, even the smallest of biases in data can lead to low-quality experiences. For example, speech recognition tools might struggle to understand different accents and dialects, leading to frustrating customer experiences. Sentiment analysis might misread emotional cues, resulting in inaccurate responses or escalation to the wrong agent. Intelligent routing workflows can unintentionally prioritize certain customer profiles over others if historical training data skews unfairly.\nThese inconsistencies don\u2019t just impact customers, but agents as well. Human agents may have to step in more often to correct AI mishaps or hallucinations, increasing their cognitive workload and decreasing employee morale, reducing the overall efficiency that AI-powered tools promise to deliver. Additionally, it decreases trust in the technology for agents, potentially leading to negative perceptions of how AI is used and how it is impacting their work.\nTo address these challenges, organizations need to start by using diverse datasets to train AI models and ensure they can adapt to evolving inputs. From there, constantly auditing and refining data allows organizations to weed out biases before they creep into outputs, ensuring more fair, accurate results. Additionally, monitoring real-time customer feedback across multiple channels gives organizations a strong idea of where customer frustrations are occurring and allows them to take another look at the data feeding those interactions.\nEthical AI builds customer loyalty and supports compliance\nToday\u2019s consumers are more tech-savvy and privacy-conscious than ever. While recent data shows that more than half of consumers say AI alone doesn\u2019t negatively impact their trust, how customer data is used with it can.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOrganizations can address these concerns by adopting privacy-first principles to maintain trust and show commitment to responsible AI practices. Taking steps like encrypting sensitive data, restricting access through strong identity controls, and anonymizing customer data used in AI training models are great examples of a privacy-first approach. Transcripts, voice recordings, and behavior patterns must be handled with care - not just to build trust, but to comply with privacy laws like the GDPR, CCPA and the EU AI Act.\nTransparency with consumers is equally as important, especially as it relates to how and what data is collected. Giving customers control over their data, ensuring transparent AI governance, clearly disclosing the use of AI chatbots or tools, and providing seamless escalation to human agents when needed, fosters a sense of trust among customers. Organizations that share how AI is used and decisions are made are likely to earn long-term customer loyalty.\nWhat is easily forgotten is that there is an entire industry segment called Workforce Engagement Management and part of that is coaching agents and getting customer feedback. The ethics of best practice are already in place. Whether it is a virtual agent or a real agent, the principle of improving and compliance still applies. What AI can bring is that the time between the potential error and the review of that mistake can be almost instantaneous. We can also use AI to check AI and compare the ethical answer with the actual answer. Just make your AI agents trainable as you would with your human agents.\nResponsible AI enables responsible innovation\nAI-driven innovation seems to move at the speed of light, but innovation doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of responsibility. Unsurprisingly, the most forward-thinking organizations are those that embed ethical principles into the innovation process from day one. Achieving this means fostering open collaboration between developers, data scientists, business stakeholders, and IT teams to ensure that both innovation and security are balanced.\nEstablishing a clear AI governance framework or roadmap helps align stakeholders around a clear vision for ethical AI. When standards and processes are both clearly defined and consistently applied, organizations can scale innovation more responsibly and confidently.\nBias in AI is a complex issue that nearly every organization has or will face - but it\u2019s not an unsolvable one. Feeding diverse datasets into AI training models and then consistently auditing the data helps to mitigate bias. While truly bias-free AI may be difficult to achieve, understanding the challenges and continuously working to limit bias leads to stronger customer loyalty, enhanced compliance, and more opportunities to innovate at scale.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Rosetta Stone\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt wasn't so long ago when learning a language at home meant buying a series of CDs from Rosetta Stone. Today, there's the Rosetta Stone app, which offers instruction for 25 languages.\nYou'll first notice Rosetta Stone relies heavily on immersion to teach new languages. Through interactive activities, audio from native speakers, and concepts based on real-world scenarios, it wants you to come out of this being able to communicate in a second language thoroughly. Its methods work \u2014 assuming you're dedicated to spending a great deal of time with the app. Too many difficult lessons (even at the basic levels) quickly challenge that dedication.\nAnd yet, there's much to love here, from its intuitive interface to its thoroughness. One word of caution: some lessons are more repetitive than others, which gets annoying, depending on your mood.\nBest language learning app experience\n3. Babbel\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith more than 150 language experts working behind the scenes, Babbel is one of the most popular language-learning programs. Ease of use is one of the reasons for this popularity. Overall, the app does a terrific job of providing a traditional online learning experience with fresh approaches sprinkled in.\nBefore any course begins, Babbel wants to get a handle on why you want to learn a new language and whether you're already familiar with it. Then, through a series of questions, the service also wants to know how much time you are willing to commit to learning the new language.\nYou can purchase a Babbel subscription for one-, three-, six-, or 12-months, and there's also a Lifetime package available when signing up through the Babbel website online. The more months you buy, the better the discount, and subscriptions overall cost less when purchased online. Subscriptions include unlimited access to hundreds of lessons at different skills levels. In addition, with Babbel Live, you can attend live virtual classes. Additional options include original podcasts, games, and more.\nBabbel is compatible with Android, iOS, and Mac; it supports 13 languages.\nBest language learning app for immersion\n4. Memrise\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMemrise uses videos featuring native speakers to teach users new languages. It's practical and puts a new twist on creating an immersive learning experience. As its name suggests, the app uses memory techniques to teach you different words or phrases over time, mainly by using flashcards.\nLike other apps on this list, Memrise is free to use and works very well at that level. However, by purchasing a subscription, new features are unlocked. You can choose a monthly or yearly subscription or go bold and get a lifetime pass. Each subscription opens the door to unlimited lessons. Otherwise, you can only take a few classes each day.\nOverall, Memrise is fun to use and easy to pick up. And yet, it doesn't feel nearly as complete as other options on the list.\nThis app is offered on Android and iOS devices and covers 23 languages.\nBest language learning app for vocabulary\n5. Drops\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVisual learners will appreciate Drops and its bright and colorful layout similar to Duolingo. Through a series of lessons, you learn a new language by matching objects and words using sounds and written text.\nAlthough Drops is free, a premium membership might be the way to go if you aren't the type of person who likes to wait. As lessons are completed, you must wait 10 hours before being allowed to complete another one \u2014 unless you upgrade to premium.\nThe Drops app is terrific at teaching you vocabulary in different languages. But unfortunately, it's not the app to use if you want to gain conversation skills or grammar. So if those are your goals, pick another option on this list.\nThe Drops app is available for Android and iOS and covers more than 45 languages. With a Drops premium account, you get unlimited playtime, offline access, no more ads, and more.\nBest language learning app for basics\n6. Mondly\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMondly uses audio, translations, and fun images to present a practical language learning approach. Continuing with a familiar theme, the app is bright and colorful in such a way you can't help but smile while learning new words and phrases.\nAlthough Mondly does allow you to learn a limited number of terms each day, I don't recommend it. Instead, unlock all the features with a premium membership. Watch for special deals online. Don't pay the regular price.\nWith Mondly, you can learn 41 languages across multiple platforms. If you are beginning with a language, Mondly does a great job. However, its overall content is lacking at more advanced levels.\nBest language learning app for audio\n7. Pimsleur\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPimsleur provides auditory lessons for 51 languages. Each class is about 30 minutes and designed for an easy download, making it a terrific learning tool for anyone who spends a lot of time on the road. You can also listen to lessons via Amazon Echo.\nEach lesson is designed to teach you a valuable skill. For example, you might learn polite phrases, numbers, or survival skills when learning Italian. After each lesson, you can practice using flashcards, matches, and other mini-games.\nThere's no free version of Pimsleur. Instead, after enjoying a free seven-day trial, you'll need to decide whether to purchase an audio-only or premium membership.\nYou can find Pimsleur on Android, iOS, PC, and Mac.\nBest language learning app for deadlines\n8. Busuu\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor those who must learn a language by a specific date, Busuu is the one for you. After you answer a series of questions, it will suggest a learning and study program that meets your goals. Ultimately, you get to decide the pace of your learning. Each lesson is valuable and enjoyable; at no time will you feel bored.\nWith a free Busuu account, you can learn one language. With a premium account, your one language gets enhanced by a personalized study plan and feedback from native speakers. A premium plus account unlocks every Bususs feature, including access to up to 12 languages, offline mode, grammar lessons, etc.\nYou can find Busuu on iOS and Android.\nBest language learning app for music\n9. Lirica\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor something completely different, consider Lirica. The impressive app combines culture and modern music (and music videos) to teach German, Spanish, or English. The app focuses on vocabulary and grammar and provides lessons for newbies to intermediate students.\nDespite its engaging premise, Lirica's biggest problem is what it doesn't offer \u2014 lots of languages. And yet, for the languages that are covered, expect a fun experience worth considering.\nLirica is free to try for seven days. After that, a relatively low-priced membership unlocks all features. The app is available on iOS and Android.\nBest language learning app FAQs\nWhen deciding which language learning app to use, first consider what your skill level is, as many apps presume you're a complete beginner. Therefore if you're an advanced user looking to brush up and improve on their language learning skills then make sure you check that there's an option in the app to cater to your higher skill level.\nHow we tested the best language learning app\nTo test for the best language learning apps we first set up an account with the relevant app provider. We then set it up and tested it to see how well it could be used for a range of different skill levels. The aim was to explore each app to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best AI chatbot for business of 2025\nSupport your customers with AI\nWe list the best AI chatbots for business, to make it simple and easy to provide online support for customers and staff using AI chatbots.\nArtificial intelligence is one of the greatest technological developments of this century. You may have heard of ChatGPT, the famous artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, an American software company. ChatGPT was released in November 2022 and amassed millions of users in a short while. It\u2019s arguably the most famous AI product, but many chatbots have existed before it, including those built for businesses.\nAI chatbots are an innovative customer support solution for businesses. They don\u2019t replace human support but instead, help solve simple issues, while human support representatives focus on the more complex issues.\nThere are many AI chatbot platforms you can adopt for your business. These platforms take away the stress involved in setting up your chatbot to interact with customers. They take care of the complex technical aspects of running a chatbot, while you focus on the simpler things. They save a lot of money compared to hiring developers to train and build your own chatbot.\nWe tested different AI chatbot platforms to identify the best ones for businesses. We considered essential factors including speed, scalability, third-party integrations, and ease of use. They each have their pros and cons but, overall, are the best chatbots you can adopt for your business.\nWe also listed the best live chat software.\nThe best AI chatbot for business of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest AI chatbot for ease of use\n1. Botsify\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBotsify is another simple-to-use AI chatbot platform. Its main proposition is for businesses to build customer support bots or bots to automate their sales processes. This platform supports translation to over 100 languages, so you can create bots to interact with customers from all across the globe.\nYou can embed the chatbots you create via Botsify on your website or connect them to your Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, or Telegram business account. You can display call-to-action buttons within the bots to convert users into paying customers; remember that making a purchase as seamless as possible will help boost your revenue.\nYou can collect contact information via your bots and automatically store them. You can let customers book meetings and purchase products via the bots. There are endless applications.\nBotsify is relatively affordable. It starts at $49 per month for unlimited conversations but with a limit of 5k users. A higher plan costs $149 per month and supports unlimited users and conversations. There\u2019s no free version, but you can take advantage of the 14-day free trial to test Botsify\u2019s features before making your final decision.\nBest AI chatbot for customer support\n2. Intercom\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntercom is a software company specializing in customer support and business messaging tools. One of its main products is a tool that lets businesses develop chatbots powered by artificial intelligence.\nYou can use Intercom's chatbot tool to develop bots without writing a single line of code. Intercom is a customer support platform, so the main use case for its chatbot tool is building customer support bots. You can define keywords and automatic responses for the bots to give to customers. This platform incorporates artificial intelligence, so it speaks in a conversational tone that customers would like.\nSimilarly, you can use Intercom bots to interact with potential customers and collect lead information from them. This platform lets you automate simple business conversations and frees up time to focus on the more complex ones.\nIntercom's pricing strategy isn't straightforward. The price you'll pay depends on several factors including the number of chatbots and the volume of conversations. Customer reviews often note that the platform is expensive.\nBest AI chatbot for social media\n3. Chatfuel\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nChatfuel is an AI chatbot platform with a simple proposition; build bots to interact with customers and embed them on your website or social media pages. The platform gives you a collection of pre-built chatbot templates that you can use as the foundation for yours. You can find templates across different categories; real estate, restaurant, e-commerce, healthcare, beauty, etc.\nYou can pick any template and edit it to fit your tastes. If you have the time and skills, you\u2019re free to create your own chatbot from scratch on Chatfuel.\nChatfuel lets you create chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes. You can define keywords for questions you expect your customer to ask and provide automated answers. If your bot notices the keywords, then it\u2019ll reply just the way you instructed it to. If the bot doesn\u2019t understand the question, it can forward the message to a human to take it further.\nAfter creating a Chatfuel bot, you can embed it on your website. Alternatively, you can connect it to your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp business pages, and customers can interact with the bot on these platforms.\nChatfuel is relatively affordable, with plans starting from $15 per month for 500 conversations.\nBest AI chatbot for WhatsApp\n4. Landbot\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLandbot offers a no-code chatbot builder that anyone can use. You can create bots without writing code but, instead, use conditional logic. Landbot already gives you a collection of pre-built templates that you can edit to create your chatbot. These templates take away a lot of the stress that would come from creating your own bot from scratch.\nYou can deploy your Landbot chatbot on your website or WhatsApp business page. Landbot has extensive integration with WhatsApp, making it easy for customers to converse with your business on the messaging platform they know best. It supports over 60 languages, so you can connect with customers across the globe.\nLandbot doesn\u2019t have integration with other social platforms apart from WhatsApp, which puts it at a disadvantage. We also observed complaints of the company\u2019s customer support being lax and needing improvement.\nBest AI chatbot for advanced features\n5. Kore.ai\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKore.ai is a popular conversational AI platform. It gives businesses a platform to build advanced chatbots to interact with customers. The Kore.ai bot builder lets you build chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes that only people with advanced technical skills can understand.\nYou can build your custom virtual assistant via a drag-and-drop interface as if you're using a website builder. Kore.ai has a built-in conversation designer that enables your chatbot to mimic human-like tones. It generates automated replies based on previous conversations, and you can make final tweaks before deploying the chatbot. During development, you can always test your chatbot via a mock screen to see how it'll work with end users.\nYou can brand your virtual assistant to make it look professional. You can add your logos and images and change the design to fit the colors of your brand.\nA drawback of using this platform is its high costs. It starts at 20 cents per conversation, plus 10 cents per conversation for pre-built apps, and 4 cents per minute for voice automation. This can add up to a significant amount if you have many customers that\u2019ll need support at some point.\nWe've listed the best help desk software.\nBest AI chatbot for business FAQs\nHow to choose an AI chatbot\nCost\nCost is the first consideration when adopting any software. High-quality AI chatbots aren\u2019t usually cheap but you can shop for the most affordable solution depending on your budget. This ensures you don\u2019t run into future pricing problems that\u2019ll disrupt your business.\nChannel support\nWhat channels does your AI chatbot support? Most chatbots will be embeddable on your website, but that\u2019s not the only needed channel. How about your social media pages? Does it integrate with Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and other popular social media platforms? Does it integrate with SMS? A good chatbot should support many communication channels.\nEase of use\nIt should be easy to navigate the platform when building your chatbot. It should have an interactive web-based tool for designing and setting parameters for the chatbot. If you're not satisfied with what you've created, you should be able to restart the development process and build on previously developed components.\nSpeed (response time)\nWe can\u2019t overstate the importance of response time for a chatbot. Customers don\u2019t have time to waste, so your chatbot must respond to them as quickly as possible. It shouldn\u2019t just respond quickly in vain but should provide relevant answers to their questions.\nWhat are the essential features of an AI chatbot?\nConversational tone\nThe chatbot should speak in a conversational tone with users. It should sound as human-like as possible instead of a robot giving bland answers. A conversational tone encourages people to continue communicating with the chatbot to get their needed answers instead of requesting human support immediately.\nAccuracy\nThe chatbot should give accurate information when prompted. Giving wrong answers will make your customers frustrated and abandon the conversation. Ideally, the chatbot should recognize when it can\u2019t provide an accurate answer to questions and forward the conversation to a human support representative who can do that.\nAnalytics\nYou should be able to analyze how customers are interacting with the chatbot and identify what needs improvements. What is the most popular question? What topics did users engage with that made them frequently ask for a human agent? What percentage of people interact with the bot from their PC or mobile? Etc.\nThird-party integration\nThe bot should have integrations with third-party enterprise software tools. For example, you can integrate your bot with the Microsoft Teams video-conferencing software to enable people to interact with it while on calls or integrate the bot with Slack so that people can talk to it within the app.\nHow we tested the best AI chatbot for business\nTo test for the best AI chatbot for business we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the chatbot could be used in a range of different situations. The aim was to push each AI chatbot to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best online learning platform of 2025\nVirtual Learning Environments (VLE) and Learning Management Systems (LMS) ranked and reviewed\nWe list the best online learning platforms, to make it simple and easy to manage online courses using a VLE or LMS.\nLearning Management Systems (LMS) and Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) have become increasingly common, especially due to sweeping changes that became necessary due to the pandemic.\nWhile face-to-face learning has a place, increasingly learning and courses are being conducted through digital channels. This can be both cheaper and easier to manage for businesses, and for educators it means the ability to reach people from a distance.\nIn a remote situation is where online learning platforms really come to the fore, as platforms for education make the most of modern technology. That\u2019s not to say traditional means of education are about to be extinct, but academic institutions and businesses have identified that we can achieve plenty more through tech, such as smartphones and other internet-connected devices which can facilitate learning from any location.\nOnline learning also has its advantages for people who might not easily be able to access face-to-face learning. This can be especially relevant in remote areas, but also for people with disabilities whose mobility issues might prevent attending college or similar.\nWhen comparing the different online learning platforms, we looked at what operating systems they were available on (Android and iOS), the app interface, integration with third-party software, and the overall quality. We also assessed the pricing plans and what kind of users each learning platform would be best suited for, among other things.\nBelow we list what we think are the best online learning platforms currently available.\nWe've also featured the best online class sites.\nReader offer: 7 day free trial on Adobe Captivate\nAdobe Captivate is a premier platform for crafting educational content, integrating various media sources such as images, screen captures, and PowerPoint presentations. Try it for yourself.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best online learning platforms of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest open source online learning platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile commercial software has its place, sometimes it is truly impressive what an open source project can achieve, such as in the case of Moodle LMS. This open source learning platform can be downloaded and used for free. While direct support is lacking (although an organization can engage one of 80 Certified Service Providers to remedy that deficit), there is still plenty here, including documentation such as guides on how to use this platform.\nLearners and teachers are sure to like the expansive feature set, such as interaction with multiple choice questions in the content, an integrated text editor, and support for 3rd party cloud storage providers, such as DropBox to submit assignments. It is also multi-language capable, and supports open standards such as SCORM.\nWe also like that teachers can make comments on assignments, and the integrated all-in-one calendar. With so many features, it may be open source, but it hardly will feel like it, which explains why it has over 200 million users.\nRead our full Moodle LMS review.\nBest online learning platform for projects\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAdobe Captivate is a professional platform for creating learning content. This can be incorporated from a variety of sources, including images that this software can edit, screen captures that can be done automatically, and by importing PowerPoint presentations.\nWe are impressed with the support for VR projects, and users are sure to like the choice of acquisition options along with its use of templates to streamline project production, and provide consistency. Users do have issues with the stability of the app, the limited options for direct support and the cancellation fee for the monthly plan will undoubtedly irk some out there.\nQuibbles aside, Adobe Captivate is a mature piece of software that has endured with good reason, and is well worth a closer look via the 30-day trial that is longer than most of its competitors.\nRead our full Adobe Captivate review.\nBest online learning platform for pricing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor those that are looking for some upfront pricing, Acorn LMS- unlike some of its competition- answers that need. Rather than keeping potential users in the dark, Acorn LMS is upfront offering both a tier without content and another with content The company also offers a flat fee for the first 100 users and an additional student fee for each user thereafter.\nBeyond that, this platform has a number of strengths that impress us, such as the ability to make individualized student pathways via LinkedIn Learning content, the white label approach to foster customization of the site for consistent branding at an organization, and support for multiple tendencies allowing an administrator to easily manage multiple acorn LMS accounts via a single set of sign on credentials.\nWhile nothing is perfect, and we should point out the lack of an Android app in the Google Play Store, the dearth of user reviews, and that there are no advanced support options such as a forum or a FAQ, overall it is an attractive package worth the 60-day free trial.\nRead our full Acorn LMS review.\nBest online learning platform for integrations\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Canvas LMS is used by top institutions worldwide, and it can boast it has over 6 million users with an over 90% satisfaction rate. Users are sure to be impressed that it integrates well with popular apps that students use, such as those from Adobe, Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams.\nWe also like the robust community forum, with thorough answers for common user issues, and the multiple communication options covering the spectrum from messaging (individually and as a group), to audio, and video. Some areas we would like to see improved would be support for gamification, and some transparency in the pricing. Teachers will also be pleased to see the support for automated grading via integration with SpeedGrader. While the opaque pricing is frustrating, we appreciate both the free 30 day trial, and also the lowest \u2018Teacher Tier\u2019 plan that is free long term for both teachers and students to allow for education of all.\nRead our full Canvas LMS review.\nBest online learning platform for Google\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Classroom offers a cloud based learning environment to enable remote education for learners from pre-K through the university level. We appreciate that it pulls together a number of Google tools, such as Google Meet, Google Drive and Google Docs all in one place to enable learning.\nTeachers can put in assignments as all types of documents, including .doc and .pdfs, students get the notification, complete the assignment and submit it. Teachers then grade the assignment, keep a virtual gradebook and can give classroom style lectures via the Google Meet function.\nGoogle offers this via several tiers of features, but we can appreciate that the free tier is plenty powerful for budget conscious school districts. The platform is also cross platform to allow learners to function with it with whatever their device of choice is, including laptops, Chromebooks, and both smartphone platforms- although the Android one garners complaints from the users.\nRead our full Google Classroom review.\nBest online learning platform for entrepreneurs\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThinkific is an online platform that has enjoyed meteoritic success as a relative newcomer to this space. It has useful functions, such as the ability for educators to build a website, and templates are provided to facilitate this for newcomers.\nWe also like that this platform can be used to issue certificates of completion. It is used worldwide, and can accept payments from learners signing up for courses from over 100 countries.\nSome omissions, such as the lack of a direct phone number or email for support, and no smartphone apps for either Android or iOS show the immaturity of the platform. We also wanted to see more user reviews than what we found online. However, with a choice of tiers starting with a free one, and a track record that has already earned its experts over $650 million dollars, it is seriously hard to dispute.\nRead our full Thinkific LMS review.\nBest online learning platform for streamlining\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n360Learning meets the challenge head on of streamlining the task of project creation. Users are sure to benefit from the integrated tools such as the video editing software, the included templates that are branded as \u2018Cheat Sheets,\u2019 and the option to include ten different types of questions to test learners.\nWe also appreciate the free 30-day trial without credit card info, and the choice of tiered plans. However, we were less impressed that there are few options for direct contact, with some features reserved for the top plan (like support for course attachments), and that the Android app has a significantly lower rating than the iOS version. We also like the \u2018Collaborative Authoring\u2019 approach that lets even inexperienced users create a course in minutes, rather than months.\nRead our full 360Learning review.\nBest online learning platform for training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\niSpring Learn is one of the most popular learning management systems (LMS) and is mostly used by corporations to train their employees. It makes it easy to prepare and deliver educational content for corporate trainees. You can start with the content you already have, e.g., upload your PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, audio tracks, and video tutorials to the platform. This platform doesn\u2019t impose limits on the size or number of files you can host.\nOne of the best things about this platform is its interactivity. You can use it to put together engaging educational content complete with illustrations, quotes, videos, etc. For example, you can divide your long articles into chapters so that users can explore the material step-by-step. If you wish, you can restrict navigation such that the user can not proceed to the next material without completing the initial one. You can also add self-test questions throughout the content to help users understand and retain information as they proceed through the course.\nThis platform has a customizable design, so you can design your courses with the colors and fonts that are part of your corporate brand. There\u2019s also direct integration with iSpring Suite, a tool that works within PowerPoint and lets you quickly develop quizzes, interactions, and simulations.\niSpring Learn doesn\u2019t just let you build courses. It also gives you analytics to track how trainees are interacting with your courses and their progress. This platform is ideal for companies looking for a solution to deliver corporate training to their employees.\nRead our full iSpring Learn review.\nAlso see:\nIf you're interested in studying more online, we've also featured the best courses in:\nBest online learning platform FAQs\nWhat is an online learning platform?\nIt is simply a platform that is designed to offer students or trainees everything they need for their education in one place. It allows them to access course materials and interact with other students. It also makes it easy for tutors to monitor student progress.\nOnline learning platforms are mostly used by schools, colleges, and other educational institutions. However, it is also used by other types of customers, such as corporations that want to deliver training materials to their staff. You can use such platforms to create lectures, assignments, quizzes, etc., and issue certificates to people that complete the course.\nWhich online learning platforms are best for you?\nThe first thing to consider when you want to choose an online learning platform is your technical competency. If you have not used an LMS system before, it's better to start with a basic platform before migrating to a complex one such as Moodle. This gives you more chances to understand the platform you are using and maximize its features. Advanced LMS systems offer more features but are of no use if you can find it difficult to use them. A more basic tool will get you acquainted with the intricacies of a learning management system before switching to a complex one.\nThe size of your trainees or students also matters. If you\u2019re tutoring just a few dozen people, it\u2019s better to choose a basic platform that is easier to manage. On the other hand, if you have hundreds to thousands of students, a more advanced platform such as Moodle is better.\nOnline learning platforms vs Learning Management Systems\nThere are three main categories of online learning platforms; open-source, free, and paid. Open-source refers to platforms where the source code is freely available for modification. Thus, anyone with sufficient programming skills can tweak the software to get just exactly what they want out of it. Moodle is currently the most popular open-source learning platform and is used by many colleges, schools, and companies.\nAn open-source learning system is free to use and can be customized extensively. For example, you can use your organization's logo and its unique colors to make the platform feel familiar to users. Open-source systems are also very scalable, so you can start small and expand the platform as you add more students.\nThere is a large community of developers behind popular open-source learning platforms like Moodle, and they are constantly building features that you can take advantage of. The drawback of using open-source software is that they are more complex to handle compared to regular free or paid software. You may need a dedicated technical staff to help you.\nThe second main category is the free online learning platform. They come at no cost, but the source code behind them is not freely available and customizable like with open-source software. You can use these free platforms to host your educational content and deliver them to the intended users without paying. However, there may be some costs associated with hosting your content on an internal server or for additional features. The drawback of free platforms is that they don\u2019t offer as much features as paid and open-source ones.\nThe third category is the paid online learning platform, which refers to most on this list. Here, you will need to pay upfront to host your educational content and distribute them to your students or trainees. Expect to pay a fixed fee for each user either monthly or annually, and it can add up to a considerable amount if you have a lot of students. The paid platforms are usually easy to use and navigate because customers expect user-friendliness for a platform they\u2019re paying for. You can also access on-demand support if you run into any issues, unlike with free and open-source software.\nWith a paid platform, you don\u2019t need to spend money running your own server and setting up and managing the software. The provider does that for you, while you just pay and access it whenever you want. It is an ideal type to choose, but the disadvantage is that it can be expensive.\nOnline learning platform vs online course websites\nThere are plenty of ways to receive education online these days. This can include anything from casual content, such as an educational YouTube Video, to more structured online education such as a series of videos, and in some cases supplemental content in the form of text or a downloadable PDF. While there are many websites to educate and impart content, they are not all online learning platforms.\nAn online learning platform goes beyond what an online course website offers, with additional content to support the education. While it will incorporate the elements of an online course website, it will include additional tools, which will all be combined into a single platform. These tools can be communication methods such as live video or messaging, the opportunity to have assignments, and a record of certificates of completed courses. Overall, an online learning platform provides content that will be more in depth, and organized in a more formal environment to promote greater learning.\nOpen source vs free vs paid online learning platforms\nLearning platforms can be divided into three different categories based on the pricing model.\nThe first is free, which has the benefit of no cost. There are both services that offer this at no cost, or ones that have a free tier, with reduced features, that then hope to upsell the service to a paid tier, and use the free offering as a gateway to getting a paying customer. A downside of these free offerings is that the support tends to be minimal to nonexistent, such as only via an online community board.\nOpen source is another nice option for a learning management system. In this model the software is distributed for no cost. This can allow an organization to then run this off of its own server. However, there are still costs to doing this, and then this must be supported internally. Another downside is that then the software may not be as updated as frequently, exposing it to security vulnerabilities.\nThe final option is a paid offering. While this does have an upfront cost, and in most cases for each additional learner, it does have plenty of advantages. This includes that the provider can host the software as a cloud service, requiring no in house personnel to provide support. Also, there may be options for phone support, and also more features.\nIs Zoom an online learning platform?\nMade popular by the pandemic with remote meetings becoming commonplace, Zoom is a video communications platform. Other popular choices in this category are GoToMeeting, and Google Meet. Zoom and other video communication apps are used for online audio and video meetings for business, casual and educational use. Each also supports additional content to support the virtual meeting, such as sharing screens, or chat within the app.\nHowever, Zoom is not specifically an online learning platform. While it can certainly be used to support education, it has no way to give assignments, grade them, or do quizzes for example. As an online learning platform it falls pretty short, with plenty of better options out there. Also, many of the better online learning platforms offer video chatting within the platform so Zoom as a standalone is not needed as the functionality is already incorporated in.\nWhat are the pros and cons of an online learning platform?\nThere are plenty of pros for an online platform. This includes the instant availability of the education, and that learners are not limited by geography and can attend class anywhere- even from the comfort of home. The learning is also self-paced, as it can accommodate a variety of learning styles and learner needs as it is more flexible. There is also the benefit that learners don\u2019t need to commute to the school reducing the cost and burden of education, which can also be a time saving benefit as well.\nWhile there are certainly benefits, there are some downsides as well. Some students may prefer face to face learning with a teacher directly in front of them, that an online learning platform lacks. Also with no physical school to attend, there is less of a structured learning environment, which some learners may do better with. Furthermore, there is less or even no camaraderie between learners than at a physical school, which can all be part of the total educational experience, and is a missing component with an online learning platform.\nWhat are the essential features of an online learning platform?\nWhen choosing an online learning platform for your organization, be sure the choice is a good one. Here are some essential features to look for:\n- Scalability: Nobody wants to outgrow their platform too soon, and have to transition to another one. Therefore, look for scalability that can grow as you need it to.\n- Mobile presence: Today\u2019s learners want to be able to learn when on the move. Therefore, look for an online learning platform that has well rated apps for both the iOS and Android platforms, that are highly rated.\n- Tools for authoring: A flexible platform allows for content creation that is easy to use. This can include tools for text editing, and also video capture and editing from within the platform to streamline production.\n- Easy to use interface: Nobody likes to use a clunky interface, so look for an easy one to use, that is well presented, and won\u2019t distract or overwhelm users.\n- Robust support: When the inevitable issues of a platform come up, users are going to need some help. Look for a platform that offers a variety of support choices, including options for direct support such as a direct email and phone number.\nRead how to host your own learning management software with Moodle LMS.\nHow we tested the best online learning platforms\nThere are plenty of choices in the online learning management software area, so there is sure to be one well suited for each organization.\nA major differentiator is price. Some LMS\u2019 are available for free, or have a low cost entry tier. Others offer more features, but at a higher price point. Pricing models are also different with some providers charging only by each student, while others having the price based on the plan, and then a lower additional cost for each additional learner.\nAnother feature to look for are the mobile apps. Especially younger learners value these apps so that a learner can engage in education from anywhere, at any time. Be sure that the apps are available for both of the mobile platforms- Android and iOS. Also, check the ratings of the apps in their respective stores, as just because an app is available it may not be a great one with some low rated, glitchy ones out there.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
