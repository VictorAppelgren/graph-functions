  "title": "Level Up With This Deal: $240 Off an Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop",
  "description": "The Acer Nitro V laptop is a solid choice for all of your gaming needs, coming equipped with both power and stunning visuals. Now you can grab it for 21% less in today's deal.",
  "content": "If you're looking for a gaming laptop with a few extra goodies, look no further than the Acer Nitro V. It's powered by a 13th Gen Intel Core processor and an NVDIA GeForce RTX 40-series graphics card, making it a top-of-the-line gaming laptop. Over at Newegg, you can grab it for $240 less, dropping the original $1,049.99 price down to $809.99. To sweeten the deal, an Acer gaming controller is also included. For a deal under a grand, don't miss out!\n\nThis laptop sports a blistering 144Hz refresh rate, making your gameplay experience as smooth as possible. Combined with the 15.6-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio, you'll be more accurate and precise when playing games like Call of Duty or Overwatch . What makes the Acer Nitro special is its compatibility with gigabit ethernet. It supports data transmission speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, which is much faster than conventional ethernet connections that operate on megabits. Given the highly competitive nature of online gaming, having a fast internet speed could mean the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nOur principal hardware writer, Matthew Buzzi, awarded a different version of the Acer Nitro V laptop a \"Good\" rating. In our Acer Nitro V 15 (ANV15-41-R2Y3) review , he said, \"This Acer Nitro V 15 configuration is no chart-topper but an affordable 1080p gaming laptop with plenty of ports, long battery life, and capable components\u2014if you don't mind dialing down some visual settings.\" At this price point, this deal is definitely enticing, especially with the extra controller.\n\nBe sure to check out our other Newegg and laptop deals .\n\nMore Laptop Deals on Amazon\n\nMore Laptop Deals on Walmart\n\nMore Laptop Deals on Target",
