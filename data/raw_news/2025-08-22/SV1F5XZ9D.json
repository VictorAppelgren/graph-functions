  "content": "CALGARY, AB, Aug. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - (TSXV: GRD) (OTCQB: GRDAF) - Grounded Lithium Corp. (\"GLC\" or the \"Company\") announces our financial and operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025. Selected financial and operational information is set out below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's December 31, 2024 financial statements and the related management's discussion and analysis, which are available for review at www.sedarplus.ca or the Company's website at www.groundedlithium.com.\n\nThe Company continues to work with its partner, Denison Mines Ltd (\"Denison\"), as it progresses to develop and finalize a pre-feasibility study (\"PFS\") anticipated to be completed towards the end of 2025 or early 2026. The PFS will provide clear conclusions on the economics, viability and development path for the Company's flagship lithium from brine project, the Kindersley Lithium Project (\"KLP\").\n\nThe detailed depletion study of the Duperow/Leduc reservoir and subsequent analysis of different well designs and configurations provide the current plan to drill wells with 2 parallel horizontal legs into the 2 best reservoir zones which maximizes brine drainage at minimal costs.\n\nExtensive samples of brine collected from the re-entry of the KLP 4-15 well in late 2024 (refer to press release dated January 22, 2025) were shipped to several unique direct lithium extraction firms. Results from those assessments provide Stantec Inc, the PFS lead auditor, the opportunity to analyze which technology optimally extracts the lithium and maximize KLP's economics. Final decisions on design will ensue post conclusions from the PFS. Based on detailed work completed thus far, both sorption and ion-exchange lithium extraction methodologies have promise for the final design.\n\nIn the continuing effort to reduce corporate expenditures, key personnel have decided to receive compensation in the form of equity incentives rather than solely cash compensation primarily received as contractors to the KLP. As such, the Company granted 2,110,900 stock options at an exercise price of $0.065 per share in accordance with the Company's Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held June 18, 2025. The grant remains subject to final TSXV approval.\n\nGLC is a publicly traded lithium brine exploration and development company that controls approximately 1.0 million metric tonnes of Measured & Indicated lithium carbonate equivalent mineral resource and approximately 3.2 million metric tonnes of Inferred lithium carbonate equivalent resource over our focused land holdings in Southwest Saskatchewan as per the Company's updated PEA. The updated PEA, titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report: Preliminary Economic Assessment Kindersley Lithium Project \u2013 Phase 1 Update\" dated November 7, 2023 and effective as of June 30, 2023, reports a Phase 1 NPV8 after-tax of US$1.0 billion with an after-tax IRR of 48.5%. GLC's multi-faceted business model involves the consolidation, delineation, exploitation and ultimately development of our opportunity base to fulfill our vision to build a best-in-class, environmentally responsible, Canadian lithium producer supporting the global energy transition shift. U.S. investors can find current financial disclosure and Real-Time Level 2 quotes for the Company on https://www.otcmarkets.com/.\n\nScientific and technical information contained in this press release has been prepared under the supervision of Doug Ashton, P.Eng., Alexey Romanov, P. Geo., Meghan Klein, P. Eng., Dean Quirk, P.Eng., Jeffrey Weiss, P.Eng., Chad Hitchings., P.L. Eng., and Michael Munteanu, P.Eng., each of whom is a qualified person within the meaning of NI 43-101.\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. The opinions, forecasts, projections and statements about future events of results, are forward looking information, forward-looking statements or financial outlooks (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\") under the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. These statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by GLC that the Company believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Although GLC believes that the assumptions underlying, and expectations reflected in, these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the internal rates of return and net present values of the KLP, activities funded by Denison to drive the KLP value and GLC's vision of becoming a best-in-class, environmentally responsible, Canadian lithium producer supporting the global energy transition.\n\nAmong the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are: GLC's expectation that our operations will be in Western Canada, unexpected problems can arise due to technical difficulties and operational difficulties which impact the production, transport or sale of our products; geographic and weather conditions can impact production; the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact commodity prices and consumption more than GLC currently predicts; the failure to obtain financing on reasonable terms; volatility in the trading price of the common shares of the Company; the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur; the failure of drilling to result in commercial projects; unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel; and the other risk factors detailed from time to time in GLC's periodic reports. GLC's forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\n\nThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.",

      "text": "Other News\nCALGARY, ALBERTA (Jan 22, 2025) (TSX.V: GRD OTCQB: GRDAF) \u2013 Grounded Lithium Corp. (\u201cGLC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces completion of the 2024 field program and provides an update on the ongoing Pre-Feasibility Study (\u201cPFS\u201d) for the Kindersley Lithium Project (\u201cKLP\u201d).\nThe Company, together with its strategic partner Denison Mines Corp. (\u201cDenison\u201d), completed a field drill program at the KLP\u2019s original 4-15-33-23W3 well (the \u201c4-15 Well\u201d) successfully re-entering and extending the well achieving several defined objectives. Further, as part of the PFS preparation, the Company and Denison commenced extensive metallurgical testing and a depletion modeling exercise. These efforts provide a deliberate, planned and methodical approach to further refine the commercial confidence level in the pending independently authored PFS by Stantec Inc. (\u201cStantec\u201d) planned for completion mid 2025.\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the timely completion of the 2024 field program,\u201d commented Gregg Smith, President and CEO. \u201cThe detailed information gained from this program greatly assists in the understanding of the Duperow formation and our systematic progression to the completion of a PFS with its technical studies.\u201d\n4-15 Field Program Results\nThe 4-15 Well was re-entered and deepened by 100 meters and subsequently tested for lithium concentrations and flow rates at a number of specific intervals across the entire Duperow formation, including newly accessible lower horizons. Previous test work focused on a single 178 metre thick interval considered to provide the greatest deliverability of lithium-rich brine. These recent activities confirmed many of the preliminary understandings but more importantly, allowed the Company and Denison to identify additional deliverability and extract large brine volumes from the formation for planned metallurgical testing.\nField program key technical highlights include:\n- 83 cubic metres or 525 barrels of bulk brine samples were collected (see Figure 1);\n2\n- 11 intervals across the Duperow formation were tested for flow capabilities and lithium concentrations with samples sent to three independent labs for confirmation of lithium and ion concentrations;\n- Test results confirmed lithium concentrations from zones previously tested at 76.5 milligrams/litre;\n- Tests of the newly drilled lower zone, in the base of the Duperow formation, demonstrated high additional deliverability with lithium brine concentrations at 66 milligrams/litre, which has the potential to contribute to the overall deliverability of the KLP;\n- Direct lithium extraction test work has commenced using the brines recovered from the field program. Evaluations are underway at three independent extraction technology labs and two governmental research labs for respective lab-pilot testing to ultimately support facility design;\n- The 3D reservoir depletion modelling underway benefits from the additional data for brine flow rates, pressures, and brine concentrations, which will support the development of production models and the associated well patterns and site infrastructure designs.\nFigure 1 \u2013Collection of brine samples from the 4-15 Well taken November 14, 2024\nAbout Grounded Lithium Corp.\nGLC is a publicly traded lithium brine exploration and development company that owns approximately 1.0 million metric tonnes of Measured & Indicated lithium carbonate equivalent mineral resource and approximately 3.2 million metric tonnes of Inferred lithium carbonate equivalent resource over our focused land holdings in Southwest Saskatchewan as per the Company\u2019s updated PEA.

The grant remains subject to final TSXV approval.\nAbout Grounded Lithium Corp.\nGLC is a publicly traded lithium brine exploration and development company that controls approximately 1.0 million metric tonnes of Measured & Indicated lithium carbonate equivalent mineral resource and approximately 3.2 million metric tonnes of Inferred lithium carbonate equivalent resource over our focused land holdings in Southwest Saskatchewan as per the Company's updated PEA.
