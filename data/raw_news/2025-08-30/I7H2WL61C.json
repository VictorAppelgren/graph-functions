  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has canceled Secret Service protection for former vice president and 2024 Democratic rival Kamala Harris, a senior White House official said on Friday.\n\nFormer vice presidents typically receive six months of Secret Service protection after they leave office.\n\nHarris' protection was extended one year, until January 2026, by then-President Joe Biden before he left office in January, the official said.\n\nHarris in September will embark on a 15-city book tour for her memoir, \"107 Days,\" about her unsuccessful presidential run. She was the Democratic nominee for 107 days after Biden withdrew from the race in the weeks following a disastrous debate against Trump. Trump went on to defeat Harris in November.\n\nThe letter to Harris, dated Thursday, says the termination of additional security is effective Sept. 1, the official said. CNN was first to report the contents of the letter.\n\nKirsten Allen, a senior adviser to Harris, said in response to the move: \"The vice president is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety.\"\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and frequent Trump critic, called the action \"another dangerous reminder that there's no agenda more important to Donald Trump than retribution.\"\n\nAccording to the Secret Service's website, it is required to protect \"major presidential and vice presidential candidates, and their spouses within 120 days of a general presidential election\" as well as former presidents.\n\nHarris announced in July that she would not run for governor of California in 2026.",

      "text": "- Kamala Harris announced she will not run for California governor in 2026.\n- Harris leaves open the possibility of a 2028 presidential bid, focusing on Democrats.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she will not run for governor of California, ending speculation that the failed presidential candidate would seek the high-profile post.\n\"I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor. I love this state, its people, and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for governor in this election,\" she said in a statement.\nHarris said she would not run for office now, leaving the door open for a possible presidential bid in 2028.\n\"For now, my leadership \u2014 and public service \u2014 will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans,\" she said.\nHarris has kept a relatively low profile since losing the presidential election to Republican Donald Trump in 2024.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has held the post since 2019, cannot run for reelection due to term limits.\nOther high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, including Xavier Becerra, who served as health and human services director under former President Joe Biden and former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter."

      "text": "Estimated read time: 6-7 minutes\n- Donald Trump won the presidency with a sweeping victory Wednesday.\n- Kamala Harris conceded but vowed to continue fighting for freedom, opportunity and fairness.\n- Trump's win could impact U.S. policies on trade, climate change, taxes and immigration.\nPALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Donald Trump recaptured the White House with a sweeping victory on Wednesday as tens of millions of Americans looked past his criminal charges and divisive rhetoric to embrace a leader who, if he carries out his campaign promises, will test the limits of presidential power.\nTrump, 78, clinched Tuesday's election after a polarizing and dizzying campaign marked by two attempts on his life and Kamala Harris' late entry into the race following President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal.\nIn a concession speech at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Harris sought to console the voters who had hoped she would become the first woman to win the White House.\n\"To everyone who is watching, do not despair,\" she said. \"This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves.\"\nHarris said she had called Trump to congratulate him and promised to aid his transition. But she was not prepared to embrace his vision for the country.\n\"While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,\" she said, as some supporters in the crowd shed tears. \"The fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people.\"\nBiden planned to address the nation on Thursday.\nTrump's resounding victory underscored how disenchanted Americans had become with the economy, border security and the direction of the country and its culture. Voters demanded a change, even if the agent of change was a convicted felon twice impeached and no longer the Washington outsider he was in his 2016 campaign.\nTrump has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal and has vowed to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate or prosecute perceived enemies, including political rivals.\nTrump and his incoming vice president, Sen. JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. He promised roles in his administration to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a prominent Trump donor, and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe outcome defied polls that showed a razor-close race ahead of Tuesday's Election Day. Trump prevailed in at least five of the seven battleground states to push him over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency and was leading in the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada, where votes were still being tallied.\nTrump was also on track to become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since George W. Bush two decades ago.\nRead more:\nHis fellow Republicans wrested control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats and had added to their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, though the outcome there may not be known for several days with dozens of races still uncalled.\n\"It was a hell of a good day,\" said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader.\nUnified Republican control on Capitol Hill would clear the way for major portions of Trump's legislative agenda, as it did in the first two years of his 2017-2021 presidency when Republicans whipped a major tax-cut bill through Congress that mainly benefited the wealthy.\n\"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\" Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.\nMajor stock markets around the world rallied following Trump's victory, and the dollar was set for its biggest one-day jump since 2020.\nOvercoming odds\nTrump was elected despite persistently low approval ratings, four criminal indictments and a civil judgment against him for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star.\nTrump's political career appeared over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat. His efforts to reverse his defeat led to two separate indictments, though all the criminal cases against him are expected to end after his victory.\nTrump swept away challengers inside his party and then beat Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed falsely was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.\nTrump's win will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, Americans' taxes and immigration, and U.S. foreign policy, including in the Middle East and Ukraine.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump, and they discussed \"the Iranian threat\" and the need to work together for Israel's security, Netanyahu's office said.\nHamas, the Palestinian militant group, called for an end to the \"blind support\" for Israel from the United States.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Trump's commitment to \"peace through strength,\" while the Kremlin said it would wait and see if his victory could help end the war in Ukraine more quickly. Trump had said he could end the war in 24 hours but has not offered a detailed plan.\nTrump's tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say.\nA second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as immigration, race, gender and reproductive rights.\nTrump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.\nHispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel the victory. Trump's support among women, whose backing Democrats had counted on, improved from four years ago. And his loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force, according to Edison Research exit polls.\nMeanwhile, many Democratic-leaning voters appear to have stayed home this year. The number of votes cast in counties that supported Trump in 2020 and where nearly all ballots have been tallied grew by almost 2% this year, while votes cast in counties that supported Biden four years ago dropped almost 5%.\nContributing: Jeff Mason Nandita Bose, Andrea Shalal, Gram Slattery, Jarrett Renshaw, Gabriella Borter, Alexandra Ulmer, Helen Coster, Stephanie Kelly, Steve Holland, Tim Reid, Bianca Flowers, Rich McKay, Brad Brooks, Nathan Layne and Timothy Aeppel"
