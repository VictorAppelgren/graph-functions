  "title": "Emma Raducanu Shut Down by Umpire for Complaining About Crying Child",
  "description": "Emma Raducanu was shut down by a Cincinnati Open umpire after she complained about a crying child disrupting her match against Aryna Sabalenka",
  "content": "British tennis pro Emma Raducanu was shut down by an umpire after complaining about a crying child in the stands.\n\nIn a clip shared via ESPN\u2019s TikTok account on Tuesday, August 12, Raducanu, 22, was seen asking the umpire during her Cincinnati Open round of 32 match against World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to address the noise.\n\nRaducanu, who was defeated by the Belarus sensation in three sets, was first seen attempting to serve before the video ran text which read \u201cchild cries,\u201d causing her to halt her game. (The crying is not detectable via the video\u2019s audio.)\n\nShe was then seen saying to the umpire, \u201cIt\u2019s been, like, ten minutes,\u201d to which the official responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a child. Do you want me to send the child out of the stadium?\u201d\n\nThe umpire\u2019s sarcastic suggestion drew several \u201cyes\u201d responses from the crowd, leading Raducanu, who is currently ranked World No. 39, to shrug her shoulders and laugh while gesturing to fans, allowing their words to speak for her.\n\n\u201cI can call in, but we need to continue for the moment,\u201d the umpire concluded before the video cut short.\n\nThe TikTok post attracted more than 800 comments that both agreed and disagreed with Raducanu\u2019s complaint. \u201cBaby won\u2019t even remember this game like why bring them,\u201d wrote one commenter, while another argued, \u201cI thought the difference between professionals and amateurs was they were able to block stuff like that out.\u201d\n\nRaducanu is no stranger to attracting headlines, recently addressing speculation over her personal life.\n\nResponding to rumors of a romance with fellow tennis player Carlos Alcaraz from Spain, Raducanu said during a pre-Wimbledon press conference on June 28, \u201cWe\u2019re just good friends.\u201d\n\nRumors swirled just prior to the British tournament after it was announced that Raducanu and Alcarez, also 22, will partner in the forthcoming U.S. Open\u2019s mixed doubles event.\n\nRaducanu told the BBC in June that teaming up professionally was Alcaraz\u2019s idea. \u201cHe asked me earlier on in the year and I was very surprised and honored and obviously excited,\u201d she said during an interview with the outlet on June 24. \u201cI just went through the formality of asking my coach. But of course I was going to say yes.\u201d (Alcaraz is currently ranked World No. 2 in the men\u2019s competition.)\n\nThe interview also saw her poke fun at online chatter over their growing friendship. \u201cI\u2019m glad the internet is having fun and we\u2019re providing some entertainment for everyone,\u201d she told the outlet before explaining that they\u2019ve known each other for years.\n\n\u201cWe go back a long way,\u201d she said at the time.",

      "text": "Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s former press secretary, Ailsa Anderson, has some thoughts about Prince Harry.\nAnderson worked alongside the late monarch for 12 years, which allowed her to form a close bond with her grandson Harry, 40, as well. The former royal family employee recalled the Duke of Sussex being a \u201cvery warm, engaging and kind person\u201d in the U.K. documentary Prince Harry: My Terrible Year, which aired on Saturday, August 9.\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean Anderson doesn\u2019t have some arguably harsh words for the Duke of Sussex amid the royal family\u2019s ongoing fallout.\n\u201cStop being the victim and start being the hero of the piece, start writing your own script,\u201d Anderson said in a message to Harry. \u201cI think people are just getting a little bit tired of how Prince Harry thinks the world is against him and how awful his life is.\u201d\nShe claimed that the duke is \u201ctoo impulsive,\u201d which she alluded to being the reason behind some of his recent decisions.\nAnderson appeared to be referring to Harry\u2019s bombshell interview with the BBC from earlier this year, in which the duke publicly revealed details about his continued feud with King Charles III.\n\u201cI think trust is paramount in every walk of life, if you can\u2019t trust your family, who can you trust?\u201d Anderson also said in the documentary.\nHarry has been making headlines for the past few months as the rift between him and his father continues. After losing his appeal for government-funded security in the U.K., Harry sat down for his BBC interview and claimed that Charles, 76, \u201cwon\u2019t speak to me.\u201d (Harry and wife, Meghan Markle, lost security protection in the U.K. after they parted ways with the royal family in 2020 and moved across the pond to Montecito, California.)\nThe duke also shared his wish to reconcile with his family at the time.\n\u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d Harry said, in part. \u201cLife is precious. I don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family.\u201d\nHarry appeared to be referring to Charles\u2019 ongoing cancer battle. (The king was diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer last year.)\nThere has been talk about the father and son potentially finding a path towards some type of reconciliation. However, Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother, Prince William, is something totally different.\n\u201cI think that Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother is a different beast than his relationship with his father,\u201d royal expert Kristen Meinzer told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this month. \u201cBut perhaps if Charles warms more to Harry, William will feel compelled to follow his lead.\u201d"

      "text": "Brandon Blackstock\u2018s son Seth and ex-wife Melissa Ashworth Wells have spoken out about the talent manager\u2019s death.\n\u201cI lost my hero yesterday, words can\u2019t describe how proud of you I am on raising me and your 3 other kids,\u201d Seth, 18, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, August 9, alongside a series of throwback photos with his late dad. \u201cYou were a father, a son, a brother, and most importantly my best friend.\u201d\nSeth shared that while his father is no longer with him physically, his spirit will live on in other ways.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch me grow up from a Birds Eye view now but that\u2019s OK with me. There\u2019s no one else on this earth that I would want to be my dad because no one can be half the man you were to me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll see you everyday when the sun rises and falls. I can confidently say all the deer and elk took a sigh of relief when the best hunter I\u2019ve ever known laid his rifle down for the last time.\u201d\n\u201cI love you so much and can\u2019t wait to throw a line in the water with you again. Love you dad. Be good or good at it -love your son Seth,\u201d he concluded.\nBrandon welcomed Seth with Ashworth Wells in 2007. The exes, who were married from 1999 to 2012, also shared daughter Savannah, 23. Savannah, for her part, shares son Lake with husband Quentin Lee. Following his split from Ashworth Wells, Brandon moved on with Kelly Clarkson. The pair tied the knot in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020 after seven years of marriage.\nOne day before Seth\u2019s tribute, Ashworth Wells shared an emotional post dedicated to Brandon.\n\u201cBrandon was full of charm, wit, and just an absolute gentleman who happened to wear cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, and a cowboy hat. He was by far, hands down, the best Daddy and Pa. He loved hard and he fought hard,\u201d she wrote via Instagram on Friday, August 8. \u201cThe best thing Brandon has left for his children is they know where he is. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u2018Nothing is lost when you know where it is\u2019 and Brandon is with Jesus his Savior. Savannah, Seth, and our grandchildren are the best parts of who Brandon and I are. Thank you all for your prayers and condolences. \u271d\ufe0f.\u201d\nBrandon died on August 7 following a private battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us Weekly in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nBrandon\u2019s cause of death was due to melanoma, which is a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes."

I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "As dating rumors have continued to swirl around tennis stars Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, Raducanu attempted to set the record straight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just good friends,\u201d Raducanu, 22, said with a big smile during her pre-Wimbledon press conference on Saturday, June 28.\nBuzz about Raducanu\u2019s relationship with Alcaraz, 22, has picked up steam after the news that the pair plan to play mixed doubles together in the U.S. Open this summer.\nLast week, Raducanu was asked about Alcaraz\u2019s insinuation that she \u201ctook her time\u201d giving him an answer about playing together.\n\u201cHe asked me earlier on in the year and I was very surprised and honored and obviously excited,\u201d Raducanu told the BBC on Tuesday, June 24. \u201cI just went through the formality of asking my coach. But of course I was going to say yes.\u201d\nRaducanu was asked about tennis fans on social media who think she and Alcaraz are \u201cdestined\u201d to be together.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the internet is having fun and we\u2019re providing some entertainment for everyone,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nWhile she didn\u2019t give into the dating speculation, Raducanu explained that her friendship with Alcaraz means a great deal to her.\n\u201cWe go back a long way,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cI think we both started to get to know each other a lot more in 2021 when I had that little run at Wimbledon.\u201d\nRaducanu made it to the 4th round of Wimbledon as a wild card in 2021, eventually being forced to retire in her match against Ajla Tomljanovic with breathing difficulties.\n\u201cEver since, we\u2019ve stayed in touch,\u201d Raducanu added. \u201cHe\u2019s done so well obviously since and continued winning. It\u2019s been amazing to see because we were speaking and friends before anyone won anything.\u201d\nAlcaraz is a five-time major champion, most recently taking home his second French Open title earlier this month.\nMonths after her Wimbledon breakthrough, Raducanu won the 2021 U.S. Open, becoming the first qualifier in history to win a major title.\nAlcaraz was asked about the \u201cgood chemistry\u201d between himself and Raducanu in a pre-Wimbledon interview of his own.\n\u201cShe plays great,\u201d Alcaraz told Hypebeast in an interview posted on Sunday, June 29. \u201cShe\u2019s struggling a little bit lately, but I\u2019m pretty sure that she\u2019s gonna get there. I have a lot of confidence in her \u2026 Her game is pretty high. I trust that she\u2019s gonna be on the top very soon.\u201d\nAlcaraz and Raducanu both kicked off their 2025 Wimbledon singles\u2019 journeys on Monday, June 30. They will hit the court together when the 2025 U.S. Open begins Sunday, August 24, in New York City."

      "text": "Brandon Blackstock\u2019s obituary is revealing details about his private life after his divorce from Kelly Clarkson.\n\u201cAfter more than 20 years in the music business, Brandon found his way back to the mountains and the cowboy way of life he always wanted to live. He found a homestead and a love in Butte, Montana,\u201d the tribute read.\nThe message continued, \u201cBrandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.\u201d\nThe news comes days after Blackstock died at age 48 following a private battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us Weekly in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nBlackstock\u2019s cause of death was confirmed to be melanoma, a form of skin cancer, by Silver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis. His manner of death is listed as natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement to People on Monday, August 11.\nBlackstock is survived by his four children. He shared son Seth and daughter Savannah with ex-wife Ashworth Wells, and daughter River and son Remington with ex-wife Clarkson. (Blackstock and Clarkson were married from 2013 until she filed for divorce in 2020. The pair\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2022.\nWells has since paid tribute to Blackstock in an emotional Instagram post shared on Friday, August 8.\n\u201cBrandon was full of charm, wit, and just an absolute gentleman who happened to wear cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, and a cowboy hat. He was by far, hands down, the best Daddy and Pa. He loved hard and he fought hard,\u201d she wrote.\nShe continued, \u201cThe best thing Brandon has left for his children is they know where he is. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u2018Nothing is lost when you know where it is\u2019 and Brandon is with Jesus his Savior. Savannah, Seth, and our grandchildren are the best parts of who Brandon and I are. Thank you all for your prayers and condolences. \u271d\ufe0f.\u201d\nSeth, for his part, also honored his dad alongside a series of throwback photos with Blackstock. \u201cI lost my hero yesterday, words can\u2019t describe how proud of you I am on raising me and your 3 other kids,\u201d Seth wrote via Instagram on Saturday, August 9. \u201cYou were a father, a son, a brother, and most importantly my best friend.\u201d"

      "text": "Pamela Anderson exudes beauty and grace both on screen and at her stunning home in her native country.\nThe actress prefers her quiet life on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, to which she moved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Her journey back to the area was decades in the making.\nAnderson grew up in Canada but relocated to Los Angeles in 1990 to pursue modeling and acting. Ultimately, following a brief stint in France, she was drawn back to Canada around 2020, where she renovated and restored her family\u2019s farm property into the haven that it is today.\n\u201cI bought this place over 30 years ago from my grandmother and she lived out her life here so she could distribute her wealth amongst her kids,\u201d Anderson told CR Fashion Book in March 2024. \u201cAnd then I was just living my wild life out there in L.A. and all over the place. I finally came back during COVID and thought, \u2018Oh, this is the time.\u2019\u201d\nAnderson\u2019s love for gardening, baking, entertaining and embracing nature has grown since moving into her whimsical home.\nKeep scrolling for Anderson\u2019s quotes on her life since moving back to Canada.\nOn Finding Comfort\n\u201cI\u2019d never been on a plane before when I left this island. You know, I left the island, and I went to Vancouver, and then I moved to L.A., and then I went around the world and South of France for a year before I moved home,\u201d Anderson said in November 2022, per The Canadian Press.\nShe continued, \u201cI was restless when I was here. And I had to learn how to be comfortable, just relaxing and enjoying and putting all my creative juices into this project, making this an art project, listening to other people\u2019s ideas.\u201d\nAnderson realized that the solution to some of her problems was simple: she \u201cjust needed some Canadian roots.\u201d\nOn Her Homecoming\nAnderson knew she would one day return home to Canada.\n\u201cI always planned on coming home to renovate this place. And it\u2019s fun,\u201d she told CR Fashion Book. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of memories \u2026 It\u2019s very much like a homecoming. I was very close with my grandfather, and his energy is all around me. He taught me how the trees spoke to him. And so, it\u2019s very mythological, very primitive.\u201d\nOn Finding Herself\nThe Baywatch alum wanted to begin a new chapter in her personal life and career, prompting her move from L.A.\n\u201cI guess a homecoming, you could say, to really kind of look at my life and remember who I was \u2014 not what other people were telling me I was \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want anything that had happened to me define me,\u201d Anderson told Women\u2019s Wear Daily in October 2024. \u201cI wanted what I do to define me \u2026 all these realizations came to me in the rose garden.\u201d\nOn Making a Big Change\nAnderson spoke about a transitional period in her life two years after her divorce from Dan Hayhurst. The pair were married from 2020 to 2022.\n\u201cA few years back, I kind of gave up at some point and needed a change,\u201d the Naked Gun actress told Better Homes & Gardens in August 2024. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I guess that\u2019s just what people think of me.\u2019 I was not in a good space when I moved back to Canada. I don\u2019t know what happened over the last few decades, but I feel now so far removed from the image of who I was.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cI felt very sad and lonely. I didn\u2019t feel just misunderstood, I felt like I had really screwed up, that my whole life was a bundle of mistakes. I was hard on myself, and I thought I put my family through a lot and put my kids through so much.\u201d (Anderson shares kids Brandon and Dylan Lee with ex-husband Tommy Lee.)\n\u201cI came to a point where I decided to move home and disappear and get into my garden,\u201d she concluded. \u201cAnd when I started building the garden, it was really like a metaphor of putting my life back together. I began planting seeds, and the smallest things became really profound.\u201d\nOn Her Love for Gardening\nAnderson\u2019s green thumb is something she inherited from her family.\n\u201cIt comes from my grandfather Herman. He was really interesting and the closest person to me as a child,\u201d she told Better Homes & Gardens. \u201cHe was very much into mythology and fairy tales, and we always spoke about them when I was little. He would put little mirrors around in the garden, and he told me that was a way I could catch a glimpse of fairies and elves.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI have a little collection of marbles and little toys that I still find in the garden. And I think, \u2018Did I put those there as a child for my future self?\u2019 Believe me, I\u2019ve gone crazy with all this. Do you realize that this place that I bought from my grandmother is the same place my parents brought me home from the hospital when I was born? There were nine cabins, and we lived in cabin six. This is the first place my feet touched the actual soil.\u201d\nOn Her Passion for Baking\nOne thing that has helped Anderson turn her house into a home is baking delicious treats.\n\u201cThis bread thing is such a meditation for me,\u201d she told Better Homes & Gardens. \u201cYou\u2019re always on the search for the best loaf and it never comes. There\u2019s something about it that I compare to giving birth. If all those other people have done it, then so can I. Baking teaches patience. I\u2019ve come to realize there\u2019s so much about cooking that is good for you. If you like to cook, you\u2019re good at lots of things.\u201d"

      "text": "Tennis star Emma Raducanu had to pause her match on Tuesday, February 18, after an unruly fan apparently caused her to break down in tears.\nThe incident happened at the Dubai Tennis Championships where Raducanu, 22, was competing in round two against Czech player Karolina Muchova. The man allegedly approached Raducanu in a public area before the match, then made his way to the first few rows as she was playing.\nIt\u2019s not clear what he said, but the Women\u2019s Tennis Association claimed in a statement that he was exhibiting \u201cfixated\u201d behavior toward her. The British pro broke down in tears near the start of the match before approaching the chair umpire to explain the situation. She appeared to hide behind the umpire\u2019s chair as security removed the fan from the stadium.\n\u201cPlayer safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events,\u201d the WTA\u2019s statement read. \u201cThe WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support.\u201d\nThe WTA added that the man will be banned from all WTA events \u201cpending a threat assessment.\u201d\n\u201cWe remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players,\u201d the statement continued.\nMuchova, 28, ultimately won the match, 7-6(6), 6-4. Raducanu released a public comment afterward via her Instagram Story, addressing the incident and congratulating her opponent.\n\u201cThank you for the messages of support,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDifficult experience yesterday but I\u2019ll be okay and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match. Thank you to Karoline for being a great sport and best of luck to her for the rest of the tournament.\u201d\nThe Lawn Tennis Association, tennis\u2019 governing body in the UK, said it is in contact with Raducanu and its \u201cextensive security arrangements\u201d are \u201cunder constant review.\u201d\n\u201cThis incident once again highlights issues around safety that all players, but female players in particular, can face,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to NBC Sports. \u201cWe have support available for British players and have been in contact with Emma and her team following the events in Dubai.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t Raducanu\u2019s first run-in with an unruly fan \u2014 in 2022 a man showed up at her home three times, leaving unwanted gifts and flowers. He also allegedly sent her love letters and stole items from her property. The man was found guilty of stalking and received a five-year restraining order."
