      "summary": "The article laments the finale of the Sex and the City reboot “And Just Like That,” focusing on a gratuitous toilet‑overflow scene that angered fans and critics, and arguing that the show’s attempt to modernize with “woke” characters and plotlines has ruined its legacy. It recounts how the episode’s ending—showing a clogged toilet and a lonely Carrie Bradshaw—felt like a betrayal to longtime viewers, who expected a more uplifting conclusion. The piece also briefly touches on unrelated controversies, such as Jussie Smollett’s hoax, Howard Stern’s declining relevance, and an AI‑based interview with a Parkland victim, to illustrate broader cultural missteps. Overall, the author portrays the series as having lost its original charm and ending on a low note that many fans find insulting.",
