  "description": "AMD stock is facing selling pressures today, but it's still up more than 40% over the last three months.",
  "content": "\u2022 AMD stock has rallied more than 40% over the last three months, but new research from MIT has contributed to a pause in bullish momentum.\n\u2022 A study conducted at MIT suggests that the vast majority of businesses aren't scoring profits with their generative AI investments.\n\u2022 Developments on the inflation front are also pushing AMD stock lower.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices \u203a\n\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is losing ground today amid macroeconomic concerns and valuation pressures for artificial intelligence (AI) companies. The semiconductor specialist's share price was down 2.2% as of 2:20 p.m. ET. At the same point in the day's trading, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 0.6% and 1.1%, respectively. The stock had been down as much as 5% when the market opened, but it regained ground in conjunction with some recovery momentum for the broader market.\n\nTech stocks are getting hit with selling pressures today following new research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that suggests generative AI integration has mostly been a losing proposition for businesses. New signs that inflation-related pressures could be on the verge of ramping up are also playing a role in AMD's pullback.\n\nAMD slips after research suggests generative AI could be a bust for businesses\n\nMIT published a new research report on business applications for generative AI yesterday, and its data has contributed to sell-offs for the tech sector. According to MIT's study, 95% of businesses that have made use of generative AI applications haven't managed to achieve profits on the money they've spent on the technology. AMD stock has managed to rally 42% over the last three months on hopes that its chips for AI data centers will help spur big sales and earnings growth, and some investors are wondering if a valuation bubble for the broader artificial intelligence space could be on the verge of popping.\n\nExpectations that the Federal Reserve will serve up substantial interest rate cuts this year have been central to bullish momentum for AMD and many other growth stocks this year, but some recent data and indicators have been calling that thesis into question. The Bureau of Labor Statistics published its July Producer Price Index report last week, and the report arrived with inflation that was much hotter economists had forecast.\n\nAdding to concerns that inflation could be poised to accelerate in the near term, Target and Home Depot published second-quarter reports and gave commentary this week that spotlighted the inflationary impacts that tariffs are having on the consumer side of the economy. Higher inflation could deter the Fed from issuing the rate cuts that investors are hoping for, which could significantly weaken bullish support for AMD stock.",

      "text": "Government bodies can use tariffs to bolster domestic industries and achieve foreign trade and policy objectives. Read on to learn more about tariffs, the different ways these taxes can be applied, and the roles they can play in international economics and diplomatic relations.\nWhat are tariffs?\nWhat are tariffs?\nTariffs are a form of tax imposed by national or supranational government bodies on the import or export of goods. Tariffs are also sometimes referred to as duties.\nWhy are tariffs important?\nWhy are tariffs important?\nBeyond just being a source of tax revenue, tariffs are a way that governments can modify trade incentives. In particular, tariffs can be important in protecting domestic industries and economic interests.\nTariffs can be a form of economic protectionism, but the costs typically wind up being passed on to domestic shoppers through price hikes on consumer goods. Higher prices on imported goods may give domestically produced goods a competitive advantage, but governments try to strike a balanced approach to tariff policy that works for the good of the broader economy.\nHow do tariffs work?\nHow do tariffs work?\nTariffs are collected when goods exit the domestic area and cross into foreign borders. Import tariffs are far more common than export tariffs. When pursuing growth opportunities in international markets, businesses must be mindful of how tariffs could affect the market for their products and their pricing strategies.\nDifferent categories of products typically have different levels of tariffs applied. For example, vegetables, auto parts, and dairy products have relatively high import tariffs in the U.S., and tariffs on sneakers and tobacco are even higher. On the other hand, not all goods are subject to import duties.\nGovernments will also set tariff levels on a country-by-country basis. In general, countries with less-developed economies tend to have higher tariffs.\nAcademic views on tariffs\nAcademic views on tariffs\nRyan Monarch, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: What are the short and long-term economic effects of tariffs that matter most to investors?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cIn the short-run, tariffs are seen as inflationary, and all else equal, the more widespread the tariffs, the tighter Federal Reserve policy will likely be in order to tamp down upward price pressure. The exchange rate is also likely to appreciate \u2013 as U.S. interest rate policy remains tight relative that of other countries, the dollar is likely to strengthen. The short run is also characterized by significant uncertainty about what trade policy will look like, leading to the pulling back of investment and production for many companies.\nIn the long-run, inflation expectations may become less stable, and as consumers come to expect inflation, this itself can lead the Federal Reserve to take stronger tightening actions. If a global trade war truly breaks out, in which countries continue to escalate tariffs and other actions against each other, the economic consequences for all sides would be dire, and could lead to a major downturn in global growth.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: How do tariffs impact the economy?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cA tariff is a tax on an imported good paid by an importer in order to obtain their purchase after passing through customs. The basic purpose of a tariff is to increase the price of imported goods from a particular country in order to protect domestic producers of that good.\nSince tariffs increase the price of imported goods, tariffs impact the economy in a number of ways. First, average import prices increase as the scope of imported products facing tariffs expands. Second, tariffs tend to lead the imports of the affected goods to decrease. In some cases, affected businesses may substitute to purchasing products from other source countries or domestic alternatives, though the availability of such alternatives varies greatly depending on the imported product. Third, increase in import prices lead to higher costs for businesses using tariffed products as inputs, and affected firms tend to reduce employment, investment, and production in response. In fact, research on the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that job losses at U.S. firms using tariffed inputs well-exceeded job gains in protected sectors, and U.S. exports weakened as a result of higher import tariffs. Finally, government revenue increases as a result of the tax being applied to importers, though tariff revenue is a small fraction of overall government revenue in the United States.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs cause inflation?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cTariffs cause the price of affected goods to rise. In fact, research into the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that the prices of U.S. imported goods affected by tariffs rose by nearly the entire amount of tariffs imposed, meaning that U.S. importers bore the brunt of the increase in costs. Additionally, if importers substitute toward alternatives that are more expensive than their original suppliers, this can also cause prices to rise.\nThe extent to which this causes inflation depends on many factors. One consideration is the scope of the tariffs: The more widespread tariffs are, the greater the inflationary pressures will be. It also depends on how importers respond to higher costs: In 2018-2019, many U.S. importers did not pass on the full amount of their cost increase to their consumers, and increases in consumer prices are the traditional metric of inflation. In addition, movements in exchange rates can counteract direct increases in import prices. For example, the dollar typically strengthens after tariffs are imposed, making imports cheaper. Central banks might also respond to widespread tariffs with tighter interest rate policies, also tamping down inflationary pressures. The exact measure of inflation along with the path of tariff increases also matters, as a one-off increase in prices due to tariffs would disappear quickly from short-run measures of inflation. All told, tariffs lead to higher prices, but there are numerous possibilities for how exactly these higher prices may be reflected in overall consumer price inflation.\u201d\nJason Miller, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe importing entity pays the tariffs.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Does the U.S. benefit from tariffs on Mexico and Canada?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe U.S. certainly does not economically benefit from tariffs, as tariffs will increase costs (thus contributing to inflation) and disrupt production networks. Prior research documents that U.S. manufacturers that export who saw larger increases in tariffs for the goods they imported from China saw reduced exports in 2019; we would expect the same mechanism to work regarding Canada and Mexico.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs have any impact on prices of domestically produced goods?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cYes, especially in the case of metals such as steel and aluminum, domestic producers will increase their prices when foreign goods are subject to more tariffs. We saw this play out in 2018, as steel prices rose sharply that year, roughly 20%.\u201d\nDavid Ortega, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: How will tariffs impact the U.S. economy?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cTariffs function as taxes on imported goods, leading to increased costs for U.S. importers. These heightened costs often translate to higher prices for consumers and businesses relying on these imports to produce goods domestically.\"\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cImporters pay the tariff, which raises their costs, and this gets passed down in the form of higher prices.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Which products are going to cost more due to tariffs?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \"Tariffs will increase the price of food, especially for items that we rely on our trading partners like produce. At the grocery store, the impact will be felt more immediately on perishable products that we import. Food products like avocados, tomatoes, peppers, berries, cucumbers, etc. \u2014 these are products that have a relatively short shelf-life and for which we can\u2019t hold inventory for a prolonged period. Other food and beverage products like imported Mexican beer, tequila, Canadian maple syrup to name a few are likely to see prices increase when tariffs are imposed.\u201d\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of tariffs in action\nDepending on their scope and application, tariffs can be a source of tension between governments. If one country implements or raises tariffs on another country's goods, there's a risk that the second country will respond in kind.\nIn recent years, the U.S. and China have increased tariffs imposed on each other's products. The U.S. began raising tariffs in 2018 under President Donald Trump, notably implementing a 25% tariff on steel imported from China and raising duties on other materials and products. In turn, China implemented its own tariff hikes on a wide range of goods. The trade squabble between the two countries escalated quickly.\nAlthough a subsequent trade deal helped reduce tensions to an extent, many of the tariffs implemented at the beginning of the trade dispute remain in place. Despite increasingly adversarial relations, trade between the U.S. and China has continued to reach new highs."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at tasks that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nAI stocks are shares of companies that are developing or employing AI technology as part of their business. AI stocks span sectors like semiconductors, software, and even beyond tech, representing companies that are using AI in ways that set them apart from their peers.\nHow AI is used\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system on vast amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.\nFor instance, AI is used by Alphabet (GOOGL -0.89%) (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams.\nIt has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Meta AI. The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This technology allows AI to perform and complete whole tasks without being prompted. For instance, an automated customer service agent that could handle a request without needing human assistance would be agentic AI. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) AgentForce is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 top AI stocks\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less.\nGPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI.\nRevenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's been the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in July 2025. It also became the first company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand, and growth is expected to be strong in 2025 as well.\nNvidia's chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models (LLMs) require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) having launched its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities such as San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini -- its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT -- which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown, as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily.\nThe company said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\" New features, like AI assistant and AI mode, have helped Google Search defend its market share against AI-based challenges.\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it. Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures, with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform. The reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind, as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI. It has been adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1.\nThe long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race. The relationship continues to evolve, but Microsoft sees the start-up's technology as critical for its AI strategy.\nMicrosoft is harnessing the power of AI in other ways, too, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools. It launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, enabling its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it launched the first major AI IPO. Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost no revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounts for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft were to pull back on spending with the platform. In its first-quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nThe company announced plans for a $6 billion data center in July. It's also acquiring Core Scientific, which will bulk up its AI infrastructure with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in power capacity.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky, as CoreWeave has a high debt burden, large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but it's investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet. Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available on its apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and had 1 billion monthly active users as of May. Meta continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is involved in ad targeting as well, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through the devices.\nIn June, it acquired 49% of data-labeling specialist Scale AI for $14.8 billion and brought Scale CEO Alexandr Wang on to run an AI research lab at Meta. The tech giant has also made a number of smaller acquisitions in AI. Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas such as advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies. However, if you're looking for even more options, here are two others worth considering:\nPalantir\nPalantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data.\nIt also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure they become more useful.\nTesla\nTesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects.\nTesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028. While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly.\nAdditionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises, such as the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $4 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution, with components that are fueling AI applications and in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

Inflation data from the PPI and comments from Target and Home Depot suggest rising costs could keep the Fed from cutting rates, adding pressure on growth stocks. The sell\u2011off has mirrored broader tech sector weakness, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also slipping. Investors now question whether AMD\u2019s AI chip sales can sustain the valuation gains amid macro\u2011economic headwinds.",
