  "description": "The video was met with mixed reactions on social media.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nA video of former Superman actor Dean Cain tackling an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) obstacle course while training to join its ranks has garnered both praise and criticism online.\n\nCain gained fame in the 1990s playing Clark Kent in the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Cain was also the host of Ripley's Believe It or Not!\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last month launched a hiring push to bolster detention and deportation efforts, offering incentives including student loan forgiveness and signing bonuses of up to $50,000.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn a video shared by ICE, the 59-year-old could be seen dressed in dark gear and sunglasses as he cleared hurdles at a law enforcement training center in Georgia.\n\n\"TV's former 'man of steel' Dean Cain runs through the obstacle course during training to become an ICE officer at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia,\" the post from ICE said.\n\nIt was met with mixed reactions on social media, with some applauding the actor.\n\nTom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, which describes itself as a \"conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, which promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law,\" wrote in response: \"Thanks for stepping up, @RealDeanCain!\"\n\nX user @SFS150 remarked: \"Good for him! @RealDeanCain he stood up and took a stand and a side. Keep at it Mr. Cain!\"\n\nX user @CarlosBtnoCigar said: \"Superman @RealDeanCain putting in work! Thank you for your service, sir!\"\n\nOther posts were more critical, however.\n\n\"Looks like there might have been some kryptonite on the course,\" quipped X user @ASFleischman.\n\n\"It's not too late to delete this,\" posted OSINTdefender, a widely followed open source intelligence account.\n\n\"LMAO. We're living in the dumbest timeline,\" wrote @BlueATLGeorgia in response to the clip.\n\n\"This is an utter embarrassment,\" said X user @asmartbrunette1.\n\n\"While Dean Cain plays hero on screen, ICE's real-life villainy in detaining innocents and tearing families apart makes this stunt nothing but tone-deaf propaganda,\" @RichardAngwin posted in response.\n\nNewsweek contacted ICE for comment via email on Sunday.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nIn a video posted to X on August 5, Cain said: \"Hey everybody, Dean Cain here. For those who don't know, I am a sworn law enforcement officer, as well as being a filmmaker, and I felt it was important to join with our first responders to help secure the safety of all Americans, not just talk about it...\n\n\"Since President Trump took office, ICE has arrested hundreds of thousands of criminals including terrorists, rapists, murderers, pedophiles, MS-13 gang members, drug traffickers, you name it\u2014very dangerous people who are no longer on the streets.\"\n\nCain added: \"If you want to help save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America's streets. I like that. I voted for that.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe DHS recently removed age limits for new ICE recruits, lifting previous restrictions that specified applicants had to be at least 21 and no older than 37 or 40 depending on the role at the agency, Newsweek reported previously.\n\n\"We no longer have a cap on how old you can be or you can continue at age 18, sign up for ICE and join us and be a part of it. We'll get you trained and ready to be equipped to go out on the streets and help protect families,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox & Friends.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nIn an effort to attract more recruits, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is touting its student loan forgiveness program, along with up to $50,000 in signing bonuses.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the benefits were possible because of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), but loan forgiveness has been the agency's policy since the Biden administration, which expanded repayments in an effort to attract new agents.\nWhy It Matters\nTouting student loan forgiveness for ICE recruits comes as the Trump administration has sought to overturn former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness policies, some of which are on hold because of legal proceedings. The Department of Education has said it needs to reevaluate how it will restart the programs, if at all.\nWhat To Know\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Tuesday that it launched its recruitment campaign to seek out \"brave and heroic Americans\" to enforce immigration laws, specifically arresting and detaining suspected illegal immigrants.\nUnder the OBBBA, ICE has been allowed to hire thousands more agents and offer signing and retention bonuses to deliver on President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.\nWhile student loan repayment and forgiveness programs are not new and apply to many federal government workers, the offer could be appealing at a time when more widespread programs have been put on hold.\nThe Biden-era plans\u2014SAVE, Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and Pay As You Earn (PAYE)\u2014are on hold as of July because of court challenges regarding claims that Congress overstepped its authority by offering student loan forgiveness.\nWhen Trump's reconciliation bill was signed into law in early July, warnings were raised about the impact on college graduates, with the Student Debt Crisis Center saying that about 45 million Americans could be impacted by adjustments to various programs, as well as new repayment plans and caps on loans.\nAs for ICE, the agency has been empowered by the Trump White House to take bolder action on immigration enforcement, with a sharp rise in detentions under the previous budget and larger, targeted actions in communities across the U.S.\nDespite this, there has also been pressure to drastically increase deportation numbers, with the new budget likely to aid the effort once staffing is increased.\nWhat People Are Saying\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a press release: \"Your country is calling you to serve at ICE. In the wake of the Biden administration's failed immigration policies, your country needs dedicated men and women of ICE to get the worst of the worst criminals out of our country.\"\nPresident Donald Trump, on Truth Social: \"We need MORE courageous men and women to, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. Join ICE now. We will take GREAT care of you, just like you take care of us!\"\nWhat Happens Next\nDHS said recruitment materials would be distributed across major U.S. cities, with recruitment fairs and college campuses also targeted.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is scrapping the age limit for new Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruits as it ramps up hiring with a major funding boost from Congress.\nPreviously, applicants had to be at least 21 and no older than 37 or 40, depending on the role within the agency tasked with locating, arresting and detaining noncitizens lacking legal status.\nDHS made the announcement in a press release on Wednesday and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told \"Fox & Friends\" that applicants as young as 18 can now be \"trained and ready.\"\n\"We no longer have a cap on how old you can be or you can continue at age 18, sign up for ICE and join us and be a part of it. We'll get you trained and ready to be equipped to go out on the streets and help protect families,\" Noem said.\nTo lure candidates, ICE is offering incentives including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, student loan forgiveness, enhanced retirement benefits and extensive overtime opportunities.\nWhy It Matters\nICE is a key player in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts. Congress passed a spending bill earlier this summer to give the agency funds to hire 10,000 more staff.\nPolling shows varied opinions on immigration in the U.S. A Gallup poll taken in June found that 85 percent of Republicans agree with President Donald Trump's handling of the issue, compared with 28 percent of independents and 2 percent of Democrats.\nThe same survey found that 48 percent of Republicans believe immigration levels in the U.S. should be decreased. A 2024 survey reported that 88 percent of Republicans wanted to see a decline in immigration.\nWhat To Know\nDHS said that more than 80,000 candidates applied to join ICE less than one week from the launch of the department's recruitment efforts. Noem called the efforts \"extremely successful.\"\n\"It's overwhelming, to see the amount of response and support that our ICE officers have gotten and people who want to join their ranks,\" Noem said.\nThe department said it needs \"dedicated Americans to join ICE to remove the worst of the worst out of our country\" in a press release.\nWhat People Are Saying\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement: \"We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit.\"\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, in an X post: \"Calling all patriots. Submit your application TODAY.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe Department of Homeland Security said all recruits will be required to go through medical screening, drug screening and complete a physical fitness test.\nThis article includes reporting by the Associated Press.\nDo you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are at the center of the national discussion on the Trump administration's immigration efforts, with the agency set to receive billions more dollars in the coming months.\nWith plans to hire about 10,000 new ICE agents in the next four years, the White House is hoping to attract new talent through a series of benefits and incentives.\nNewsweek reached out to ICE for comment via email Friday morning.\nWhy It Matters\nICE is set to become the highest-funded part of federal government law enforcement, with a tripled yearly budget of about $30 million. While funds are pumped into an agency that has claimed to be stretched for several years, actions of its officers\u2014old and new\u2014are coming under increasing scrutiny.\nWhat To Know\nPresident Donald Trump's reconciliation bill set out in detail how extra funding will be used, with performance, retention and signing bonuses available for ICE agents and other new recruits across immigration enforcement.\nThe new funding will aid the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as it runs job fairs across the country, seeking to hire 10,000 new agents.\nHow Much Do ICE Agents Earn?\nThe government hiring website, USA Jobs, currently has openings for Deportation Officers, with vacancies in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.\nSalaries are being advertised as between $49,739 and $89,528 per year, with ICE stating that pay can be increased through overtime, as well as location-dependent additions.\nWill ICE Agents Get a Raise?\nIt was not clear if salaries will increase overall, but DHS has said that agents are set for a bonus.\nExisting agents, along with those with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), will get a $10,000 yearly bonus for the next four years. New agents will also get signing bonuses, similar to those introduced for Border Patrol officers under the Biden administration.\nThe new budget also included provisions for additional bonuses, with agents able to receive extra pay for their performance, as well as for their commitment to an additional two years with the agency.\nWhat Other Benefits Do ICE Agents Receive?\nICE staff, including agents, also receive benefits in line with other government workers.\nThey are entitled to health, dental, vision, life and long-term care insurance, along with retirement plans and flexible spending accounts.\nStaff are able to receive between 13 and 26 days of annual leave, along with paid personal leave and federal holidays.\nWhat People Are Saying\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a July 4 press release: \"This $165 billion in funding will help the Department of Homeland Security and our brave law enforcement further deliver on President Trump's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\"\nICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, in a statement on July 3: \"I speak on behalf of the entire agency when I say that ICE is grateful to President Trump for putting in the hard work necessary to get the Big Beautiful Bill across the finish line - but the real win is for the American people. The unprecedented funding for ICE will enable my hard-working officers and agents to continue making America safe again by identifying, arresting and removing criminal aliens from our communities. I'm thrilled to work with Secretary Noem, Congress and the president to protect our families, friends and neighbors.\"\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X, formerly Twitter: \"With this vote, Congress makes ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in history, with more money per year at its disposal over the next four years than the budgets of the FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons combined.\"\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, on BlueSky: \"I don't think anyone is prepared for what they just did w/ICE. This is not a simple budget increase. It is an explosion - making ICE bigger than the FBI, US Bureau of Prisons, DEA, & others combined.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nDHS is expected to continue recruitment through the summer, at least, with the Trump administration promising to hire enough agents and staff to deliver on the president's promise to deport about 1 million immigrants per year.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.

  "argos_summary": "Former Superman actor Dean Cain posted a video of himself tackling an ICE obstacle course while training to join the agency, sparking mixed reactions online\u2014some praised his commitment while others criticized ICE\u2019s enforcement tactics. The clip came amid a DHS recruitment push that offers student loan forgiveness, up to $50,000 signing bonuses, and has removed age limits for new recruits. ICE\u2019s campaign highlights its role in arresting and detaining alleged illegal immigrants, a stance that has drawn both support from conservative figures and condemnation from immigrant\u2011rights advocates. The controversy underscores the broader national debate over ICE\u2019s policies and the Trump\u2011era emphasis on aggressive immigration enforcement.",
