  "title": "Here's why serious photographers should still pick the Pixel 10 Pro over the Pixel 10",
  "description": "The Google Pixel 10 comes with a revamped tripple camera setup, but does the Pro model have anything extra to offer the serious photographer?",
  "content": "The new Pixels are here, and, to be frank, they\u2019re a bit of a mixed bag in terms of upgrades. Perhaps one of the most significant changes to last year\u2019s formula is that the Google Pixel 10 now features a third camera, bringing longer-range zoom capabilities to Google\u2019s more affordable model and bringing it closer to the best camera phones.\n\nFor the same $799 price tag as last year, the Pixel 10 has become much more appealing to the series\u2019 photography fans. But is there still a good reason to grab the Pixel 10 Pro or XL if you\u2019re an avid photographer \u2014 well, yes, but like most things, it depends on what you need.\n\nTriple cameras aren\u2019t all the same\n\nBut it\u2019s not the megapixels that I\u2019m really interested in. As you can see in the table above, the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro XL have larger image sensors in both the primary and ultrawide cameras. That means better light capture, less noise, and more detail. Is the difference between 1/2.0-inch and 1/1.3-inch meaningful? Well, yes, the larger sensor has over 2x the surface area with which to capture light. Equally, the Pixel 10\u2019s 1/3.1 ultrawide is positively tiny \u2014 it\u2019s smaller than the camera on the OG Pixel.\n\nNot only that, Google notes that the Pixel 10 Pro and XL boast improved stabilization on the main lens and autofocus for the ultrawide, both of which will help provide superior shooting in low light while capturing action shots. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10\u2019s ultrawide camera has no focusing capabilities, putting your shots at risk of additional softness at both close and far ranges. Likewise, the Pixel 10\u2019s selfie camera doesn\u2019t have autofocus, while the Pro and Pro XL do.\n\nSmaller sensors and apertures on the Pixel 10 mean you'll see slightly better results from the Pro.\n\nNow, how about that new Zoom camera? Well, again, the Pixel 10\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d telephoto camera is a 10.8MP 5x optical setup that appears to have been lifted straight from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which remains unchanged on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold as well. Once again, the Pixel 10 Pro and XL not only have more megapixels but a larger zoom sensor as well, ensuring better dynamic range and detail at a distance.\n\nPinching the zoom capabilities from the Fold isn\u2019t strictly a bad thing; it\u2019s a $1,900 phone after all. However, based on our previous experience with the Fold, we know that the image quality isn\u2019t quite as good, particularly in the trickiest lighting. Not that it\u2019s easy to notice at a casual glance, but the astute photographer, especially one who likes to edit their pictures, will see better results from the Pro models, particularly in low light.\n\nFor starters, the smaller Pixel 10 5x telephoto camera is able to extend out to 20x via Google\u2019s Super Res Zoom technology. That\u2019s as good as last year\u2019s Pro models, so certainly nothing to sniff at. However, Google is debuting 100x Pro Res Zoom on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, thanks in part to their zoom camera\u2019s high megapixel count. This isn\u2019t just a hardware trick; Google is running a diffusion model on the Pixel camera, thanks to the new Tensor G5, to fill in missing details.\n\n100x zoom is only available on the Pro and Pro XL.\n\nGoogle claims it works best for landscapes and landmarks at great distances, and still holds up well up to about 60x for animals and objects with more complex textures. While the jury is still out on whether using AI to enhance picture details works well, this tool is only available on Pro models.\n\nI don\u2019t take many close-up pictures, but for those who can\u2019t help but snap their morning coffee, macro focus is important too. Without autofocus on the ultrawide camera, the regular Pixel 10 is not as useful here either. Thankfully, Google has improved the main lens to allow for closer subject focusing, which should be fine for most uses. However, you can use macro focusing on the Pro models\u2019 ultrawide lens, allowing you to get even closer or fit more in the frame \u2014 a minor benefit, but a benefit nevertheless.\n\nPhotographers should pick a Pro. Well, except one\n\nWhile Google\u2019s Pro Pixels promise the best camera capabilities, there is one exception to this rule \u2014 the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Google\u2019s priciest flagship has a very similar camera setup to the regular Pixel 10. In fact, it has an even smaller ultrawide camera, again without autofocus, and is also capped at 20x for long-range zoom. Still fine, but not the best Google has to offer.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Pixel 10 or the Pro Fold have bad camera setups or should be avoided if you want to take great pictures. Even Google\u2019s more affordable hardware setups have proven extremely reliable and robust, especially when paired with the brand\u2019s computational photography smarts. Most likely, you\u2019ll only notice these differences when eyeballing the fine details.\n\nThe Pixel 10 offers most of Google's photography tools at a fraction of the Pro's price.",

Learn more.\nI've tested all the best camera phones of 2025: These are my top picks\nMay 29, 2025\nEvery smartphone claims to have the best camera money can buy, but which ones actually make the cut? To help you decide, I\u2019ve sifted my way through dozens of the best and most affordable camera phones, grading them on essential photography metrics like exposure, HDR capabilities, portrait quality, zoom capabilities, and video capture options. Whether you\u2019re shooting friends and family or documenting a trip abroad, these are the smartphones I think you should buy.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: The best camera phone overall\n- Excellent build quality, refined design\n- Stunning display\n- Extensive update policy\n- Sharp, powerful cameras\n- Improved wired charging\n- Clever Gemini features\n- Tensor still runs warm\n- Confusing charging situation\n- Only 128GB base storage\n- Check out our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL camera samples\nWhen it comes to snapping photos of friends and family, you seldom get a second chance to reframe the moment, so reliability and point-and-shoot simplicity are key. As such, it is no surprise that the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL (the camera hardware is exactly the same) take our top spot. Whether you\u2019re snapping wriggling toddlers or capturing the stage from the nosebleeds, I have extensively tested the Pixel 9 Pro XL and have always come away with great-looking pictures.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is equipped with a brilliant 50 megapixel primary sensor and Google\u2019s industry-renowned image processing capabilities, ensuring great-looking pictures no matter the lighting conditions. Paired with an ultrawide lens to fit more in and a 5x periscope camera capable of extending out to 30x zoom, Google\u2019s flagship phone is as versatile as they come. Whether you\u2019re after consistency and simplicity or a hardware package to get creative with, the Pixel has the tools you need.\nDuring my time with the phone, I\u2019ve been particularly impressed by the Pixel\u2019s ability to capture the action. When other phones come out blurry or miss the action completely, my Pixel 9 Pro XL grabs crystal clear shots. I always miss Top Shot\u2019s ability to pick the best-looking frame from a motion photo when testing out other smartphone cameras.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is the most consistent smartphone camera you can buy.\nSpeaking of, Google\u2019s photography prowess extends beyond camera hardware, leaning heavily on clever software and AI tricks to make your pics look their best. Astrophotography, Panorama shots, Action Pan, and Super Res Zoom are long-running staples that help you take your photography in more creative directions. Meanwhile, more unique tools like Add Me allow you to splice yourself back into the family photos you\u2019re usually left out of, while Cinematic Blur helps videographers capture sumptuous bokeh blur.\nIn addition to its brilliant camera, Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro XL is also a great phone. Its battery life will easily last through a busy day, its Tensor G5 processor provides responsive performance, and it has some of the industry\u2019s most powerful AI tools. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a great all-around pick, whether you\u2019re a serious photographer or just looking to capture the occasional moment. Starting at $999 for the Pro model, Google\u2019s best can also be grabbed for notably cheaper than other premium-tier camera phones, but we gave the XL the nod for its superior battery life and larger display \u2014 both of which are handy for dedicated photographers.\nXiaomi 15 Ultra: The best premium camera phone\n- Brilliant cameras\n- Two-day battery life\n- Fast universal charging\n- Solid update policy\n- Snapdragon overheats under load\n- Questionable AI features\n- HyperOS bloatware\n- Check out our Xiaomi 15 Ultra camera samples\nIf money is no obstacle (and you can actually buy the handset in your country), the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is my favorite camera phone on the market. It\u2019s not strictly always the most color-accurate, but boy, can this handset capture mood like no other phone I\u2019ve used. In fact, it\u2019s the only camera phone that has ever made me seriously question whether I really need my beloved Fuji mirrorless anymore.\nXiaomi has packed the best camera hardware available into this year\u2019s flagship. The eye-catching circular rear array features a 50MP, \u0192/1.63, 1-inch sensor flanked by a 50MP, \u0192/2.2, 115\u00b0 ultrawide, a 50MP, \u0192/1.8, 3x telephoto (70mm), and a colossal 200MP, \u0192/2.6, 4.3x periscope zoom (100mm) that offers deceptively long-range capabilities. In fact, I tested the phone against our best all-around camera picks and found the 15 Ultra to be by far the best at long-range photography. Videographers will also love the phone\u2019s 4K/60fps and 8K/30fps capabilities on all four lenses, as well as the 120fps option for the primary and 4.3x lenses.\nThe Xiaomi 15 Ultra makes me seriously question if I need a mirrorless camera.\nHowever, two aspects really make the 15 Ultra stand out in my eyes. First, its sumptuous colors. Xiaomi provides three color profiles as a base and many more filters to apply on top, making it easy to find a unique profile to call your own. The second is that 3x telephoto lens; its 70mm focal length is brilliant for natural-looking portraits, while the large sensor and wide aperture make this a brilliant lens for framing shots that look and feel much like shooting with a \u201cproper\u201d camera than the overly broad field of fiew from most phone\u2019s primary lens.\nIf I have one reservation about the phone, besides its sky-high price, it\u2019s the rather mediocre AI features that Xiaomi has crammed into the phone to make it seem like a cutting-edge software player. But if you can look past that guff and focus on the camera experience, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra can\u2019t be beat for image quality.\nGoogle Pixel 9a: The best value camera phone\n- Solid, reliable cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- Clever AI-powered features\n- Great battery life\n- New, streamlined design\n- Excellent price\n- Relatively slow charging\n- Aging Gorilla Glass 3 (again)\n- Missing Pixel Screenshots\n- Check out our Google Pixel 9a camera samples\nPoint-and-shoot consistency paired with intuitive yet comprehensive software tools makes it easy to recommend the Google Pixel 9a as the best camera phone to buy on a tighter budget. It might not have all the bells and whistles of its flagship siblings, but you\u2019ll be hard pressed to tell the difference between Google\u2019s two tiers most of the time.\nGoogle upgraded the Pixel 9a with a new 48MP primary camera with a wider \u0192/1.7 aperture. This new setup captures superb levels of detail and color, even in tricky lighting. The main lens also sports a new macro mode that produces eye-catching close-ups and handles 2x zoom without issue. It\u2019s a pretty versatile package. The lack of longer-range zoom and so-so ultrawide capabilities are the only real hardware drawbacks, but those are perfectly acceptable trade-offs when the primary camera looks this good for this price.\nThe Pixel 9a proves that flagship-consistency doesn't have to cost a fortune.\nMany of the same software benefits I mentioned for the Pixel 9 Pro also apply to the budget-friendly Pixel 9a. The rebuilt panorama feature, Add Me, and Long Exposure all make the cut, giving creative photographers plenty to play with. 4K60 and 1080p at 120fps video support means you can also capture high-quality clips without spending a fortune.\nBesides great-looking photos, the Pixel 9a has a lot else going for it. It\u2019s powered by a last-gen flagship processor \u2014 Google\u2019s Tensor G4 \u2014 and has superb battery life. Oh, and it\u2019ll receive the same seven years of updates as Google\u2019s Pro phones despite its affordable $499 price tag. There\u2019s a lot to love here, but especially the pictures.\nvivo X200 Pro: The best zoom camera\n- Great real-world performance\n- Good battery life\n- Telephoto camera is fantastic\n- Improved video quality\n- IP68/IP69 design\n- Relatively fast wired and wireless charging\n- Main camera has excess glare\n- Plenty of bloatware\n- Lags behind Samsung and Google for updates\n- Few on-device AI features\n- Throttles hard under extreme load\n- Check out our vivo X200 Pro review for camera samples\nMany phones already mentioned in this list can take great-looking pictures at a distance, but if you\u2019re after the absolute best, then the vivo X200 Pro (or the fancy Ultra) is the phone to grab. Boasting an f/2.3, 85mm periscope lens backed by a colossal 200MP 1/1.4-inch sensor, the handset captures impressive details at its native 3.7x optical zoom and crops in for much tighter frames without losing detail. We\u2019ve been impressed with the phone\u2019s results right out to 10x, but it can also take super-close-up macro photos from the same lens.\nIf you\u2019re really into wildlife-distance photography, vivo also sells a 200mm, f/2.3 extension lens for the Ultra\u2019s impressive main camera. Paired with a hybrid digital zoom, it can take pictures all the way out to 1,600mm. That\u2019s a huge distance, although the quality doesn\u2019t quite hold up that brilliantly at that range. Sadly, this accessory, just like the phone, is only available in China. Thankfully, you can grab the Pro model in some markets outside of China.\nvivo is making a name for itself with unbelievable long-range photography.\nThe rest of vivo\u2019s X200 Pro package is pretty great too. A huge battery, fast charging, and a powerhouse MediaTek Dimensity 9400 processor make for an extremely capable flagship. The phone\u2019s biggest drawback is its lack of long-term updates, so you might be better off sticking to one of the big Western brands if you plan to keep taking long-range photos for years to come.\nOnePlus 13: The best phone for selfies\n- Gorgeous design\n- Incredible camera zoom and overall photography\n- Helpful AI integration\n- Excellent charging options\n- Simplified Oxygen OS experience\n- Great performance\n- Magnetic charging requires accessories\n- Fewer updates than Samsung or Google\n- Check out our Google Pixel 9a camera samples\nWhen I tested the best phones for portrait photography, OPPO\u2019s Find X8 Pro performed brilliantly for selfies, producing natural skin tones and great details across lighting conditions. That\u2019s everything you want from a great front-facing camera. However, I\u2019d actually recommend that selfie-lovers buy the OnePlus 13 instead. Why? Well, it\u2019s a little less expensive, which is always a plus, and has the same selfie camera and capabilities as the OPPO. OnePlus is essentially its sister brand, after all.\nWhat makes the OnePlus 13 particularly well suited for selfies is its excellent HDR capabilities, so you won\u2019t look washed out even when shooting into bright light. Its low-light performance is also robust, and the phone offers sumptuous portrait lighting and blur options to make your photos look their best.\nThe OnePlus 13 takes great selfies no matter the lighting.\nAs a broader photography package, the OnePlus 13 also has a lot going for it. Surprisingly brilliant long-range zoom capabilities, stunning portraits, and robust video recording capabilities almost made this our best overall pick. Its new shooting modes excel in tricky lighting conditions, and it boasts impressive zoom capabilities for a seemingly humble 3x telephoto lens. Oh, and it\u2019s a lickety quick when it comes to performance and charging, too.\nAfter years of shaky photography, the OnePlus 13 nails a superb triple camera setup at a price that undercuts the competition. Don\u2019t let the price fool you, this phone can take the fight to any camera phone on this list.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: The best phone for video\n- Great size\n- Excellent hardware\n- Flexible cameras\n- Solid software support\n- Durable build quality\n- Some helpful iOS 18 improvements\n- Slow wired charging\n- Mediocre battery life\n- No Apple Intelligence until long after launch\n- Check out our iPhone 16 Pro review for camera samples\nWhen you want to capture stunning-looking video, Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro (or the larger Pro Max) is the best choice on the market right now. Powered by a 48MP primary camera with sensor-shift OIS and a 12MP 120mm, 5x optical periscope zoom camera with the same robust stabilization hardware, you don\u2019t need to worry about shaky-handcam footage even when you\u2019re cropping in on a fast-moving subject.\nGranted, the latest iPhones don\u2019t record in 8K like some top-tier Android rivals, but resolution is far from everything. 4K 120fps is more than most will ever need, even for fast-paced action. Furthermore, Apple\u2019s unique combination of robust stabilization, cinematic-quality processing, and impressive low-light capture is what really makes the Pro stand out from the crowd as a brilliant pick for videographers.\nHigh quality footable and professional file formats make the iPhone a top choice for video.\nFor the really serious content creator, the latest iPhone can record high-res RAW video footage straight to external storage via USB-C. Paired with 10-bit Pro Res video, log file recording, and cinematic modes, you\u2019ve got all the makings of professional-looking footage in the palm of your hand.\nHonorable mentions\nWe can\u2019t mention camera versatility without the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It\u2019s not the absolute best like previous generations have been, but whether you\u2019re shooting portraits, landscapes, or something far off in the distance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has the lenses and quality to capture pictures you won\u2019t be disappointed in.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make video content with an Android phone, Sony\u2019s new Xperia 1 VII will be right up your street. With powerful hardware backed by Sony\u2019s Pro Video software, packed with metering, temperature, white balance, audio, and other controls that professionals will love. Oh, and it\u2019s bundled with live streaming options too.\nAnother of China\u2019s finest, the OPPO Find X8 Ultra is a hardware powerhouse. It has a one-inch primary sensor, huge 3x and 6x zoom sensors, and an ultrawide combination that only Xiaomi can rival. Sadly, it\u2019s a China-only affair, but many regions can get their hands on the similarly brilliant OPPO Find X8 Pro, which costs a little bit less as well.\nIt was an incredibly close call between the Pixel 9a and the Phone 3a Pro for our best value pick, but the latter\u2019s shaky US carrier availability is an issue. Still, the 3a Pro offers additional camera flexibility over the 9a, thanks to its dedicated 3x 50MP telephoto camera. Paired with a 50MP primary sensor, it\u2019s a versatile package that performs well in low light at longer distances. Overall, it\u2019s a pretty great camera setup for such an affordable phone.\nIt\u2019s not quite as affordable as the other value-centric options on our list, but the Galaxy S24 FE has a versatile triple camera setup that really isn\u2019t far from the superb quality of a flagship phone. It\u2019s a bargain that makes you wonder if you really need to spring for the Galaxy S25.\nAnother brilliant camera package that won\u2019t absolutely break the bank; the Google Pixel 9 Pro\u2018s camera suite mirrors the XL model, including the 5x periscope lens. It takes great pictures at its optical focal length and performs admirably at 10x and even a tad beyond. Want the overall best but in a smaller form factor? The Pixel 9 Pro is your pick.\nWhat to look for in a good camera phone\nAs you can probably tell from this best list, there\u2019s a huge range of smartphone camera hardware on the market. Picking the right combination for you really boils down to the type of pictures you\u2019re trying to capture on a regular basis.\nIf you love landscapes, find a camera with a great ultrawide lens. If you\u2019re more of a people person, a phone with a portrait-friendly focal length is the way to go. But don\u2019t fret about the megapixel or lens count; finding the best camera is more about nailing the fundamentals within your set budget than having the absolute latest and greatest of everything.\nConsistency is key when it comes to picking a camera phone suitable for any occasion.\nNo matter what your preference, I have some essential camera purchasing tips that I recommend for absolutely everyone:\n- Sensor size over megapixels: Megapixels are good for cropping in on detail, but you only need 12MP to print most pictures on a good-sized canvas. Instead, the size of the phone\u2019s image sensor is likely to be a far bigger factor in terms of image quality. Bigger sensors capture more light, which results in better dynamic range and less noise in low light. While a 1-inch sensor might be top of the line, 1/1.4 or above is considered very good.\n- Three cameras for versatility: If you\u2019re looking for a phone capable of taking the perfect picture in any scenario, you\u2019ll want more than a single camera. Wide, ultrawide, and telephoto zoom combinations are very popular on high-end models, allowing you to capture broad landscapes or zoom right in on distant details. Some ultra-premium models include periscope cameras as well, allowing for even longer-range zoom.\n- Optical zoom over digital zoom: Brands love to tout long-range zoom credentials like 30x or 100x capabilities, but these are always digital zoom and look, frankly, rubbish. Instead, eyeball the phone\u2019s optical zoom capabilities (usually 3x, 5x, or 10x) and double that for a realistic maximum zoom distance with reasonable quality.\n- Don\u2019t bother with macro lenses: Keen to capitalize on the multi-camera trend, some affordable phones include additional cameras that aren\u2019t all that useful. The macro lens is a popular option, but it often comes with horrendously reduced specs, such as a tiny aperture and low resolution. Just ask yourself, how regularly are you really going to point your phone super-close up at anything?\n- A 50-70mm lens for portraits: If you\u2019re planning to take lots of pictures of friends, family, and pets, you\u2019ll want a phone with a good telephoto camera with a focal length in the region of 50-80mm. Why? Well, a lens of that focal length does two important things: it captures realistic face shapes that aren\u2019t too narrow or too wide and adds natural bokeh that makes your subject stand out from the background.\n- Selfie cameras that aren\u2019t too wide: I know we all want to fit our friends and family, but any camera (front or back) boasting a sub-22mm focal length or greater than 120-degree field of view will look warped and horrible. Trust me, pick something a little narrower and your photos will look better.\nWhy you should trust me\nI love photography. I\u2019ve been professionally testing smartphone cameras for years, having reviewed my way through the transition from the humble single camera to the triple and quadruple behemoths found on today\u2019s top-of-the-line flagships. I\u2019m attached at the hip to my Fuji mirrorless and constantly striving to find a smartphone camera that can close the quality gap. Equally, I can chat your ear off about the pros and cons of quad-bayer filters and why aperture isn\u2019t everything when it comes to long-range zoom.\nFrom the very best camera flagships to budget-friendly models, I've shot with everything.\nSo, let\u2019s just say I know what goes into making a good photo, both the hardware and the software. But picking out the right phone when you have to compromise on budgets and size is difficult. I make my judgment calls by first sifting through the huge range of options on the market, digging through their specs and features to find combinations that look top-tier across various price points.\nThen, I dive into the massive range of snaps from our review time with these models, sorting out the good pictures from the bad across ultrawide, portrait, low light, selfie, and various other shooting scenarios. You\u2019ll probably have spotted numerous camera shootouts I\u2019ve conducted for the site, where I pit phones side by side to see which comes out on top when taking photos of exactly the same subjects.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to look at the camera strengths (and weaknesses), the price, and the bigger smartphone picture, and decide which phones will best serve your needs.\nWhat do you look for in the best camera phones?\nSmartphone camera technology continues to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in a pocketable form factor. As such, I carefully reevaluate our recommended picks every few months, taking into account what the latest and greatest innovations and weighing them against the broader market and what\u2019s actually a sensible sweet spot to spend your money on.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nPixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL debut as Google's most ambitious lineup yet\nAugust 20, 2025\nYear after year, Google has given us good reason to consider its latest Pixel lineup among the best Android phones you can buy. And while the company pushes both its hardware and software to new limits with each subsequent generation, this year, the Pixel 10 series has got to represent one of the biggest, boldest steps forward for the phones yet.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve got four new additions to the Pixel family to check out, with the launch of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We\u2019re giving the new foldable some special attention of its own, but right now, let\u2019s break down exactly what you can expect from the three new traditional models forming this year\u2019s Pixel lineup.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nBest specs and AI features\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 10 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 10 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a3,1,099\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (1TB): $1,449 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting the Pixel 10 series for ages now, and back in July, Google finally set the date for this season\u2019s Made By Google event. Today, with August 20 finally rolling around, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s chance to officially check out the new family, with Google showing them all off at its Brooklyn launch extravaganza.\nWhile this year introduces some important changes for the hardware that make up Google\u2019s Pixel phones, pricing is blessedly remaining consistent with last year\u2019s Pixel 9 devices, starting at just under $800 for the 128GB base model \u2014 and moving up from there.\nPre-orders for the new handsets open up today, so if you like what you see here, you don\u2019t have to waste any time getting the ball rolling on making a Pixel 10 model your next daily driver. For all three of these non-folding Pixels, regular retail availability kicks off next week, on August 28.\nGoogle is once again making its latest Pixel phones available to global audiences, kicking sales of the Pixel 10 series off in all the usual markets, with the addition of Mexico this time around. But this year, there\u2019s an important new distinction to be aware of regarding the hardware coming to the US versus the rest of the world \u2014 more on that in just a moment.\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Specs\nGoogle\u2019s definitely not going back to the drawing board with the Pixel 10 phones, and at a glance, it can be quite tricky to tell the new family apart from the last generation. But even with that approach to design remaining consistent, the manufacturer hasn\u2019t been afraid to deliver some impactful changes to the hardware you\u2019ll find within.\nWe\u2019ll be covering some of those more important differences in a little more depth, but here\u2019s your bird\u2019s-eye view at how all this hardware compares across the lineup:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | Pixel 10

new phone is imaging performance, raw speed, or excellent power management, you should be able to find something about these Pixel 10 phones to make them worthy of consideration. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights.\nCamera\nSome phones really go all-in on camera hardware, and it\u2019s no surprise to see these models with beefy sensors and crazy periscopic zoom options on our list of best camera phones. But even without really jaw-dropping hardware, we also see Google\u2019s Pixel phones join those right up at the top, year after year, thanks in no small part to Google\u2019s exceptional image-processing prowess.\nMaybe the biggest news this year is the arrival of a telephoto option for the base Pixel 10, getting a 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom. Google tries to sell that for a little more than it is, highlighting \u201cup to 10x optical quality\u201d and capable of even tighter zooms with Super Res processing, but we\u2019d be happy either way.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWith the Pro models, Google doubles down on that sentiment. Here it pairs a 48MP sensor with that 5x optical zoom, and the company claims this offers the highest-quality zoom you\u2019ll get of any smartphone being sold to US shoppers. Similarly, it\u2019s pushing processing to new heights, with these two boasting Pro Res Zoom up to 100x. That\u2019s optimized for the new Tensor G5 processor, and operates using an advanced diffusion model.\nIn addition to the fancy new zoom capabilities, you can expect some solid improvements to optical stabilization quality and auto-focus speed.\nPerformance\nOK, now we\u2019re getting into it. When your smartphone-obsessed friend advised you to hold off buying that Pixel 9 and wait for the Pixel 10 series, this is likely what they looking forward to: the Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle\u2019s been building Pixel phones around its custom-designed Tensor processors for years now, but with this generation the company moves from Samsung to TSMC as its manufacturing partner \u2014 and as a consequence, jumps from the 4nm process it employed across the past two chips down to 3nm for the G5.\nGoogle's got more to prove than ever this year, with all eyes on the Tensor G5 and its performance.\nUnsurprisingly, this chip is heavily focused on AI capabilities. It can run on-device models with the help of an upgraded TPU, which Google says is 60% more powerful than before. That new production node doesn\u2019t just help the Tensor G5 run on average 34% faster but also aids in keeping power consumption down. And in case you haven\u2019t picked up on it from those incredible camera tricks we were just touching on, this chip\u2019s got an upgraded image processor on board.\nUnlike last year, we\u2019re not getting any big shake-ups when it comes to memory configuration. Google is sticking with the same 12GB for the base Pixel 10 and 16GB on the Pro and Pro XL. We\u2019d love seeing 16GB across the board, but the lack of motion here isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nYour storage choices also remain largely consistent with the new Pixel 10 generation, still starting down at 128GB, but this time Google drops the 128GB option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL, starting at 256GB, instead \u2014 honestly, a trend we wouldn\u2019t hate to see trickle down to the rest of the phones.\nScreen quality and size\nGoogle\u2019s also sticking with what works when it comes to screen size and resolution, returning with the same 6.3-inch sizes on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, and a 6.8-inch panel on the Pro XL. On the smallest Pixel 10, that spells a pixel density of around 420ppi, while you\u2019ll enjoy a slightly sharper image closer to 490ppi on the Pro models. All three support Smooth Display output at up to 120Hz, but only the Pro models can also dial that down as low as 1Hz for power saving.\nPeak brightness should be about 10% higher this time around, from what Google calls \u201cbest in class\u201d Actua displays \u2014 and better yet, the company claims we\u2019ll get those brighter screens without feeling the impact on battery life. Just like we had with the Pixel 9 series, Google is tapping Corning for some Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nWhile last year brought us a major new look, with that new pill-shaped camera island on the back, the Pixel 10 is very much a smartphone cast in the physical mold of its predecessor. And comparing the sizes of these three phones against their Pixel 9 equivalents, the differences are absolutely minuscule: Really, the only distinction you\u2019ll measure is the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro each coming in a tenth of a millimeter thicker than last year.\nThere is, admittedly, a little heft being added this time around, but it\u2019s on a scale that might be too minor to notice outside of holding one phone in each hand \u2014 maxing out at an 11g difference with the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nJust like on the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects the hardware around back, with a sturdy aluminum frame making up the middle of our smartphone sandwich. And as we\u2019d only expect, all three carry an IP68 ingress rating, so they\u2019ll have no trouble surviving a brief dunk.\nWhat's your favorite Pixel 10 series color?\nThe question of best Pixel colors is a contentious one, granted, and this year you\u2019ve got your choice of four no matter which Pixel you go with. In addition to the expected assortment of neutral tones, we get a few fun options, like Indigo and Lemongrass on the smallest Pixel 10 and Jade available for the Pro and Pro XL.\nDepending on where you get your Pixel 10, you may notice a low-key omission from the phone\u2019s expected design. For Pixel 10 series phones sold in the US, this year, Google is taking the unprecedented step of going eSIM-only: The phones will lack a traditional tray for a physical SIM card. While some users might not blink twice at that, those who rely upon the flexibility of physical SIMs (especially when traveling) could run into trouble \u2014 so be advised.\nBattery life and charging speed\nHere\u2019s one area in particular where we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic this year \u2014 even if that\u2019s one word that\u2019s just positively fraught to throw around when we\u2019re talking all things battery. Instead of making one big change, Google has implemented several, and with any luck, they\u2019ll all add up to make the Pixel 10 series some real endurance champions.\nGoogle started by lowering power demands from phone components, with parts like the 3nm Tensor G5 chip and the updated Actua displays promising to merely sip away at battery capacity. On its own, that might not deliver in the way users hope, but Google pairs that with higher-capacity batteries across the board.\nNow, those gains themselves are a little minor: 270mAh higher on the Pixel 10, 170mAh higher with the 10 Pro, and up 140mAh on the Pro XL. But they are absolutely progressing in the right direction, and we will take all the extra juice phone manufacturers are willing to offer. Maybe most interesting, though, is that this year the little Pixel 10 actually manages to push past the Pro in terms of raw capacity \u2014 even though the phones are the same size, we guess not having a few of those Pro upgrades left room within for some extra battery.\nThat\u2019s consumption and capacity for you, but maybe Google\u2019s biggest win with power on the Pixel 10 series will come from how you recharge them.\nWith this generation, Google is finally giving users a full-featured wireless charging experience, and that means Qi2 support, complete with built-in magnets for secure attachment \u2014 no case required. The company is taking full advantage of this by introducing new Pixelsnap branding for accessories designed to tap into it \u2014 including a long-overdue successor to the Pixel Stand. You\u2019ll enjoy 15W wireless speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pro, while the Pro XL supports even speedier Qi2.2 25W charging.\nWired charging also gets a boost across the lineup, going from 27W to 30W for the Pixel 10 and Pro, while climbing from 37W to 45W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Google says that users should expect over 30 hours of battery life, and between all these upgrades, that sounds like it just might be within the realm of possibility.\nSoftware and updates\nUnlike last year, when the Pixel 9 phones arrived still running Android 14, Google has sorted out its development cycle, and Android 16 has arrived well in time to show up at home on the Pixel 10 phones. And with seven years of updates in the pipeline, you\u2019ll be running new Android releases well into the next decade.\nJust like everything Google touches these days, the Pixel 10 series is chock full of Gemini AI-powered features \u2014 including a full year of free access to Google AI Pro with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. Gemini Live is picking up some cool-sounding new tricks, like highlighting stuff in your camera to show you, and the Phone app is adding an impressive real-time translation tool.\nWe finally get to meet what would have been Pixel Sense with the introduction of Magic Cue, an AI-powered assistant with awareness of what you\u2019re working on with your phone, and the ability to offer suggested actions you may want to take next. In case that sounds like a step too far, Google\u2019s privacy controls will let you decide just how much of your data you want AI having access to.\nYou\u2019d have to be living in a cave not to understand how popular journaling is these days. Rather than forcing you to jot your thoughts down in something like Keep, Google\u2019s now offering a dedicated solution in the form of the new Pixel Journal app \u2014 complete with PIN protection to keep your private thoughts private.\nThere\u2019s tons more, too, from Call Message offering a hand dealing with your missed calls to Pixel Studio upgrades, new NotebookLM integration with Pixel Recorder and Screenshots, and Camera Coach helping you get your best shots yet. It\u2019s the new Pixel, after all! This is Google\u2019s biggest chance to show off all year! If you don\u2019t want to miss out on that experience, make sure to get your pre-order in now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Pixel 10's Camera Coach helps you get better at taking photos\nCamera Coach is basically the photography teacher you never had.\nBy\n\u2022\nAugust 20, 2025\n\u2022\n\u2022\nTL;DR\nThe newly announced Google Pixel 10 phones offer a Camera Coach feature.\nThis uses on-device AI to analyze your scene and make step-by-step shooting suggestions.\nThe feature can suggest you try different angles and framing, ask the subject to look at the camera, and more.\nGoogle has just announced the Pixel 10 series of phones, and there are plenty of features worth knowing. However, one of the most intriguing camera-related additions is a so-called Camera Coach feature.\nCamera Coach is a feature within the Pixel Camera app that uses on-device AI models and reference images to analyze your scene and make step-by-step shooting suggestions. These suggestions include trying different angles and framing, moving closer, switching camera modes, asking the subject to look at the camera, and more. The feature even generates reference images from your scene and lets you choose them so you can capture a similar-looking snap.\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\nIn any event, this seems like a pretty cool feature for newbies who need some photography tips. However, I imagine that this could also be handy for experienced smartphone photographers who just want a few more shooting ideas.\nCamera Coach also seems like a natural evolution of Google\u2019s long-standing framing hints feature on Pixel phones. This feature offers a few on-screen tips and tools, such as a level guide, prompts to try a different mode (e.g., portrait mode for selfies), and alignment help for top-down shots (e.g., documents).\nGoogle says Camera Coach is launching in preview on the Pixel 10 series. However, there\u2019s no word on whether this feature will come to older Pixel phones like the Pixel 9 series.\nVery promising battery specs \u2022 6.3-inch display \u2022 Loaded with Google AI features\nMSRP: $799.00\nBaseline excellence.\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the 6.3-inch base model of the in-house Android phones from Google. With plenty of high-speed storage options, a good amount of RAM, and the all-new Tensor G5 processor, it should blow through your mobile computing tasks with ease. A triple camera system includes standalone ultrawide and telephoto lenses, and a 50MP main sensor.\nTop-tier specs with small display \u2022 Satellite SOS \u2022 Powerful AI tools \u2022 Bright display\nMSRP: $999.00\nMore power in the smaller form-factor\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro marks a new trend. As the medium model in the Pixel 10 line, it offers top-tier specifications with the smaller 6.3-inch display. Diverging from previous Pixel series' trend of the medium phone being a large display with low-tier specs. We're excited for the Tensor G5 chipset, high-resolution display, UFS 4.0 storage options, big 16GB of RAM, and the AI-powered triple camera setup with 50MP main sensor.\nBiggest non-folding Pixel phone \u2022 Best specs and AI features\nMSRP: $1,199.00\nUltimate power from the Pixel 10 line\nThe most powerful option from the Pixel 10 line is the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. With a 6.8-inch display, Tensor G5 shipset, 16GB of RAM, UFS 4.0 storage options, a powerful triple camera setup, and a battery in excess of 5,000mAh, you should be able to power through any task in your day.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold combines a 6.4-inch front display with a folding 8-inch inner panel for two capable viewing experiences. With the Tensor G5 shipset, 16GB of RAM, and lots of UFS 4.0 storage options, it matches the Pixel 10 Pro XL in terms of specifications and performance. The folding phone also offers a triple camera setup, plenty of powerful AI features, wireless charging, and an IP68 rating."

Learn more.\nGoogle announces Tensor G5: What's new with the Pixel 10 processor?\nAugust 20, 2025\nGoogle has just announced the Pixel 10 series, and all four phones are powered by the Tensor G5 processor. Tensor chips have traditionally enabled a variety of great Pixel-only features, but have also lagged behind rivals when it comes to peak horsepower and efficiency.\nNevertheless, the Tensor G5 is a landmark processor for the company as it\u2019s the first Tensor chip made by TSMC instead of long-time partner Samsung. So what do we know about this silicon?\nA cooler, more frugal Pixel chip (in theory)\nFor starters, the Tensor G5 is made by TSMC on its 3nm process. Google didn\u2019t identify the specific process used, but this switch from Samsung to TSMC is still good news for Pixel owners.\nTSMC has traditionally been more adept at chip manufacturing than Samsung. This previously resulted in chips that were more efficient and powerful than the same chip produced by Samsung. Google hasn\u2019t detailed specific efficiency improvements over the Samsung-made Tensor G4.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Google says the Pixel 10 phones enjoy \u201c30+ hours\u201d of battery life compared to the Pixel 9 range\u2019s \u201c24+ hours.\u201d This is at least partially explained by the new phones\u2019 slightly larger batteries, and we\u2019re guessing other components are more efficient too. But the Tensor G5 will likely play a significant role here, too.\nMany previous Pixel phones have also been plagued by heating issues, even when performing less demanding scenarios and tasks. The good news is that Google says it\u2019s upgraded the \u201chardware and software thermal controls\u201d to allow the chipset to run at higher clock speeds without throttling. Google specifically told Android Authority that the standard Pixel 10 has a \u201cgraphite thermal solution\u201d while the Pro models have vapor chamber cooling. There\u2019s no word if the vapor chambers are larger this time. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if these measures bear fruit or if heating problems persist.\nConnectivity was another issue that plagued early Tensor-powered Pixels. Google seemingly got on top of the issues last year thanks to the new Exynos Modem 5400. So what\u2019s new this time?\n\u201cBuilding on last year\u2019s new modem, we are further optimizing this experience with software refinements,\u201d the company told us, suggesting that the Exynos Modem 5400 has been carried over from the Pixel 9 family.\nTensor G5 CPU and GPU: Why so quiet, Google?\nThe Tensor G5 offers a revised CPU layout compared to the Tensor G4. Google only noted during press briefings that the CPU consists of one big core, five medium cores, and two little cores. This would be a significant layout change over last year\u2019s chip, which had one big core, three medium cores, and four little cores.\nThe company didn\u2019t name the specific cores used or the clock speed. Nevertheless, Google later confirmed to us that the CPU has been upgraded to the \u201clatest generation midcore IPs.\u201d This suggests that the Tensor G5 is using Cortex-A725 cores at the very least. This would partially line up with our previous exclusive leak, which revealed one Cortex-X4 core, five Cortex-A725 cores, and two Cortex-A520 cores.\nSo what does this actually mean for CPU performance? Google claims the CPU is 34% faster on average than the Pixel 9\u2019s chip. The company didn\u2019t clarify whether this figure applied to single- or multi-core performance, although I expect much better multi-core performance thanks to the newer, more numerous middle cores. However, I\u2019m not expecting the Tensor G5 to beat the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and Qualcomm\u2019s custom Kryo cores.\nThe Tensor G5 enjoys a welcome multi-core CPU performance boost, but Google is suspiciously quiet on the GPU front.\nWhat about the GPU, though? Google didn\u2019t reveal any concrete information about the Tensor G5 GPU during its briefings, merely noting that it features \u201cupdated\u201d GPU IP. The company also claimed that the Pixel 10 series ran many top games \u201cvery very well\u201d during internal testing. Nevertheless, these vague statements aren\u2019t a good sign if you were expecting a performance or efficiency upgrade.\nOur previous Tensor G5 leak points to an Imagination DXT-48-1536 GPU, but we\u2019ll need to confirm this with review units. That would be a major departure from Arm\u2019s Mali GPU technology, which has been used since the first Tensor processor. Google also told us the Tensor G5 GPU doesn\u2019t support ray tracing.\nQualcomm\u2019s Adreno GPUs and Arm\u2019s Mali graphics rule the roost as far as gaming and emulator support goes. So don\u2019t be surprised if your Pixel 10 phone has compatibility issues with a few games and apps.\nAI and imaging\nAI has become a key focal point for smartphone processors, so what does Google offer in this regard? The company claims that the Tensor G5\u2019s TPU is up to 60% more powerful. Google says these gains are the result of architectural upgrades, such as more compute blocks, and a higher frequency. The nebulous nature of AI benchmarking means it\u2019s still a little tough to tell how the Tensor G5\u2019s AI horsepower compares to rival chips.\nNevertheless, Google says the Pixel 10 series supports a so-called Matryoshka transformer model, in reference to Russian nesting dolls. In any event, this architecture enables a smaller, speed-optimized AI model (two billion \u201ceffective\u201d parameters) to be nested within a larger, quality-focused model (four billion \u201ceffective\u201d parameters). The company says this approach means the phone doesn\u2019t need two separate models, allowing apps to \u201cdynamically\u201d choose between the full model and sub-model.\nThe Tensor G5 has supercharged AI hardware, and supports some interesting AI model tricks.\nInterestingly, Google explained to us that the submodel actually has five billion parameters while the full model actually has eight billion parameters. However, some of these parameters aren\u2019t loaded into RAM. Instead, the Pixel maker uses per-layer embedding tech to pull these parameters in from flash storage in \u201ctiny increments.\u201d\nSo what do these improvements mean for AI performance? Well, Google claims that the latest Gemini Nano model running on the Tensor G5 is 2.6x faster and twice as efficient as the Pixel 9\u2019s Tensor G4 for tasks like Pixel Screenshots and the Recorder app. The search giant also claims that the token window (how much input the model can process at once) has increased from 12,000 on the Tensor G4 to 32,000 on the new chip. Google says this larger token window is broadly equivalent to 100 screenshots or a month\u2019s worth of emails.\nWhat do you think of the Pixel 10's chipset so far?\nThe improved AI silicon enables \u201cover 20 unique experiences\u201d at launch, with Google saying there\u2019s more to come. Some of the more notable on-device features include 100x Pro Res Zoom, voice translations during phone calls (in the person\u2019s voice), a Personal Journal app, Magic Cue, and more.\nThe Tensor G5\u2019s image signal processor (ISP) has also been redesigned and works more closely with the digital signal processor. MediaTek and Qualcomm have taken similar approaches over the last few generations, drawing their ISPs and AI silicon closer together.\nGoogle claims the chipset supports \u201cadvanced\u201d segmentation to identify objects and details in a scene. It gave the example of segmentation being used in a portrait shot to identify skin, lips, eyes, and more for a more accurate image. Again, this isn\u2019t anything new, as rivals have long offered advanced and even real-time scene segmentation in photos and videos. Nevertheless, I\u2019m glad to see Pixels with these upgraded capabilities.\nGoogle\u2019s new ISP also enables a couple of video-related improvements, namely reduced blur in low-light videos, and 10-bit HDR by default for 1080p and 4K/30fps video capture. Unfortunately, you still have to rely on the cloud-based Video Boost feature for 8K video capture as Google chooses to skip local 8K recording on its phones.\nBig questions remain about Tensor G5\nIt\u2019s hard to come to a firm conclusion about the Tensor G5 in the absence of some basic details. The company\u2019s refusal to mention any GPU gains compared to the Pixel 9 series suggests that performance hasn\u2019t changed, or that even a downgrade could be on the cards. We\u2019ll also have to wait for review units to see whether the switch to TSMC has paid off in terms of battery life and if Google has definitively addressed heating problems.\nOne thing is for sure, though. Google\u2019s Tensor processors have never really focused on peak performance or benchmarks. I\u2019m not expecting this to change with the Tensor G5 and Pixel 10 series.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nBest specs and AI features\nThank you for being part of our community.
