      "feedback": "This analysis has solid anchors (tariff enforcement via DOJs push to criminal tariff evasion; the Goodyear tariff-cost channel; the UK DCTS with Sri Lanka and Asia Cumulation; and Sri Lanka’s June 2025 UK export momentum) but it lacks a disciplined 3–6 month scenario map, explicit triggers/invalidations, and quantified transmission paths; it also underweights several critical sources and misses clear base/alternative paths. Actionable edits: restructure into a tight scenario map for 3–6 months with (i) base case, (ii) alt 1 (tariff authority constrained or narrowed by appellate/Supreme Court outcomes), (iii) alt 2 (UK DCTS rollout accelerates or delivers larger-than-expected uplift for Sri Lankan apparel). For each, specify timing windows (e.g., July 31 oral arguments on OFY11YO0I; potential Supreme Court action in fall 2025; UK DCTS early 2026), path-dependency (how outcomes change flows and pricing decisions if rulings swing either direction), and end-state implications for trade flows and valuations. Quantify channels with concrete numbers: use Goodyear’s ~$350m annualized tariff cost and the 4$/tire rough pass-through to gauge import-cost pressure, and link the Sri Lanka UK uplift to the June 2025 20.4%/to $67.33m UK apparel exports, plus employment/macro contribution from WLXM1819K, to ground demand impact; provide a plausible sensitivity (e.g., 0–20% UK apparel uplift from DCTS given current momentum; 10–40% upside if inputs can source globally within Asia Regional Cumulation). Incorporate corroborating context from Canada–U.S. trade (CUSMA) as a potential tailwind easing some tariff exposures (Source 2) and explicitly reconcile conflicts between sources (e.g., DOJ enforcement tone vs. court-ordered stays). Strengthen the narrative by mapping causal links: policy shock (tariffs) → cost pass-through and pricing pressure (AJTHKYXQ3) → corporate hedges/adjustments (Goodyear supply-chain rework; AKR layoffs) → routing of sourcing and trade through cumulation schemes (WLXM1819K) → observable demand signals in UK Sri Lanka apparel (20.4% growth; 439.39m June 2025). Finally, label confidence as moderate (given explicit catalysts) and add 1–2 watch-list signals per scenario (e.g., any interim court ruling around late July; progress/timing on the Asia Regional Cumulation Group announcements; and any UK-DCTS implementation milestones). Ensure each assertion ties back to the IDs (OFY11YO0I, WLXM1819K, AJTHKYXQ3, and optionally CAN-US/CUSMA source) and avoid introducing non-sourced numbers.",
