  "description": "The creative hub offers programs that serve both children and adults.",
  "content": "Unlike many of the recent restaurant and service openings in the area, this new venture offers something distinctly tactile and educational. \"It's a little bit more unique than most of the ribbon-cuttings we've done in the past year or two, where we've got a lot of restaurants, services, and sports things that are coming into town. This one, actually, you've got to get out and use your hands,\" Mayor Brad Cohen said during the ceremony. \"It takes us back probably a century \u2013 back to the old sewing machines and using your hands to make material useful, to repair material and appreciate the art of sewing.\" Owner Melissa Quijano has created a creative hub that serves both children and adults. \"We have sewing and fashion design classes, but we also have art and crochet and knitting here. We have a lot going on,\" Quijano explained. The studio goes beyond just classes, also selling fabric, sewing supplies, and handmade items created by local women in the community.\n\nThe studio's accessibility is one of its key features. \"You don't ever need any experience to come to any of our classes,\" Quijano said. The offerings range from one-off workshop projects like stuffed animals and clothing to regular classes for students as young as four years old. For adults seeking a social creative outlet, the studio hosts \"sip and stitch\" events where participants can enjoy wine while working on sewing projects.\n\nBusy Bee Fashion and Art Studio adapts its schedule to serve the community year-round. During the school year, classes run Monday through Friday from 4:30 to 8:00 p.m., with some daytime sessions available. Summer hours are Tuesday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., ensuring accessibility for both working parents and students. The studio's annual fashion show has already become a highlight, with last year's event taking place at the nearby East Brunswick Mall, showcasing the talents and creations of students and community members.\n\nQuijano said that social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have significantly boosted interest in do-it-yourself projects, particularly among young people. This trend has created natural demand for the hands-on skills and creative outlet that Busy Bee provides. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by Cohen, Economic Development Officer Rob Zuckerman, and Ronnie Li from the East Brunswick Regional Chamber of Commerce, all joining owner Quijano to celebrate this exciting addition to the local business community.",
