  "description": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian state and federal ministers will meet for two days from Wednesday to weigh the biggest cuts to consumption tax in eight years, aimed at spurring domestic demand in the face of economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs.  Coupled with cuts in personal tax unveiled in February, the cuts in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are expected to boost consumption in the South Asian nation, whose economy grew at an unexpectedly higher pace of 7.8% in the quarter to June.

  "content": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian state and federal ministers will meet for two days from Wednesday to weigh the biggest cuts to consumption tax in eight years, aimed at spurring domestic demand in the face of economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs.\n\nCoupled with cuts in personal tax unveiled in February, the cuts in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are expected to boost consumption in the South Asian nation, whose economy grew at an unexpectedly higher pace of 7.8% in the quarter to June.\n\nA panel on the tax, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with ministers from all Indian states, will decide on a plan to cut the tax on more than 400 items, ranging from hair oil to small cars.\n\n\"With U.S. tariffs clouding exports in textiles, autos and possibly pharmaceuticals, India must pivot towards domestic consumption as the primary growth engine,\" said Manoj Mishra, a partner at Grant Thornton Bharat LLP.\n\nThe move is expected to boost sales of FMCG firms such as Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Industries, and consumer electronics companies such as Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Sony.\n\nAmong automakers Maruti, Toyota Motor and Suzuki Motor are expected to be big winners.\n\nThe rush to cut the tax was triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for greater self-reliance, when he vowed to lower GST by October, aiming to counter the U.S. tariffs of up to 50%.\n\nTWO RATES INSTEAD OF FOUR\n\nThe ministers will consider a two-rate structure of 5% and 18%, instead of four now, with additional tax bands of 12% and 28%. It will also consider a higher tax of 40% on some luxury and \"sin\" goods such as cigarettes.\n\nThe plan is to sweep into the 5% category all items of daily use now in the category of 12%.\n\nThe panel will also consider lowering taxes on consumer items such as toothpaste and shampoo to 5% from 18%, and on small cars, air conditioners, and televisions to 18% from 28%.\n\nEconomists expect the cuts to cost $21 billion in revenue losses, with states set to lose more than the federal government.\n\nWhile the states are broadly on board, there could be heated discussion on ways to make up their loss of revenue.\n\nThe panel is likely to discuss raising taxes on high end electric vehicles priced at more than 2 million rupees.\n\nIt will also consider raising tax to 18% from 12% on apparel priced above 2,500 rupees ($29), which would affect the premium offerings of Marks and Spencer, Levi Strauss, and Zara.\n\nTaxes on air travel in the premium and business classes could also go to 18% from 12%.",

      "text": "President Trump on Tuesday said his administration would seek an immediate hearing from the Supreme Court in hopes of overturning an appeals court's ruling deeming most of his tariffs illegal.\nTrump said the administration would appeal to the high court on Wednesday.\n\"It's an economic emergency,\" he said on CNN commentator Scott Jennings' radio show, adding, \"If we don\u2019t win that decision, you\u2019ll see a reverberation like maybe you\u2019ve never seen before.\"\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of Trump's global tariffs were illegal, reaffirming an earlier ruling by the Court of International Trade and saying he exceeded his authority in using emergency powers to impose them. The judges, however, allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case moves through the appeals process.\n\"The stock market's down because the stock market needs the tariffs. They want the tariffs,\" he said in the Oval Office.\nOther members of the administration are making backup plans, however. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is confident the Supreme Court will back Trump's use of a 1977 emergency law to impose broad tariffs, but said the administration is working on a Plan B in case it does not.\nIn any case, the \"reciprocal\" tariffs Trump unveiled on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below) now face a fresh bout of legal limbo.\nMeanwhile, Trump has amped up criticism of the trade relationship between the US and India, saying it has been heavily one-sided for decades.\n\"They sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest 'client,' but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades,\" Trump posted.\n\"It has been a totally one sided disaster!\" he added.\nTrump's comments came as India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on bids to strengthen ties with China and Russia as relations with the US have deteriorated. On Tuesday, Trump suggested he wasn't considering lowering tariffs on India.\nMerz offers to help Swiss reduce \u2018exorbitant\u2019Trump trade tariff\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has offered Switzerland his support after President Trump hit the export-dependent nation with high tariffs last month.\nIndia eyes Russia, Brazil, Netherlands for pharma export growth as US tariffs concerns linger\nIndia is making moves to increase its pharma exports to Russia, the Netherlands and Brazil, according to sources. New Delhi is hoping this will expand its presence beyond the US, its largest market.\nKey Starbucks supplier in Switzerland tastes bitter harvest of Trump tariffs\nSwiss coffee machine maker Thermoplan grew from a small family business into a major Starbucks supplier during the late 1990s globalization wave, bringing over 500 jobs to its Alpine lakeside village.\nBut its future has been thrown into jeopardy due to President Trump's tariffs.\nBessent expects Supreme Court to uphold legality of Trump's tariffs\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday he believes the Supreme Court will support President Trump's use of a 1977 emergency law to impose wide tariffs, but added the administration has an alternative if it does not.\nHe told Reuters he is drafting a legal brief highlighting the urgency of fixing trade imbalances and stopping fentanyl from reaching the US.\nIndian oil minister denies country is profiteering from Russian imports\nIndia's oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday that the country is not \"profiting\" from Russian oil imports, and its purchases have stabilized markets while keeping prices from rising as much as $200 a barrel.\nTrump slams India's high tariffs, calls trade relationship a 'disaster'\nPresident Trump criticized the trade relationship between the US and India on Monday, saying it has been heavily one-sided for decades.\nTrump noted that while India sells large amounts of goods to the US, American businesses sell very little to India because of the high tariffs New Delhi have put in place, which he called the highest of any country.\n\"In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest \u201cclient,\u201d but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades,\" Trump posted.\n\"The reason is that India has charged us, until now, such high Tariffs, the most of any country, that our businesses are unable to sell into India. It has been a totally one sided disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US\"\nTrump continued by saying India has offered to eliminate tariffs entirely. The US president said this action was overdue and that such trade policies should have been addressed years ago.\nJenny McCall\n'We haven't seen the worst of it': Retailers warn tariff impacts are far from over\nYahoo Finance's Senior Reporter Allie Canal looks at President Trump's tariffs and the retailers who are feeling the impact:\nRice remains sticking point as Japan, US seek to implement deal\nRice continues to be a sticking point between Japan and the US as both countries navigate differing interpretations of their July trade agreement, much of which has not yet been implemented.\nUS still working on trade deals despite court ruling: Greer\nThe Trump administration is pressing ahead with trade talks with its partners, even after a US appeals court ruled that the majority of President Trump's tariffs are illegal, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Sunday.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two discussed how the two countries will work to cooperate in the face of an ongoing trade war with the United States.\nHe also notes that the appeals court left the duties in place until October to allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in. Until then, however, it's not clear what businesses can \u2014 or should \u2014 do."
