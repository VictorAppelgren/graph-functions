  "description": "President Vladimir Putin of Russia has agreed to meet with President Donald Trump \"in the coming day...",
  "content": "President Vladimir Putin of Russia has agreed to meet with President Donald Trump \u201cin the coming days,\u201d a top Kremlin aide said Thursday, as the White House pushes for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nThe aide, Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, confirmed reports Wednesday that Trump said he planned to meet the Russian leader in person as soon as next week and to follow up with a meeting with Putin and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe American side has suggested, and we have agreed in principle, to hold a high-level bilateral meeting, that is, a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,\u201d Ushakov told Russian news agencies Thursday. He declined to discuss the idea of a three-way summit with Zelenskyy.\n\nUshakov did not give an exact date for the meeting, saying only that it was \u201chard to say how much time the preparations for such an important meeting would take.\u201d Russia and the United States have agreed on the place to meet but will not be disclosing it at this time, Ushakov added.\n\nThe confirmation of a potential sit-down between the American and Russian leaders comes a day after Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s envoy, held talks with Putin at the Kremlin.\n\nIt was the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity since the White House issued an ultimatum for Russia: Either agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face new sanctions.\n\nMeeting with Trump would be something of another minor victory for Putin, who had been largely isolated by NATO leaders over the invasion of Ukraine until Trump started phone conversations with the Russian leader after coming to office.\n\nIf the meeting goes ahead, it would be the first in-person summit between an American and Russian president in more than four years.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",
