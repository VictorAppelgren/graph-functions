  "description": "No co-signer? No problem. Explore proven tips and financing strategies to get the car you want.",
  "content": "Buying a car is a rite of passage, and owning a car is a necessity in many places. But it's not always the most straightforward process. From researching different cars and taking test drives to comparing loan interest rates, it's even more complicated if you\u2019re going into the car-buying process independently.\n\nHaving bought my first car in July, the process was nerve-racking, especially as a fresh college graduate with minimal credit history and new employment. Ultimately, though, I found success with a local dealership that offered lower interest rates to recent college grads (a program that many dealerships have an equivalent of).\n\nEven if you can\u2019t find a dealership with a similar program, there are plenty of other ways to buy a car without a co-signer. As long as you meet a few qualifying criteria, it\u2019s possible to get a reasonable deal on a vehicle.\n\nIf you have a family member or close friend with good income and credit, they may qualify to serve as a co-signer for your car purchase. When someone co-signs your auto loan, they provide the dealership with their financial information and pledge to take responsibility if you fail to make a monthly payment.\n\nHaving a co-signer can be a simple way to qualify for a good car deal, especially if your co-signer has an excellent credit history, but it doesn\u2019t mean it's the only way. If you don\u2019t have anyone willing to co-sign your loan, you may still qualify for a car loan if you explore multiple lenders, make sure your credit and income are in good standing, and are open-minded about the type of car you purchase.\n\nWhy do I need a co-signer?\n\nYou don\u2019t technically need a co-signer to buy a car. However, it can make you a more attractive buyer in the eyes of a lender, especially if you are a first-time buyer. If you have a limited or unfavorable employment or credit history, you\u2019ll likely be deemed a risky buyer. Having a well-qualified co-signer reassures the lender that payments will continue to be made if you fail to do so for whatever reason.\n\nWhile having a co-signer can be beneficial when applying for a car loan, it\u2019s a big responsibility for the person co-signing, and sometimes even close family members or friends are unwilling to do it. Here are a few things you can do to improve your odds of successfully qualifying for a loan independently if you don't have strong credit.\n\nCredit unions can often be a good alternative to financing a car outside of an auto dealership or other lender. Many credit unions are known to have lower interest rates on loans and put a higher priority on flexibility and personal connection with their members compared to auto dealerships or other types of banks. However, be aware that some credit unions may still deny you if you have a limited credit history.\n\nEven if you don't secure a loan through your credit union, you can still get loan preapproval through your credit union. If you are preapproved with a low interest rate, you can use said rate as leverage with dealerships or other lenders as you shop around for a vehicle.\n\nRead more: See our picks for the best credit unions of the year\n\nIf you have a limited or unfavorable credit history, there are a few options outside of a traditional auto loan through a dealership or bank. Several online and in-person financing options market themselves with having high approval rates, no credit requirements, lower down payments, or longer payment terms, which in turn makes monthly payments lower.\n\nFor example, online lender Carvana offers financing to any prospective buyer over 18 without bankruptcies and a minimum annual income of $5,100, so long as you haven\u2019t defaulted on a Carvana loan in the previous two years. For those who want a more traditional dealership experience, CarMax Auto Finance accommodates most credit profiles and offers prequalification online.\n\nBe aware that while you may get approved with no credit or poor credit, the terms will likely be less favorable compared to other options.\n\nAnother alternative to traditional financing from an auto dealership, bank, or credit union is taking out a personal loan. Personal loans can be used for almost any purpose and are given in a lump sum, which you then pay off in fixed monthly increments. Personal loans also give you the freedom to shop around from a variety of different lenders.\n\nShould I pay for my car using a personal loan?\n\nWhile taking out a personal loan to finance your car can be beneficial to some, it\u2019s generally not the best option for an auto loan. Because personal loans are unsecured, meaning there is no collateral on the loan, they typically have a higher interest rate than traditional auto loan options.\n\nFurthermore, personal loans are typically unsecured; that means they're often harder to get approved for, requiring a high credit score and good credit history. So if you are already struggling to get approved for a car loan via more traditional methods, you might also find it tough to qualify for a personal loan. There are personal loans specifically for people with bad or no credit history, but those loan terms are usually much less favorable.\n\nStill, personal loans can be a good option for some first-time car buyers. For instance, if you're purchasing an older car or a used vehicle with high mileage, you may have trouble getting a traditional auto loan. A personal loan could be a good option to pursue if you don\u2019t have enough cash to secure the vehicle.\n\nHow to buy a car without a co-signer\n\nOnce you have secured your financing or loan preapproval for your vehicle, it\u2019s time to start shopping. After doing your research on what type of vehicle you are interested in and what features you are looking for, here are a few other things to consider when thinking about what cars you\u2019ll best qualify for as an independent buyer:\n\nMany dealerships, as well as banks and credit unions, offer first-time car-buyer programs. While most of these programs don\u2019t expect you to have a co-signer or an extensive credit history, many will still require you to have a good credit score, a good existing credit history, and proof of income. Shop around with multiple lenders to see which first-time buyer programs in your area offer the best interest rate and lowest down payment for the vehicle you want.\n\nA three-year-old vehicle is, on average, around $13,435 cheaper than a brand new car, according to Edmunds \u2014 and is often easier to qualify for compared to a new car. By shopping for low-mileage used cars, you could find a vehicle in good condition that is both less expensive and slower to depreciate compared to newer models.\n\nJust make sure you run an inspection before committing to a car to learn about any previous issues or accidents the vehicle has experienced, as well as any previous maintenance issues the owner had before you.\n\nIf you were previously a car owner or were gifted a car, you can trade in your older vehicle and put that cash back into your new vehicle. This can help you by allowing you to put down a larger down payment or lowering your monthly payments.\n\nAccording to JD Power, someone buying a car can save $834 on a new car worth $42,000 by trading in their previous vehicle. The exact value you can expect on your vehicle depends on various factors, including the car\u2019s condition, history, and depreciation rates.\n\n4. Put down a larger down payment or accept a higher monthly payment\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a vehicle to trade in, you may have to put more money into your vehicle than you initially planned, either as a larger down payment to secure your car or by paying more into your car monthly. While experts recommend a down payment of 10% on a used car and 20% down on a new car, putting down a larger down payment can help you more easily secure the car you want.\n\nAs far as average monthly car payments, Experian's 2025 State of the Automotive Finance Market report says auto loan payments averaged $745 per month for new cars and $521 per month for used cars. So expect to pay similar, or possibly even more, when buying your car without a co-signer.\n\nRead more: How much you should save before you buy a car\u200b?\n\nI did the above, and I still can\u2019t afford the car I want. Now what?\n\nIf, after approaching multiple lenders and looking at more affordable car options, you still aren\u2019t able to secure a car with a price tag you can stomach, here are some long-term solutions you can pursue to qualify for the car that fits your needs:\n\nMost car lenders want applicants with a credit score of at least 661 and a lengthy credit history, which showcases responsible credit usage and financial management skills. If you don\u2019t urgently need new transportation, spending a few more months or even one or two years improving your credit score can greatly help you qualify for the car you want.\n\nShowing proof of stable income and references to your current place of employment is also a big part of qualifying for the car you want. Most auto sellers want independent buyers to have a full-time income (or at least part-time streams that equate to full-time income) to make sure they will be able to afford the car\u2019s monthly payments.\n\nRead more: 7 ways to improve your personal cash flow\n\nIf you are unable to secure a car through a traditional dealer, consider buying a car through private sellers such as local used car sales, auctions, or online listings. If you secure a car through a private seller, make sure to do your research on the vehicle\u2019s history and previous ownership.\n\nWhat is an auto loan?\n\nAn auto loan is a type of secured loan used to finance your vehicle. When you buy a car with an auto loan, the lender pays the seller the full amount once the loan is issued. Then, you make monthly payments to the lender over a several-month term (usually somewhere between 36 to 96 months), paying off the original amount plus interest. If you miss multiple monthly payments or are otherwise unable to repay your loan, your lender can repossess your vehicle.\n\nWhat are the risks of buying a car without a co-signer?\n\nWhile it's definitely possible to buy a car independently and even qualify for a good deal, there are a few things you might have to accept:\n\u2022 Used car: Unless you have the money for a large down payment and high monthly payment, it might be most logical for you to invest in a more affordable used car.\n\u2022 Higher monthly payment or down payment: Many dealerships view first-time buyers as risky, so you may have to accept putting more money into your car, either initially or through your monthly payment.\n\u2022 Higher interest rate: If you don\u2019t get bogged down with higher payments up-front, your lender could offer you a deal with higher interest rates. On the other hand, many first-time buyer programs actually offer lower interest rates to certain favorable buyers, such as recent graduates or those with full-time work.\n\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn.",

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nSimply put, buying a car with a credit card is a bad idea for nearly everybody. There are a few strategies that may make it a worthwhile endeavor \u2014 but unless you\u2019ve got the money to pay off your card immediately, it\u2019s a financial booby trap.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about buying a car with a credit card.\nDo car dealerships accept payments with a credit card?\nThere are two reasons you might consider purchasing a car with a credit card:\n-\nYou\u2019re a savvy collector of credit card rewards and you\u2019d like to funnel a large expense like an auto purchase through a credit card or two.\n-\nYou want a car but don\u2019t want (or can\u2019t qualify for) an auto loan.\nCar dealerships are perfectly capable of accepting credit card payments \u2014 whether they actually will is a total grab bag. Here\u2019s why: Whenever you use your credit card, the merchant accepting the payment will pay a processing fee (often between 1.5% and 3.5%) to your credit card issuer. Your issuer will then pay the card\u2019s payment network (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, etc.) to fulfill the transaction.\nTo give customers the ability to use a credit card is well worth that cost for most vendors. But car dealerships are an exception. After all, eating up to 3.5% of a $30,000 car is a hefty price just to allow a customer to pay with a credit card. Some locations may invite you to use a credit card for your down payment, but not the entire bill. If it\u2019s of paramount importance that you use a card for the whole transaction, you may need to visit multiple car dealerships before you find one that\u2019ll even entertain the idea \u2014 or offer to repay them for their losses.\nAdvantages of buying a car with a credit card\nEarn credit card rewards\nYou can earn cash back, airline miles, hotel points, or flexible bank rewards by channeling your spending through a credit card. For example, if you were to make a $30,000 car purchase with the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card, you\u2019d earn $600.\nHowever, the best credit card strategy to leverage a large purchase like this is by earning a welcome bonus \u2014 or even multiple. For example:\n- Welcome offerEarn 75,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months\n- Welcome offerEarn 130,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points after you spend $3,000 in purchases in your first 6 months of card membership\n- Welcome offerEarn 75,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after spending $3,500 in the first 4 months\nBy opening and using these three credit cards to buy your car, you\u2019d earn more than 300,000 rewards points and miles from just $14,000 in spending. Depending on how you use those rewards, it\u2019s entirely possible to net well over $5,000 in value. This is an easy win for those interested in travel.\nJust note that if you want to open multiple credit cards in a short span of time, it\u2019s wise to apply with different credit card issuers. Banks often have rules about opening multiple products in a short span of time. For example, Chase tends to only approve a maximum of two credit card applications per rolling 30-day period. But you could potentially open one card from Chase, American Express, Citi, and Capital One all in the same day.\nAchieve credit card spending incentives\nThere\u2019s more to credit card spending than just your return rate. Many rewards credit cards offer motivation for meeting specific spending thresholds each year.\nAs an example, the World of Hyatt Credit Card offers a bonus free night at a Category 1\u20134 Hyatt hotel each year you spend at least $15,000. You could squeeze hundreds of dollars from this free night, depending on the property you choose to use it for.\nDisadvantages of buying a car with a credit card\nSteep transaction fees\nRemember those processing fees we talked about earlier? That expense may come back to haunt you.\nIf your request to pay with a credit card isn\u2019t flat-out denied, the car dealer will likely raise the total amount you owe by tacking on a \u201cconvenience fee\u201d to cover a portion of the processing fees it will sustain. You\u2019re charged for the \u201cconvenience\u201d of using a credit card instead of a form of payment that doesn\u2019t require a processing fee. This is sure to negate your rewards earnings.\nIncreased credit utilization ratio\nCredit utilization, also called \u201camounts owed,\u201d is the ratio of available credit that you\u2019re currently using. For example, if you have a credit line of $20,000 and a credit card balance of $5,000, your credit utilization is 25%.\nCredit utilization accounts for 30% of your overall credit score. If your utilization is too high (above 30%, according to experts), your credit score may suffer. Unless you\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of credit (or the vehicle you\u2019re purchasing is dirt cheap), paying for a car with your credit card can increase your credit utilization to detrimental levels. If you\u2019re able to quickly pay down your balance, this shouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker. Your credit score will bounce back quickly after your credit limit is freed up.\nMost credit card issuers report to credit bureaus once per month. Ideally, you\u2019ll pay off your transaction before it even appears on your credit report. The rapidity with which your balance is reported will depend on the day of the month your credit card issuer reports.\nHigher interest rates\nCredit card interest rates are nightmarishly high, especially when compared to the average interest rates you\u2019ll find with auto loans \u2014 or even most personal loans. Unless you\u2019re able to pay off the transaction for your new car within a month or two, (or longer if you\u2019re using a credit card with a generous 0% intro APR offer), it\u2019s not worth it. In other words, using a credit card to finance a car with the intent on making monthly payments is almost always a horrible idea. Interest charges will erase any upside to using a credit card.\nThe hassle of it all\nAssuming you\u2019re going to make an enormous purchase on a single credit card, there\u2019s a chance you may be declined \u2014 even if you\u2019ve got the credit line to swing it. Your credit card issuer may want to ensure that the hand swiping your card is in fact attached to your body.\nBefore you make your purchase, it could be worth giving the issuer a heads-up. Some cards even offer a feature within your online account that allows you to preemptively test your spending power. Simply enter the dollar amount of your upcoming transaction, and it\u2019ll tell you whether the purchase will be approved.\nSee also: Best credit cards of 2025\nCan you make a car payment with a credit card?\nUsing a credit card to purchase a car outright probably isn\u2019t the best option for you. But what about making a car payment with a credit card?\nIt is possible to pay your monthly car loan with a credit card. Lenders that don\u2019t accept cards can be compensated through third-party payment platforms such as Plastiq, which charges your credit card and then mails a paper check to whomever you request.\nEither way, making a car payment with a credit card is usually a bad idea because of the convenience fees incurred by these payment platforms (often around 3%). Again, unless you\u2019re struggling to meet the minimum spending requirement for a credit card, it\u2019s almost certainly not worth paying with a credit card.\nThis article was edited by Rebecca McCracken\nEditorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nThe best personal loans get borrowers their money quickly and at the lowest rates. But with personal loan rates on the rise, learning how to compare your options, vet personal loan lenders, and score affordable monthly payments is key. Here are our picks for the best personal loans in 2025 and how you can find one that you qualify for and that fits your needs.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n12 best personal loan lenders\nSoFi: Best overall\nOur take: SoFi offers flexible loan amounts, fast funding, and helpful customer support, making it our best overall pick among the lenders we evaluated.\n-\nLoan amount: $5,000-$100,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-84 months\n-\nFunding speed: Same-day funding possible\n-\nOrigination fee: None\nSoFi\u2019s minimum loan amount is fairly high, so it won\u2019t work for everyone. But if you need a larger personal loan, this online lender is definitely worth considering. You won\u2019t pay an origination or application fee with SoFi, nor does it charge prepayment penalties. It also offers competitive APRs on its loans and a highly accessible customer service team, plus member perks like free financial planning.\nLightstream: Best for rate discounts\nOur take: Lightstream offers very low APRs among lenders we evaluated, making it an excellent option if you want to keep interest costs low.\n-\nLoan amount: $5,000-$100,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-84 months, but some loan types offer terms up to 240 months\n-\nFunding speed: Same-day funding possible\n-\nOrigination fee: None\nNot only does Lightstream offer competitive APRs, it also has a generous 0.50% autopay discount and sweetens the deal by pledging to beat competitors\u2019 rates by 0.10%. Borrowers also benefit from no prepayment penalties, origination, or application fees. Like SoFi, Lightstream\u2019s minimum loan amount is fairly high, so it\u2019s likely only a good choice if you\u2019re seeking a larger personal loan.\nLendingClub: Best for a simple application process\nOur take: LendingClub offers a streamlined application process that gives it an edge over competitors and makes life easier for borrowers.\n-\nLoan amount: $1,000-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-72 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: 0% - 8%\nLendingClub offers a fast and simple application process, allowing you to prequalify for a personal loan before formally applying. It also offers relatively low rates and fees, so it\u2019s worth a look if you want to keep your borrowing costs low. This lender also lets you apply for a personal loan with a co-borrower.\nWhile LendingClub has some perks, its origination fees can be fairly high and its repayment terms are less flexible than some competitors.\nDiscover: Best for low fees\nOur take: Discover offers no origination fees, prepayment penalties, or application fees, and it also has a fairly low APR compared to its competitors.\n-\nLoan amount: $2,500-$40,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 36-84 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: None\nWith its lack of fees and competitive APRs, Discover gets high marks for personal loan affordability. It also offers relatively fast funding \u2014 as soon as one business day \u2014 and its reputation with customers is respectable.\nDespite these positives, Discover\u2019s loan terms aren\u2019t as flexible as some competitors. You also can\u2019t use a co-applicant to improve your chances of qualifying for a loan.\nNavy Federal Credit Union: Best for military members\nOur take: With fast funding, a lack of fees, and accessible customer support, Navy Federal\u2019s personal loans are an excellent option for military members and veterans.\n-\nLoan amount: $250-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 36-60 months\n-\nFunding speed: Same-day funding possible\n-\nOrigination fee: None\nThe biggest drawback of Navy Federal is its restrictive credit union membership. Membership is open to veterans, active-duty and retired service members, eligible family members, and Department of Defense civilians.\nIf you qualify for membership and are seeking a personal loan, this lender offers several perks, including flexible loan amounts, fast funding, 24/7 customer support, and more. With the lowest minimum loan amount among all lenders we reviewed, this could be a low-fee option to predatory payday loans.\nBest Egg: Best for custom payment options\nOur take: Best Egg is unique among competitors because it offers a special payment option that could make it easier to repay your personal loan and save on interest.\n-\nLoan amount: $2,000-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 36-60 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: 0.99%-9.99%\nWith Best Egg\u2019s Payment Pathways program, borrowers benefit from a descending payment option. Your monthly payment starts higher but decreases the further you get into your loan term, which not only makes your personal loan more affordable but could make it easier to repay. Best Egg also offers a relatively low starting APR, making it ideal for borrowers with excellent credit who are seeking payment flexibility.\nThat said, you\u2019ll want to be mindful of Best Egg\u2019s origination fees, which can be as high as 9.99%. It also isn\u2019t particularly transparent about its borrower requirements or whether co-applicants are allowed for its personal loans.\nUpstart: Best for customer satisfaction\nOur take: Upstart gets excellent ratings from online reviewers and provides ample email and phone support to borrowers, making it our top pick for customer satisfaction.\n-\nLoan amount: $1,000-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 36 or 60 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: Not disclosed\nPast Upstart customers have great things to say about this lender, and it offers accessible customer support for existing and new borrowers. Its loan amounts are flexible, making it suitable whether you want to borrow a little or a lot, and loans are disbursed quickly after approval.\nUpstart isn\u2019t transparent about its fees, though. It\u2019s wise to discuss potential fees with customer support before proceeding with an application.\nUpgrade: Best for excellent credit\nOur take: Upgrade offers a very low starting APR compared to some competitors, making it a good choice for borrowers with excellent credit who want to keep interest costs low.\n-\nLoan amount: $1,000-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-84 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: 1.85%-9.99%\nIf you have excellent credit, you might qualify for a low-rate personal loan with Upgrade. This lender does charge origination fees, though they could be on the lower side for well-qualified borrowers. Apart from a decent APR, Upgrade offers fast funding, flexible loan amounts, and an accessible customer service team.\nThat said, its fees can also be relatively high, so this is something to watch out for if you plan to apply. Consider prequalifying with a soft credit check before submitting a formal application.\nWells Fargo: Best for flexible terms\nOur take: If you\u2019re looking for a flexible repayment term, Wells Fargo offers personal loans with terms as short as one year or as long as seven years.\n-\nLoan amount: $3,000-$100,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 12-84 months\n-\nFunding speed: Same-day funding possible\n-\nOrigination fee: None\nBesides flexible repayment terms, Wells Fargo offers competitive APRs, no origination fees, and fast funding. Thus, it\u2019s a great choice for borrowers seeking flexibility, those who want to keep their borrowing costs low, or people seeking funds quickly to cover an emergency expense.\nWhile it has its perks, Wells Fargo\u2019s feedback from online reviewers is limited and mostly negative. It\u2019s also unclear if this lender allows you to apply with a co-borrower.\nRocket Loans: Best for fast funding\nOur take: Rocket Loans offers quick funding for its personal loans compared to other lenders we evaluated. It also has an excellent reputation with borrowers.\n-\nLoan amount: $2,000-$45,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 36 or 60 months\n-\nFunding speed: Same-day funding likely\n-\nOrigination fee: Up to 9%\nIf Rocket Loans approves your personal loan application before 4 p.m. ET on a weekday, you\u2019re likely to receive same-day funding. Of course, disbursement time can vary on a case-by-case basis, but a same-day funding option still makes Rocket worth considering if you need to cover an emergency expense. This lender also has a good reputation with its customers.\nThat said, Rocket charges a fairly high origination fee, and its loan terms aren\u2019t particularly flexible. These are important things to consider before you apply.\nAvant: Best for customer support\nOur take: Avant offers accessible customer support, with representatives available via email and phone seven days a week. It also has a stellar reputation among customers.\n-\nLoan amount: $2,000-$35,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-60 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: None, but has an administration fee of up to 9.99%\nIf accessible customer support is important to you, Avant is worth considering. Its team is available via phone and email seven days a week for at least 12 hours each day. Avant also gets high customer satisfaction ratings, perhaps due to its accessible support team and simple loan application process.\nThat said, this lender has some drawbacks. It charges a relatively high administration fee, and borrowers are on the hook for late and dishonored payment fees.\nProsper: Best for fair credit\nOur take: Prosper has a minimum credit score requirement of 600 and lets you apply with a co-applicant if you can\u2019t meet its criteria on your own.\n-\nLoan amount: $2,000-$50,000\n-\nRepayment terms: 24-60 months\n-\nFunding speed: As soon as one business day\n-\nOrigination fee: 1%-9.99%\nIf you\u2019ve had past credit setbacks and are concerned about your ability to qualify for a personal loan, Prosper may be worth considering. Borrowers with credit scores as low as 600 might qualify for its loans, and you can also apply with a trusted co-borrower to help increase your likelihood of approval. Prosper offers relatively fast funding, as soon as one business day after loan approval.\nDespite Prosper\u2019s perks, its origination fees are higher than some competitors. Borrowers may also be subject to other fees, including check payment fees, late fees, and insufficient funds fees.\nPersonal loan pros and cons\nPros\n-\nVersatility. Personal loan amounts are flexible, and you can use the loan funds for many financial goals. Repayment terms may be fine-tuned to your monthly cash flow.\n-\nNo collateral required. Personal loans are typically unsecured. Qualifying for an unsecured personal loan means you won't have to put up your vehicle, savings account, or other asset to guarantee the loan.\n-\nLower interest rates than credit cards. With good credit, you'll likely get an interest rate lower than you'll see with a credit card. Personal loans typically have fixed interest rates that don't change, while credit cards have variable rates that can fluctuate.\n-\nEasier to qualify for. The best personal loans are easier to qualify for than an auto or home equity loan. Borrower requirements also vary by lender, so credit score requirements may be more flexible with one lender compared to another.\n-\nQuick approval. The best personal loan lenders can process your loan approval and have cash in hand as soon as the next day. That speed for loan approvals is unique to personal loans.\nRead more: Personal loan vs. credit card\nCons\n-\nYour interest rate might be higher than expected. Rates tend to be higher for unsecured personal loans, though secured personal loans are harder to come by. Consider the pros and cons of secured versus unsecured personal loans.\n-\nPotential fees. Personal loan lenders may charge fees, including origination fees up to 10%. Read the fine print before you apply.\n-\nMore debt. Let's face it: Personal loans can be just one more thing to pay off. If you have a good to excellent credit score and manage debt well, that\u2019s likely not a problem. But for those struggling in their current financial situation with a low credit score, think it through before taking on more debt.\nRead more: What is a personal loan?\nHow to choose a personal loan\nGood personal loans come with relatively low fixed rates and flexible repayment terms. But the best personal loan lenders go the extra mile by minimizing unnecessary fees, offering flexible credit score requirements, and ensuring responsive customer support. Here\u2019s what to look at as you compare loan options.\nDig deeper: Is a personal loan right for me?\nInterest rates and APR\nInterest rates for personal loans tend to increase when the federal funds rate increases. While personal loan rates are trending higher, the rate you receive is based on your creditworthiness, at least in part.\nLenders consider your credit score, which is a measure of your creditworthiness based on your history of repaying debt, such as credit cards, vehicle loans, or a mortgage. They also review your debt-to-income ratio, or how much you owe on existing debt relative to your pre-tax earnings.\nLenders typically charge higher rates to borrowers with poor credit since they could be at a higher risk of nonpayment. Excellent-credit borrowers generally get the lowest personal loan rates. The lower your interest rate, the less you pay to borrow and the easier it is to afford your monthly payment.\nYou'll often see an interest rate quoted as an annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is your yearly cost of borrowing money and includes any fees or other charges. APRs offer a more accurate picture of your overall borrowing costs than interest rates alone.\nLoan amount and terms\nYour best personal loan choice will be based on your needs. Here are some best practices for choosing the right loan amount and term.\n-\nBorrow only what you need. Lenders who identify a qualified borrower are anxious to offer the maximum loan amount they believe the customer can afford. But that may be more than you need, putting you on the hook for more debt and interest. For example, if you need $7,000 and the lender approves you for a $10,000 loan because of your good credit, stick with the $7,000.\n-\nConsider what you can afford. Estimate your monthly payments based on different repayment terms to determine how your new loan payments will fit into your budget. Generally, a shorter repayment term means higher monthly payments and lower interest costs, while a longer term means lower monthly payments and higher interest costs.\nPersonal loan fees and charges\nYou\u2019ll also want to compare fees and charges before choosing a personal loan. Common fees and charges to look for include:\n-\nOrigination fee. Some lenders charge origination fees to cover loan processing. The fee is usually a percentage of the total loan, such as 1% or 10%. This is subtracted from your total loan amount when the money is disbursed, so be sure to factor that in when calculating your desired loan amount.\n-\nApplication fee. Lenders may charge application fees, which are usually around $25 to $50 but can be as high as $500.\n-\nPrepayment penalty. Sometimes a fee is levied if you pay off a loan early. In effect, you're being penalized for reducing debt, so it\u2019s smart to avoid a prepayment penalty if you can. None of the lenders we reviewed charges a prepayment penalty.\n-\nLate payment fee. If you don't pay on time, you'll likely get hit with a late fee. Getting behind on monthly payments will also negatively impact your credit score.\nCredit score and eligibility\nLook up your credit score and credit history before applying for a personal loan. That way, you can correct any errors or try to clean up any blemishes.\nThe higher your credit score, the better your personal loan terms and the lower your monthly payment will be. Credit scores generally range from 300 to 850. The average FICO score in the U.S. was 714 in 2024, according to Experian data.\nLearn more: Average credit score by age: How do your scores compare?\nCurrent interest rates vary by lender, but generally range from about 7% to 36% as of July 2025. Top-tier credit scores will earn the most favorable interest rate.\nSome lenders do offer personal loans to borrowers with bad credit. Of course, your repayment terms will be less favorable, and the interest rate will be higher.\nLender customer service and reputation\nYour lender choice is important. You want to find a lender with a good reputation, the services and perks you prefer, and the most favorable loan terms. Here\u2019s what to look out for:\n-\nPrequalification. Some lenders let you prequalify, giving you an idea of potential loan amounts, rates, and terms without a formal application. Lenders do a soft credit check when you prequalify, and this type of credit check won\u2019t harm your credit score.\n-\nCustomer support and payment options. Research customer support and payment options before moving forward with an application. Does the lender offer an autopay discount? Is there phone and email support during the hours you'll likely need assistance?\n-\nCustomer reviews. Real-life reviews offer the best insight into a lender's reputation. Sort customer reviews by \"most recent,\" if possible, to see the latest issues or complaints. Red flags can include last-minute changes to a borrower's interest rate or loan terms, disbursement or payment glitches, or issues with the functionality of a mobile app or website.\nLearn more: What is the best place to get a personal loan?\nApplying for a personal loan is simpler and requires less documentation than applying for other types of debt such as an auto loan. Step one is understanding your credit history and scores, as both help determine your interest rate. You can access your free credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com and get insight into your scores through your credit card issuer, bank, or a third-party service like Credit Karma.\nNext, consider how much you need to borrow and how fast you can pay it back. Remember that interest costs tend to be lower with a shorter repayment term, but your monthly payments will often be higher because you\u2019re repaying your loan over a shorter time frame. You\u2019ll usually pay more in interest with a longer-term loan.\nIt also makes sense to prequalify with a few different lenders to compare your options. Once you have two or three loan offers in hand, sit down and do a side-by-side comparison of each. Which lender gives you the best payment options and combination of loan terms and service? How much will you save over the life of the loan from the lowest APR offer compared to the least favorable? How quickly will the loan funds be available?\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your ideal lender, it\u2019s time to apply online. Be prepared to share basic personal and financial information on your application, including proof of income. You\u2019ll find out whether you qualify for a loan after your lender checks your credit and financial history. If you\u2019re approved, your lender will likely disburse funds quickly, with some lenders offering next-day funding.\nDig deeper: How long does it take to be approved for a personal loan?\nPersonal loan FAQs\nCan I use a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?\nAbsolutely. Consolidating high-interest credit card debt with a lower-rate personal loan could help you save on interest and make it easier to repay your debt.\nDig deeper: How to consolidate credit card debt with a personal loan\nCan I apply for a personal loan with no credit check?\nYes, some lenders allow you to apply for a personal loan with no credit check. But a no-credit-check lender will likely offer smaller loans, shorter repayment terms, and high interest rates. Thus, a no-credit-check loan can be a risky financing option, so consider other financing options if possible.\nCan I get a personal loan with bad credit?\nSome personal loan lenders offer loans for borrowers with bad credit, but you'll likely pay a high interest rate. The lender may also require a co-applicant or a secured loan guaranteed by collateral.\nHow does a personal loan work?\nA personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan issued by a bank, credit union, or online lender. If approved, you'll make monthly payments for a set term, often as long as five or seven years. You can use a personal loan for a variety of purposes, but are generally prohibited from using one for higher education, a home down payment, or for investing purposes.\nMethodology\nLenders were scored across nine key evaluation categories that reflect critical aspects of the loan process. Data was collected from 18 personal loan lenders and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts.\nWe graded each lender based on publicly available information found on their websites, disclosures and legal fine print, customer service policies, and consumer reviews from Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau. Categories include available APR range, applicable fees, offered loan amounts and terms, and customer support options. Each category was assigned a weight that corresponds to its relative importance and prioritizes consumer-friendly lending for individual, unsecured personal loans. Some subjective scoring is involved when clear information is unavailable.\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhether you need a loan for a transmission repair or hip surgery for your dog, personal loans are an increasingly popular option, and people are borrowing larger amounts. In 2021, the average balance per personal loan borrower was $9,622, according to TransUnion data. By the end of 2024, that number jumped to $11,607 \u2014 a 20% increase in just three years.\nPart of the appeal is that personal loans are usually unsecured; you don't need to pledge any property or asset as collateral to qualify for a loan. However, unsecured loans have their downsides, such as stricter eligibility requirements than other loan options.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nUnsecured vs. secured personal loan: What's the difference?\nInstallment loans can be secured or unsecured. A secured loan requires the borrower to use some form of property or asset \u2014 such as their savings account balance, a vehicle, or some other valuable item \u2014 as collateral. The lender can use the collateral to recoup the money owed if the borrower fails to keep up with the required payments.\nUnsecured personal loans work differently. They don't require any form of collateral as security, so you can qualify for a loan without risking your valuables. Instead, the lender decides to approve your loan application based on your creditworthiness, income, and other factors.\nHow unsecured personal loans work\nYou can use unsecured personal loans to consolidate credit card debt or finance a major expense.\nAn unsecured personal loan is issued based on the borrower's creditworthiness rather than the value of the borrower's collateral. As a result, they differ from secured loans in several key ways:\nApplication process\nWhile secured loans may focus on the appraised value of your collateral, unsecured loan lenders review your credit report, employment, income, other debt, and your intended loan use to decide whether to approve your application.\nBecause unsecured loans don't involve any form of collateral, the lender takes on more risk when it issues loans, so they tend to have stricter eligibility requirements. You usually need good to excellent credit and a regular paycheck (or another source of reliable income) to qualify for a loan. Otherwise, it can be difficult to qualify on your own, and you may need a loan co-signer to improve your application.\nInterest rates and loan terms\nWhen reviewing your loan application, the lender will consider your creditworthiness when determining your loan terms and annual percentage rate (APR). In general, the longest loan terms and lowest APRs will go to borrowers with excellent credit. Those with poor to fair credit may only qualify for higher interest rates and limited repayment term options.\nFor example, a borrower with excellent credit might qualify for a loan with a seven-year term at 9.00% APR. By contrast, a borrower with a score in the \"fair\" credit range may qualify for a maximum loan term of three years, with an APR of 20.00%.\nIf you have less-than-stellar credit, some bad-credit personal loan companies may approve your loan application. However, unsecured loans for borrowers with poor to fair credit can have high interest rates and fees (in some cases, well over 30%). If you fit that credit profile, a secured loan may offer a lower interest rate.\nDefault consequences\nWith a secured loan, a lender can seize your collateral if you default on the loan. With unsecured loans, lenders don't have that option, but that doesn't mean there are no consequences to defaulting on a personal loan. If you miss your payments for long enough, the lender can:\n-\nCharge you late fees\n-\nReport the missed payments to the major credit bureaus, damaging your credit and hurting your chances of borrowing money in the future\n-\nSend your account to collections, after which you'll be responsible for collection fees\n-\nSue you for payment and, if allowed by the court, place a lien on your assets or garnish your wages\nWhile you don't have to worry about losing your car or another asset right away, like you would with a secured loan, the consequences of defaulting on an unsecured loan are still significant and long-lasting.\nPros and cons of unsecured loans\nUnsecured loans can be useful for many borrowers, but they're not a good option for everyone. Consider the pros and cons:\nBenefits\n-\nNo collateral: Unsecured loans don't require any form of collateral, so you don't have to risk a vehicle or other valuables as security.\n-\nQuick loan approvals and disbursements: Because lenders only consider your creditworthiness (rather than needing to evaluate and appraise property), the application and approval process is fast. You can apply for a loan, get approved, and receive the funds in your checking account in as little as one day.\n-\nFlexible uses: Unsecured loans have few restrictions, so you can use a personal loan to pay for home repairs, renovations, veterinary care, medical bills, or even a dream wedding.\nRisks\n-\nStricter eligibility requirements: Unsecured loans are usually difficult to qualify for if you have a limited credit history or poor credit.\n-\nMore limited repayment terms: Because unsecured lenders take on more risk, they might have shorter repayment terms than secured loans.\n-\nLower loan maximums: With secured loans backed by valuable collateral, such as home equity loans, you can take out large sums. But unsecured loans are riskier, so lenders tend to have lower loan maximums.\nRead more: How much can I borrow with a personal loan?\nHow to take out an unsecured personal loan\nIf you decide that an unsecured personal loan is right for you, follow these steps:\n-\nReview your credit: The best personal loan rates and terms require excellent credit. Review your credit to get an idea of where you are on the credit scale. If you have a history of missed payments or a high level of existing debt, you may need a co-borrower to qualify for a loan.\n-\nCreate a budget: Decide how much money you want to borrow. Use a personal loan calculator to see how much your monthly payments would be with different rates and repayment terms, and ensure those amounts fit comfortably in your budget.\n-\nRequest loan estimates: Many lenders have prequalification tools so you can check your eligibility and view estimated interest rates without hurting your credit.\n-\nChoose a loan and apply: Once you find a lender that works for you, you can apply for a personal loan online. The lender will ask for your Social Security number, contact information, income, and employment details, and ask you to consent to a hard credit check. The lender will often make a decision within a few hours. If you're approved, you'll receive a notification with the next steps.\n-\nSign your loan agreement and finalize disbursement: The lender will send you a loan agreement to review and sign. Read it carefully to ensure the loan amount, rate, and fees are correct. If it all looks good, sign and return the agreement. Lastly, the lender will work with you to disburse the loan funds. In some cases, the lender can disburse the funds to your bank account electronically within a day or two.\nUnsecured personal loan FAQs\nWhat happens if I don't repay an unsecured personal loan?\nIf you miss your payments, you'll incur late fees, and the lender will report the missed payments to the major credit bureaus (causing your credit score to drop). If you continue to miss payments, the lender can send your account to collections or sue you in court.\nHow long does it take to get an unsecured personal loan?\nSome lenders allow you to apply for a loan and get your funds as soon as the same day, but unsecured personal loans commonly take one to five business days from application to disbursement.\nWhat's a good interest rate for a personal loan?\nPersonal loan rates currently range from about 7.00% to 35.99% APR; borrowers with excellent credit can qualify for rates in the single digits, while those with fair or poor credit will pay much higher rates.\nHow much can I borrow with an unsecured personal loan?\nUnsecured personal loans can range from a few hundred dollars up to $100,000 for borrowers with good credit.\nWhat can I use a personal loan for?\nA personal installment loan can finance just about anything \u2014 medical bills, home improvements, or credit card debt consolidation. However, some lenders prohibit using a personal loan to fund a business, pay college tuition, or make particular investments. Ask your lender about any restrictions when doing your research.\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nA personal loan can give you access to much-needed cash \u2014 and can be easy to qualify for, especially if you have a decent credit report and a steady income. You borrow a lump sum of money and make a predetermined number of monthly payments, with interest, until the loan is repaid.\nAs appealing as personal loans might be, there are some factors to consider.\nWhat is a personal loan?\nA personal loan is granted primarily on your creditworthiness rather than being tied to a property, such as a house or a car. The proceeds can be used for just about anything. You might consider a personal loan to cover an unexpected expense, a large purchase, medical bills, home improvements, or to pay off existing high-interest debt.\nBecause a valuable asset does not back it, the interest rate you pay on a personal loan (averaging 12.35% for a 24-month loan in the fourth quarter of 2023) will likely be higher than on a home mortgage or even a vehicle loan, both of which have been hovering in the 6% to 7% range recently.\nHowever, personal loan interest rates are typically lower than credit card rates, which were slightly over 21% towards the end of 2023.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nPros and cons of a personal loan\nLet's break down the pros and cons of a personal loan.\nPros:\n-\nThey are often easier to qualify for than a mortgage or car loan.\n-\nThe turnaround time from application to funding can be speedy.\n-\nYou'll likely be able to choose how long your repayment period (called the \"term\") will be. Generally, installment loan terms for personal use range from one to five years or sometimes a bit longer.\n-\nYou may be able to borrow just a few hundred dollars \u2014 up to several thousand.\nCons:\n-\nYou are adding to your debt load. If you struggle to make ends meet, another monthly payment may be the last thing you need.\n-\nSome personal loans are loaded with fees in addition to the interest costs. These might include origination fees, documentation, various types of optional insurance, and late fees. Be on the lookout for prepayment penalties, too. That's a fee for paying off your loan early.\nHow does a personal loan work?\nYou can apply for a personal loan from a bank, credit union, online lender, and even some credit card companies.\nAny loan offers will be based on the following:\n-\nA credit check revealing your credit score and payment history\n-\nYour income\n-\nYour current debt load and your debt-to-income ratio\nThese and other factors determine the loan amount a lender may offer, the repayment terms, and the annual percentage rate. As with all loans, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate.\nWith so many lenders looking to get your business, the time frame for getting your loan funded can vary greatly. Online lenders may approve your application in minutes and issue funding almost immediately. Traditional banks may take days, but if you have a relationship with a local bank or credit union, the turnaround time on a loan could be quicker.\nLearn more: How long does it take to get a personal loan\nWith the best personal loans, you might typically expect to receive loan funding in one to seven business days.\nOnce you receive your lump sum loan proceeds, expect your loan payments to begin within 30 days or so. You'll already know how much your payment will be and how long those payments will continue.\nTypes of personal loans\nPersonal loans come in several variations, including:\nSecured vs. unsecured personal loans\nA personal loan is often unsecured. That means it doesn't require collateral, such as a mortgage or an auto loan, which are secured by your home or vehicle.\nIf a lender offers a secured personal loan, you will likely put up a certificate of deposit, a portion of a savings account, stock, or other valuable asset as collateral. Secured loans are easier to qualify for and can have lower interest rates because the lender's risk is lessened by holding something of value in the case of default.\nDig deeper: What is an unsecured personal loan?\nFixed vs. variable interest rates\nPersonal loans can have fixed or variable interest rates. A fixed interest rate never changes during the life of the loan. If it's 12% at the beginning, it will be 12% for the complete term of the loan.\nA variable interest rate can change. You may begin with a lower rate than with a fixed-rate loan, but that interest charge will be periodically adjusted, just like credit card interest rates are. A variable-rate loan may work to your advantage when interest rates are falling. When rates are rising, not so much.\nTraditional banks vs. online lenders\nAs with so many financial services these days, you have many options when looking for a personal loan. Of course, traditional banks are on the list, but online lenders can be very convenient and sometimes faster to approve and fund a loan.\nIt's also good to consider credit unions where you live. They often offer lower interest rates for borrowers with good credit, and you might forge a relationship with a local rep that can be helpful in the future.\nSpecialized loans\nSome personal loans are targeted at borrowers with specific needs.\n-\nTitle loans: Vehicle title loans are a common type of secured personal loan, where you use proof of vehicle ownership to back the loan. Unfortunately, they are usually short-term loans with extremely high interest rates and burdensome fees. Plus, if you fail to pay, you can lose your car.\n-\nBuy now, pay later: There has been a resurgence in popularity for long-in-the-tooth BNPL purchase financing, a spin-off of rent-to-own. While some plans say you'll pay low or even no interest, there can be transaction fees, late charges, and other add-on expenses.\n-\nPayday loans: These short-term loans require you to issue a personal check or provide checking account draft access to cover any non-payment. The Federal Trade Commission says payday loans typically charge $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. That amounts to a nearly 400% interest rate on a two-week loan.\n-\nPawn shop loans: Giving a pawn shop personal property for quick cash is another variation of a personal loan. Like title and payday loans, many consumers get trapped in a vicious cycle of \"rolling over\" the debt with ever-increasing fees.\n-\nDebt consolidation loans: This type of personal loan is used to pay off high-interest debt such as credit card balances. It's often an attempt to lower monthly payments and save interest, but if you extend the payback period, you can actually add to your total finance charges. Instead, you might seek debt reduction advice from a nonprofit credit counselor.\n-\nHome renovation loans: Upgrades and repairs can add value to your home. A personal loan can fund those improvements. Another option could be a home equity loan or home equity line of credit.\n-\nCredit builder loans: Used to establish a credit history and improve your credit score, a credit builder loan is a personal loan in reverse; you begin making payments before receiving the funds. Finally getting the money is almost like a reward for good debt management.\nShould I get a personal loan? Things to consider before applying\nTaking on any debt is a matter of thinking through your current obligations and your future ability to pay. There can be borrower's remorse: Getting the loan proceeds is the fun part. Paying it back can be a burden.\nIf you've examined your expenses and are confident that a personal loan is a good move, proceed with a plan:\n-\nCheck your credit score before you decide to get a loan. It's likely to be affected once a lender starts processing your application.\n-\nShop multiple lenders for the best interest rate and loan terms you can qualify for.\n-\nRemember to hunt for hidden fees and add-on charges.\n-\nBe aware that the longer the payback period, the likelier you'll pay more interest.\n-\nAsk if there will be a prepayment penalty should you decide to pay the loan off early.\nDig deeper: Should I get a personal loan?\nAlternatives to personal loans\nA personal loan may be a good solution for you now, but how can you borrow less in the future? That's the key to building wealth over the long term. Having a cash cushion for unexpected expenses and large purchases empowers you to avoid taking on more debt later on.\nStart moving money into an emergency savings fund, even if it's just a little at a time. Maximize your returns by considering high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\nKeep one credit card paid off and available for use when a serious need arises.\nConsider having a home equity line of credit available, but use it sparingly. The value of your home can be a significant factor affecting your long-term net worth.\nLearn more: Home equity loan vs. personal loan\nFAQs\nDo you need collateral for a personal loan?\nNot usually. Most personal loans are issued based on your ability to repay. That considers your credit history, income, and the amount of debt you already have.\nKeep reading: Do you need collateral for a personal loan?\nHow many personal loans can you have at once?\nThe amount of debt you can carry is a function of your creditworthiness. Lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio to determine if you qualify for any new loans or additional debt.\nDig deeper: How many personal loans can I have at once?\nCan I get a personal loan with bad credit?\nYes. Some financial institutions offer personal loan programs to borrowers with low credit scores. But be aware of \"advance-fee\" loan scams. This is when fraudsters guarantee they can provide you loans or credit cards \"no matter your credit score\" but require payment upfront. After collecting the fees, they disappear.\nLearn more: How to get a personal loan with bad credit?"

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nThe term \u201ccash flow\u201d is common in business, but the concept has implications for your personal finances too. Cash flow, or the money going into and out of your accounts each month, is a useful metric for understanding your financial health.\nWhen you spend more than you make, your cash flow is negative. When you spend less than you make, you have a positive cash flow and can save money over time.\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time getting a handle on the movement of money into and out of your accounts, you\u2019re in the right place. Continue reading for seven ways to improve your personal cash flow.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhat is cash flow?\nYour personal cash flow is the movement of money into and out of your accounts, typically on a monthly basis. All of your net income \u2014 including paychecks, investment income, side hustle income, rental income, and any other money you receive \u2014 makes up your cash inflow. Meanwhile, your bills, debt payments, and discretionary spending make up your outflow.\nA positive cash flow means you\u2019re making more than you spend; in other words, your inflow is higher than your outflow. A negative cash flow means you spend more than you make.\nWhy is cash flow important?\nUnderstanding your cash flow is a helpful measure of your financial health. If your cash flow is positive every month, you can save money, invest, and make progress toward financial goals such as buying a house, going on vacation, or retiring comfortably.\nOn the other hand, if your cash flow is negative, you could end up in serious debt. Plus, bleeding money every month is stressful. Not only does it mean you\u2019re falling behind on your goals, but you may also be scrambling to make ends meet.\nRead more: 7 ways to save money on a tight budget\nHow to calculate cash flow\nYou can calculate your cash flow by subtracting your monthly expenses from your net monthly income. If your income and expenses look different each month, you can get a more accurate idea of your monthly cash flow by averaging multiple months of income and expenses.\nIf the thought of sifting through all your financial statements and calculating cash flow every month seems like a lot of work, don\u2019t worry. You can rely on simple \u2014 and often free \u2014 online tools to do it for you.\nFor instance, My Money from Yahoo Finance allows you to connect all of your financial accounts, then automatically categorize expenses and calculate your cash flow on a monthly basis. Once you set up your account, your work is done. Want to give it a try? Sign up for free here.\nHow to improve your cash flow\nIf your cash flow isn\u2019t where you want it to be, you can improve it by increasing your income or reducing your expenses. The following strategies can help:\n1. Create a budget\nThe first step in improving your personal cash flow is to understand where your money goes after landing in your account. Start by combing through credit card and bank statements from the past few months. Figure out how much you tend to spend on essential expenses and discretionary spending, then use these targets to create a budget.\nRemember, your budget needs to reflect your income. If you earn $4,000 in net monthly income, your expenses (including discretionary spending and savings goals) should add up to $4,000. If your expenses are higher than your income, that\u2019s a sign your cash flow is negative, and you\u2019ll need to make some adjustments.\n2. Eliminate unnecessary spending\nYour budget will fluctuate as your income, expenses, and goals change. If your priority is to increase your cash flow, try combing through your budget for unnecessary spending.\nFor example, if you\u2019re paying for two streaming services but only watch one, cancel the one you don\u2019t use. Similarly, if you prefer working out at home rather than driving to the gym, stop paying for your membership.\n3. Spend less on essentials\nLimiting your discretionary spending is one thing, but you can also improve your cash flow by saving money on essentials. There may be less wiggle room to cut costs here, but see what you can do with the following tips:\n-\nGroceries: Make a list before heading to the store, and choose store-brand over name-brand products. Try choosing more whole, unprepared foods to cook yourself instead of buying prepared and processed options.\n-\nUtilities: Negotiate your bills to bring costs down, and see if you can switch to a cheaper phone plan. You can also lower utility bills by switching to energy-saving devices and fixtures, like smart thermostats and water-saving shower heads.\n-\nHousing: Move to a less expensive area, get a roommate to cover part of your mortgage, or rent out your home when you travel.\n-\nTransportation: Reconsider how many vehicles you need for your household, and if it makes sense, sell one. Take public transportation, carpool, and bike when possible. Finally, compare car insurance policies to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal possible.\n-\nClothing: Instead of buying new outfits for special events, try a clothing rental service instead. If you want to buy something, shop at consignment shops and secondhand marketplaces first.\nRead more: How to save money in 2025: 50 tips to grow your wealth\n4. Build an emergency fund\nAn emergency fund is an essential cushion for anyone, especially those trying to improve their monthly cash flow.\nAn emergency fund is a pile of money you set aside for hard times, with the assumption you won\u2019t touch it unless you truly need it. For example, you might use the funds when your furnace breaks or you need to book a last-minute flight for a family emergency.\nHaving an emergency fund means you can cover unexpected costs without going into debt, which can be a major drain on your cash flow. Experts generally recommend saving at least three to six months\u2019 worth of essential expenses in your emergency fund. Keep this money in a high-yield savings account so it\u2019s easily accessible (and earns interest while it\u2019s sitting there).\n5. Tackle your debt\nDepending on your debt balance and interest rates, this monthly expense can take a major toll on your cash flow.\nTo improve your cash flow, focus your efforts on paying off high-interest debt, like credit cards, first. The higher the interest rate, the more you\u2019ll end up paying in the long run \u2014 so it\u2019s best to get rid of this debt as soon as possible.\nYou can also consider a debt consolidation loan, which allows you to pay off several loans at once, consolidating your debt into a single monthly payment. If you can qualify for a low enough rate on a debt consolidation loan, this strategy can help you pay off debt faster (and pay less interest along the way).\n6. Increase your income\nAfter cutting your costs as much as possible, you can continue to improve your cash flow by increasing your income with one of the following strategies:\n-\nNegotiate a raise: If you think there\u2019s room to earn more at your current job, pursue a raise with your boss. Research what comparable roles are paying and get clear on what your responsibilities, contributions, and achievements are worth.\n-\nLook for a new job: If you can\u2019t get a raise at your current job \u2014 or your negotiations don\u2019t go as planned \u2014 you can look for a new job that pays more. You can even bring a job offer to your current employer to see if they\u2019ll budge on your salary.\n-\nStart a side hustle: Side hustles are a great way to increase your earning potential, allowing you to explore a different skillset or industry outside of your day job. There are endless side gig options, such as tutoring, freelance writing, or pet sitting.\n7. Automate your savings\nRegardless of how much you earn, automating your savings can help you improve your cash flow. When you automate your savings, you\u2019re essentially paying yourself first. This approach means you prioritize your long-term goals and security (and a positive cash flow), even if it means spending less now.\nTo automate your savings, set up a recurring transfer from your checking to your savings account. Even if you only transfer a small amount to start, it\u2019s building the habit that matters."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nWhen it comes to deciding between using a bank or a credit union, there are several factors to consider \u2014 including safety. Credit unions have a reputation for being slightly safer than banks, but are they, really? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nUnderstanding credit unions vs. banks\nCredit unions and banks have plenty in common: They\u2019re both federally insured, and they offer similar products and services. But there are a few important differences between the two that are worth understanding.\n-\nInsurance: Deposits at credit unions and banks are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. However, banks and credit unions are insured by different entities. The Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) insures banks, while the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures credit unions.\n-\nMembership: Anyone can apply for an account at a bank, but a credit union\u2019s products and services are only available to its members. To become a credit union member, you typically need to meet eligibility criteria, such as living in a specific geographic area or working for a certain employer.\n-\nStructure: While banks operate for profit, credit unions are nonprofit organizations. Credit union members are also part-owners and have influence over decisions and operations.\n-\nInterest rates: Because credit unions aren\u2019t focused on earning a profit, they generally can afford to offer lower interest rates on loans and credit cards and higher interest rates on savings accounts compared to banks.\n-\nFees: Banks tend to charge higher fees compared to credit unions. This is because banks need to earn a profit, while credit unions can pass on earnings to their members.\n-\nTechnology: Banks tend to be more technologically advanced than credit unions. This may translate into more robust and user-friendly mobile apps and online banking platforms.\n-\nAccessibility: Many credit unions serve a specific city, state, or region, meaning branches tend to be limited to a particular area. On the other hand, larger banks may have a bigger network of branches and ATMs across the country.\nRead more: Differences between credit unions vs. banks\nAre credit unions safer than banks?\nWhile credit unions may have a reputation for being safer, you can reliably bank with either type of institution. When choosing between a bank and a credit union, the decision will likely hinge on factors other than security.\nThat said, here are some reasons credit unions may feel slightly safer than banks:\n-\nCredit unions may be more likely to prioritize members\u2019 best interests. Credit unions operate as nonprofit, member-owned organizations. That means they\u2019re generally focused on serving their members rather than generating profits for shareholders. As a result, credit unions tend to make more conservative lending and investment decisions, prioritizing stability and members' financial well-being over high returns or riskier financial activities.\n-\nCredit unions offer more personalized service. Credit unions usually cater to a specific community, region, or demographic, allowing them to customize their products and services to meet their members\u2019 needs. They also tend to have a bigger emphasis on customer service. This can contribute to an overall impression of safety and stability, even if it doesn\u2019t necessarily make credit unions safer than banks from a purely financial or regulatory standpoint.\n-\nCredit unions tend to offer lower interest rates for borrowers. Credit unions often have lower caps on loan and credit card interest rates compared to banks, helping members save money during hard financial times.\n-\nThere are more bank failures than credit union failures. One study by researchers at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley found that banks have a slightly higher failure rate than credit unions (0.48% vs. 0.44%, respectively). For example, following the aftermath of the Great Recession, more than 400 banks failed, while closer to 100 credit unions failed. And in 2023, five banks failed, while three credit unions either merged or closed.\nRead more: Can credit unions fail?\nAgain, both credit unions and banks are generally safe thanks to federal regulations and insurance. However, if you want the security of lower fees, more personalized service, and an institution that puts members\u2019 needs first, a credit union may be the better choice for you.\nFrequently asked questions\nAre credit unions safer than banks in a crash?\nAs long as they\u2019re insured, credit unions and banks are both safe in a financial crash. The NCUA and FDIC insure deposits of up to $250,000 at credit unions and banks. Assuming your bank or credit union is insured, your deposits are guaranteed up to that amount. However, credit unions may offer lower interest rates for borrowers. During hard financial times, this perk may make credit unions feel safer.\nIs it safer to put your money in a bank or credit union?\nIt\u2019s safe to put your money in either a bank or a credit union, as both are federally insured up to $250,000 by either the FDIC or NCUA. While the safety of your deposits is guaranteed at both types of institutions, there are a few reasons credit unions may feel safer to some people. For example, credit unions tend to offer fewer fees, lower interest rates on loans, and a more personalized customer experience.\nWhat is the downside of banking with a credit union?\nWhile credit unions offer several advantages, there are a few downsides to consider too. For example, credit unions may not offer the same accessibility banks do. Because they often serve a specific region or group of people, branches and ATMs may be limited to a small geographic area. Credit unions also may not have the range of products, services, and technology that banks have. Finally, credit unions require membership, which may be a hassle or barrier to some individuals.\nIs it better to belong to a bank or a credit union?\nWhether it\u2019s better to belong to a bank or credit union depends on your preferences. If you prioritize accessibility, a wide range of products and services, and the latest digital banking tools and technology, you may prefer using a bank. But if you prioritize customer service, lower fees, and low-cost borrowing, you may want to consider joining a credit union. However, both banks and credit unions are secure places to keep your money."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nA personal loan can help you cover many expenses, whether you want to front the cost of a major home improvement or pay for an unexpected medical bill. While these loans are flexible and useful, lenders have varying qualification requirements for borrowers. For example, some may require good credit while others are designed with poor-credit borrowers in mind.\nWorried you might not be eligible for a personal loan? Here\u2019s the inside scoop on personal loan requirements and how to maximize your chances of approval.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n5 common personal loan requirements\nLender requirements vary for personal loan borrowers, so it\u2019s important to research and compare options before applying. Generally, though, you\u2019ll need to provide the following:\n1. Valid identification\nLenders generally require that you confirm your age and identity by providing a copy of a government-issued ID. Acceptable forms of identification may be a driver\u2019s license, passport, military ID, Social Security card, or birth certificate, but check with the lender for specifics.\n2. Proof of residence or address\nYou may also need to share proof of address. Valid documents may include a utility bill in your name, a copy of your lease or mortgage, a voter registration card, or a copy of your homeowners or auto insurance policy listing your address.\n3. Consistent income\nLenders may have income requirements, such as earning a minimum of $25,000 annually, though this isn\u2019t always the case. Regardless, you'll need to prove you have steady income or ample savings to afford your monthly payments. Pay stubs, bank statements, and other documentation for employment and income verification are typically required.\n4. Manageable debt\nJust because you have enough money coming in doesn\u2019t mean you have the cash on hand to make your personal loan payments. Lenders consider your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to measure your ability to make a loan payment.\nYour DTI is expressed as a percentage and reflects how much of your gross monthly income goes toward existing debt, such as auto loans or credit card payments. Lenders often prefer a DTI below 36%.\n5. Acceptable credit score and history\nYou don\u2019t need perfect credit to qualify for a personal loan, though many lenders require at least good credit. Good credit scores range from 670 to 739. Some lenders may also accept fair credit (580 to 669), though you\u2019ll typically end up with a higher interest rate.\nLearn more: What credit score do you need for a personal loan?\nHow to increase your likelihood of approval\nUnderstanding what lenders require is just the first step. The next step is determining how to improve your chances of qualifying for a personal loan. Here are some tips.\n1. Check your credit\nBefore applying, check your credit reports for inaccuracies. You can get free copies of your credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com. If you notice any errors, you can file a dispute with the credit bureaus and fix the issue before applying for a loan.\nNote that your credit scores won\u2019t appear on your credit reports. But banks and credit card issuers often allow you to check your credit scores for free. Since many lenders require good credit, understanding where your credit score stands is important before applying for a loan.\n2. Shore up your finances\nBefore you start to compare loan options, make sure your financial house is in order. Consider supplementing your income with a side gig if your monthly debt payments are high. Ensure you\u2019re up to date on monthly debt payments, limit your credit card spending to reduce your credit utilization, and set up automatic payments so you won\u2019t miss a bill.\nIf your credit score isn\u2019t great, these steps could help boost it before you apply for a loan.\nRelated: 7 ways to improve your personal cash flow\n3. Calculate what you can afford\nNext, determine how much you need to borrow and how long you\u2019ll need to pay it back. Estimate your interest rate and use a loan calculator to determine a potential monthly payment. Personal loans often have repayment terms as long as seven years or as short as a year or two.\nKnowing what you can comfortably afford before applying for a loan could help increase your chances of approval.\nDo you need to prequalify for a personal loan?\nWhile it\u2019s not strictly necessary, it\u2019s a good idea to prequalify for a loan with a few different lenders. You can often input a few pieces of personal information on the lender's website, and the lender will show you the estimated interest rates and loan terms you might qualify for.\nAlthough the interest rate isn\u2019t guaranteed, prequalification allows you to see the lender\u2019s personal loan rates and your estimated monthly payment. While prequalifying with your current bank or credit union offers a good starting point, you\u2019ll also want to prequalify with other lenders. Doing so will let you compare potential loan offers, helping you find the best and most affordable option.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the prequalification process involves a soft credit check, which won\u2019t impact your credit score. Once you submit a full application, the lender will initiate a hard credit check, which will show up on your credit reports and could affect your credit score.\nThis article was edited by Alicia Hahn."

While having a co-signer can improve loan approval chances, it's not strictly necessary; buyers can explore various financing options, including credit unions and online lenders, to secure loans independently. Additionally, strategies such as trading in an old vehicle, making a larger down payment, or considering personal loans can help buyers navigate the car purchasing process more effectively.",
