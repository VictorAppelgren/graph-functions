  "description": "The US State Department on Tuesday released a pared-down version of its annual report meant to catalogue human rights concerns in countries around the world.",
  "content": "The US State Department on Tuesday released a pared-down version of its annual report meant to catalogue human rights concerns in countries around the world.\n\nThe report covers the 2024 calendar year \u2013 before the Trump administration took office \u2013 and sources told CNN it was largely completed before the US president began his second term. However, it underwent significant revisions in the subsequent months.\n\nThere were notable changes between the previous report released April 2024 \u2013 covering 2023 \u2013 and the one released Tuesday. For countries whose leaders are political allies of the Trump administration, like El Salvador, there was far less criticism and detail about reports of their human rights abuses.\n\nIn traditionally allied countries like Germany and the United Kingdom, the latest report alleged a deteriorating human rights situation in 2024, noting that \u201csignificant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression.\u201d Trump administration officials have lambasted European nations for allegations of free speech backsliding.\n\nThe latest report was stripped of many of the specific sections included in past reports, including reporting on alleged abuses based on sexual orientation, violence toward women, corruption in government, systemic racial or ethnic violence, or denial of a fair public trial. Some country reports, including for Afghanistan, do address human rights abuses against women.\n\n\u201cWe were asked to edit down the human rights reports to the bare minimum of what was statutorily required,\u201d said Michael Honigstein, the former director of African Affairs at the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy and Labor. He and his office helped compile the initial reports.\n\nThe report itself acknowledges that it was adjusted, saying the country reports \u201cwere streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners, and to be more responsive to the underlying legislative mandate and aligned to the administration\u2019s executive orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe minimize the amount of statistical data in the report. In the age of the internet, the underlying data are generally available,\u201d an appendix to the latest report said.\n\n\u201cFor purposes of focus and streamlining, the reports select illustrative examples of alleged abuses and in most instances follow up only on high-profile unresolved allegations from previous years,\u201d it said.\n\nA senior State Department official said that \u201cUS policy on promoting respect for human rights around the globe, or in any particular country has not changed.\u201d\n\nThe release of the report comes after significant changes were made to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor \u2013 which housed the teams that prepare the annual, congressionally-mandated reports. Many of the staff who worked on the reports, including drafts of the ones released Tuesday, were fired last month. The bureau\u2019s focus has been shifted to \u201cadvancing the Administration\u2019s affirmative vision of American and Western values.\u201d\n\nThe report on El Salvador, where the US deported Venezuelan migrants earlier this year, is much shorter than the one released last year. The latest one claims \u201cthere were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses\u201d in 2024.\n\nHowever, it notes that \u201cthere were several reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings during the year\u201d and that some suspects arrested under suspicion of gang affiliation \u201cdied in prison prior to conviction or completing their sentences.\u201d\n\nThe report from the previous year \u2013 which was four times as long \u2013 describes \u201csignificant human rights.\u201d These included \u201ccredible reports of: unlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; extensive gender-based violence, including domestic and sexual violence, and femicide; substantial barriers to sexual and reproductive health services access; trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and crimes involving violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons.\u201d\n\nThe report on Israel includes a far less extensive documentation of reports of human rights abuses, leaving out any reference to \u201csignificant human rights issues,\u201d which is in the 2023 report.\n\nThe latest report mentions Hamas and Hezbollah only in a very sparse section about reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nLast year\u2019s report, however, noted allegations of \u201cextensive and in many cases unprecedented conflict-related abuses\u201d and war crimes committed not only by Hamas, but also Israel, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian militant groups.\n\nThere is no reference to allegations of torture of Palestinian detainees by Israeli government officials \u2013 which were included in the previous year\u2019s report, but the report says that the Israel Security Agency and police \u201cused violent interrogation methods.\u201d There is also no mention of the criminal trial of Prime Minister Netanyahu on charges of bribetaking, fraud and breach of trust, which were ongoing at the time.\n\nThe latest country report on Afghanistan is also far shorter than last year\u2019s. However, it still describes reports of \u201csignificant human rights issues\u201d and \u201cwidespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nThe report notes a \u201csignificant deterioration in respect for women\u2019s rights\u201d in 2024 due to edicts \u201ceffectively removing them from public spaces.\u201d\n\nDespite such findings, the Trump administration sought to end Temporary Protected Status for Afghans in the US, citing \u201cnotable improvements in the security and economic situation\u201d in Afghanistan.\n\nThe latest report on Russia, while lengthier than others, was still shorter than the one released last year. It points to the death of Aleksey Navalny in a Russian prison in February 2024, noting the prison is \u201cknown for harsh conditions and alleged torture.\u201d It also cites vast human rights abuses inside Russia, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances perpetrated by government authorities. But the report does not include a full section on corruption, which was described as \u201cwidespread throughout the executive branch\u201d in last year\u2019s report.\n\nThe report also says there were credible reports that some Russian forces committed war crimes and crimes against humanity as they continued their invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s forces and officials committed crimes against humanity, including but not limited to deporting thousands of civilians to Russia, including children. The government operated an extensive system of filtration and detention operations that sometimes included the use of forced labor,\u201d the report says.\n\nNot all of the reports were drastically changed from last year. The latest country report on China is very similar. It notes that genocide and crimes against humanity occurred against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, the report says. It also concludes that the Chinese government did \u201cnot take credible steps or action to identify or punish officials who committed human rights abuses\u201d in 2024, which mirrors the findings from the previous year\u2019s report.",
