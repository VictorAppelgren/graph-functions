  "title": "The emperor strikes back\u2014but Trump's revenge and deflection aren\u2019t public protection",
  "description": "Over 2,000 years ago, Roman emperors would arrange massive public salutes to themselves, surrounded by armed, uniformed soldiers and cheering crowds.",
  "content": "Deflection is not protection, unless you are President Trump, desperate to divert national attention away from your own failures and ongoing legal problems. Sounding false alarms over public safety despite falling crime rates, Trump is manufacturing misinformation to lead a dangerous military war on his own American cities as a dodge from accountability while, paradoxically, degrading public safety.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s bravado, despite his firing of non-political career economists, prosecutors, and military leaders, and despite his attacks on former Trump Administration officials and critical media commentators, he cannot hide the evidence.\n\nHe cannot hide the evidence of rising inflation and wide-ranging national security failures, such as threats of nuclear war from North Korea, the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza, or the continued Russian mass slaughter of Ukrainian civilians. He cannot hide the public outrage over maneuvers intended to evade the release of the full Epstein sex trafficking files, and over cutbacks to Medicaid and disaster relief. Targeting critics for unwarranted criminal investigations and deploying thousands of National Guardsmen have sidetracked media attention from his own setbacks but they have made the nation less safe.\n\nAs experts on leadership, governance, community policing, counterterrorism, and military training, we condemn Trump\u2019s dangerous erosion of public safety and outline how to fortify law enforcement. Trump\u2019s grandiose displays of brute force\u2014the massing of weapons of war and platoons of masked, unidentified combat fighters targeting the very civilian populations they are commissioned to protect\u2014does not bring reassurance.\n\nThis June, Trump invoked Title 10 of the U.S. Code to send about 700 active-duty Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, over the objection of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, citing the urgent need to combat rebellions and to repel foreign invasions.\n\nTrump has now expanded this massive federal invasion into Washington DC, and he\u2019s been widely reported to be planning the military occupation of other Democratic-led cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle, and Detroit, despite the reality of crime already significantly dropping in all these cities. Such moves conjure up images of the suppression tactics of feared secret police forces, from Russia\u2019s FSB (formerly known as the KGB) to China\u2019s MSS to the former Savak and Gestapo agencies of Iran and Germany, respectively.\n\nThe president has an uncanny ability to reframe national attention by taking the focus off his failures with distractions based on the repetition of distorted statistics, fortified by large ceremonial events. In the recent past, he invented false charges of President Obama\u2019s non-American birth, untrue charges of New Jersey Muslims cheering the collapse of the twin towers of 9/11, and antivax conspiracies insisting that COVID was a Democratic hoax. He incited a riot at the US Capitol as he falsely declared massive election fraud, amassed thousands of troops along the southern border to repel mysterious caravans of illegal immigrants, and made false allegations of Haitian immigrants eating their neighbors\u2019 pets.\n\nTrump\u2019s crime data as empty as his military parade\n\nEarly this summer, on his 79th birthday, overlapping with the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary, he imported 6,600 soldiers along with tanks, armored personnel carriers and aircraft, supported by roughly 150 vehicles, including Strykers, M1 Abrams tanks and Humvees. (Trump was rebuffed when he tried to pull off such a grandiose parade during his first term.) Despite the cost of up to $45 million, only several thousand civilians came to watch the event, with photos showing the bleachers largely empty, while the anti-Trump \u201cNo Kings\u201d counter rallies drew up to 6 million Americans nationwide.\n\nAs a counter to this failed show of military force to divert public attention, Trump has now weaponized the military against America, seizing the false pretext of crime when a DOGE staffer who called himself \u201cBig Balls\u201d was assaulted during an attempted carjacking. Trump inaccurately proclaimed \u201cWe have a capital that\u2019s very unsafe,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have to run D.C.\u201d\n\nTrump announced a virulent crime epidemic, but his own Justice Department (DOJ) numbers show this to be false. Trump\u2019s move on DC came just months after the DOJ announced that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low, and it was down 35% in 2024 from the year before. According to recent data released by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), homicides are down 11% year-to-date in comparison to the same period in 2024 and violent crime is down 26%. Although violent crime rates in Washington DC, are higher than the national average, the Council on Criminal Justice announced last week \u201cthere is an unmistakable and large drop in reported violence in the District since the summer of 2023 \u2026 consistent with what\u2019s being reported in other large cities across the country.\u201d\n\nCity leaders also insist the crackdown is unnecessary and destabilizing, pointing to data showing that violent crime is already declining. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back on Trump\u2019s characterization of the city, calling his actions both a photo op and a gross militarization of the nation\u2019s capital. She tweeted that \u201cAmerican soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican.\u201d\n\nTrump has since ordered thousands of soldiers from the National Reserves and federalized law enforcement officers to converge on Washington, with exaggerated assertions of crime, to divert the public narrative away from his own legal challenges and on public safety instead.\n\nWashington is like a city under siege, with armed combat troops establishing federal checkpoints, with individuals being asked questions about their immigration status and then being arrested, with no evidence of a criminal violation and no evident crimes committed. His false public safety emergency invoked section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which gives the President of the United States the authority to seize control of DC\u2019s Police Department in \u201cconditions of an emergency nature.\u201d (Attorney General Pam Bondi was initially placed in charge of the MPD, but the DOJ agreed to withdraw that power grab following negotiations required by a federal judge.)\n\nSection 740 provides the president only limited and temporary powers to direct the mayor to provide the services of MPD for federal purposes after the president determines that \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency nature exist. Authority over the MPD lapses after just 48 hours unless they obtain a joint resolution from Congress to extend the authority for beyond 30 days. The legal time limit and required congressional approvals should act as an important limit on such abuse of presidential power, however Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) has already introduced a resolution to extend it beyond the 30-day period.\n\nThis past June, one of us ran 20 of Trump\u2019s most prominent pronouncements through all five of the top AI platforms (Chat GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic, Perplexity; and X AI\u2019s Grok) and found agreement that every single one of them was false, as we wrote in The Washington Post. Our new original review of all five leading AI platforms, drawing on scores of different independent databases, contradict Trump and indicate Trump\u2019s pretext of out-of-control crime to be a lie \u2014 all federal and state law enforcement statistics reveal plunging crime rates in all of these cities.\n\nAccordingly, some GOP governors have declined Trump\u2019s request for National Guard troops, such as Vermont Governor Phil Scott, who issued a bold statement defying Trump: \u201cWhile public safety is a legitimate concern in cities across the country and certainly in the nation\u2019s capital, in the absence of an immediate emergency or disaster that local and regional first responders are unable to handle, the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as a proper use of the National Guard.\u201d\n\nThe public reaction has been a humiliating blend of outrage and mockery rather than the intended adulation. A recent Pew Research Poll found that most Americans believe Trump has made the federal government worse. Even in Washington, the federal military crackdown has destroyed business, with people hiding at home and independent restaurant booking data showing business plummeting by a stunning 31%.\n\nSuch rejection of his efforts to reflect has angered Trump even more, as he called the federal and local crime statistics false and demanded criminal investigations of the data collection. Army, Air Force, and Marine generals and admirals have decried this attack on our cities as a \u201cpolitical stunt with his very dangerous for our country\u201d creating dangerous crowd situations.\n\nGeneral Mark Hertling has said \u201cin this case, I can\u2019t see what the mission is right now.\u201d Former Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper has warned that Trump asked him to shoot peaceful protestors demonstrating after the George Floyd murder.\n\nSoldiers are not trained to be police\n\nOne of us who has trained the nation\u2019s military forces for decades at West Point warns that people who are trained to kill in battle are not trained in assisting distressed citizens in emergency healthcare or aiding those in mental distress, let alone handling traffic stops, routine arrests, domestic violence, or peacefully calming neighborhood disputes. Military reservists are civilians who jump back into uniforms to assist heroically in natural disaster recovery, provide humanitarian assistance, or to fortify regular combat divisions in battles around the world. Wearing them out in the wrong jobs makes them less available for such national priorities.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has armed the deployed troops with M17 pistols\u2014controversial weapons that have been known to fire if dropped or even when holstered. The manufacturer has made repairs to many of them, but claims of unintentional discharges, including in upgraded models, have continued, leading to ongoing debate and lawsuits about the pistol\u2019s safety.\n\nMore importantly, most of the Guardsmen are not Military Police or Special Ops, meaning that they are not well trained to carry or shoot the handguns they have been armed with. Thus the probability of innocents being killed or wounded in these deployments is high.\n\nMilitaries are designed to win wars: They are trained in Rules of Engagement (ROE), which define the parameters of the use of force on a battlefield. These are governed by the laws of armed conflict (LOC), and provide a framework for identifying appropriate military targets; once identified, they can be eliminated. By contrast, law enforcement are trained in rules on the use of deadly force. Under this paradigm, deadly force is appropriate only when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject poses an imminent threat to the officer or another person. Their actions are governed by the Constitution of the United States: The goal is to \u201cneutralize the threat,\u201d not \u201cshoot to kill.\u201d\n\nThese are very different mindsets. Having individuals who view American streets as a military battlefield, rather than a community whose overall well-being they are trained to protect, is a recipe for disaster.\n\nAnother of us who has led counterterrorism initiatives at the FBI similarly is concerned about the distraction from genuine protection against foreign terrorist plots and international gangs and domestic mass shootings and kidnappings. Instead, soldiers have been needlessly assigned to stand around train stations and monuments, like statues themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, she has called out Trump\u2019s efforts to delegitimize proper FBI investigation of misuse of classified information and other reviews of possible illegal conduct of public officials, punishing them for doing their jobs beforehand, while using them now to silence critics of his administration. There are also concerns about the misuse of needed expertise and resources of ATF agents who need to be targeting the cartels who are smuggling firearms, improving forensic tools for criminal investigations. and assisting in thousands of federal weapons convictions. Meanwhile, the draining of ICE agents from the borders, where the US is now understaffed, comes as Trump urgently seeks to recruit 10,000 more agents.\n\nAnother of us who led the Capitol Police has warned that the collaboration across agencies will work only if the MPD leads the effort as they know the turf. It already has 3,500 police, with unique experience in managing peaceful demonstrations and legal protests. He has confirmed the statistics about the increased safety in Washington and warned that local leadership has the expertise to prevent crowding and overlap of law enforcement.\n\nWilliam Bratton, who has successfully led crime-fighting efforts in such major cities as Boston, Los Angeles, and New York, provided the track record and data to prove that militarizing municipal law enforcement is the exact wrong way to partner with communities for public safety. As the architect of the successful model of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d in American cities, he advocated for engaging with neighborhoods for beat police officers to be known as resources and not distant, feared soldiers in tanks, operating under central command. He advocated combined crime prevention initiatives with a willingness to listen to community concerns through a system of decentralized management where precinct commanders were held accountable for addressing locally defined problems. His double-digit drops in violent crime across these cities fortifies the credulity of his approach over Trump\u2019s military assault on American cities.\n\nFinally, one co-author, a leadership scholar, has worked with Trump personally and notes that the drive for grandiosity that motivates this misuse of law enforcement, intertwined with military warriors, could have been foreseen years earlier in Trump\u2019s character. His goal is not public safety but rather imperial power. In a 2004 Wall Street Journal essay, entitled \u201cLast Emperor Trump,\u201d he predicted Trump might run for the presidency a decade before he actually did so, warning, \u201cOur curiosity over the tortured logic behind his mysterious choices has a magnetic draw as does the raw power to change the fate of someone else\u2019s life at your pleasure. Roman crowds packed the Colosseum to watch the gladiators battle each other and loved the Emperor\u2019s glance to the onlookers before condemning the loser to death.\u201d\n\nOver 2,000 years ago, the vainglorious emperors and conquering generals of the ancient Roman Empire would arrange massive public salutes to themselves in famous Roman Triumphs where they would surround themselves with armed, uniformed soldiers and cheering crowds to celebrate and sanctify their victories with divine-like imagery. While President Trump may not have been a classics scholar, he certainly tried to model the tradition of such grandiose fanfare. But his classics lesson is backfiring.\n\nAs Benjamin Franklin advised 270 years ago, \u201cThey who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\u201d\n\nThe authors would like to thank Steven Tian and Stephen Henriques from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute for their research.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",

      "text": "Republican Gov. Phil Scott has \u201cpolitely declined\u201d a federal request to deploy Vermont National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C. as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial directive to tamp down on crime.\nAt Trump\u2019s behest, the federal government has taken control of the capital city\u2019s police force and dispatched approximately 800 National Guard troops, as well as roughly 500 federal law enforcement agents, to patrol the streets.\nTheir numbers could have included a \u201cfew dozen\u201d soldiers from Vermont, according to Scott\u2019s chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, had the governor not rebuffed a preliminary request from the Pentagon last week.\n\u201cWhile public safety is a legitimate concern in cities across the country and certainly in the nation\u2019s capital, in the absence of an immediate emergency or disaster that local and regional first responders are unable to handle, the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as a proper use of the National Guard,\u201d Gibbs said Friday.\nGibbs said the governor\u2019s calculation might have been different if Washington, D.C. officials were seeking federal assistance with an emergency situation. Instead, the city on Friday filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration\u2019s takeover of its police force.\n\u201cBut in this case, because it is being hyperpoliticized, the governor doesn\u2019t feel like \u2014 and I believe the vast majority of Vermonters don\u2019t feel like \u2014 it would be an acceptable and appropriate use of the National Guard,\u201d Gibbs said.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Scott has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to use Vermont National Guard soldiers for a domestic mission. Late last month, the Pentagon asked Scott to mobilize a dozen Guard soldiers to perform administrative duties at detention facilities operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nScott rejected the request, saying it was inconsistent with his views of the purpose of the National Guard.\nThe Republican governor\u2019s decision caught the attention of a group of retired four-star admirals and generals, who sent a letter to Scott Thursday praising his actions. The letter, signed by people including retired Adm. Steve Abbott, the former acting homeland security advisor to President Trump, and retired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Trump\u2019s recent requests for Guard troops \u201crepresent a troubling blurring of lines between civilian law enforcement and military responsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cBy rejecting the Department of Defense\u2019s request to activate the Vermont Army National Guard as an inappropriate use of military resources, you stood up for the security of Vermonters and the healthy civil-military relationship envisioned by our nation\u2019s founders,\u201d they wrote.\nWhile Scott has thus far into the second Trump administration turned down all federal requests related to potential Guard operations, he has complied with other controversial orders.\nEarlier this month, Scott approved the release of the sensitive personal information of about 140,000 low-income Vermonters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. His decision drew condemnation from food-security advocates and prominent Vermont Democrats.\nScott said an exhaustive legal review by his administration concluded that the Trump administration's demand for the data was a lawful order.\nGibbs said Friday that the governor\u2019s pattern of decision-making, when it comes to requests from the federal government over the past seven months, reflects a deliberative process that is \u201cdisciplined and clinical.\u201d\n\u201cHe makes a decision that is very detail driven. And it\u2019s not politically driven. It\u2019s not rhetorically driven. It\u2019s not driven by media, and it\u2019s not driven by fear or anger or frustration,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\u201cAnd that type of protocol we believe serves everyone well \u2026 and represents the type of leadership in this particular political environment that is different than what we\u2019re seeing on both sides of the political spectrum.\u201d"

      "text": "The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as President Donald Trump looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.\nIt is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.\nTrump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, \u201cI think Chicago will be our next, and then we\u2019ll help with New York.\u201d\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said Friday that the city has not heard from the White House about the deployment or any increased law enforcement presence, adding that such a move would be \u201cuncalled for\u201d and \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\nJohnson told MSNBC on Sunday the city would take legal action if Trump sent troops into the city, adding that \u201cthe people of this city are accustomed to rising up against tyranny.\u201d\n\u201cWhat he is proposing at this point would be the most flagrant violation of our Constitution in the 21st century. The city of Chicago does not need a military occupation,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we need. In fact, we\u2019ve been very clear about what we need. We need to invest in people to ensure that we can build safe and affordable communities.\u201d\nWhen asked for comment, the White House on Saturday referred CNN to Trump\u2019s remarks in the Oval Office a day earlier. The president said Friday he hadn\u2019t spoken to the Chicago mayor when asked by a reporter whether he had taken any \u201cconcrete steps\u201d toward a crackdown in the city.\nA spokesperson for the Pentagon told CNN, \u201cWe won\u2019t speculate on further operations. The Department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel.\u201d\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement Saturday that he has not heard from the federal government and that Illinois has not made requests to the federal government for help.\n\u201cThe safety of the people of Illinois is always my top priority. There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active duty military within our own borders,\u201d Pritzker said.\nThe plans align with the Trump administration\u2019s unusual efforts to use the military for law enforcement and immigration actions within the US\u2019 borders.\nThe administration\u2019s potential moves in Chicago, first reported by the Washington Post, would be different from the law enforcement crackdown in Washington, DC, where Trump \u2014 and in turn the federal government \u2014 has more leeway in directing troops and a range of federal authorities.\nInstead, the administration\u2019s future plans, including in Chicago, are expected to look like Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard earlier this summer to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests, sources told CNN.\nIn June, Trump evoked Title 10 of the US Code to send about 700 active-duty Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the objection of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Title 10 allows the president to deploy the National Guard as necessary to repel invasion, suppress rebellion or execute laws, which means the National Guard reports to the president rather than the governor.\nCalifornia immediately challenged the legality of Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in a lawsuit that is making its way through the court system.\nStill, Trump touted the move as an unmitigated success. \u201cWithout the Military, Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven\u2019t seen in years,\u201d he wrote on social media in June.\nIt is not uncommon for federal authorities, like the National Guard, to assist in emergency situations across the country in cases of disaster relief or civil unrest. But experts say that sending in the National Guard in a blanket order to crack down on crime and implement Trump\u2019s immigration policies is unprecedented.\nAs the administration looks to expand its immigration agenda inside the US, rather than just on the southern border, it has tried to augment Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s capacity by pulling personnel from multiple agencies, including the US military.\nCNN has previously reported that internal discussions have included how to mobilize active-duty troops from consenting states as force protection for federal agents and whether National Guard units from Republican-led states could be used in non-consenting states.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has also made clear that cities and states across the country with so-called sanctuary policies, which limit local officials from assisting in federal immigration enforcement, could be a target for the National Guard.\nHowever, Democratic governors and city mayors are pushing back.\n\u201cStop attacking our cities to hide your administration\u2019s failures,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, said earlier this week in response to a letter from Bondi.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN\u2019s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report."

      "text": "Over the past six months, Americans have become less supportive of Donald Trump\u2019s policies and plans \u2014 and more likely to say that Trump is making the way the federal government works worse.\nBut wide partisan divides remain, with Republicans being far more likely than Democrats to express confidence in Trump on both domestic and foreign policy issues.\nTrump\u2019s policies and plans\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have become less likely to express support for Trump\u2019s policies in recent months:\n- 58% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they support all or most of Trump\u2019s policies, down from two-thirds earlier this year.\n- 88% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they support few or none of Trump\u2019s policies, a modest increase from the 84% who said the same in February. This includes 51% who say they support none of Trump\u2019s policies and plans.\nTrump\u2019s influence on the way government works\nA narrow majority of Americans (53%) say Trump is making the way the federal government works worse, nearly double the share who say he is making it better (27%). Two-in-ten say Trump is making the government function about equally better and worse.\nWhile there are wide partisan differences in perceptions of Trump\u2019s impact on the federal government, both Democrats and Republicans have become more negative in their assessments than they were at the start of his term.\nDemocrats (87%) overwhelmingly say Trump is making the way the government works worse. A few weeks into his presidency, 78% predicted that he would make this worse.\nWhile a 55% majority of Republicans say Trump is making the government work better, that is 21 percentage points lower than the share who expected he would make things better six months ago. The share of Republicans saying he is making things worse is also up, from 7% to 16%, over that period.\nConfidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle issues\nAcross most domestic and foreign policy issues, Americans express less confidence in Trump than they did in the period leading up to his election in November. However, views are little changed in recent months.\nFewer than half of Americans express confidence in Trump on any of the 12 issues asked about on the survey, but he performs better on some issues than others:\n- 47% say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries.\n- 46% express confidence in Trump to make good decisions about immigration and use military force wisely.\nBut substantially smaller shares are confident in Trump\u2019s ability to bring the country closer together (31%) or work well with Democratic elected officials (27%).\nViews among Republicans\nWide majorities of Republicans are at least somewhat confident in Trump on most of these measures, including his ability to:\n- Make good decisions about immigration and use military force wisely (83% each)\n- Negotiate trade agreements with other countries, effectively handle law enforcement and criminal justice issues, and respond effectively to natural disasters (81% each)\n- Make good decisions about economic (80%), foreign (79%), tax (77%) and health care (72%) policy\n- Manage the executive branch effectively (77%)\nBy comparison, much smaller shares of Republicans express confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to bring the country closer together (56%) or work well with Democratic elected officials (49%).\n(Note that the survey was conducted prior to Trump\u2019s announcement that he would federalize the District of Columbia\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department and deploy the National Guard to combat crime in the city.)\nViews among Democrats\nAcross the full set of domestic and foreign policy issues, small shares of Democrats express confidence in Trump\u2019s ability \u2013 no more than 15% of Democrats express confidence in Trump on any (15% say have confidence in him on negotiating trade deals), with even smaller shares expressing confidence in him on several of the issues (including working well with Democrats, making good decisions about health care policy and bringing the country closer together).\nConfidence in Trump on foreign policy issues\nSeven-in-ten or more Republicans say they are at least somewhat confident that Trump can make wise decisions across a series of foreign policy issues, while no more than two-in-ten Democrats say the same.\nMost of these views are little changed from last July, during the presidential campaign. But confidence in Trump\u2019s decision-making on the war between Ukraine and Russia is lower than it was last year, particularly among Republicans.\nToday, 40% of Americans are at least somewhat confident in Trump to make wise decisions about the Ukraine-Russia conflict, down from 45% last summer. And while 73% of Republicans express confidence today, that is down from 81% a year ago.\nRelated: How Americans view the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war"

The parade is said to be planned on June 14: the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, and Donald Trump\u2019s 79th birthday. Trump has long wanted a showy parade of military units since seeing France\u2019s Bastille Day in 2018.\nDonald Trump has long wanted to oversee a military parade. This year, he might finally get one.\nWashington CityPaper reports Trump has set June 14, which is his birthday as well as the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, for a massive military parade. Details are still in the process of being worked out.\nAn Arlington County board member says the county was given the \u201cheads up\u201d about the parade late last week, but does not yet know the scope of the festivities.\nTrump, in his first term, pushed for a military parade, with soldiers marching through Washington and tanks rolling down the city streets in 2018, following his attendance of Bastille Day in Paris. On his trip home on Air Force One, he told aides he wanted to create a similar show of military force in the U.S.\nThe idea was scuttled after military leaders calculated the parade would cost $92 million\u2014and D.C. officials expressed concern about the impact of the parade on local roads and the $21 million it would cost for public safety.\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, at the time, wasn\u2019t afraid to challenge Trump, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that he had canceled the parade with a fierce tweet of her own, writing \u201cYup, I\u2019m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington DC, the local politician who finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities ($21.6M) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad).\u201d\nThere has been no pushback to this proposal, however.\nOrganizing such a massive parade in just a few months could be a challenge to coordinators, especially as widespread job cuts are happening across a swath of federal divisions. The White House has not commented on the possibility of a parade."

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc"

      "text": "Trump threatens to deploy troops to Baltimore to 'clean up' crime\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy troops to Baltimore, escalating a clash with Maryland Governor Wes Moore after the Democrat invited him to join a \"safety walk\" in the city.\n\"If Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,\" Trump wrote on social media.\nThe comments mark the latest flashpoint in the president's efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of what he calls a crackdown on crime.\nThe use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement has drawn fierce backlash from Democrats. One governor described it as an \"abuse of power\".\nTrump has already deployed around 2,000 troops to Washington DC, a Democratic stronghold.\nOn Sunday, the Guard started to carry weapons in Washington, the military said. Previously, their weapons were available if needed but kept in the armoury.\nA statement from the Joint Task Force said they were only to be used as a last resort.\nAs many as 1,700 troops are expected to mobilise in 19 states in the coming weeks, US media report.\nGovernor Moore, a frequent critic of the president's strategy, said Trump's comments about fighting crime \"come off as so, so tone deaf and so ignorant\".\n\"It's because they have not walked our streets,\" Moore said. \"They have not been in our communities, and they are more than happy to keep making these repeated tropes about us.\"\nTrump's Sunday Truth Social comments appeared to be a direct response to Moore's invitation letter to Trump which the president described as \"nasty\" and \"provocative\".\n\"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk,'\" Trump wrote.\n- Is crime in Washington DC 'out of control', as Trump claims?\n- Crime in DC: What do the figures say and how safe do people feel?\nThe White House says hundreds of arrests have been made since the operation began in Washington DC.\nSpeaking in the White House Oval Office on Friday, Trump said the mission had brought \"total safety\" to Washington.\n\"DC was a hellhole,\" he said. \"But now it's safe.\"\nAccording to crime figures published by Washington DC's Metropolitan Police (MPDC), violent offences fell after peaking in 2023 and in 2024 hit their lowest level in 30 years.\nThey are continuing to fall, according to preliminary data for 2025.\nViolent crime overall is down 26% this year compared to the same point in 2024, and robbery is down 28%, according to the MPDC.\nTrump has suggested he would deploy troops in New York and Chicago as well.\nThis escalation has led to condemnation from Democrats leaders of other states and cities including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker who said Trump's threats to deploy troops to Chicago is an abuse of power.\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also weighed in, asserting that Trump lacks the legal authority to dispatch troops to cities like Baltimore and Chicago.\nHe said the president was exploiting reduced crime levels - like Baltimore's \"fewest homicides in over 50 years\" - to manufacture a crisis.\nA poll conducted by the Washington Post and Schar School released earlier this week found the deployment deeply unpopular among the city's residents, with almost 80% saying they were opposed to both the deployment of federal officers and the National Guard, as well as the takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department."

They were intended to provide the task force overseeing the federal protection mission in LA \u201cwith adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency,\u201d US Northern Command said at the time.\nThere are still another roughly 2,000 California Army National Guard soldiers assigned to the mission who were mobilized later in June.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement Monday called for the remaining National Guard soldiers to be withdrawn from the state.\n\u201cThe women and men of the California National Guard deserve more than to continue serving as puppets in Trump and Stephen Miller\u2019s performative political theater,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere was never a need for the military to deploy against civilians in Los Angeles. The damage is done, however. We, again, call upon them to do the right thing and end the militarization once and for all.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass welcomed the decision to withdraw the Marines.\n\u201cThis is another win for Los Angeles but this is also a win for those serving this country in uniform,\u201d Bass said in a statement on Monday. \u201cJust this morning I stood with Veterans, families of active duty officers, and business leaders to show the impact of this unnecessary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional assault on our city.\u201d\nThe Marines\u2019 deployment to LA was immediately met with criticism as a significant escalation of the use of the military by President Donald Trump. LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said at the time that the arrival of Marines \u201cabsent clear coordination\u201d would present \u201ca significant logistical and operational challenges for those of us charged with safeguarding this city.\u201d\nThe Marines, like the National Guardsmen who were activated under Title 10 status, were prohibited from conducting law enforcement activity, which is outlawed under the Insurrection Act.\nNewsom said in a statement in June that the \u201clevel of escalation is completely unwarranted, uncalled for, and unprecedented,\u201d adding the Trump administration was \u201cmobilizing the best in class branch of the U.S. military against its own citizens.\u201d\nA senior Pentagon official said during a congressional hearing last month that the mobilization of the Marines and National Guardsmen was estimated to cost $134 million.\n\u201cThe current estimated cost is $134 million, which is largely just [temporary duty] cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,\u201d Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense and official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.\nAsked further about the funding for the mobilization, MacDonnell said it would come from other operation and maintenance accounts.\nDuring the same hearing, Hegseth aggressively defended sending US troops to LA, arguing that \u201call three\u201d requirements in the US Code that authorizes the president to federalize the National Guard applied to the situation.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the US Code \u2026 as a legal basis that the president used, cites three examples and circumstances for the guard: invasion by a foreign nation, rebellion or dangerous rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States, or the president is unable, with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\u201d Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar said. \u201cWhich authority is triggered here to justify the use?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, you just read it yourself, and people can listen themselves, but it sounds like all three to me,\u201d Hegseth responded.\n\u201cThe governor of the California has failed to protect his people, along with the mayor of Los Angeles, and so President Trump has said he will protect our agents, and our guard and Marines are proud to do it,\u201d he later added.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles, overriding California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s objections in a rare move.\nThis invocation of presidential powers that have remained dormant for decades signifies an escalation that challenges both state authority and long-established standards, some experts and political leaders say.\nProtests in and around Los Angeles erupted on Friday after federal immigration agents arrested at least 44 people. The arrests come amid Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration, which has involved waves of raids and deportations across the country.\nLaw enforcement used tear gas and flash bang grenades in an effort to disperse protesters over the weekend, but Trump said local officials had failed to deal with the unrest, and the federal government would \u201csolve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!\u201d he wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 of the United States Code to \u201ctemporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions\u201d as well as federal property, he announced in a memo to the attorney general and the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security Saturday.\nTitle 10 allows the president to deploy the National Guard as necessary to repel invasion, suppress rebellion or execute laws, which means the National Guard reports to the president rather than the governor.\nTrump\u2019s federalization of National Guard troops marks the first time a US chief executive has used such power since 1992, when the Los Angeles riots erupted after four White police officers were acquitted in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King.\nDozens of people were killed, thousands injured and thousands were arrested during several days of rioting in Los Angeles. Property damage was estimated at more than $1 billion in one of the worst civil disturbances in US history.\nHowever, the deployment ordered by then-President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, occurred at the request of then-California Gov. Pete Wilson, another Republican. It is rare for a president to act without a governor\u2019s cooperation or request. In this case, Democrat Newsom has explicitly opposed Trump\u2019s deployment order.\n\u201cThat move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions,\u201d Newsom said on X Saturday. \u201cThis is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.\u201d\nTrump earlier Sunday on Truth Social praised National Guard troops he greenlit to quash ongoing immigration protests in Southern California for doing a \u201cgreat job,\u201d despite no evidence the troops were yet on the ground.\nMinutes after Trump posted on Truth Social, LA Mayor Karen Bass said on X, \u201cJust to be clear, the National Guard has not been deployed in the City of Los Angeles.\u201d\nAbout 300 members of the National Guard arrived in Los Angeles later Sunday morning following two consecutive days of protests over immigration enforcement action, Izzy Gardon, communications director for Newsom, told CNN in an email Sunday.\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens condemned Trump\u2019s order, saying the move \u201cmarks a deeply troubling escalation in the administration\u2019s approach to immigration and civilian reaction to the use of military-style tactics.\u201d\nDemocratic Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n of California agreed.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t asked for the help. We don\u2019t need the help. This is him escalating it, causing tensions to rise. It\u2019s only going to make things worse in a situation where people are already angry over immigration enforcement,\u201d said Barrag\u00e1n, who represents the city of Paramount, where troops have been deployed.\nOn Sunday afternoon, aerial footage showed masses of demonstrators blocking lanes in both directions of a Los Angeles freeway, disrupting traffic. Bass said at a Sunday evening news conference hundreds of people managed to reach the freeway with thousands more occupying the streets nearby.\nProtesters took to the streets near an initial protest site at the Metropolitan Detention Center after the Los Angeles Police Department declared the gathering \u201cunlawful.\u201d The California Highway Patrol said in a post on X some people were arrested as authorities worked to reopen the freeway.\nA look at past federalizations\nOther federal mobilizations of the National Guard since World War II were made to support enforcement of the expansion of civil rights and ensure public order during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957; the University of Mississippi in 1962; and the University of Alabama and Alabama\u2019s public schools in 1963, according to the National Guard\u2019s website.\nGuard units also came under federal control in 1967 to restore public order during the Detroit riots; in 1968 following the assassination of civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and in 1970 during the New York postal strike, according to the National Guard.\nCongress first authorized presidential mobilization of state militias in 1792, to help repel foreign invasions and suppress domestic insurrections, the Guard\u2019s website says.\nThe biggest ever federalization of state militias was made by President Abraham Lincoln, when he called up 75,000 troops to fight the Confederacy and later support Reconstruction. After that, no president federalized state militias to prevent or quell civil disturbances until the 1957 Little Rock action, according to the website.\nWhat makes this situation different from most past federalizations? To start, the deployment came without a request from the state\u2019s governor.\nThe last time this happened was 1965, according to Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy institute.\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson federalized National Guard troops to protect civil rights demonstrators in Alabama that year. Protesters who set out from Selma were protected by over 3,000 National Guard troops, according to the National Archives.\nThe protest march \u2013 the third attempt after previous marches were met with violence from state troopers \u2013 was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. and thousands of protesters walked to the State Capitol in Montgomery, where they delivered a voting rights petition to the governor.\nGoitein described Trump\u2019s deployment as \u201cextremely rare\u201d in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto. She noted Johnson invoked the Insurrection Act \u2013 a move Trump hasn\u2019t taken yet.\nAsked Sunday whether he was prepared to invoke the law, Trump told reporters in New Jersey it \u201cdepends whether or not there is an insurrection.\u201d\nDeployment ordered \u2018without a major crisis,\u2019 expert says\nHistorically, presidents have federalized National Guard deployment when requested by a governor whose resources are overwhelmed, such as during the LA riots or the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana \u2013 or when a governor defies a court order, such as the Little Rock desegregation case, when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the National Guard to support the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision.\nCNN senior national security analyst and former DHS official Juliette Kayyem called the Trump administration\u2019s response to this weekend\u2019s protests an extreme overreaction and said it is \u201cnot rational given the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThis scenario \u2013 some urban unrest handled directly by police and state authorities overruled by a president who is defying a governor \u2013 is without modern precedent,\u201d Kayyem said in a post on X.\n\u201cA democracy does not deploy military for unrest that looks like this,\u201d Kayyem told CNN on Saturday.\nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, about 7,000 National Guard troops were federalized to support New Orleans; ports and prisons were closed, the police force was not functional, and nearly 2,000 people died.\n\u201cThe numbers, when you just compare this to Hurricane Katrina \u2026 an entire city and court system underwater, you get a sense of why Governor Newsom and local law enforcement are very concerned,\u201d Kayyem said.\n\u201cThe comparison to 2,000 (National Guard troops) for a couple of hundred protesters, you can just get a sense of the sort of reaction that the Trump White House is having,\u201d she said.\nThe administration\u2019s diminishing of the standards for deploying and federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 is concerning, Kayyem added.\n\u201cThis is part of an overall reaching by the Trump White House to utilize federal military resources in civilian society, without an insurrection, without a major flood, without a major crisis, and in defiance of political leadership.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Trump called in the National Guard soldiers to \u201caddress the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester\u201d and \u201cviolent mobs attacked ICE Officers and Federal Law Enforcement Agents.\u201d\nEven in the face of violence, disruptions and civil unrest, Kayyem said deploying the National Guard under Title 10 without the governor\u2019s cooperation, especially when local law enforcement is already handling safety concerns, is unnecessary.\n\u201cA car on fire, some unrest, people arrested \u2013 those are things that we have seen in our society for a long time. They\u2019re not unique, and that is why we have law enforcement,\u201d Kayyem said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know how to deal with it, they then ask for state resources, and if the state resources are overwhelmed, then the state generally turns to the federal government.\u201d\nIn nearby Compton, a vehicle was set on fire where protesters began to gather Saturday, video from CNN affiliate KABC showed. On Friday, video showed several projectiles being thrown at officers equipped with body armor and protective shields outside a Los Angeles federal detention center.\nElsewhere in Los Angeles County, a crowd of protesters in Paramount became \u201cincreasingly agitated, throwing objects and exhibiting violent behavior toward federal agents and deputy sheriffs,\u201d the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department said in an advisory Saturday night. In response, the department requested extra resources countywide and deployed additional deputies.\n\u201cLA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment\u2019s notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need,\u201d Newsom said in a post on X Saturday night.\n\u201cTrump is sending 2,000 National Guard troops into LA County \u2014 not to meet an unmet need, but to manufacture a crisis,\u201d Newsom said in another post Sunday.\nOfficials from the Trump administration described protesters as \u201clawless rioters.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department, meanwhile, said Saturday\u2019s demonstrations within the city \u201cremained peaceful\u201d and \u201cevents concluded without incident.\u201d\nWhen asked about the LA County Sheriff\u2019s Department describing protesters as exhibiting violent behavior, congresswoman Barrag\u00e1n said the violence was not coming from anti-immigration protesters.\n\u201c(The sheriff) told me the situation in Paramount was under control, the people that were peacefully (protesting) have left. The situation was now across the street into the Compton area, and (these were) the unruly folks \u2014 that Saturday night crowd. The people that were there to actually protest immigration were gone,\u201d Barrag\u00e1n said.\n\u201cWe agree that if you\u2019re being violent, you should be arrested, you should be prosecuted,\u201d she added.\nDeployment may increase risk of violence\nBecause Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard has occurred in defiance of the governor\u2019s request, Kayyem predicts there is a higher likelihood the move will incite conflict.\n\u201cOur federalized troops are trained to do something, and that something is the use of force. They are not trained to de-escalate a political situation, civil unrest,\u201d she said.\nUS Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the National Guard soldiers are in Los Angeles to maintain peace amid ongoing tensions between immigration enforcement authorities and demonstrators this weekend \u2013 but the rules of engagement remain unclear.\nAsked about the rules of engagement by reporters Sunday, Trump said simply, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nAlthough Noem said the soldiers are there to \u201cprovide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests,\u201d she did not provide specifics about their activities on the ground.\nKayyem said if the troops also lack clarity of mission, problems can arise.\n\u201cWithout a definitive mission statement and without rules of engagement \u2026 there will be mistakes, and those mistakes will not only potentially harm civilians, they will also potentially harm other law enforcement,\u201d Kayyem said.\n\u201cThis is dangerous for the troops \u2026 and it\u2019s dangerous for a population that, even if you view them as hostile, do not deserve to be put in harm\u2019s way because of that hostility.\u201d\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized if the unrest continues.\n\u201cWe need an administration that\u2019s not going to get to DEFCON 1 (the highest level of US military alerts) every time they see something on TV they don\u2019t like,\u201d Kayyem said. \u201cActive Marines? That\u2019s just unheard of in the kind of situation we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nIt\u2019s likely a show of power\nTrump\u2019s decision to deploy the National Guard against Newsom\u2019s wishes comes on the heel of escalating tensions between the two leaders, with the president consistently targeting Democratic-led California in his efforts to use funding as leverage to enact his agenda.\nThe administration is preparing to cancel a large swath of federal funding for California, according to multiple sources. Last month, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete\u2019s participation in a sporting event.\nThe administration also recently cut $126.4 million in flood prevention funding projects, and even before his inauguration Trump repeatedly went after the state\u2019s handling of devastating wildfires earlier this year. The president and Newsom have also publicly feuded for years.\n\u201cI see these actions as kind of intentionally inflammatory from the White House, because they want this escalation,\u201d CNN political analyst Astead Herndon said. \u201cThey want this fight with Gavin Newsom, and they want to be able to use the levers of federal power in that fight.\u201d\n\u201cIt shows a feature of this administration, which is to use the levers of federal power against its enemies as a means of exerting its own ideological prism,\u201d Herndon added.\nNewsom signed laws in February designating $50 million to help defend immigrants from the president\u2019s mass-deportation plans and to protect state policies from challenges by Trump\u2019s administration.\nSouthern California has historically been a beacon of support for immigrants, says Juan Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez, director of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition. He argues Trump is targeting Los Angeles \u201cto use it as an example that there can be no resistance\u201d to his aggressive deportation agenda.\n\u201cLos Angeles is the epicenter of resistance and the work of all of American society,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said, adding, \u201cWe are not illegals, we are not terrorists, we are workers.\u201d\nHuman rights advocacy organization Amnesty International criticized the \u201cdangerous\u201d deployment of National Guard troops, which the executive director says is \u201cto target and punish those who speak out in defense of human rights.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not about protecting communities,\u201d the organization\u2019s executive director, Paul O\u2019Brien, said in a statement. \u201cThis is about crushing dissent and instilling fear.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Brad Lendon, Karina Tsui, Antoinette Radford, Zoe Sottile and Danya Gainor contributed to this report."

      "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has signed an order authorizing roughly 2,000 of the National Guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C., to carry weapons, two U.S. officials told NBC News.\nIn recent weeks, hundreds of National Guard members fanned out across the nation\u2019s capital as part of what the White House has framed as an urgent crackdown on crime and lawlessness. The troops in Washington have been unarmed. They have mostly been sent out to assist local law enforcement officers in parts of Washington known for tourism, such as the National Mall.\nThe two U.S. officials said Hegseth\u2019s authorization will be approved by the U.S. Marshals Service, an agency of the Justice Department. Guard members who are supporting law enforcement functions will likely carry weapons, whereas troops who are assigned to beautification tasks across the district likely won\u2019t be armed, the officials told NBC News.\n\u201cAt the direction of the Secretary of Defense, JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our Nation\u2019s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,\u201d a U.S. defense official said, using the acronym for Washington\u2019s joint task force.\nThe task force confirmed on Friday that guard members will carry M17 pistols \u201cintended for personal protection.\u201d\n\"Guard members receive initial, regular, ongoing and refresher training, as well as complete annual weapons qualifications, prior to carrying weapons,\" the joint task force noted in a statement.\nThe deployment of National Guard members to Washington has drawn intense criticism from Democratic leaders, who say the move is a clear case of executive overreach. The National Guard is traditionally focused on domestic crises such as national disasters and civil unrest.\nMayor Muriel Bowser has pointed to Washington police data showing that violent crime has decreased 26% compared with last year. The Justice Department launched an investigation into whether the district\u2019s police department manipulated crime data to make crime rates seem lower.\nBowser\u2019s spokesman declined to comment on Hegseth\u2019s order.\nTrump greeted dozens of law enforcement personnel and National Guard troops in Washington on Thursday, thanking them for what he described as a strong start to his administration\u2019s anti-crime and beautification measures.\n\u201cI feel very safe now, and I\u2019m hearing people are very safe,\u201d Trump told the crowd while flanked by senior administration officials, later adding: \u201cYou people are winners, and I just think it\u2019s such an honor to be with you. We\u2019re going to make Washington, D.C., great again.\u201d\nTrump implied the troops would remain in Washington for at least six months.\n\u201cYou do the job on safety, and I\u2019ll get this place fixed up physically, and we\u2019re going to be so proud of it at the end of six months,\u201d the president said.\nHegseth, for his part, visited roughly 300 mobilized Guard members at the D.C. Armory on Thursday.\nSeventy-six people were arrested in Washington on Thursday night, a White House official said, bringing the total number of arrests since Trump\u2019s law enforcement initiative started to over 700.\nThirty-six of the people arrested overnight were undocumented immigrants, the official said.\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to protests around immigration raids.\nThe White House is simultaneously attempting to exert more control over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, one of the largest municipal police forces in the country. The president has long blasted what he presents as out-of-control crime in cities governed by Democratic mayors.\nHegseth\u2019s order authorizing federal troops to carry weapons had been expected. Two officials previously told NBC News that some troops would begin to bear firearms."

      "text": "- Trump will get his military parade, at a cost of up to $45 million. That comes as the administration cuts defense spending and called for major cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The parade will take place on June 14.\nAfter having to abandon plans for a military parade in his first administration because of cost, President Donald Trump will get one next month, but it won\u2019t be cheap.\nThe June 14 parade will come with a price tag that falls between $25 million and $45 million, according to reports from both the Washington Post and Reuters, quoting an Army spokesperson. That\u2019s less than the $92 million estimate officials came up with in 2018, but comes at a time when the Trump administration is making controversial cuts in the Department of Veterans Affairs and other areas of the military.\nThe parade will involve hundreds of Army vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and dozens of warplanes. Service members will sleep in government office buildings, including the Agriculture Department and General Services Administration, for days as part of the prep for the showcase.\nThe parade, officially, is meant to commemorate the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary. It also happens to fall on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday. Trump has wanted a military parade for most of the past decade, however, envisioning soldiers marching through Washington and tanks rolling down the city streets. The idea started in 2018, following his attendance of Bastille Day in Paris. He told aides on Air Force One on the trip home that he wanted to create a similar show of military force in the U.S.\nWashington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, at the time, wasn\u2019t afraid to challenge Trump, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that he had canceled the parade with a fierce tweet of her own, writing \u201cYup, I\u2019m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington DC, the local politician who finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities ($21.6M) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad).\u201d\nThere has been no formal pushback to this proposal. However, Bowser did say last month that she had concerns about the effect of tanks on the city\u2019s roads.\n\u201cIf military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Tensions between the Trump administration and California intensified this weekend as President Donald Trump decided to deploy 2,000 National Guard members to the Los Angeles area, a move the state\u2019s Democratic leaders cast as an unnecessary escalation amid protests over the administration\u2019s immigration policies.\nTrump campaigned on aggressive mass deportations, and there has been enormous pressure on his administration to boost those efforts as the first months of his second term have fallen far short of his stated goals. The aggressive enforcement push, in addition to long-simmering tensions between Trump and California, contributed to a fraught weekend in Los Angeles, where protests became violent at times.\nAs protests escalated Friday, Homeland Security Department officials began preparing to augment resources and personnel on the ground to provide force protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who were conducting a previously planned operation.\nIn calls that stretched into Friday evening, officials prepared for what one source described as a Portland-type incident, harking back to protests that erupted in that Oregon city in 2020, as protesters surrounded a federal building in Los Angeles. The Department of Homeland Security prepared to surge resources to Los Angeles, including armored vehicles and less-lethal munitions like gas and pepper balls, and to deploy hundreds more personnel from across the department, according to two sources familiar with the calls.\nDuring those discussions, officials considered whether they needed to cancel the operation, but eventually, the overall assessment among officials was that the ICE operation \u2014 focused on targeting businesses and migrants with criminal records \u2014 was ongoing and needed to proceed, according to sources with knowledge of the talks.\nThe decision: send more resources and agents to the area to provide protection for ICE agents and to guard one of the federal buildings where the protests had consolidated.\nOver the course of the day Saturday, DHS and White House officials were in near constant communication about the situation on the ground, as resources and personnel continued to arrive in the city.\nBy Saturday evening, when it was clear the administration couldn\u2019t keep adding federal authorities without pulling from elsewhere, the White House decided to pull the trigger and bring in the National Guard, according to one of the sources.\n\u201cAdministration officials were briefed on escalating attacks on law enforcement, such as rocks being thrown at their vehicles by rioters,\u201d a White House official said.\nThe official added, \u201cIt was abundantly clear federal law enforcement were not allowed to do their jobs and were being attacked.\u201d\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum authorizing the deployment of National Guard members on Saturday night, and his press secretary announced the decision as the president made his way to a UFC fight in Newark, New Jersey.\nThe overwhelming message from Trump, his top aides and congressional allies: The decision was made because Californian leaders were not doing their job.\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s feckless Democrat leaders have completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens. That is why President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in the statement announcing the deployment.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed back strongly, warning the deployment would only fan the flames.\n\u201cThat move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions. LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment\u2019s notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need,\u201d the Democratic governor wrote on social media.\nHe later said Trump was trying to \u201cmanufacture a crisis.\u201d\nDuring his first term, Trump mused on several occasions about deploying US troops on domestic soil, either to crush protests or tamp down on crime. Aides at the time talked Trump out of the move, which would amount to a dramatic step without recent precedent.\nNow, however, the president is less encumbered by aides who seek to restrain his more extreme impulses. And after a campaign during which Trump promised crackdowns on crime and illegal immigration, he appears eager to demonstrate a willingness to use maximalist actions to follow through on his pledges.\nOne senior law enforcement source involved in responding to the unrest said they saw the deployment of the National Guard as an overreaction that may backfire and only provoke additional agitators.\nThat source noted that potentially violent demonstrators observed by law enforcement around Los Angeles as of early Saturday evening numbered in the dozens and law enforcement officers were actively working to bring them under control.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the move Sunday as a matter of security.\nThe National Guard, she said during an appearance on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d is expected to \u201cuse their special skill set to keep peace.\u201d\n\u201cNational Guard soldiers are there to provide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests,\u201d Noem said.\nThe immigration crackdown in Los Angeles comes amid a renewed push by the White House to increase immigration arrests. Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide and architect of the administration\u2019s most hardline immigration policies, communicated that urgency in a meeting last month with senior ICE officials, pushing agents to significantly increase arrests.\nIn the weeks that followed, ICE has significantly ramped up its enforcement efforts. According to a senior DHS official, ICE\u2019s \u201cenhanced enforcement operations \u2026 have resulted in a significant increase in arrests, reaching a new daily record of 2,368\u201d arrests on June 4. The daily arrest average during Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office was approximately 1,000.\nThe deployment also comes as the Trump administration has threatened major cuts to federal spending in California. CNN reported Friday that the administration is preparing to cancel a large swath of federal funding for the state, according to multiple sources.\nAgencies are being told to start identifying grants the administration can withhold from California, and sources said the administration is specifically considering a full termination of federal grant funding for the University of California and California State University systems.\nTrump has repeatedly publicly lambasted Newsom, with whom he has long had a contentious relationship that only deteriorated amid the state\u2019s handling of devastating wildfires earlier this year. The two men spoke by phone for approximately 40 minutes on Friday, Newsom\u2019s office said in a statement.\nDuring that call, the White House official said, Trump \u201ctold Newsom to get the police in gear because it was getting out of control.\u201d\nIt is unclear how long the National Guard could be present, but the memorandum signed by Trump states that the guard\u2019s service will last 60 days at the discretion of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino made clear that the protests would not deter immigration enforcement efforts, saying in a post to social media, \u201cWe are not stopping or slowing down. We are not intimidated or apprehensive. Illegal immigration operations will continue and anyone using violence to obstruct and impede these operations will be investigated and prosecuted.\u201d\nHegseth, for his part, posted Saturday that active-duty Marines stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton were on \u201chigh alert\u201d to support the National Guard. Trump told reporters Sunday that he was not prepared at this time to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, which authorizes presidents to deploy US military domestically.\nAsked whether he was prepared to invoke the law, Trump told reporters in New Jersey it \u201cdepends whether or not there is an insurrection.\u201d\nPressed on whether he believed there was one happening in Los Angeles, he said, \u201cNo, but you have violent people and we\u2019re not going to let them get away with it.\u201d\nTrump was asked his definition of an insurrection, and said, \u201cYou really just have to look at the site and see what\u2019s happening. Last night in Los Angeles, we watched it very closely. There was a lot of violence there.\u201d\nStill, he kept the option open.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what we need. We\u2019ll send whatever we need to make sure there is law and order,\u201d Trump said as he prepared to depart for Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.\nJust over an hour later, he claimed on social media that \u201cviolent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking\u201d federal agents in Los Angeles to halt deportation efforts by his administration.\nTrump, for his part, is expected to huddle with Hegseth and other top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sunday evening at Camp David for what the White House says will become a regular off-campus retreat to address a number of issues and topics."

      "text": "The scale of last weekend\u2019s \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests is now becoming clearer, with one estimate suggesting that Saturday was among the biggest ever single-day protests in US history.\nWorking out exactly where the protest ranks compared with similar recent events has been a project of G Elliott Morris, a data journalist who runs the Substack Strength in Numbers, calculated turnout between 4 million and 6 million, which would be 1.2-1.8% of the US population. This could exceed the previous record in recent history, when between 3.3 million and 5.6 million people showed up at the 2017 Women\u2019s March to rally against Trump\u2019s misogynistic rhetoric.\nMorris estimated the No Kings Day protest turnout in two steps. First, his team gathered data at events for as many locations as possible, defaulting to tallies published in local newspapers. Where that wasn\u2019t available, they relied on estimates from organizers and attenders themselves.\nTo come up with a rough approximation of nationwide numbers, he then estimated the attendance in each unreported protest would be equal to the median of the attendance in places where data did exist. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough approximation, but at least an empirical one,\u201d Morris wrote in an email. \u201cWe use the median instead of the average to control for outliers, [such as the fact that] big cities pull the average up, but most events are not huge urban protests.\u201d\nMorris stressed that the Strength in Numbers tally remains unofficial, and he hopes that researchers will \u201cbuild\u201d on his data when they conduct more studies. But his estimation is similar to that made by Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, the progressive non-profit that organized the event. He estimated that 5 million people across the globe took to the streets.\nNot everyone is ready to call it the biggest protest ever. Jeremy Pressman of the Crowd Counting Consortium, a joint Harvard University/University of Connecticut project that estimates political crowds, told USA Today it would take \u201csome time\u201d to get an official tally.\nMeanwhile Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s director of communications, unsurprisingly called the protests \u201ca complete and utter failure with minuscule attendance\u201d on X. (No Kings took place on Donald Trump\u2019s birthday, which coincided with a parade the president threw in celebration of the US army\u2019s 250th anniversary.)\nOmar Wasow, an assistant professor in UC Berkeley\u2019s department of political science, told the Guardian that the demonstration was \u201cwithout question, among the largest single-day protests in history\u201d.\nWasow compared protest movements to standing ovations given at a theater. \u201cWe see a cascade effect: if one person stands after the curtain drops, then more follow,\u201d he said. \u201cIf 1.8% of the US adult population showed up to protest on Saturday, those are the people who stood up to clap first. It sends a signal to all these other people that you can stand up, too.\u201d\nThe 1963 March on Washington, where Dr Martin Luther King Jr made his famous \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech was at the time one of the largest protests in history, with up to a half a million people in attendance. It was dwarfed in size by the first Earth Day protests in 1970, in which 20 million people helped spark the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cAt the time this was about 10% of the US population, possibly the largest we will ever realistically see \u2013 unless the political environment deteriorates significantly, prompting more backlash,\u201d Morris said.\nIn 1986 at the Hands Across America fundraiser, an estimated 5 million Americans formed a human chain to raise money to fight hunger and homelessness (each person was asked to donate $10, though many participants didn\u2019t end up paying and the politics of the Coca-Cola-sponsored event were murky). More than a million people took to the streets in 2006 for a boycott called \u201cA Day Without Immigrants\u201d in protest of stricter immigration laws. Polls taken during the summer of 2020 found that between 15 and 26 million Americans protested against the murder of George Floyd during the month of June (though day-by-day numbers were smaller).\nGloria J Browne-Marshall, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of A Protest History of the United States, said that it was difficult to compare crowd sizes for various protests, especially ones that take place over the course of several days and span various locations. \u201cThere are different processes that have been used over the years, from eyeballing things to actually counting the number of people per square mile,\u201d she said.\nIn the days following No Kings, an idea put forth by the political scientists Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan called the 3.5% rule spurred social media discussion. Chenoweth, a Harvard professor and Stephan, a political scientist who covers nonviolent movements, studied 323 revolutionary campaigns around the world that took place from 1900 to 2006. They found that all nonviolent movements that had the support of at least 3.5% of a population always succeeded in triggering change. No Kings, with its massive turnout, could be seen as a turning point.\nThere are caveats to this rule, which was published in the team\u2019s 2011 book Why Civil Resistance Works. \u201cThe 3.5% rule is descriptive, not prescriptive \u2013 and has been revised significantly since being originally published to allow for exceptions,\u201d Morris wrote. \u201cChenoweth now is clear that hitting 3.5% does not guarantee success, especially in political regimes where change is harder, and that movements can accomplish their goals with much smaller mobilization, through things like media coverage and alliances with elites.\u201d\nOrganizers and attenders of No Kings feel invigorated enough to continue the demonstrations, with another round of coordinated protests to fall on 17 July, the fifth anniversary of the death of John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader.\nBut they admit there are limits to these events. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win if a lot of people show up at a protest one day,\u201d Levin said. \u201cWe need people actually taking democracy seriously, and that\u2019s not going to be done through a top-down action. It has to be done from the bottom-up. When pro-democracy movements succeed, it\u2019s because of a broad-based, ideological, diverse, geographically-dispersed, grassroots organizing \u2013 not just mobilizing.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that President Trump is using false crime statistics to justify militarizing U.S. cities, deploying National Guard and federal troops to places like Washington D.C., Los Angeles, and potentially Chicago, despite data showing crime rates are falling. Critics, including governors, mayors, and law\u2011enforcement experts, contend that these deployments are unnecessary, undermine civil liberties, and divert resources from real policing needs. The piece highlights legal limits on federal control of local police, the backlash from local officials, and the broader context of Trump\u2019s controversial use of executive power to suppress dissent and pursue immigration enforcement. Overall, the article portrays the military presence as a dangerous distraction that erodes public safety rather than enhancing it.",
