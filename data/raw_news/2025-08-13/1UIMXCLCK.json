  "description": "University of St Andrews",
  "content": "St Andrews, our Scottish University of the Year, is a plum university prize and there are close to ten applications for every place, making it one of the hardest universities to get into in the UK. More than a quarter of the undergraduates come from abroad - it's popular among Americans, in particular. Perched on the Fife coast, the university dominates the town, offering an alternative to Oxford and Cambridge for the brightest applicants. Traditions abound - notably the Raisin Monday foam fight - and the students' distinctive red gowns are a familiar sight on formal occasions. Academic excellence is also abundant, and it has one of the strongest performances of any university in our exclusive subject tables. And from September, a medical degree is back after an absence of more than 50 years. Until now, students could do three years of such a degree at St Andrews before spending their clinical practice years at a partner university. From next month, a full five-year medical degree will be offered onsite, run in partnership with NHS Fife. St Andrews' repeated success in the annual National Student Survey is proof that academically demanding, multi-faculty, larger institutions can do well. That ringing endorsement from its students and their onward success in the graduate jobs market underpins St Andrews' consistently excellent showing in our ranking.\n\nFor a university with fewer than 10,000 undergraduates, a \u00a32.8m annual spend on bursaries and scholarships for Scottish and RUK (rest of UK) undergraduates is a significant investment. At the heart of the university's financial support is the St Andrews access award which offers up to \u00a34,855 for each of four years of study. For care leavers, this comprises \u00a32,900 as a cash bursary, \u00a31,750 in accommodation discounts and a \u00a3205 sports membership. Students from homes with annual income of up to \u00a320,999 get \u00a32,000 in cash, a \u00a31,750 accommodation discount and the \u00a3205 sports membership, dropping to \u00a31,750 in cash and the same in accommodation discount, plus a 50% reduction on the sports membership for those from homes with an income of \u00a321,000 to \u00a323,999. Students from homes with an income of \u00a324,000 to \u00a333,999 receive \u00a31,500 in cash, are eligible for (but not guaranteed) a \u00a31,750 accommodation discount, and a 25% reduction on the sports membership. Payments can be made (but are not guaranteed) to students from homes with more than \u00a334,000 annual income, if they meet eligibility criteria and funding is available. Among the categories of widening participation from which scholarship applications are particularly welcome are having a home address in a postcode considered to be among the 40% most deprived in Scotland, being a carer or care experienced, being estranged from parents or being an asylum seeker or refugee. A significant number of other awards are available, and a discretionary fund is there for students who encounter severe financial difficulties. Students can also borrow from the university if they are experiencing temporary cash-flow issues. St Andrews claims to have more university-managed accommodation per head of student population than any university bar Oxford and Cambridge colleges with 4,400 rooms to go round. Self-catered rates range from \u00a35,953 for a 34-week tenancy up to \u00a39,197 for 38 weeks in ensuite accommodation. Catered rooms are priced from \u00a39,199 to \u00a312,363, both for 38 week-contracts.\n\nThe return of a full undergraduate medical degree to St Andrews is a significant moment. It was one of the courses first offered by the university when it was founded in 1413 but has not been available for over 50 years. The first medics for the new five-year course begin their studies in September and will undertake their clinical training in local hospitals and healthcare settings run by NHS Fife. The course is designed to address local needs with a focus on community healthcare. St Andrews is also expanding the number of joint honours degree options, allowing students to combine subjects such as Arabic, comparative literature and management to create bespoke pathways that suit their academic and career goals. The university's making waves campaign was launched in September 2024, a \u00a3300m initiative to develop infrastructure, research capabilities and student support systems (the latter already among the best there are). Taking centre ground in infrastructure developments is the creation of a home for the new St Andrews business school in the former Madras College school site in the centre of the town. The \u00a3140m redevelopment, named New College, will also be home to the university's school of international relations and is due for completion in 2027.\n\nAmid fierce competition for places, the university has introduced measures to open up pathways to the university for those who have not had the privileges that make high grades so much easier to achieve. For applicants holding higher grades, a minimum ask of AABB is made if they qualify for a contextual offer, or BBBB if they gain a place via a gateway or supported widening access pathway. For those with A-level or international baccalaureate grades, contextual offers are lowered respectively to ABB and 36 points with 6, 5, 5 at higher level. St Andrews guarantees an offer to all care leavers and those who live in a Scottish postcode among the 20% most deprived and attend a school with 30% of lower progression to higher education, so long as they are expected to meet the minimum offer grades, 'the desire to study the subject is demonstrable', and they pass any additional tests or interviews, if applicable. Contextual data is used for applicants from the rest of the UK to determine if their offer should be pitched at standard, minimum or gateway level. The university has developed a whole community approach to well-being through its student mental health agreement, created with the students' association. Well-being champions are based in each academic school, and academic and professional services staff, together with halls of residence and students' association teams, are equipped to deal with and refer students with issues. Treatment options, where needed, span counselling, coaching, cognitive behavioural therapy and group therapy. All new students are required to complete four modules of peer education and training - Got Consent?, Got Limits?, Got Support? and Got Solidarity? - which cover sexual consent and gender-based violence as well as racial, social and sexual tolerance.",
