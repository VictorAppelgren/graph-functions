  "content": "An elite Sydney restaurant has made the shock announcement that it will be closing its doors within a matter of weeks.\n\nMonopole, a French-inspired bistro in the heart of the Sydney CBD will soon close its doors after 13 years in operation.\n\nDespite currently holding two-hats at the 2025 Australian Good Food Awards, the owners have made the unexpected decision to shutter it.\n\nThe announcement was made by the restaurant's parent company, The Bentley Group, which is owned by leading Australian hospitality operators, Nick Hildebrandt and Brent Savage.\n\nThe sudden upcoming closure is due to the ending of its lease.\n\n'Nick and Brent... announce the closure of two-hatted Monopole at the end of the restaurant's current lease,' they confirmed.\n\n'Monopole's last service will be dinner on Saturday 6 September, and will trade for dinners Tuesday to Saturday and lunch on Friday until then.'\n\nThe owners also provided a joint statement, confirming that they were 'extremely proud' of what they'd achieved at Monopole, both in the original Potts Point location and the CBD.\n\n'Monopole was a ground-breaking wine bar when we opened it and has always pushed the envelope, holding two hats for 10 years and winning multiple awards for its wine list,' Nick and Brent said.\n\nBut in perhaps a flicker of hope for die-hard Monopole fans, the restaurant owners hinted that it might not necessarily be the end of the road.\n\n'[W]hile we're sad that the lease has finished, we will never say never for a Monopole in the future,' they concluded their statement.\n\nAlthough one restaurant is closing, the announcement also confirmed that the business owners already have their next exciting restaurant in the works.\n\nThe Bentley Group will soon be opening a new venue called Watermans, which will be located at Barangaroo inside the recently completed One Sydney Harbour Lendlease development.\n\nThe new venture will be an Eastern Mediterranean restaurant with respected chef Darryl Martin - formerly of Barzaari - as executive chef.\n\nCo-owner Nick confirmed that Watermans would be opening towards the end of the year, 'right in time for summer'.\n\nThe upcoming 120-seat establishment will feature both indoor and outdoor dining areas and will be open seven days a week for both lunch and dinner.\n\nCo-owner and chef Brent also offered a tantalising taste of what's in store on the new restaurant's menu.\n\nBrent hinted that Watermans' menu was 'inspired by the cuisine of The Levant [Mediterranean region] and highlights the best of Australian produce'.\n\nDishes set to feature on the opening menu include: warm hummus with green zhoug; labneh with salted cucumber and lemon jam; pickled watermelon and raw tuna salad with sumac; sweet and sour Abrolhos scallop with sesame praline; whole roasted John Dory with chermoula; and pomegranate glazed slow cooked lamb shoulder with pickled radishes and black lime.",

  "argos_summary": "Monopole, a Sydney French\u2011inspired bistro that has earned two hats, will close after its lease ends, with the final dinner on 6 September. The Bentley Group, owners Nick Hildebrandt and Brent Savage, said they are proud of the restaurant\u2019s achievements but may reopen under a new name. They announced a new venture, Watermans, an Eastern Mediterranean restaurant at Barangaroo, set to open later this year with chef Darryl Martin. Watermans will feature a 120\u2011seat dining area and a menu highlighting Australian produce and Levant flavours. The closure marks the end of a 13\u2011year run for Monopole but leaves open the possibility of a future Monopole iteration.",
