  "description": "Consumers recognize marketing when they see it, and they\u2019re quick to disengage if it feels inauthentic or irrelevant.",
  "content": "Teja Chekuri is the Founder of Fullstack Ventures.\n\nToday\u2019s consumers are no longer passive recipients\u2014they\u2019re active participants in their brand journey. Armed with real-time data, intuitive tools, DIY ecosystems and communities that offer alternate perspectives, they\u2019re making informed choices and expecting brands to meet them where they are.\n\nThis shift has fundamentally changed the power dynamic. Consumers know that their attention, and their loyalty, are valuable. They recognize marketing when they see it, and they\u2019re quick to disengage if it feels inauthentic or irrelevant. Traditional models of persuasion designed to push, nudge, or steer don't hold as much sway in a world where the consumer is often one step ahead.\n\nSo what does this mean for marketers?\n\nIt means the playbook must evolve. It\u2019s time to treat consumers as informed, empowered, and self-aware individuals. To engage and build trust, marketers must listen before they speak and create strategies that respect the consumer\u2019s intelligence, agency, and choice.\n\nAI-driven recommendations aren\u2019t guesswork, they\u2019re psychological matchmaking. Systems mine your clickstream, reviews, even social chatter to anticipate preferences. That means brands can no longer pitch en masse\u2014they must personalize at scale, tailoring every touchpoint like a bespoke suit.\n\nDeloitte reports \"75 % of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that deliver personalized content.\" The takeaway you should consider is that templated campaigns are now tiny fish in a data ocean. Now it's personalized storytelling.\n\nTrust Is The New ROI\n\nWhile most consumers say they wouldn't let AI auto\u2011buy, even with better deals, a good portion is now appreciating AI-powered recommendations. Consumers fear misuse. AI\u2019s \u201cinformation advantage\u201d can feel manipulative. So transparency isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s essential. Brands must show the wiring: \u201cHere\u2019s what data we collect, here\u2019s why it helps.\u201d\n\nHumans inherently trust humans more even when machines outperform. In marketing, AI-led suggestions still lag behind human-curated picks in perceived authenticity. The antidote is to blend machine speed with human warmth. Let AI do the heavy lifting but let humans add the heart.\n\nForget SEO and welcome GEO: Generative Engine Optimization. This new frontier optimizes content not just for human eyes, but AI-powered platforms. Brands should design metadata and structured content so AI assistants pull your product solutions\u2014not a competitor\u2019s.\n\u2022 Personalize like you mean it. Deploy AI across channels\u2014emails, chatbots, ads\u2014but guard trust by being transparent about data use.\n\u2022 Humanize the machine. Combine AI recommendations with human touches. Celebrate your team, share brand values or add a witty signature to the AI-generated email. Don\u2019t be a robot.\n\u2022 Optimize for AI, not just Google. Invest in GEO. Get your content structured so generative engines discover, cite and champion it in their answers.\n\nIn the new AI-led era, consumers expect brands to know them better, not scare them. Master that, and you\u2019re not just marketing but micro-targeting hearts and building lasting loyalty.\n\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.",

      "text": "How AI Could Potentially Manipulate Consumers\nHow AI Could Potentially Manipulate Consumers\nProfessor Ali Makhdoumi says companies may be able to exploit a growing information advantage over consumers\nThe rise of artificial intelligence is enhancing online platforms\u2019 ability to predict customer preferences. The results may benefit users, who may find value in personalized advertising and targeted product recommendations.\nBut according to Professor Ali Makhdoumi of Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, the new AI tools are also making companies better at understanding customers\u2019 vulnerabilities, which may enable them to manipulate user behavior in ways beneficial for the company but not for customers.\n\u201cPlatforms have an information advantage,\u201d Makhdoumi said in a talk on Fuqua\u2019s LinkedIn page. \u201cThe question is whether this is good or bad for consumers.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s information advantage\nMakhdoumi said that AI-powered platforms have more information about consumer preferences than what consumers have about themselves.\nConsumers learn about products as they use them, he said, but it takes time for them to understand whether the attractiveness of the product has anything to do with the real quality of it.\nHe explained platforms collect data about what draws consumers to the products, regardless of any consideration about the inherent quality\u2014which enables a greater understanding of the product\u2019s \u201cglossiness,\u201d or its attractiveness to the consumer.\n\u201cWe know for example about the mechanisms behind impulse buying,\u201d Makhdoumi said. \u201cPlatforms can predict these forces and they may use them for gain.\u201d\nA model of behavioral manipulation\nIn a working paper shared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Makhdoumi and co-authors Daron Acemoglu and Asu Ozdaglar of MIT, and Azarakhsh Malekian of University of Toronto, built a model to predict the conditions under which platforms may find it profitable to manipulate consumers\u2019 behavior by using techniques to increase \u2018glossiness,\u2019 such as enhanced packaging, hidden costs, and exaggerated benefits.\nThe researchers found that it is optimal for companies to manipulate consumer perception\u2014and drive them to low-quality products\u2014when the \u201cglossiness effect\u201d is persistent, but not when customers can learn quickly about the products\u2019 quality.\n\u201cIf the platform can fool consumers for a long time, it will engage in behavioral manipulation,\u201d Makhdoumi said.\nThis means companies may use the information imbalance to guide consumers to products that would only advantage the company and may even be \u201charmful\u201d for the customers, he said, mentioning possibilities involving surveillance and price discrimination.\nPotential regulation\nThe constant improvements of large language models and machine learning capabilities will likely offer even more opportunities for behavioral manipulation, Makhdoumi said.\nCompanies will be able to collect more and more information about consumers\u2019 tendencies towards multiple products at a time, compounding the information imbalance even further, he said.\n\u201cIt's sort of a double whammy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the consumer eventually learns about the low quality of a product, then the platform will switch to another product.\u201d\nHe said it is not clear whether companies\u2019 competition for user data will have any impact in moderating this practice. Competition could actually make the problem worse, he said, since once the user joins different platforms, each platform will be able to exploit the same amount of data.\nPublic policy may play a role, Makhdoumi said, but any regulation will need to strike a delicate balance.\n\u201cPreventing the harvesting of user information is not easy and may not always be desirable,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause AI-powered data collection may also have benefits for consumers.\u201d\nThe other potential aspect for regulation could be to limit the way platforms can offer tailor recommendations, Makhdoumi said.\n\u201cYou put a limit on personalized recommendations, so that the platform can\u2019t take the process to the extreme. This may also help reduce behavioral manipulation.\u201d\nThis story may not be republished without permission from Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business.
