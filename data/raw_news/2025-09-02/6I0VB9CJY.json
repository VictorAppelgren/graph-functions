  "content": "It is usually uneventful when a single insider buys stock. However, When quite a few insiders buy shares, as it happened in Diversified Energy Company PLC's (LON:DEC) case, it's fantastic news for shareholders.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nDiversified Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Senior Independent Director David Turner bought UK\u00a3152k worth of shares at a price of UK\u00a310.15 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (UK\u00a311.96), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.\n\nIn the last twelve months Diversified Energy insiders were buying shares, but not selling. They paid about UK\u00a39.04 on average. We don't deny that it is nice to see insiders buying stock in the company. However, we do note that they were buying at significantly lower prices than today's share price. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Diversified Energy insiders own about UK\u00a321m worth of shares. That equates to 2.2% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Diversified Energy Insiders?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Diversified Energy shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders do have a stake in Diversified Energy and their transactions don't cause us concern. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Diversified Energy (2 make us uncomfortable) you should be aware of.",

  "argos_summary": "Diversified Energy Company PLC (LON:DEC) saw a wave of insider purchases totaling about \u00a3485k, with insiders buying at lower prices than the current share price and no recent sales, indicating a modest confidence in the stock. The insiders collectively own roughly 2.2% of the company, a level that suggests alignment but not dominance. While the buying activity is a positive signal, it does not provide a definitive view on DEC\u2019s valuation or future performance.",
