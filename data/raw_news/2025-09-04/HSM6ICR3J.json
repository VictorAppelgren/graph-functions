  "description": "The property, which includes a bowling alley and shooting range, is set to break a sales record for the state of Indiana.",
  "content": "The main house, which is 13,956 square feet with eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms, sits on a 5.6-acre lot about 115 miles north of Indianapolis and, if it sells, will break a state record, according to Encore Sothebys International Realty. The property also has an indoor pool house for year-round swimming with retractable lake-facing doors, a hot tub, heated paver pool deck, fireplace lounge area, live plant wall, steam room, and fitness areas. A third structure, a guest house, has three bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, and there is an eight-car garage on the property. The estate also boasts what the listing describes as an \u201centertainment complex\u201d decked out with a professional-grade four-lane bowling alley, arcade, shooting range and club-style bar, connected to the main residence area via an underground tunnel. The waterfront estate sits on Lake Maxinkuckee and has a 4,000-square-foot dock\u2014the largest private dock on the lake, with spaces for parking several boats and other water vehicles.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

That's the current sales record in Indiana, which was set by a 41,762-square-foot mansion on 168 acres that included a 35-acre lake. The seven-bedroom, 17 bathroom house was reportedly inspired by the Villa la Rotonda in Italy and Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello. It belonged to late businesswoman Christel DeHaan.\n\nJames (Jim) Irsay died in May at age 65 and with an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion. His father, Robert Irsay, bought the Indianapolis Colts football team in 1972 and Jim grew up living with the team during summer camp and traveling on the team bus. He worked in everything from ticket sales to public relations before being named general manager in 1984, at 24, and inheriting the team as 100% owner in 1997. The Colts\u2019 record improved dramatically under Jim Irsay, resulting in a 2007 Super Bowl victory and 10 division titles during his tenure.\n\nThe Colts are ranked as No. 26 on Forbes' list of the most valuable NFL teams in 2025, with $593 million in revenue, up 23% from the year before. The team is now owned by Irsay's three daughters: Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson.",

      "text": "Football\u2019s 32 clubs are worth $7.1 billion on average, a 25% year-over-year jump, but the Dallas Cowboys sit tall in the saddle with a record valuation for any sports franchise.\nLast August, the Dallas Cowboys became the first pro sports team ever worth $10 billion. But a handful of stake sales around the NFL over the past 12 months\u2014as well as the $6.1 billion sale of the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics and the $10 billion deal for the Los Angeles Lakers\u2014have shown that investors are more desperate than ever to join the sports franchise dogpile, and the Cowboys have now galloped right past the $11 billion and $12 billion thresholds on the way to their latest financial first down.\nFor the 19th straight year, Dallas is the NFL\u2019s most valuable team, worth $13 billion, according to Forbes estimates\u2014up 29% from 2024 and double its valuation from just four years ago. And the Cowboys have new company in the $10 billion club, with the Los Angeles Rams now worth $10.5 billion and the New York Giants close behind at $10.1 billion.\nAll 32 NFL teams are worth at least $5 billion for the first time, with the Cincinnati Bengals setting the floor at $5.25 billion\u2014a figure that surpasses all 32 NHL clubs in Forbes\u2019 ranking last year and all but seven franchises across the most recent NBA and MLB valuation lists. The average team value in the NFL now sits at $7.1 billion, a 25% increase over 2024 and a 104% jump from 2021, and league-wide revenue climbed to an estimated $21.2 billion during the 2024 season, rising 74% over the same four-year period.\nThe Cowboys, however, are in a league of their own with estimated 2024 revenue of $1.2 billion, leading every other NFL team by at least $400 million. In fact, remove the roughly $440 million that every club received from the league office\u2014from national media, sponsorship and merchandise, as well as a pooled portion of league-wide ticket revenue\u2014and Dallas still collected nearly $800 million in purely local revenue, more than the total revenue of every other team except the Las Vegas Raiders.\nEven more astonishing, the Cowboys posted operating income of $629 million last season, according to Forbes estimates, meaning Dallas made more in profit than 16 teams logged in revenue.\nThat money-making machine, coupled with the franchise\u2019s massive fan base and enduring legacy, has led some bankers to conclude that, while $13 billion seems like a fair price for the Cowboys given pro football\u2019s current economics, longtime owner Jerry Jones might draw even higher bids if he ever decided to put the team on the market.\nIt\u2019s not just Dallas that has an astronomical price tag, either. Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross sold a 13% stake in his holding company (which also includes Hard Rock Stadium and Formula 1\u2019s Miami Grand Prix) at an $8.1 billion valuation in December, the same month that the Buffalo Bills fetched $5.8 billion in a deal for 20.6% of the team and the Philadelphia Eagles sold off 8% at an $8.3 billion valuation. Meanwhile, a 6.2% slice of the San Francisco 49ers sold for $8.6 billion in May, and the Chicago Bears reached an agreement this month to sell a roughly 2% stake at an $8.8 billion valuation.\nDespite that run of activity\u2014which also included deals at undisclosed valuations for 8% of the Los Angeles Chargers and 15% of the Las Vegas Raiders\u2014the NFL has not seen a control sale since a group led by private equity billionaire Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders for $6.05 billion in July 2023. That lag is important because the extent to which the implied valuation in a minority sale reflects the true price of a sports team can be a bit murky. (Traditionally, limited partners have gotten a discount\u2014often 20% to 25%\u2014because they typically have no say in the operations of the team. In recent years, however, tiny slivers of teams have sometimes been sold at a significant premium because the relatively small buy-in has expanded the pool of bidders.)\nStill, bankers believe that most of the recent deals are at least in range of a control valuation\u2014even in cases where Forbes\u2019 valuations from just a few months prior look relatively paltry, such as the Eagles (valued at $6.6 billion in August 2024) and the 49ers ($6.8 billion). Notably, after the NFL adjusted its rules last August to allow private equity firms to join its ownership ranks, Ares Management was among the investors in the Dolphins deal, and Arctos Partners bought pieces of the Bills and the Chargers. As a rule, institutional investors are not known for letting ego or emotion inflate the prices they are willing to pay.\nThe lure of NFL ownership starts with the league\u2019s national media deals, which took effect in 2022 and 2023 and locked in $125.5 billion in revenue over the next decade. But many around the sport expect that number to end up considerably higher because the league can opt out of most of its agreements in 2029 and secure even better rates, capitalizing on the success the NBA had negotiating an 11-year, $76 billion package with Amazon, ESPN and NBC last year. The NFL also moved this month to acquire a 10% stake in ESPN in exchange for the NFL Network and other media assets, including the TV rights to the RedZone channel.\nMeanwhile, the NFL continues to increase its marketing revenue, approaching $2.5 billion in team sponsorships last season in a 6% rise from the previous year, according to research firm SponsorUnited. And football has plenty of room to grow internationally, where the NFL\u2019s broadcast rights are negligible and teams have only recently started to devote real resources as part of the league\u2019s global markets program.\nOne other clear perk of NFL ownership is that it has become nearly impossible to lose money in the league, with the 32 teams averaging $127 million in operating income last season and no team falling below $21 million, according to Forbes estimates. That kind of profitability isn\u2019t guaranteed in other sports, such as MLB, where Forbes estimates that 11 teams were in the red last season.\nThe result of all of those tailwinds is that Forbes now pegs the average revenue multiple in the NFL at 10.7x, spiking from 9x in 2024 and 6.4x five years ago. And as the league scans the field for its next big score, it may already be in the red zone: The Giants are searching for a buyer for around 10% of the franchise.\nThe Most Valuable NFL Teams 2025\n#1. $13 billion\nDallas Cowboys\nOne-Year Change: 29% | Revenue: $1.234 billion | Operating Income: $629 million | Owner: Jerry Jones\n#2. $10.5 billion\nLos Angeles Rams\nOne-Year Change: 38% | Revenue: $764 million | Operating Income: $244 million | Owner: E.

Debt includes both team and stadium debt recourse to team owners. Forbes presents its P&L figures on a cash basis, rather than an accrual basis, of accounting.\nTeam values are enterprise values (equity plus net debt) and include the economics of the team\u2019s stadium (including non-NFL revenue that accrues to the team\u2019s owner) but not the value of the stadium real estate itself. Team values also exclude other businesses related to the team with separate financial statements, such as The Star, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 headquarters and entertainment district. Team values are rounded to the nearest $50 million, and estimated operating income is rounded to the nearest $1 million.\nSources for Forbes\u2019 NFL valuations include team executives, sports bankers and league consultants; public documents, such as stadium lease agreements and credit rating reports; and sponsorship and broadcasting industry executives."

It was listed for $68 million in June 2024 before that listing was removed in March.

The original grounds included the Greystone Mansion, now a U.S. historical site.

      "text": "Topline\nA 151-acre estate in the Hudson Valley has hit the market for the first time in more than 30 years in the exclusive Tuxedo Park village of New York, which has housed billionaires, socialites and business tycoons since the late 1800s.\nKey Facts\nThe home, named \"Renamor,\" has hit the market one year after the death of its longtime owner Robert Dow, senior managing partner at a private investment firm and 1972 Olympic fencer, and his wife, Christina Seix Dow, a former asset manager.\nThe Gilded Age estate, listed by Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, is the largest in the historic and exclusive Hudson River town of Tuxedo Park, New York.\nThe main house on the 1920s estate is 14,000 square feet and includes a large kitchen, banquet-size dining room, library, former chapel, smoking \u201cfumoir\u201d or fume room, wine cellar, 16 bedrooms, 20 bathrooms and 19 fireplaces.\nScattered around the expansive property are eight other buildings: a 3,700-square-foot guest house, 4,700-square-foot carriage house, boathouse on Tuxedo Lake, secluded log cabin, tea house, pool/spa house and five-car garage.\nThe property also has two pools, a tennis court and a $1 million geothermal heating system and concealed solar field, which allows the estate to fulfill its own energy needs.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

The house was built for original owners George Amory, a major stockholder in container shipping business Sea-Land Freight Company, and his wife Marion Renee, who inspired the Renamor name. It was bought in the early 1950s and housed the now-closed Academy of Mount St. Vincent, according to New York Heritage, before it was returned to private ownership.\nTangent\nThe Tuxedo Park village, about 40 miles northwest of New York City, is gated and houses a social club synonymous with high society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The area can historically count names like Colgate/Palmolive heir Adele Colgate, actress Millicent Rogers (granddaughter of Standard Oil tycoon Henry Rogers), banker J.P. Morgan and politician William Waldorf Astor among its residents. It was founded as a hunting-and-fishing reserve in 1886 by tobacco heir Pierre Lorillard IV (his company made cigarettes under the brand names Newport, Maverick and others until it was purchased by Reynolds American in 2015) along Tuxedo Lake.

The main house has eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, 11 fireplaces and three kitchens, and was featured as Sharon Stone\u2019s house in the 1992 film \"Basic Instinct\" and was the settling for the couples therapy scene between Madeline and Ed MacKenzie in Season 2 of the HBO Series \"Big Little Lies.\u201d\nDubbed \"The Lodge,\" the home also has an art deco library, chef's kitchen with wine refrigerators for 500 bottles, a four-car garage, commercial fitness center and spa with an indoor dry sauna, steam room, pool, three hot tubs, outdoor dry-sauna and cold plunge.\nThere are four smaller cottages on the property that boast six oversized fireplaces made with one-of-a-kind sculptural stones brought to California from Montana over the course of three years, and a newer one-bedroom residence.\nThe compound totals 5.35 acres with cliffside views of the Pacific Ocean and the property also includes two stand-alone garages, an 8-foot-tall stone privacy wall, a Japanese Zen garden, a manicured garden with waterscapes and Koi pond, a mature Cypress forest, a greenhouse and three stairwells accessing the coastline below.\nWho is selling Seacliff?\nThe home is being sold by software entrepreneur Gary Vickers, who founded and later sold P2 Energy Solutions, and his wife, Kerry Vickers. The couple purchased the main house from the estate of Steve Fossett, a financier and aviator who was the first person to fly around the world alone in a balloon. The Vickers went on to expand the property by buying neighboring lots and built the compound's cottages for family use. Gary Vickers has said he is selling the property to downsize and travel with family, but that \"my crowning achievement will always be the uncompromising realization of Seacliff.\" The compound was listed for $52 million in 2019 but did not sell, and the Vickers subsequently remodeled the main house, built a new one-bedroom residence and made landscaping improvements, according to Coldwell Banker Real Estate.\nCould Break Sales Recored Set By Brad Pitt\nIf it sells for its asking price, Seacliff will break a sales record for the Carmel, California area, according to Coldwell, once held by actor Brad Pitt.
