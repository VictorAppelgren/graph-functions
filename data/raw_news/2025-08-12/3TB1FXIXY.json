  "description": "A portable mini projector doesn\u2019t perform as well as a good TV or home-theater projector, but the Nebula Mars 3 Air ably blends performance and convenience.",
  "content": "The Nebula Mars 3 Air is our favorite portable mini projector because it has all of the essential features we like to see in this category, and it delivers good picture and sound quality for a competitive price.\n\nThis projector measured well on our test bench. In the Movie picture mode, the Mars 3 Air served up a nice-looking image with good detail, rich color, and better contrast in comparison with what we saw on most competitors. The only projector to best it in image contrast was the pricier but dimmer Nebula Capsule 3 Laser.\n\nThe overall color balance is fairly neutral \u2014 not as accurate as what you can get from a good home theater projector, but the image doesn\u2019t skew too blue, red, or green. The colors themselves are vibrant but a bit off the mark from the HDTV standard, which is true of most portable mini projectors we test \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen far worse color performance from pricier projectors. Some advanced picture adjustments are available in the Custom picture mode, but they don\u2019t do much to improve upon what you get from the preset Movie mode.\n\nThe Mars 3 Air isn\u2019t the brightest portable projector we\u2019ve measured overall, but it strikes a better balance between brightness and black level than many competitors, so you can enjoy brighter HDTV shows and sports in a room with some ambient light and then enjoy a well-saturated movie in a dark room. It also does a better job than many portables of preserving the fine details in dark movie scenes.\n\nWhereas some portable projectors give you only a couple of brightness options to choose from, the Mars 3 Air has preset standard and eco modes plus an adjustable slider for you to fine-tune the brightness to your viewing situation. This projector also supports HDR video in the HDR10 format. Even at maximum brightness, it isn\u2019t bright enough to show off what HDR can offer, but at least it handles HDR video correctly, unlike our budget pick, which makes everything too dark.\n\nThe Mars 3 Air has a 1080p resolution, which allows for a sharp, well-detailed image at modest screen sizes. At a distance of about 5 feet, we could see the detail improvement that this projector offered over 720p projectors, especially in text clarity. The pixel structure (that is, the grid of tiny little squares or the screen-door effect) was still somewhat visible in patches of white or solid color, but we really noticed it only when we were actively trying to see it.\n\nIt has a built-in battery. We tested the battery life by running the internal YouTube TV app at low volume. We got 3.5 hours of run time at 20% brightness, 2.33 hours at 55% brightness, and 1.5 hours at 100% brightness. Those are excellent results.\n\nIt automatically focuses and shapes the image. The projector\u2019s Intelligent Environment Adaptation technology uses a combination of automatic focus, keystone correction, obstacle avoidance, and screen fitting to quickly shape a level, rectangular image on whatever wall surface you\u2019re using. We don\u2019t love the use of keystone correction in higher-end projectors because it reduces image detail and adds artifacts, but it makes sense here, where you\u2019re probably using the portable projector in a variety of less-than-formal settings.\n\nIn previous Nebula projectors we\u2019ve tested, the auto adjustments didn\u2019t work great, but in newer models they\u2019ve gotten quicker and more accurate. You can also turn them off, if you\u2019d prefer to handle the task manually.\n\nThis smart projector runs Google TV. Many other smart projectors run either the older Android TV platform or a proprietary smart-TV system. Google TV supports all the major streaming services and offers the superior search and content recommendations that make it our favorite media streaming system. In addition, this projector has native support for Netflix (many others don\u2019t).\n\nThe Mars 3 Air comes with a Bluetooth-based, backlit remote that has the core buttons you need and supports voice search through Google Assistant.\n\nThanks to the unit\u2019s Chromecast support, you can wirelessly transmit audio and video from your mobile device. If you want to connect a Blu-ray player, gaming console, or standalone media streaming device, the projector also has one HDMI input, plus a powered USB-A port.\n\nThe built-in speakers perform well. The audio system uses dual 8-watt speakers to produce better dynamics and a more balanced sound than what you hear from a lot of competitors. In our tests, dialogue had a less beaming, \u201ccupped hands\u201d quality on this model.\n\nThanks to its decent audio quality, the Mars 3 Air can work okay as a Bluetooth speaker, though it can\u2019t produce as much bass as even a modestly priced portable Bluetooth speaker can. You can also send the internal audio out to Bluetooth speakers and headphones. We had no trouble connecting the projector to a UE Wonderboom Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe projector measures 7 by 4.8 by 5.2 inches and weighs 3.7 pounds. It has an integrated carrying handle, and an optional case is available.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work with all tripods and mounts. The combination of a shallower tripod socket and the ridged design of the Mars 3 Air\u2019s underside limits which tripods and mounts work with this projector. We couldn\u2019t secure it firmly onto our Vanguard Alta Pro2+ tripod, which has a larger, rectangular baseplate, but it worked fine with a little desktop tripod that had only a threaded screw.\n\nIf you plan to use a tripod or mount, choose carefully. Look for one with either no baseplate or a smaller, round baseplate.\n\nIt lacks USB-C. You need either a USB-C-to-HDMI or USB-C\u2013to\u2013A adapter cable to attach many mobile devices for video playback, and this projector uses a standard DC power port that requires an external power brick. But the ability to run it off the built-in battery at full brightness makes this inconvenience a little less bothersome.\n\nIt isn\u2019t made for big-screen movie watching. None of the small, portable projectors in this guide have the brightness, color accuracy, or deep black levels necessary to produce a satisfying big-screen (80 inches or more) movie image. For that, look at our guide to budget home theater projectors.\n\nIt isn\u2019t ideal for serious gaming. We measured over 45 milliseconds of input lag in this projector\u2019s game mode, which, combined with the 60 Hz refresh rate, means that it isn\u2019t responsive enough for serious gaming. But it\u2019s fine for, say, connecting a Nintendo Switch for casual gameplay.",

      "text": "The Best Tripod\nMany of today\u2019s cameras and lenses come with truly impressive image stabilization built right in, but there are always occasions\u2014such as time-lapse or macro photography\u2014when it makes sense to put your camera on a tripod.\nAfter spending 60 hours researching tripods and 30 hours testing 16 of the most promising models, we found the Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100 kit to be the sturdiest platform for challenging shooting situations. It has the tallest maximum height among the tripods we tested, and it\u2019s very stable. It\u2019s also easy to set up and break down, and built to withstand years of use.\nIf you need a more specific kind of support for certain shooting situations, we also have picks for people who dual-wield cameras, those who frequently shoot sports or wildlife, photographers who work in wet conditions, and frequent travelers. But all of the picks in this guide are geared toward full-size cameras. If you\u2019re looking for a tripod for a smartphone, try our guide to the best tripod for iPhones and other smartphones.\nWhat we looked for\n- Built to last\nCheap tripods are often made with low-grade plastic. We searched for tripods built with durable, high-quality aluminum and a long warranty to back them up.\n- Maximum height\nWe sought models that could reach at least 50 inches without the center column extended and at least 60 inches with the column extended.\n- Load capacity\nWe looked for models that can hold a camera-and-lens combination of at least 15 pounds\u2014enough to handle even the heaviest camera bodies and lenses we recommend.\n- Easy to carry\nA tripod should be light enough to transport, but still heavy enough to stand firmly in place. We favored models that weigh less than 6 pounds\u2014light enough to bring along even if you\u2019re also carrying a camera and lenses.\nThe Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100 offers the best balance of size and stability of all the tripods we tested. It gets taller than any of our other picks (68.2 inches at maximum height), its legs can splay outward at four angles, and its angling center column lets you position your camera as low to the ground as you want. This combination means you can find a stable shooting position on all kinds of surfaces, whether the camera is up high or down low.\nThe included ball head (the part that connects the camera to the tripod legs and allows adjustments to the camera\u2019s position) is better than what you usually find bundled with tripods in this price range; it adjusts smoothly, locks down solidly, and has a quick-release plate for you to easily attach and detach the camera. With a 15.5-pound weight limit, this tripod is more than strong enough for any of the camera-and-lens combinations we recommend.\nIf you\u2019re more of an on-the-go type of shooter, or if you like to shoot with two stabilized cameras at the same time, the Vanguard VEO 3T+ 234AB is the tripod for you. It\u2019s smaller and lighter than our pick and has all the same features, including a multi-angle center column. In addition, it comes with an adapter that lets you mount a second camera to the center column when it\u2019s in the horizontal position, so you can shoot with two devices at once.\nIf you plan to submerge your tripod in water on a regular basis, Sirui\u2019s W-1004K10 Tripod Kit River Runner is worth paying more for, since it\u2019s designed to keep dirt or sand from mucking up any sliding parts. Solidly built and easy to set up, the W-1004K10 has a ball head that adjusts smoothly, and its impressive 33.1-pound load capacity means that even if you rent a huge lens for a once-in-a-lifetime nature vacation, the W-1004K10 can handle it. It doesn\u2019t have a tilting center column like our other picks, but you probably won\u2019t miss that feature when you\u2019re waist deep in a lake.\nManfrotto\u2019s Element MII is an ideal travel tripod because it offers ample height and support in a highly portable package. Capable of collapsing to just 16.7 inches long and weighing a mere 3.4 pounds, it can nevertheless extend to a maximum height of just over 62.9 inches and support up to 17.6 pounds of gear. It was one of the most stable travel tripods we tested, yet it also costs less than much of the competition. The Element MII has other key features we seek in a travel tripod, such as easy-to-use twist leg locks and smooth and simple control of the ball head. It even has some nifty extras, including two bubble levels to help keep perspectives straight.\nIf you\u2019re into shooting birds and other wildlife, or if you like to capture fast-moving sports, a tripod might just get in your way. What you need in that situation is a monopod, and the Sirui P-204SR is our favorite monopod because it\u2019s tall, strong, and adaptable. The removable base features three sturdy feet that provide great stability when equipment is mounted, and this monopod can even become a tabletop tripod with an included accessory. With the base attached, the P-204SR stands 63.5 inches tall, and without the base it\u2019s still a respectable 57.9 inches.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- Who this is for\n- How we picked and tested\n- Top pick: Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100\n- Flaws but not dealbreakers\n- Best for use with multiple cameras: Vanguard VEO 3T+ 234AB\n- Best for shooting around water: Sirui W-1004K10 Tripod Kit River Runner\n- Best for travel: Manfrotto Element MII\n- Best monopod for shooting action: Sirui P-204SR\n- Sustainability and the environmental impact of tripods\n- Other tripods worth considering\n- The competition\nWhy you should trust us\nAssociate staff writer Arriana Vasquez has been doing both professional and hobbyist photography for over 10 years. Her work ranges from fashion to nature and street photography. She also worked for three years as a camera specialist at several camera stores in New York City. Erin Roberts is a photojournalist, writer, and professional photographer, and has a wide range of experience researching, testing, and writing about photography trends, techniques, and tools.\nWirecutter has been reviewing tripods since 2014. For this guide:\n- We researched approximately 65 tripods and tested 16.\n- We considered five monopods and tested four of the most promising models.\n- We measured the performance of each tripod and monopod in a variety of climates and situations.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, we review and test products with editorial independence. We are never made aware of any business implications of our recommendations.\n- In accordance with Wirecutter standards, all products are returned or donated once testing is complete. (This may involve long-term testing to evaluate whether our picks hold up with long-term use.)\nWho this is for\nEven with the image-stabilization systems built into many modern cameras and lenses, when you\u2019re using slower shutter speeds, the slightest movement of the camera can result in blurry pictures. If you shoot a lot in the following situations, using a tripod will let you get shots that would otherwise be very difficult or even impossible to capture:\n- Low light and longer exposures: When low light requires you to use a slower shutter speed, it\u2019s best to keep the camera stabilized. (Experienced photographers tend to use the reciprocal rule to figure out whether they need to use a tripod.) Similarly, if you\u2019re using a longer exposure to create a special effect\u2014such as blurring the movement of a waterfall while keeping the background sharply focused, or capturing bursts of color from a fireworks show\u2014you\u2019ll get a much better result with a tripod.\n- Remote triggers: You can take much better selfies and group photos with the camera on a tripod. You can either set the timer and run over to pose with the group or connect your camera to your smartphone and trigger the camera with the camera manufacturer\u2019s app. Remote triggers are also useful when you don\u2019t want to be near the camera\u2014say, while you\u2019re waiting for a hummingbird to show up at a bird feeder or for other wildlife to wander in front of your lens.\n- Landscapes, panoramas, and HDR: Even if you\u2019re shooting a landscape with plenty of light, placing the camera on a tripod lets you ensure that the camera is level for a straight horizon and that all the elements in the shot are properly positioned. Similarly, if you want to turn multiple shots into a panorama (stitched together in software), you need a tripod to keep everything evenly placed in the frame. And high dynamic range (HDR) images, which consist of two or more photos combined, require that those pictures be perfectly aligned. A tripod lets you take different exposures to get a better range of highlights and shadows while preserving alignment\u2014the resulting pictures will more accurately reflect the scene you wanted to capture.\n- Close-ups and telephoto shots: Whether you\u2019re using a macro or telephoto lens, the closer you get to a subject, the more sensitive the camera is to even the slightest movement. Telephoto lenses also tend to be bigger and heavier than other lenses, so you might not want to shoot handheld for a long period of time.\n- Images on the go: When you\u2019re shooting under the above conditions while on the go, you\u2019re likely to want a travel tripod, a model that collapses enough to be easily carried when attached to a hiking bag or placed inside a carry-on suitcase. Travel tripods are smaller and lighter than their full-size brethren, and though they might not be quite as stable or have as many extra features as bigger models, they make up for that in portability.\nHow we picked and tested\nWe\u2019ve seen plenty of cheap tripods, but in general we\u2019ve found that sub-$100 models are made with poor-quality materials, have less height adjustability, and are more difficult to set up properly. They might seem like a good value if you\u2019re on a tight budget, but in reality your cheap tripod is more likely to break after a year of use (or sooner), meaning you\u2019ll have to spend another $100 for a replacement. Our experience tells us that to get a truly solid, versatile, reliable, and full-featured tripod, you probably should spend around $150 or more.\nBut there\u2019s also an upper limit to how much most people should spend on a tripod. While carbon-fiber models are slightly lighter than their metal counterparts, they are also far more expensive. Case in point: You\u2019d have to spend an extra $70 to get the carbon-fiber version of our top pick, and doing so would save you only about 9 ounces.\nWith that in mind, we focused on quality aluminum models. To narrow things further, we looked at the following factors:\n- Load capacity: This represents how much weight a tripod is designed to support. We sought models that could hold a camera-and-lens combination of at least 15 pounds, which is enough to handle even the heaviest camera bodies and lenses we recommend.\n- Maximum height: We scouted for tripods that could reach at least 50 inches without the center column extended and at least 60 inches with the column extended, so even if you\u2019re 6-foot-2 you won\u2019t be too uncomfortably hunched over when trying to get that shot.\n- Leg and center-column angling: We favored tripods that allow you to angle the legs outward for setting the tripod low to the ground, as well as to angle the center column for shooting directly downward or getting the camera closer to subjects for macro photography.\n- The head: A good tripod head lets you position the camera at nearly any angle, and most have a quick-release plate that attaches to the bottom of a camera, allowing you to easily mount it on the tripod or remove it. Tripod legs and heads are often sold separately so you can upgrade them independently, although you can also find kits (such as our top pick) that include both. We recommend a ball head, which allows you to tilt and rotate the camera simultaneously. Ball heads tend to be more compact and easier to use than three-way heads, which let you adjust the amount of left/right tilt, up/down tilt, and rotation independently. (All of our picks include a ball head.)\n- Length when collapsed: Although size is much more important for travel tripods, it\u2019s always more convenient to carry something smaller.\n- Leg grips: Tripod legs can get cold when you\u2019re shooting on chilly days. Foam or rubber grips can keep your fingers happy\u2014and give you a better grip than bare metal.\n- Spikes: When you\u2019re setting up on a soft surface such as grass, spiked feet can help set a tripod more firmly in place. That said, a lot of photographers don\u2019t bother to use them. We looked for tripods that either include them or offer them as an optional accessory.\n- Weight: If a tripod is really heavy, you won\u2019t want to take it with you; if it\u2019s too light, it won\u2019t be sturdy enough. We looked for tripods weighing less than 6 pounds\u2014light enough to bring along even if you\u2019re also carrying a camera and a few lenses. If weight is important to you, our travel tripod pick keeps it to a minimum while still providing solid support for your camera.\n- Longevity: A quality tripod should last way longer than a year or two, so we singled out tripods packaged with tools that let you retighten the legs as they come loose with time and usage, as well as a long warranty so you\u2019re covered if something happens.\nStability is the main objective when you\u2019re using a tripod, so we mounted different camera-and-lens combinations to each tripod model to make sure it stayed steady with various setups and on different surfaces, including hardwood and carpeted floors indoors, as well as cement pavement, grass, and other uneven terrain outdoors. We purposefully used gear that was bulkier and heavier than the cameras and lenses we recommend in our guides, including the Nikon D5 and Z5 and Sony \u03b16600 cameras with various lenses. The longest and heaviest lenses we used were the Nikkor 24\u201370mm f/4 lens and the Sigma 150\u2013600mm f/5\u20136.3 lens.\nWe evaluated how easy it was to operate each tripod by setting up and closing down the legs and checking the leg-lock mechanisms. We checked the stability of the ball head, whether it moved when it was supposed to be locked, and how smoothly and evenly it moved when unlocked. We also examined each tripod\u2019s build quality and made sure that the different parts didn\u2019t get in the way of one another when in use.\nFinally, we tested any special features; if a model had a movable center column, for example, we angled it into different positions.\nTop pick: Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100\nThe Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100 offers the best combination of stability and height of the tripods we tested. It has the tallest maximum height (68.2 inches), its legs can angle outward at four angles (most models offer only three) to bring the camera closer to the ground, and its angling center column lets you position the camera in a multitude of ways when you\u2019ve set the tripod at any one of those leg angles. Although it\u2019s a little heavier and longer than some other models when collapsed, its added weight and height increase its stability and versatility, and it\u2019s still small and light enough to carry around for a day\u2019s shooting.\nThe Alta Pro 2+ is rated to support up to 15.4 pounds. In our testing, it was very stable, even when we mounted pro-level gear that was heavier than any of the cameras and lenses we recommend in our guides. Each leg has three extendable segments, and although we experienced some wobbliness in the lowest segment when the legs were fully extended, it wasn\u2019t enough to negatively affect our picture taking and was typical of all the tripods we tested when they were at full height. When the center column is fully extended, the Alta Pro 2+\u2019s height (not including the head) is about 68.2 inches, the tallest of the tripods we tested, so it\u2019s easier for taller photographers (anyone above the average height of 5 feet 6 inches) to use without having to stoop much. (With the center column collapsed, the maximum height is about 57 inches.) Although the center column is relatively stable when extended, keep in mind that all tripods are most stable when you have the center column lowered flush against the top of the legs.\nSetting up the Alta Pro 2+ is quick and easy: Just turn the two twist locks on each leg\u2014they unlock with a simple quarter-turn\u2014and then tilt the legs down so that they slide to full extension. You lock the legs with a similar turn in the opposite direction. We like the nice feel of the textured grips on the locks.\nThose three-section legs offer four angles relative to the center column: 20, 40, 60, and 80 degrees (most tripods offer only three angles). That gives you more versatility in terms of both lower height and the ability to adapt to uneven surfaces. The angles are marked at the top of the legs, and the legs ratchet into place so you can hear and feel when they\u2019re in position. With the legs at the 80-degree position, the tripod is almost level to the ground; this position is perfect for low-angle and macro shots, especially in combination with the tripod\u2019s multi-angle center column. A bubble level helps you ensure that the tripod is level even if the legs are extended to different angles.\nIt\u2019s easy to put the Alta Pro 2+\u2019s center column into multiple positions: You just turn a couple of knobs, lift the center column (it automatically stops when fully extended, so it won\u2019t come all the way out in your hand), and angle it to whatever position you want. The hexagonal column won\u2019t twist when extending or retracting, making angled work easier. However, although this column is generally stable in its angled position, even when horizontal, be sure to check the balance: If the center column is positioned too far to one side, the weight of the camera and lens can cause the entire tripod to tilt over and fall\u2014a law of physics that applies to any tripod with a multi-angle center column.\nThe included ball head and quick-release plate also work well. The ball head moved smoothly when we adjusted it, and it locked solidly into place. It has its own bubble level (to supplement the one on the legs), as well as a rotation gauge at the base of the head to help you duplicate panning positions when you\u2019re shooting multiple images to stitch into a panorama later.\nWe also like the overall build quality of the tripod\u2014none of the pieces seemed to be straining substantially even when we subjected them to heavy camera-and-lens combinations. The smoothness of the sliding parts was impressive, too. The Alta Pro 2+ feels like it will last a long time, and it comes with a two-year warranty.\nIn addition to the ball head and the quick-release plate, the Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100 kit comes with Allen wrenches in case you need to swap out the head or replace a broken leg, as well as a carry bag with a shoulder strap. The bag isn\u2019t as well made as those that accompany some other tripods we\u2019ve tested, but it\u2019s good enough for moving your tripod from one place to another.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nOf the tripods we tested, the Alta Pro 2+ is one of the heaviest, at 5.3 pounds, and one of the longest, at 29 inches, when fully collapsed. If you\u2019re hiking in the woods or traveling on a plane or train, you have smaller and lighter options (including our pick for travel tripods, or even our tripod pick for multiple cameras). But this Vanguard model\u2019s weight helps provide stability, and its added height makes it more versatile\u2014we think these are reasonable trade-offs for a full-size tripod.\nThe rubber feet of the Alta Pro 2+ work well on uneven terrain, but we felt them slide a few times when we were shooting indoors on wooden floors.\nUnlike some tripods, the Alta Pro 2+ has no hook at the bottom of the center column to hang a camera bag or other weight to stabilize the tripod. Instead it has a small canopy-suspension loop on the bubble level. The loop is very small, and we wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold anything of measurable weight, but Vanguard makes a stone bag accessory that you can attach to the legs to add weight.\nSome reviews on Amazon refer to issues with the Alta Pro 2+\u2019s center column either coming off entirely when the owner is trying to angle it or not being able to tighten in place completely, but we didn\u2019t encounter this problem in our testing. When we reached out to Vanguard, representatives explained that this happened because some units that were meant as photo samples accidentally ended up distributed for sale; the reps said it shouldn\u2019t be a problem going forward, and we will be keeping an eye on this issue in long-term testing.\nBest for use with multiple cameras: Vanguard VEO 3T+ 234AB\nWhereas the Alta Pro 2+ is a great all-around tripod for most photographers in most situations, we think the Vanguard VEO 3T+ 234AB is a good alternative for people who like to shoot with multiple cameras or are frequently on the move. That\u2019s because while the VEO 3T+ 234AB shares all the features we enjoy about the Alta Pro 2+, it's also lighter, smaller, designed with more flexible legs, and packaged with an additional accessory (the VEO+ MA1 adapter) that lets you mount an extra device, such as a second camera or a smartphone, to the center column. If you can live with its sole con\u2014a shorter maximum height\u2014those are some compelling pros.\nAt its maximum height, the VEO 3T+ 234AB stands 57.48 inches tall, about 10 inches shorter than our top pick but still tall enough to keep most people from hunching over when shooting. Each leg has three sections that extend easily yet feel solid once you tighten the twist locks. The legs have three easy-set angles, but they can also invert up to 108 degrees. This represents a notable advantage over the Alta Pro 2+, whose legs can adjust only up to 80 degrees. And when fully collapsed, the VEO 3T+ 234AB measures 18 inches long, some 11 inches less than the Alta Pro 2+; in other words, what you lose in maximum height you gain in portability.\nThe VEO 3T+ 234AB offers a multi-angle center column that allows you to position the column (and the ball head) at various horizontal and tilted angles. Again, this design is great for otherwise challenging overhead and low-angle shots, and it\u2019s especially helpful for capturing macro images. In addition to offering the multi-angle column, the VEO 3T+ 234AB can convert to a monopod\u2014you simply remove one of the legs and mount the center column on top of it. The tripod includes spiked feet, though you have to switch them out with the default rubber feet whenever you want to use them.\nThis tripod can handle loads of up to 22 pounds, or about 6.5 pounds more than our top pick. As with all the other tripods we tested, we saw a slight bit of movement when we mounted a Sony \u03b16600 with a Sigma 100\u2013400mm zoom lens and fully extended the center column. There is an optional hook you can screw into the bottom of the center column that lets you hang a camera bag or other weight to help stabilize the unit (though you\u2019ll need to remove this piece if you want to use the VEO 3T+ 234AB as a monopod).\nThe VEO 3T+ 234AB comes with the Arca-Swiss\u2013compatible VEO BH-110S dual-axis ball head, which we found to be stable and secure during testing. The BH-110S also worked great with our Peak Design plate, locking in just as solidly as it did with the plate that comes with the ball head. Additionally, the VEO 3T+ 234AB includes a second mounting adapter, the VEO+ MA1, that you can use when you\u2019ve set the center column to a horizontal position. It easily slides onto the other end of the center column and locks into place with a quick-release lever. The VEO+ MA1 offers a standard \u00bc-inch tripod screw to mount a second camera, a smartphone (using a smartphone tripod mount), or an action camera such as a GoPro.\nBest for shooting around water: Sirui W-1004K10 Tripod Kit River Runner\nIf you plan to shoot with your tripod partially submerged in water or mud, the waterproof Sirui W-1004K10 Tripod Kit River Runner is worth spending more on for the peace of mind it can provide. Although all our tripod picks can stand up to the rain, waterproof tripods do a better job of keeping the dirt and sand from rivers and lakes out of the joints, which can destroy any sliding or moving parts. This waterproof tripod from Sirui (pronounced \u201csue-ray\u201d) has comfortable controls and is well built and stable. It can\u2019t match the height of the Vanguard Alta Pro 2+, and it doesn\u2019t have the angling center column of either of our Vanguard picks, but it is the best tripod for fans of aquatic subjects.\nThe W-1004K10 provides very good stability, with a load capacity up to 33.1 pounds. The tripod weighs just 4.2 pounds and folds up to a compact 19.3 inches for travel. With the center column fully extended (which, as we noted above, sacrifices some stability), it reaches a height of 65 inches; with the column lowered, 53.5 inches.\nFrom its four-section legs to the bundled ball head, the W-1004K10 looks and feels solidly constructed. Whether you\u2019re extending the legs after releasing the twist locks or adjusting the angle of the ball head, the movements are smooth. This is especially true of the excellent ball head, which has separate controls for panning and locking, as well as a friction knob to adjust the tension on the control movement. It also has three bubble levels\u2014in addition to the bubble level on the tripod itself\u2014for photographers who need extremely accurate placement.\nThe tripod is waterproof up to the top of its foam grips, so you can step right into a river, lake, or ocean to get a shot. Those waterproof seals also mean that the W-1004K10 is protected from the dirt and sand you might encounter on your outdoor adventure. You can easily swap the stock rubber feet with the bundled spiked feet, and you can remove one of the tripod\u2019s legs to convert it into a waterproof monopod. As with the VEO 3T+ 234AB, a hook on the center column lets you hang a camera bag or other weights to help stabilize the tripod. The bundled carry bag is well constructed, just like the rest of the kit.\nUnlike our other picks from Vanguard, this Sirui tripod does not offer a multi-angle center column. This omission can make macro work more difficult, but it\u2019s an acceptable trade-off if you need the W-1004K10\u2019s waterproof design.\nBecause the W-1004K10 has four-segment legs, the last section of each leg is a little thin, so you give up a bit of stability when you fully extend all the legs. This drawback is common for four-segment legs, but it\u2019s still something to be aware of.\nBest for travel: Manfrotto Element MII\nIf you plan to bring a tripod with you when you go hiking or on a vacation, you should consider a travel tripod that packs down small and won\u2019t weigh you down too much. The moderately priced Manfrotto Element MII is both small and tall\u2014able to unfold from a collapsed height of 16.7 inches to a maximum height of just over 62.9 inches. The Element MII was one of the most stable travel models we tested; although its three leg sections end in a narrow circumference, overall it felt just as stable as the Vanguard VEO 3T+ 234AB.\nAt 3.4 pounds, the Element MII weighs almost 2 pounds less than the Vanguard Alta Pro 2+ 263AB100, but it can handle even more load with a rating of 17.6 pounds\u2014equivalent to far more gear than most people would ever need to support at once while traveling.\nThe Element MII features smooth twist leg locks with plenty of grip, as well as three leg-angle locks that snap into place and release with a simple push. Two knobs control panning and ball head rotation, and they work smoothly with secure tension. Two bubble levels help keep both your horizon level and your vertical alignment correct. You can also remove one leg and attach it to the ball head for use as a monopod.\nThe Arca-Swiss\u2013style mount looks small, but in our tests it easily accommodated a Nikon Z5 camera with a 24\u201370mm f/4 lens. The mount includes a tiny handle that works great in a pinch if you don\u2019t have an Allen wrench or a coin handy to tighten the plate to the camera.\nThe Element MII\u2019s slightly spiked small rubber feet offer plenty of grip, as well. Optional rubber spikes are included in the bag with the tripod. Thankfully, the entire package is small enough to tuck into most backpacks or large bags.\nLike many tripods, the Element MII uses twist leg locks. Although we prefer these to the flip kind for travel tripods\u2014because they help keep the overall aesthetic sleek and are less likely to snag\u2014they come with potential problems, too. Resist the temptation to over-loosen twist locks. It takes only a slight turn to loosen them; much more than that, and you may unintentionally discover that the legs are a bit tricky to put back together. Once they\u2019re extended, also be sure to firmly tighten the twist leg locks. Unlike with flip leg locks, with twist leg locks it\u2019s harder to tell whether they\u2019re completely secured; use your hand to double-check.\nLike most tripods in this category, the Element MII comes with a drawstring bag that you\u2019ll likely end up discarding. There\u2019s not much advantage to using a dedicated bag, as opposed to just tucking the tripod into a backpack or attaching it to a bag you\u2019re already using in your travels.\nBest monopod for shooting action: Sirui P-204SR\nIf you often shoot subjects that keep you on the move\u2014such as wildlife or sports that require a lot of panning\u2014you may prefer the lightweight freedom of a monopod over a tripod. The Sirui P-204SR is tall, strong, and adaptable to almost any situation, which makes it our favorite general-purpose monopod. It has large, comfortable, rubberized twist locks for extending and retracting its three sections. It weighs just 3.3 pounds but can hold up to 17.6 pounds of equipment\u2014more than our top tripod pick. In testing, it handled everything we mounted on it with ease, including a 4.5-pound Sony \u03b16600 camera with a Sigma 100\u2013400mm zoom lens.\nThe P-204SR features a removable base that can tilt up to 20 degrees. With the base, the monopod stands 63.5 inches tall; without the base, it reaches 57.9 inches. The base of the P-204SR had the largest feet of any of the monopods we tested, which gave it extra stability. Even when fully extended, it stood solidly with a Nikon Z5 camera and 24\u201370mm f/4 lens attached. Both rubber and spiked feet are included. One additional feature we love about this monopod is that the base, once you remove it from the body, can double as a small tripod (similar to the Manfrotto Pixi) with the help of an included accessory.\nThis monopod doesn't come with a ball head, but the screw mount is reversible, meaning it has two thread sizes\u2014one for cameras and one for tripod heads, so you can mount one if you want. In our testing we found that the tilting base gave us enough leeway to get most shots but not all. We definitely recommend a ball head if you\u2019re into bird photography, since it\u2019s much easier to angle only the camera upward instead of leaning the whole monopod backward. We tried the Benro BH00 ball head (which we discuss below) with the P-204SR, and it worked great.\nSustainability and the environmental impact of tripods\nThe best way to live a sustainable lifestyle is to create less waste, and a great way to create less waste is to invest in equipment that is made to last, repairable, and covered by a dependable warranty. As we state in How we picked and tested, a solid warranty was one thing we looked for when deciding which tripods to test. All of the picks in this guide also come with an Allen key so you can retighten the legs as they come loose from use.\nAlthough it might be tempting to pick up a cheaper tripod, such models are often made from low-grade plastic that you cannot tighten over time, and that you cannot repair if a part should break or crack. If you need a tripod and don\u2019t have the budget to invest in one that\u2019ll last, try searching sites such as Craigslist, eBay, or Facebook Marketplace to see if other photographers are selling used but high-quality tripods at a discount.\nIf you currently own a tripod but are looking to upgrade, selling or giving away your old equipment is a great way to help others and keep excess materials out of landfills. If you have a tripod that\u2019s not in good-enough condition to pass along, consider upcycling it.\nOther tripods worth considering\nIf you need a cheaper tripod and don\u2019t mind giving up a little stability and usability: The Benro SystemGo Plus FGP18A is simple to set up, solidly built, and only 3.9 pounds. It\u2019s significantly lighter than our 5.3-pound top pick, and in its most compact configuration, it\u2019s also noticeably smaller\u201418 inches versus the Vanguard Alta Pro 2+\u2019s 29 inches. Despite its lightweight design, this tripod is well made and sturdy-feeling. And like the Alta Pro 2+, the FGP18A offers a multi-angle center column that you can position at various horizontal and tilted angles.\nHowever, Benro doesn\u2019t offer a package with a ball head, so you have to pick one up separately if you don\u2019t already own one. We tested and recommend the company\u2019s BH00 single-action ball head as a solid, inexpensive option. It has a snap-in quick-release plate that\u2019s comparable to what you get with other tripods at this price.\nThe combination of the Benro SystemGo Plus FGP18A and BH00 ball head isn\u2019t quite as stable as our top pick, especially when extended to maximum height, and this tripod\u2019s adjustment knobs aren\u2019t as easy to use. We found that the FGP18A\u2019s center-column angle-adjustment knob was tight and difficult to move into position. And the knobs\u2014including the center column\u2019s height and pan-control locking knobs\u2014could end up blocking each other depending on how we positioned them. But if you can live with those quirks, it\u2019s a fine all-around choice.\nIf you want a monopod with its own quick-release plate: The iFootage Cobra 2 A180-II monopod uses a spring-loaded sliding collar to hold a quick-release plate on top. A similar mechanism lets you detach the feet at the bottom so you can turn them into a table-top style tripod like you can with the bottom of our monopod pick. You can also stack a second A180-II on top if you want to approximately double the height of the monopod.\nWhile we found that the A180-II was comparable to our pick in terms of stability, maximum height (71 inches), minimum length (27.8 inches) and weight (3.1 pounds), we feel that the sliding collar may pose a problem to people with hand strength issues. It takes considerable force to move the collar. This helps hold it very securely in place, but might make it a bad choice for some people. We also liked the feet on our pick better, which are each about 1.5 inches longer than those on the A180-II.\nThe competition\nStandard tripods\nThe Benro MeFoto GlobeTrotter is a simple but solid tripod with four-section legs. When fully extended, it was the most solid feeling of all the tripods we tested, and it\u2019s rated to handle up to 26 pounds, more than any of our picks. It\u2019s more expensive, though, and the center column can\u2019t angle out like those of our top picks can. We also found that the twist locks required more turns to loosen and tighten than on our picks, which meant that this model took more time to open and close. Lastly, at 4.5 pounds, it\u2019s almost as heavy as our pick but without the benefit of a multi-angle center column.\nTravel tripods\nOben\u2019s CT-3565 carbon-fiber tripod and BZ-217T ball head package makes for a solid travel tripod\u2014it\u2019s even lighter than our travel pick and can be found for about the same price. On the downside, it\u2019s just a bit shorter, and we didn\u2019t like the feet as much. The Oben tripod comes with rubber-and-spiked combo feet, which can be a bit annoying when the rubber spins up (during transport or use) to reveal the metal spikes just when you don\u2019t need them. (We\u2019d argue that you so very rarely need them that this feature often feels like more of a hindrance.) In contrast, the small, slightly spiked rubber feet on the Manfrotto Element MII are everything that most people will ever need, with a bit more grip to the rubbery material, too. And the Element MII comes with optional rubber spikes, should you need them.\nMonopods\nThe Manfrotto Element MII Video Monopod is significantly smaller and less stable than our monopod pick from Sirui. It barely stood up on its own, let alone with a camera mounted. The included fluid head panned and tilted smoothly, but the base isn\u2019t removable, making this model less versatile than our pick.\nTheano Nikitas contributed to this guide.\nThis article was edited by Ben Keough and Erica Ogg.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker\nPortable Bluetooth speakers are the easiest, most affordable way to spread music and podcasts across a room, backyard, or beach blanket. Because these speakers come in a variety of designs and sizes, no model is perfect for every situation. But the excellent sound and rugged design of the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 made it the favorite in our tests.\nHow we picked and tested\n- Panel testing\nWe tested Bluetooth speakers with expert listeners, and we concealed the identities of the speakers to eliminate bias.\n- Wide range of models\nWe test everything from tiny travel models to 40-pound backyard blasters. All of them include rechargeable batteries for portability.\n- Real-world trials\nWe continue to spend many hours with our recommended speakers to make sure they survive day-to-day use.\n- Price range\nTo give readers a full picture of the category, we test models priced as low as $10 and as high as $500.\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom has been our top pick for more than seven years, and the latest iteration, the Wonderboom 4, finally makes the switch to USB-C charging to keep up with the times. This small, round speaker (which measures 4.1 by 3.6 inches and weighs 15 ounces) has a clear, spacious sound that our listeners and editors have consistently ranked above the competition in brand-concealed tests.\nIt\u2019s also quite rugged. With an IP67 water-resistance rating, it can handle immersion in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. Plus, it\u2019s dustproof, it can survive a 5-foot drop onto concrete, and it floats. We got 11 hours of battery life in our tests, and the speaker is available in four colors.\nThe Tribit StormBox Mini+ is the best-sounding inexpensive Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve heard. Unlike almost all speakers in the low-two-figures price range, it produces a full sound that didn\u2019t leave our ears pining for more bass \u2014 although it didn\u2019t sound quite as clear, or play as loud, as our top pick.\nMeasuring about 4.7 by 3.6 by 3.6 inches and weighing 1.3 pounds, it travels easily in a beach bag (although not in a laptop bag), and its IPX7 rating means it\u2019ll survive being dunked underwater for 30 minutes. The battery lasted about 8 hours in our tests. It charges via USB-C and comes in three colors.\nThe StormBox Mini+ is an updated version of our previous budget pick. Physically and sonically, the two models are practically identical, but the Mini+ adds AAC decoding (a small potential advantage for Apple iOS users) and compatibility with Tribit\u2019s smartphone app, which offers preset sound modes and a nine-band equalizer.\nThe W-King X10 is an astonishingly affordable upgrade for those who need a larger, louder speaker with a long battery life. It plays almost 8 decibels louder than the Wonderboom 4, so it can easily be heard over a roomful of chatty partygoers. Even when cranked full blast, this speaker sounds clear and doesn\u2019t seem to lose any bass.\nWe got 24 hours of playtime from the internal battery, which is less than the claimed 42 hours but still impressive. It charges via USB-C, has an analog input and TF card slot, and offers a USB-A port to charge your mobile devices.\nThe X10 is about the size of a football and weighs 6.5 pounds. It doesn\u2019t travel as well in a backpack or suitcase, but the shoulder strap makes it easy to carry. The IPX6 rating means it can withstand being sprayed by a hose, but it can\u2019t be safely submerged in water like some of our other picks.\nThe JBL Go 4 is by far the smallest of our picks, easy to slip into a laptop bag, purse, or even a pocket. But unlike most of the ultra-compact Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve tried, it produces a satisfying, reasonably full sound.\nThe Go 4 measures 3.7 by 3 by 1.7 inches and weighs just 11 ounces. It maxes out at a little under 80 dB, which is about 10 dB more than the speakers built into most smartphones, so it\u2019s worth carrying with you, especially considering it weighs about the same as a typical smartphone.\nLike our top pick, this speaker is rated IP67, which makes it both waterproof and dustproof. It has USB-C charging and comes in lots of colors. The battery life is just 5 hours in standard mode. The Playtime Boost mode increased this to almost 9 hours, but it produced a slightly thinner sound.\nOf all the Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve tested around the $100 mark, the Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2 reminds us the most of a good bookshelf speaker. It reproduces voices more clearly and naturally than almost all other portable Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve tried, and it produces a satisfying amount of bass \u2014 more than our top pick.\nAlthough the Rockster Go 2 is relatively small at 8.3 by 2.4 by 4.3 inches and 1.6 pounds, it\u2019s larger than the Wonderboom 4 \u2014 too large to fit in most laptop bags, though probably small enough to slip into your suitcase. It charges via USB-C and has an IP67 rating, so it\u2019s waterproof and dustproof. The battery lasted 18 hours in our tests, and the speaker\u2019s removable elastic strap lets you connect it to a post or hang it from a hook.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust me\n- Who this is for\n- How we picked and tested\n- Top pick: Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4\n- Budget pick: Tribit Stormbox Mini+\n- Upgrade pick: W-King X10\n- Best for people who want a tiny, ultra-portable speaker: JBL Go 4\n- Best for someone who wants more bass than our top pick delivers: Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2\n- Other portable Bluetooth speakers worth considering\n- What to look forward to\n- The competition\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a staff writer at Wirecutter, currently handling 12 guides on audio products and providing technical measurements for our headphone guides. I\u2019ve worked as an editor or writer in audio publishing for more than 30 years, and I\u2019ve previously served as a consultant on speaker tuning and measurement for some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.\n- To date, I\u2019ve tested 455 speakers for this guide.\n- I brought in another listener \u2014 drummer and audio production student Kage Shissler \u2014 to provide a second opinion. I also played several models for a group of Wirecutter staffers in a brand-concealed test. For listeners other than myself, I concealed the identities of the products to avoid bias.\n- I ran technical tests on the products to find flaws that our listening sessions might have missed.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nWho this is for\nAnyone who owns a smartphone or tablet is likely to enjoy owning a portable Bluetooth speaker, which usually has a rechargeable battery and is often waterproof and/or dustproof. Bluetooth support is available in every current smartphone and tablet, as well as in most laptop computers, so you don\u2019t need additional equipment.\nUnlike smart speakers and Wi-Fi speakers, Bluetooth speakers don\u2019t require a network connection, and most don\u2019t require the use of special apps. Whatever you play on your phone will play through the speaker.\nIf sound quality and volume are your top priorities, and you don\u2019t plan to take your speaker out of your house, you may want to check out the larger, more powerful speakers featured in our tabletop speaker guides:\nHow we picked and tested\nWe use the following criteria to help us decide which portable Bluetooth speakers to call in for testing:\n- Portability and battery life: We focus on models that have rechargeable batteries and are designed to take a trip to the beach or the park with no hassle. In selecting our top pick, we prioritize speakers that are compact and easy to toss into a backpack or beach bag.\n- Ruggedness and waterproof design: We give priority to speakers that are built to survive the knocks and bumps of travel. We prefer speakers with an Ingress Protection (IP) rating, which tells you exactly how dustproof and waterproof a speaker is.\n- Price: We set a bottom price of $10. Less-expensive models often don\u2019t sound better or play much louder than a phone\u2019s built-in speakers.\n- Playback controls: Because you can control the playback from your Bluetooth source device (usually a phone or tablet), we don\u2019t require the speaker itself to have playback controls, but it\u2019s a convenient perk.\n- Bluetooth codecs: We don\u2019t award extra points for inclusion of additional Bluetooth codecs beyond the standard SBC codec found in all Bluetooth devices. The sonic differences among these codecs are insignificant next to the easily heard differences among the speakers themselves.\n- Special features: Bluetooth speakers may offer extra features, including speakerphone capability, multi-speaker pairing (the ability to play the same material through two Bluetooth speakers at once), and built-in lighting. We don\u2019t consider any of these features essential, but they can be convenient add-ons.\nFor each new round of tests, I begin by comparing the new models with each other and with some of our previous picks. I measure the maximum output of each speaker indoors at a distance of 1 meter, using an NTi Minilyzer audio analyzer and a calibrated NTi MiniSPL test microphone and playing a 34-second section of ZZ Top\u2019s very loudly mastered tune \u201cChartreuse.\u201d\nThe chart below shows the maximum output for our current speaker recommendations, plus a few other models we\u2019ve tested. For more details, see our results and our explanations of our testing process.\nPortable Bluetooth speaker maximum output\nFrom these tests, I narrow down the group of contestants to the models that have a real chance to impress our listening panel, in addition to all of our past picks. To prepare for our brand-concealed panel testing, I hide the speakers behind black fabric and divide them into four groups: ultra-compact, small, medium, and large. To make the test fair, I set the volume within a particular group to the same approximate level by using a shaped-noise channel-balancing test tone recorded from a Dolby Digital receiver.\nFor the most part, we use a speaker\u2019s factory settings for our listening tests. If a speaker has extra sound modes that are easily accessible through a dedicated button, we try these and do most of our testing using the mode that sounds best to us.\nDuring our brand-concealed tests, our listeners pay particular attention to:\n- how clear the speakers sound at normal levels\n- how the speakers balance bass to midrange to treble\n- how loud the speakers are able to play when cranked up\n- how clear they sound when cranked up\nLast, I check the battery life of each of our top picks by repeating Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cAja\u201d at an average level of 75 dB (measured at 1 meter) over and over until the power runs out. For the larger Ultimate Ears Hyperboom speaker, I increased the level to 81 dB.\nI also measure the maximum Bluetooth range of all our picks by placing my Samsung Galaxy S10 phone indoors, in a window, and carrying the speaker away in my backyard until the connection becomes unreliable. There are no industry-standard methods of testing these functions, but our methods have worked well through 12 years of testing more than 450 portable Bluetooth speakers.\nWith each model that offers speakerphone functionality, I try placing a call to Wirecutter senior staff writer Lauren Dragan. I note how the speaker sounds to me, and she tells me how my voice sounds on her end.\nTop pick: Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is the closest thing we\u2019ve found to an ideal all-around portable Bluetooth speaker, thanks to its great combination of performance, ruggedness, and portability.\nIt sounds great for its size. The Wonderboom speakers have been consistent winners in our brand-concealed tests, with listeners praising a more \u201copen, 3D sound\u201d than its competitors offer. The Wonderboom 4 delivers a natural balance of bass to midrange to treble, which means no instruments or voices are unnaturally boosted.\nWe measured maximum volume at 84.0 dB at 1 meter; that\u2019s enough to fill a bedroom or kitchen with sound. The Outdoor Boost button kicks up the level by about 3 dB, which makes the speaker a little louder but sacrifices bass.\nThe design is tough, practical, and fun. This IP67-rated speaker is dustproof, can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a half hour, and also floats. When we dropped it from 5 feet onto a backyard deck and then onto concrete, it kept playing and exhibited just a couple of small scuff marks.\nWe measured its Bluetooth range at an impressive 100 feet, and we got 11 hours of battery life \u2014 not quite the 14 hours that Ultimate Ears promises, but still plenty. An elastic loop on top lets you hang the speaker from various objects. You can pair two Wonderboom 4 speakers together to create stereo sound or to deliver sound in a second nearby room.\nThis roundish speaker measures 4.1 by 3.6 inches and weighs 15 ounces. It\u2019s available in four color schemes: black, pink, light gray, and blue.\nHow the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom has held up\nNumerous Wirecutter staffers have bought some version of the Wonderboom and have good things to say about it. Our editor-in-chief selected it from the thousands of top picks on Wirecutter to write about in our \u201c52 Things We Love\u201d series.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s light on bass. In terms of sound quality, the one consistent flaw we hear with the Wonderboom is that it doesn\u2019t have much bass oomph for hip-hop or heavy rock. If you like more bass, you may want to try out the larger but similarly priced Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2 described below.\nIt\u2019s chunky and lacks a few features. This speaker\u2019s 3.6-inch diameter makes it too stout to fit comfortably in a briefcase or laptop bag, but it\u2019ll fit fine in a backpack.\nThe Wonderboom 4 has neither a speakerphone function nor an analog input, but we seldom use those features.\nDouble-pressing the center button skips to the next track, but the speaker offers no way to skip back to the previous track.\nBudget pick: Tribit Stormbox Mini+\nThe Tribit StormBox Mini+ is one of the best audio bargains we\u2019ve ever encountered. Few speakers priced under $50 sound as full and satisfying as this one, and it also offers a useful feature set \u2014 including an IPX7 water-resistance rating, internal lights, and a smartphone app with tone presets and adjustments. It\u2019s not the most portable model we\u2019ve tested at this price, but it fits easily in a beach bag or suitcase.\nIt sounds fuller than most budget models. Unlike almost all other inexpensive Bluetooth speakers, the StormBox Mini+ has a full and satisfying sound. Compared with the Tribit XSound Go, which was our budget pick for five years, the StormBox Mini+ sounded more natural, and it didn\u2019t sacrifice as much of the bass in the music we listened to. We have found that some under-$50 speakers make voices sound a bit clearer than the Mini+ does, but that\u2019s because those speakers\u2019 relatively anemic bass lets the voices stand out. This speaker sounds more balanced.\nThe Mini+ is compatible with Tribit\u2019s smartphone app, which offers several tone presets plus a useful nine-band graphic equalizer, so you can tune the sound to your liking.\nThe feature set is impressive for the price. The StormBox Mini+ is IPX7-rated, which means it can stand being submerged in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes but is not dustproof. The 3.5 mm analog input allows you to connect to non-Bluetooth sources, such as some portable music players and computers.\nMulticolor lights on the top of the speaker pulse in time with the music; you can easily turn them off if you prefer. A strap on the top lets you hang the speaker from a hook, while the rubbery feet on the bottom prevent sound vibrations from scooting the StormBox Mini+ across a table \u2014 but only if you remove the protective plastic films covering the feet.\nThe Mini+ also supports the AAC Bluetooth codec, which could give you a slight advantage in sound quality when you\u2019re using it with an Apple iOS device or an AAC-equipped Android phone.\nIf you buy an extra StormBox Mini+, you can pair them to get stereo sound, but they can\u2019t pair with any other Bluetooth speaker. The Mini+ is available in three colors: black, light blue, and light green.\nIt\u2019s reasonably portable. While the StormBox Mini+ is much larger than the JBL Go 4, it measures just 4.7 inches high and 3.6 inches wide and deep, and it weighs 1.3 pounds. So it\u2019s great for tossing into a beach bag, but too chunky for a laptop bag or purse.\nIn our tests, the Bluetooth range measured about 100 feet.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt doesn\u2019t play that loud. With a max volume of 80.7 dB in our tests, it\u2019s not significantly louder than the much tinier JBL Go 4. But it does sound fuller.\nBattery life is a little lacking. With the internal lights turned off, the StormBox Mini+ averaged about 8 hours of battery life in our tests, well short of the 12 hours that Tribit promises, and shy of its predecessor\u2019s average of 9.5 hours. Still, that\u2019s enough for a full day at the office or beach.\nThe speakerphone function sounds good but doesn\u2019t work for long. Tribit added a speakerphone function to the Mini+, and in our tests calls sounded clear on it from both ends. However, the speaker turns itself off 10 to 15 minutes into a call, so the call goes back to your phone.\nUpgrade pick: W-King X10\nThe W-King X10 is the best portable speaker to use in larger areas, such as at a picnic, a small beach party, or a yoga class. This football-sized speaker often costs less than our top pick, but it sounds as good as, and plays louder than, many of the more expensive speakers we\u2019ve tested.\nIt\u2019s larger and louder than our top pick. The X10 maxes out roughly 8 dB louder than the Wonderboom 4, which is about the difference between talking normally and raising your voice to address someone 30 feet away.\nEven at that loud volume, during our tests it sounded smooth and balanced, with clear voices and plenty of bass. The Outdoor mode cut the bass some but didn\u2019t boost the volume. (Unfortunately, the speaker has no indicator to tell you which mode it\u2019s in.)\nThe X10 weighs 6.5 pounds, a manageable weight when you use the included shoulder strap (which sports an integrated bottle opener) \u2014 but it\u2019s not a speaker that you can easily toss into a purse or suitcase. Once you reach your destination, you can lay the speaker down horizontally or stand it on end.\nThe battery life is impressive. In our tests we got 24 hours, which is excellent \u2014 although short of W-King\u2019s claimed 42 hours.\nThe back panel offers a USB-C charging port, a 3.5 mm analog audio input, a TF card slot for playing MP3s, and a USB-A output for charging mobile devices. You can pair two X10 units for stereo audio.\nWe measured the speaker\u2019s Bluetooth range at 70 feet, which is more than adequate.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt isn\u2019t quite as rugged as our top pick. The X10 has an IPX6 rating, which means it can withstand spraying from a hose but not submersion in water, and it\u2019s not dustproof.\nAlso, its buttons are a little stiff. They might prove daunting for small or arthritic hands; the similar but slightly less powerful W-King D8 has bigger buttons that are easier to use.\nIts speakerphone function isn\u2019t great. Its speakerphone function worked okay in our tests, but for both Lauren and me, it sounded dull and somewhat noisy, as if we were both in our cars.\nBest for people who want a tiny, ultra-portable speaker: JBL Go 4\nIf you love traveling light but want to listen to music and podcasts everywhere you go, the JBL Go 4 is a superb choice. It\u2019s one of the few ultra-compact Bluetooth speakers that sound good, and it\u2019s so small and light that it could go almost unnoticed in a laptop bag, purse, or coat pocket.\nIt\u2019s small and tough enough even for backpacking. Measuring just 3.7 by 3 by 1.7 inches and weighing just 11 ounces, the Go 4 might find a place in the pack of even the most minimalist traveler.\nThe IP67 rating means it\u2019s dustproof and can withstand immersion in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. A small loop at the top lets you hang the speaker from a strap or a carabiner clip.\nIt sounds good for its size, but you should keep your expectations in check. The Go 4\u2019s tiny size prevents it from producing much bass, but the bass you do get is well-balanced with the treble and midrange, so the sound is satisfying.\nThis speaker plays loud enough for a bedroom, bathroom, or tent, maxing out at 79.8 dB in our tests. That's about 4 dB less than the Wonderboom 4, but 3 dB louder than most similarly sized models we\u2019ve tested.\nThe Go 4 is one of the first portable Bluetooth speakers on the market to incorporate Auracast Bluetooth technology. Auracast lets you broadcast a signal to multiple Auracast-equipped speakers and headphones from a single source. We were able to use Auracast to create a three-room audio system with the Go 4 and JBL\u2019s Charge 6 and Flip 7 speakers. But Auracast products are just starting to roll out, and we expect a few bugs and incompatibilities. Even without using Auracast, you can pair two Go 4 speakers to get stereo audio.\nWe only got about 5 hours of battery life out of the Go 4 in its standard mode, which isn\u2019t great. But activating the Playtime Boost mode in the JBL Portable mobile app kicked this up to about 8 hours 45 minutes, which is much better for such a small speaker. The Playtime Boost mode has a little less bass but still sounds pretty good; if you\u2019re listening to podcasts or background music, you probably won\u2019t notice.\nBluetooth range measured about 85 feet, and the Go 4 is available in nine color schemes.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt has very little bass compared with larger portable speakers. There\u2019s only so much bass you can produce from such a small cabinet. Even though the Go 4 didn\u2019t distort when we cranked up Audrey Nuna\u2019s \u201cdamn Right,\u201d much of the rhythmic drive and kick of your hip-hop, R&B, and EDM favorites will be lost.\nBest for someone who wants more bass than our top pick delivers: Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2\nThe Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2 is the only portable Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve tested under $100 that comes close to the sound of a decent bookshelf speaker. While this speaker is not the last word in portability, it\u2019s reasonably compact and rugged.\nEven audiophiles may like the sound. The Rockster Go 2 has an almost shockingly natural, smooth sound compared with most other portable Bluetooth speakers. It doesn\u2019t add sibilance or coarseness to voices, and it doesn\u2019t emphasize certain instruments at the expense of others. A large passive radiator on the front reinforces the bass and gives the Rockster Go 2 a more satisfying sound than most other speakers its size can produce.\nThe Rockster Go 2 achieved a max output of 86.2 dB in our tests, which is a just-noticeable 2.2 dB increase over the Wonderboom 4. But it sounds even louder because it has more bass.\nThis speaker doesn\u2019t sound as spacious as a set of stereo speakers or a good soundbar, but no speakers of this size do. The \u201cDynamore\u201d button on top attempts to add more spaciousness, but it seems to just tack on some phony surround effect with extra reverb, and we didn\u2019t bother with it.\nThe Rockster Go 2 supports the AAC Bluetooth codec, which could be a mild sonic advantage for iPhone and iPad users.\nIt\u2019s travel-friendly. Because it measures just 2.4 inches thick, the Rockster 2 Go can probably slip between your clothes and the side walls of your suitcase. But at 8.3 inches wide and 1.6 pounds, it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll want to lug to work every day in your laptop bag.\nThis speaker should be rugged enough to survive adventurous vacations because, like our top pick, it\u2019s IP67-rated \u2014 which means it\u2019s dustproof and can survive being dunked in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes.\nA removable elastic strap lets you strap the speaker to a post or hang it from a hook. A \u00bc\u2033-20 threaded socket on the bottom allows you to attach it to a photo tripod or camera mount.\nThe battery didn\u2019t run as long as we\u2019d hoped. We got 18 hours in our tests, which is good for the speaker\u2019s price but much less than the rated 28 hours. Bluetooth range averaged an impressive 140 feet.\nThe design is more ergonomic than most. Too many portable Bluetooth speakers feature raised black labels on black buttons, which can be almost impossible to see in poor lighting. The Rockster Go 2\u2019s big, top-panel buttons are clearly marked in white, so you can see them in the dark.\nWhile the Rockster Go 2 takes its styling cues from Fender guitar amps, it shares no engineering with Fender products. It\u2019s actually a rebranded version of a model made by Teufel, a German audio company.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nWe occasionally noticed the limiter clamping down on deep bass notes. When we played hip-hop or heavy rock music at high volume, we sometimes heard the speaker\u2019s internal limiter reducing the volume of deep bass notes to prevent distortion.\nThis type of artifact is audible with most portable Bluetooth speakers, but given the size of the Rockster Go 2\u2019s internal speakers and bass radiator, we expected a little less limiting.\nOther portable Bluetooth speakers worth considering\nIf you want something louder: The Ultimate Ears Hyperboom is a great choice if you need loud volume for outdoor parties, or if you want fuller, clearer sound than smaller Bluetooth speakers can provide. It maxed out at 99.1 dB, so it\u2019s loud enough for a big pool party, yet it produces the clear, robust sound we\u2019re used to hearing from a good small stereo system. It\u2019s IPX4-rated, which means it can tolerate a splash of water, and it played for 27.5 hours in our tests, at a volume 6 dB higher than we usually use in our tests.\nIf you want a powerful portable speaker with Wi-Fi and smart-speaker functions: The Brane X is pricier than the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom, but it\u2019s half the size and offers similar sound quality and maximum volume. In addition to Bluetooth, it works as an Amazon Alexa device. It can stream many services directly through Wi-Fi, including iHeart, Pandora, Prime Music, Spotify, and TuneIn Radio. It\u2019s IP57-rated, so it\u2019s better armed against the elements than the Hyperboom. It requires a separate AC adapter for charging, and in our tests it typically ran for 11.25 hours on a charge.\nIf you want something more stylish: The Morel Biggie is a smaller, portable version of the Morel H\u00f6gtalare speaker that we recommend in our home Bluetooth speaker guide. Like the home model, the Biggie is built like a bookshelf speaker, with a high-quality woofer and tweeter. Our panelists thought the sound was exceptionally clear and the bass impressive, although the front port sometimes made chuffing sounds when we played tunes with extra-deep bass. With its leather carrying strap, minimalist design, and eight understated color schemes, it looks like something you\u2019d buy in a home design store. But it\u2019s not waterproof or dustproof, so don\u2019t leave it outside. It lasted 21 hours in our battery test and hit a maximum volume of 98.9 dB.\nIf you want a more versatile ultra-portable travel speaker: The Ultimate Ears Miniroll is more expensive and a little larger than the JBL Go 4, but it sounds a bit fuller and it has a handy integral strap that lets you strap it to a pole or chair or hang it from a hook \u2014 something the JBL doesn\u2019t offer unless you add your own strap or carabiner clip. It\u2019s IP67-rated, so it\u2019s waterproof and dustproof. Its max volume is about the same as the Go 4\u2019s, and its battery typically ran for about 8.5 hours in our tests.\nIf you want the least-expensive portable Bluetooth speaker that still sounds decent: The Rofall D68F sounds fuller and more natural, and plays louder (an impressive 84 dB), than any other under-$25 Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve tried. Plus it has cool-looking internal lights that can be switched off, and it even offers stereo pairing.\nIf you want a Bluetooth speaker that also works for karaoke: The Soundcore Rave 3S is a good-sounding, very loud speaker; it includes two wireless microphones and has a surprisingly effective AI Vocal Remover mode, which lets you sing along with your favorite tunes. You can read more about the Rave 3S in our best karaoke machines guide.\nWhat to look forward to\nWe\u2019re in the process of testing several new models, including the Bose SoundLink Plus, the Fender x Teufel Rockster Cross, the Soundcore Boom 3i, and JLab\u2019s Epic Party, Go Party, JBuds Party, and Pop Party.\nThe competition\nWe\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of Bluetooth speakers for this guide. Below are capsule descriptions of some of the models that might be of most interest to Wirecutter readers. If you don\u2019t see a certain model you\u2019re interested in, check out our running list of portable Bluetooth speakers we\u2019ve tested.\nThe new version of the Beats Pill sounds much better than the previous model, but it plays only about 2 dB louder than the less-expensive UE Wonderboom 4, and it sounded a little bright and edgy to us.\nThe Bose SoundLink Flex is a solid alternative to the Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2. The sound is a little more trebly and less full, with about a 2-dB reduction in maximum volume. But it\u2019s a good choice if you want a speaker that\u2019s smaller and has more conservative styling than the Rockster Go 2.\nThe Bose SoundLink Max sounds good and has excellent maximum output for its size (96.3 dB), but it has less bass than some competitors and is comparatively expensive.\nThe affordable Comiso C15 is competitive with our budget pick, but it lacks bass and doesn\u2019t sound quite as loud. The Comiso X26 sounds comparatively distorted and unclear.\nThe EarFun UBoom X is a great choice if you want more power than the W-King X10; it plays 6.1 dB louder and has powerful yet well-defined (i.e., not boomy) bass. Voices and midrange instruments sound clear, although slightly bright. However, the UBoom X is much bulkier and, as of this writing, costs about 60% more.\nThe JBL Charge 6 and Flip 7 are both very good speakers with rugged designs and Auracast capability. Our listeners generally liked them, but in both cases they would\u2019ve preferred a little more bass.\nAbove about 85 dB, the JBL Xtreme 4 has a blaring, bright sound that emphasizes snare drums; our listeners didn\u2019t like it. And it\u2019s very expensive for its size.\nThe LG xboom Bounce sounded good overall, but a little bright. We love its MY Button, which instantly calls up a favorite playlist or internet radio station. However, its Auracast function works only with other Bounce speakers. We\u2019ve found less-expensive models that play as loud and sound a little better. But this one is well worth considering if the design and features appeal to you. The less-expensive xboom Grab sounded thinner and somewhat blaring with loud music.\nThe large LG xboom Stage 301 plays very loud, but we thought that vocals sounded unnatural. Sometimes singers sounded a bit like they were singing into a coffee can.\nThe pricey Marshall Emberton III underperforms for its size; voices sound strained, and it needs more bass.\nThe Skullcandy Barrel is a good bargain, with clear (although slightly bright) sound, but some comparably priced and similarly sized competitors can play a little louder.\nThe Sony ULT Field 5 and ULT Field 3 are both expensive for the volume and sound quality they offer. We thought that both speakers had a rather trebly sound and needed more bass.\nThe Soundcore Select 4 Go typically runs about half the price of the JBL Go 4 and offers similar sound quality and maximum output. However, it\u2019s 72% larger by volume. If you don\u2019t mind the larger size, it\u2019s a terrific deal.\nThe Treblab HD-Go sounds pretty full for its size, but it doesn\u2019t really play that much louder than the speaker built into a good smartphone.\nThe Tribit StormBox Blast is a great value if sound quality and volume are most important to you, and if you don\u2019t mind lugging around a 12-pound speaker. This affordably priced speaker provides excellent sound quality, and it plays about 5 dB louder than the W-King X10. The StormBox Blast 2 costs about 50% more but plays only 3.6 decibels louder than the original Blast.\nThe Tribit StormBox Lava is a close competitor to the W-King X10, with a similar design and price and comparable maximum output. We thought the W-King X10 sounded a little smoother with voices, but in the stock setting, the StormBox Lava produced deeper bass. If you\u2019re into bass, you might like the Lava better.\nThe Tribit XSound Go was our budget pick for five years, easily beating other inexpensive models in our brand-concealed tests. But in our most recent test, the StormBox Mini beat the XSound Go by just as wide a margin.\nThe Tronsmart Bang Max delivers the most decibels per dollar (100.2 dB) of any large portable Bluetooth speaker we\u2019ve found. It sounds less smooth and you can hear more bloat in the lower midrange than the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom, but for outdoor parties, it might be better. As one of our listeners said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer the UE for indoor listening and the Tronsmart speaker for dancing or playing music by the pool.\u201d\nThe Turtlebox Gen 2 is designed for high volume outdoors. It\u2019s quite a good speaker, and it maxes out at an impressive 101.6 dB. At more than $400, it\u2019s pricey, but if you want high volume and need something more rugged than the UE Hyperboom, it\u2019s a great choice. We didn\u2019t care for the Turtlebox Ranger, though, which has a harsher sound and less bass than most similarly sized competitors.\nThe Ultimate Ears Boom 4 is a great-sounding speaker with a balanced sound and impressive clarity, but it can\u2019t compete with the volume and bass power of the less-expensive W-King X10. The bigger, pricier Megaboom 4 played only 0.8 dB louder, and sometimes it sounded distorted on deep bass notes.\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play is a cost-reduced version of our top pick, the Wonderboom 4. The Play\u2019s single-speaker design sounds rougher and considerably less room-filling than what the Wonderboom 4\u2019s stereo speakers produce. We think the Wonderboom 4 is well worth its higher price.\nThis article was edited by Adrienne Maxwell and Grant Clauser.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "If you've ever tried to set up a projector you'll be familiar with the struggle of getting a perfectly rectangular image on the wall. This is because the lens of projector has to be perpendicular to the screen. If any corner of the projector is closer to the screen than its opposite, you'll get some kind of trapezoid instead of a nice rectangle.\nThis isn't a new problem, and for decades projectors have had a \"feature\" to counter this issue. Called keystone correction, or keystone adjustment, it will technically make a rectangle out of your trapezoid\u2026 so to speak. If you care at all about picture quality, don't use it. Here's why.\nThe problem with not being perpendicular\nProjectors are a two-piece system: the projector and the screen. Even if you're using a wall or the side of your house instead of a screen, that still counts. All projectors use rectangular imaging chips to create an image, and it's crucial that the image sent by the chip is exactly perpendicular to the screen. Every corner needs to be the same distance to the screen as its opposite corner and if that doesn't happen, the shape gets distorted.\nEven if you've never used a projector, you've probably seen this effect in action. Ever used a flashlight? Point it directly at the wall and you've got a circle. Point it on the ground ahead of you, and it's an oval. Same concept.\nSome projectors have a feature called lens shift, which mechanically adjusts how the imaging chips, lens and screen line up. Lens shift lets you move the image slightly on the wall without hurting image quality, but its adjustment range is limited. If you're beyond how far the lens shift can adjust, or the projector don't have lens shift at all, misplacement will cause the image to go askew.\nMost screens have black borders so you don't need exact placement to the picometer, but it'd be a shame to spend money on a projector, and time on installing it, only to be annoyed at the visible edges when you're using it.\nWhich is why every projector has keystone correction. That doesn't mean it's good.\nKeystone: Not even once\nKeystone correction aims to solve electronically what is inherently an optical problem. The projector will digitally adjust the image in the opposite direction to offset the trapezoid. So if the image is, say, smaller on the left than the right, the projector can reduce the size of the right side so it appears rectangular again. Clever, right? Sort of. Unfortunately there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\nAll modern projectors use one of three technologies, DLP, LCD, or LCOS. All of them have a fixed number of pixels, or picture elements, used to create an image. There's no way to change the number of pixels on one of these chips. These imaging chips are generally fixed in place as well.\nWhat keystone correction does is scale the image smaller, and then further process it to form the shape required to \"look\" rectangular. Or to put it another way, it's drawing a trapezoid inside a rectangle, but because the projector and image itself is skewed, that trapezoid now looks rectangular.\nBoth of these things reduce image quality. Scaling, in this case, reduces the number of pixels used to create the image. You're only using a portion of the imaging chip to create the new image shape. The more you adjust the keystone, the fewer pixels are used, further softening the image.\nMost projectors don't have much processing power, so this scaling might further soften the image, or it might introduce other noticeable artifacts. Changing the shape of the image is a further processing challenge and can add additional artifacts.\nAnd if that weren't enough, it's impossible to turn \"off\" the pixels you're not using. So there's still going to be light projected on the screen from these unused pixels, which appears inside the trapezoid shape you've been trying to avoid. In an extreme situation, you could have a noticeable gray image beyond the screen area. Inelegant at best, distracting at worst.\nThe solution? Place the projector properly\nThere's no better solution than not having the problem to begin with. Proper projector placement placates potential picture perils. Or to quote the ancient adage from prehistory: measure twice, cut once.\nIf you're mounting your projector permanently, double- and triple-check the mount is in the correct place for your projector. This is crucial. Most projectors, especially those based on DLP, have their lenses offset from the center of the projector. Ideally, your mount will have some adjustment \"wiggle room,\" but it might not.\nUsually you can download a mounting template and other info from the manufacturer's website.\nAlso consider that most projectors, again especially those based on DLP, have an \"upward throw.\" Which is to say, they create an image several inches above the top of the projector (or below, if it's mounted on the ceiling). You can't tilt the projector down since that, too, creates a trapezoid. Again, this info is on the company's website.\nSo yeah, if you absolutely have to use keystone correction, go for it. But it should only be used as a last resort in situations where you physically can't place the projector in its proper position. If you're mounting it, it's best to spend the time and get it right the first time and not rely on image-reducing electronic trickery to fix a bad install.\nAs well as covering TV and other display tech, Geoff does photo tours of cool museums and locations around the world, including nuclear submarines, massive aircraft carriers, medieval castles, epic 10,000-mile road trips and more.

      "text": "The Best Budget Projector for a Home Theater\nIf you want to create a big-screen movie experience at home on a modest budget, the BenQ HT2060 is the best choice. Although the HT2060\u2019s performance can\u2019t rival that of the best 4K home theater projectors, it offers good image contrast and impressive color accuracy, so it will make your favorite movies look richer and more engaging than other budget projectors. It\u2019s also bright enough for you to enjoy sporting events and TV shows with some room lights on.\nHow we picked\n- Who this is for\nThese picks let you create a big-screen movie experience on a budget. We cover smaller, more affordable models in our portable projectors guide.\n- High brightness\nMany cheap projectors are too dim to use with a large screen. We prefer a brightness spec of at least 1,000 ANSI lumens for a 100-inch screen.\n- Full HD resolution\nAll our picks have at least a 1920\u00d71080 resolution, which allows for a big, detailed image with no chance of visible pixels.\n- Flexible setup\nProjectors can be tricky to set up, so we look for models that offer zoom, lens shifting, and other features to help you position the image.\nThe BenQ HT2060 stands above every projector we\u2019ve tested under $1,300 because it gets the important things right in the picture-quality department and doesn\u2019t have any major ergonomic annoyances to contend with. You can find lower-priced projectors that offer good brightness or a solid black level or accurate color, but it\u2019s rare to find all three in the same package. That\u2019s what you get with the HT2060, along with a respectably robust speaker, a thorough connection panel, and a long-lasting LED light source that\u2019s quiet in operation and won\u2019t need to be replaced.\nThe projector\u2019s 1.3x zoom, adjustable feet, and ability to vertically shift the lens make it easier for you to position the image on your screen, and this model isn\u2019t plagued by excessively loud fan noise. The HT2060 has a 1080p HD resolution but supports the input of a 4K high dynamic range video signal, and it supports 3D playback.\nThe HT2060 lacks built-in streaming apps and Bluetooth support, but you can easily add those features by connecting a media streamer to one of the two HDMI 2.0 inputs. The biggest potential drawback to this projector is that the single-DLP-chip design can produce a visible rainbow effect for some viewers, but most people either can\u2019t see it or aren\u2019t bothered by it.\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m an editor at Wirecutter, overseeing all of our audio and video device coverage and writing our projector guides. I am an Imaging Science Foundation Level III\u2013certified video calibrator, and I have the full complement of objective testing gear to measure and evaluate the performance of these projectors.\n- I have reviewed more than 20 projectors since I took over this guide in 2020, and I have researched many more.\n- I follow annual trade shows like CES and CEDIA Expo to get details on new projector models and technologies.\n- In accordance with Wirecutter standards, I return or donate all products I\u2019ve tested once my assessment of them is complete. I never hang on to \u201cfreebies\u201d once testing is done, though I do hold on to our official picks (when possible) for future comparison testing.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nWho this is for\nA budget home theater projector is designed for anyone who wants to enjoy a cinema-like, big-screen movie experience at home but doesn\u2019t need the improved detail of the best 4K projectors.\nWe focus here on projectors designed primarily for watching movies and TV shows on a big projector screen. We have a separate guide to smaller, portable projectors, which can be a good replacement for a midsize TV but lack the brightness to produce a 100-inch-plus image. Business projectors are cheaper and sometimes brighter, but that\u2019s because they emphasize colors that appear brighter on screen in order to compete with sunlight coming through office windows, not the colors that produce the best image for movies. As a result, their images may not look realistic, with cartoonish greens, washed-out reds, and cyan-tinged blues.\nBudget home theater projectors can reside in a permanent ceiling mount in a home theater, but they\u2019re small enough that you could just set one on a stool, coffee table, or chair in the living room. They also have built-in speakers, so it\u2019s not mandatory that you add an external audio system (though we recommend that you do). Just add a screen, and you\u2019ll have a huge and immersive image anytime you want.\nHow we picked and tested\nWe consider the following criteria to help us decide which projectors to call in and test:\nPrice: This guide focuses on home theater projectors priced around $1,300 or less.\nLight output: A projector\u2019s light output (usually listed in ANSI or ISO lumens) determines not only how bright the image is but also how large an image the projector can create (image brightness decreases as the image size increases). Our focus here is on projectors that are bright enough to produce a well-saturated image on a large screen (100 inches or bigger) for a true cinema-like experience. We prefer a stated brightness spec of at least 1,000 ANSI or ISO lumens for a 100-inch screen, which disqualifies pretty much all of the cheap mini/pico projectors and portable projectors.\nNote that most manufacturers\u2019 stated brightness specs don\u2019t correlate with real-world performance, at least not in the more accurate picture modes that people should actually use. The highest light output usually comes from a picture mode that has a strong green tint, which helps it measure brighter but doesn\u2019t look accurate or even good. Some manufacturers of LED-based projectors state their brightness output in \u201cLED lumens\u201d instead of ANSI lumens in order to give a higher number.\nResolution: A projector must have at least a full HD (1920\u00d71080) resolution for us to consider it for this guide because that allows for a big, detailed image with less chance of visible pixels. The images from 720p or 480p projectors look softer, and when such models are creating a big image (or when you\u2019re sitting close), the pixels are visible. In the past, our price limit has excluded most 4K projectors from consideration, but we are seeing more entry-level 4K models priced around $1,300.\nSetup features: A front-projection system can be trickier to set up than a TV, since you have to focus the image and adjust it to project a precise size and shape onto your screen. Generally you need to place a projector about 100 inches away from the screen to cast a 100-inch image, but a lens with zoom adjustment gives you some flexibility in the projection distance \u2014 and a higher zoom equals more flexibility.\nIf the projector is not directly in line with the screen, it can produce the keystone effect, which makes the image look more trapezoidal than rectangular. Pretty much all the projectors we\u2019ve tested have digital keystone correction to help deal with this problem, and many new budget models have automatic keystone correction. But using it can reduce image clarity and add artifacts, so it\u2019s best to avoid it whenever possible. The better projectors allow you to physically shift the lens vertically and/or horizontally to place the image more precisely without having to resort to keystone correction.\nWe do not require features such as a 120 Hz refresh rate or low input lag, both of which can improve gaming and sports playback but are less crucial for movie playback. But some projectors in this price range do include those features, which is a nice perk.\nTo evaluate each projector\u2019s performance, we conduct both objective and subjective tests. For objective tests, we use Portrait Displays\u2019s Calman software and C6 HDR2000 colorimeter, along with a Murideo Six-G test pattern generator, to measure each projector\u2019s contrast ratio, light output, and color and color-temperature accuracy. We measure all the available picture modes and brightness settings to find the best combination of performance attributes. We test all the projectors for this guide on a 100-inch Silver Ticket STR Series screen.\nA projector\u2019s most important performance attribute is its contrast ratio, which is the difference between the brightest part of the image and the darkest. A high contrast ratio creates dark blacks and bright whites. A low contrast ratio creates an image that is more washed out, usually with more gray-looking blacks. No projector in this price range has a great contrast ratio, but some results are certainly better than others.\nTied in with contrast is the projector\u2019s brightness. As we mentioned above, the projector\u2019s brightness determines how large an image it can create, but brightness also affects the quality of the image and the types of content that look best. Lots of projectors are bright, and they perform well for everyday TV watching and gaming. But a good home theater projector that you use primarily for watching movies in a dim or dark room needs to strike a balance between the brightness and the black level. A projector\u2019s ability to produce a dark black is crucial to good performance on movies, and many budget projectors fall short in this regard.\nTo judge color accuracy, we compare each projector\u2019s performance with reference standards set by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). If a display has accurate color, that means everything you see appears more realistic and natural \u2014 and more like what the filmmakers intended. Some projectors can\u2019t produce fully saturated colors, and they create yellows and reds that look dull next to the results from those projectors that can. Color temperature basically refers to the projector\u2019s color of white: Does the entire image look more blue, green, or red?\nSince numbers don\u2019t reveal the whole picture, we also do qualitative comparison testing by placing projectors next to each other and sending them the same signal using an HDMI splitter. Viewing the same image side by side with identical screen sizes makes it easy for us to see differences in black level, contrast, and color.\nTop pick: BenQ HT2060\nThe BenQ HT2060 is our favorite budget projector for home theater because it creates an image that\u2019s more realistic and lifelike than that of other projectors around the same price. It offers accurate color, good image contrast, and great detail, plus enough brightness for you to watch your favorite movies on a larger screen.\nThe HT2060 follows in the footsteps of the now-discontinued HT2050A, which was our top pick for several years. The new model retains what we liked about the HT2050A and improves upon it in certain respects, such as switching from a traditional bulb to a long-lasting LED light source.\nThe HT2060 has better contrast than similarly priced projectors. Although this projector is not as bright as some competitors that are geared more toward living-room use, in our tests it still had plenty of light output for illuminating our 100-inch Silver Ticket screen. We measured 830 lumens in the most accurate picture mode, called Filmmaker Mode (yes, that Filmmaker Mode), which is meant for dark-room viewing.\nWe got 946 lumens in the Living Room mode, which has a slightly bluer color temperature (the color of white) and more saturated color that helps it pop in a room with some lights on. Like most budget projectors we tested, this model also has a Bright picture mode that\u2019s even brighter (1,636 lumens), but it produces a very green color temperature \u2014 it\u2019s suitable for the occasional daytime sporting event, but you wouldn\u2019t want to watch movies in that mode.\nEven with its pleasing brightness, the HT2060 renders a respectably dark black level, and the result is better contrast than most budget projectors can muster. When watching movies in a dark room, we found that the HT2060\u2019s image looked richer, with more depth and color saturation. In our darkest Blu-ray demo scenes from Dune, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the HT2060 made blacks look actually black instead of gray.\nIn our measurements, this model produced a slightly deeper black level than its predecessor, but in real-world demos we found it hard to discern a difference. What we could discern was that the HT2060 did a better job of revealing the subtle shadings and fine details in dark backgrounds, which often get lost when a projector has a poor black level.\nThe real strength of the HT2060 lies in its color accuracy. The Filmmaker Mode measured within the desirable accuracy range in both its color temperature and its color points, no adjustment needed. This is where we saw the biggest improvement over other budget projectors, including the previous HT2050A. The older projector had pretty accurate color, but it required some fine-tuning of the picture controls on our part to get there, and its color temperature had a greenish tint in bright scenes to help it look a little brighter. The HT2060\u2019s output looks more neutral and natural, but as a result, it measures a little less bright than the HT2050A\u2019s output did.\nThe two HDMI inputs can accept 4K signals and can play HDR10 video content. Projectors generally don\u2019t handle HDR content as well as TVs do, mostly because they just aren\u2019t bright enough. But in our tests the HT2060 did a respectable job of showing HDR scenes from Dune, Pan, and Sicario without looking too dark or washed out.\nIt uses an LED light source instead of a bulb. That means you get instant on/off capabilities (no more waiting for a bulb to ramp up to full brightness) and roughly 20,000 to 30,000 hours of use, depending on the brightness mode, without having to buy replacement bulbs. This should save you some money over the life of the projector.\nThe HT2060 has physical lens adjustments. Many budget projectors lack lens adjustments such as physical zoom and lens-shifting dials, which help you properly position the image on your screen. Instead, these cheap projectors rely on digital zoom and keystone correction, which may seem user-friendly but can actually degrade picture quality. The more digital correction you apply to an image, the less clarity you get.\nThat\u2019s why we appreciate the HT2060\u2019s 1.3x zoom and vertical lens shift (10%). They give you at least a little wiggle room in where you can place the projector while maintaining an undistorted image. In addition, the HT2060 has three adjustable feet for you to further fine-tune the image height and positioning.\nThe design is living-room friendly. The HT2060\u2019s white cabinet is a little bigger and boxier than that of the HT2050A, but that design helps the built-in speaker sound fuller and louder. The fan noise is almost inaudible in the projector\u2019s eco (dimmer) brightness mode, and it\u2019s still pleasingly quiet in the normal mode.\nIn addition to two HDMI inputs, the connection panel has a powered USB port, which is useful for providing power to a streaming stick so you don\u2019t have to run a power cable to that add-on. You also get analog and digital audio outputs to connect an external speaker and an RS-232 control port to integrate the projector into an advanced control system. The remote control is fully backlit and has buttons for quickly accessing many picture adjustments, but it relies on IR control rather than Bluetooth.\nBecause the HT2060 has a 60 Hz refresh rate, it can\u2019t handle fast motion as smoothly and cleanly as a 120 Hz projector can. As a result, this model is generally fine for movie-watching, but gamers and sports enthusiasts may want to check out the affordable gaming projector we list in Other budget projectors worth considering \u2014 especially if you mostly enjoy those types of content with the room lights on. For gaming, we did measure a respectably low input lag of 16.3 milliseconds when the HT2060\u2019s \u201cfast mode\u201d was enabled.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe price fluctuates more than we\u2019d like. When we first tested the HT2060, its price was right at $1,000. It often sells for around $900, but right now it\u2019s up to $1,250 (the highest we\u2019ve seen it). This projector is still the best performer we\u2019ve tested at that price, but the value proposition isn\u2019t as clear.\nThe HT2060 produced some digital noise in mid to dark grays during our tests. It wasn\u2019t an ever-present noise \u2014 just in specific shades of gray here and there. The rest of the picture actually looked quite clean most of the time. And the effect wasn\u2019t evident from a viewing distance of 6 or more feet. So unless you like to sit very close to your screen, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nAlso, this budget model doesn\u2019t have an automatic iris that adjusts the image brightness based on the content being displayed, a feature that is commonly found on higher-end home theater projectors and can significantly improve the contrast ratio.\nThere are no smart features built in. A lot of budget-oriented projectors now include features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and built-in streaming apps. The HT2060 lacks those things, but that isn\u2019t a huge issue since you can add those functions through a good media streamer for less than $50.\nPlus, the projector\u2019s built-in speaker sounds respectably full and loud, and its inclusion of both analog and digital audio outputs lets you easily connect a variety of speakers.\nSome people are sensitive to the rainbow effect in DLP projectors. Single-chip DLP projectors like this one often use a spinning color wheel to create the image, and some people can see visible trails of color on the screen. Most people don\u2019t see it at all, but if you do, an LCD projector like the Epson EpiqVision Mini EF22 may be a better choice. (Learn more about the different types of projectors.)\nOther budget projectors worth considering\nIf you prefer an LCD projector, or if you want a small, smart projector for more casual use: While LCD projectors generally have better image contrast than DLP projectors in the higher price ranges, the reverse is usually true in the under-$1,300 realm. There aren\u2019t a lot of budget LCD options, and most of the ones we\u2019ve tested have had major issues. But Epson\u2019s EpiqVision Mini EF22 and EF21 are good performers that we\u2019re comfortable recommending for people who see DLP rainbow artifacts. These 1080p laser projectors have Google TV built in, they have a fairly small form factor with a quiet fan, and the speaker system is respectably robust.\nWe tested the EF22, which comes pre-mounted in a rotating, swiveling gimbal stand and is available in five colors. The EF22 did not compete with our top pick in overall brightness or black-level performance. Its measured contrast was less than half that of the HT2060, so it\u2019s not the best movie projector for a home theater. But it can get brighter than most of the small, smart projectors we\u2019ve tested in this price range. We measured over 1,100 lumens in the Dynamic picture mode, which isn\u2019t super color-accurate but is good enough for occasional brighter-room viewing. The EF22 had wonderfully accurate color in the Natural and Custom picture modes, and overall we found it to be a good choice for more casual, everyday TV and movie watching. It also doesn\u2019t suffer from light-spill issues, a common problem we see with smaller DLP projectors where the lens throws extraneous light outside the borders of the screen.\nThe EF21 is the same projector, but comes in fewer colors and omits the gimbal stand. Frankly, I didn\u2019t love the gimbal stand because the swiveling mechanism was too loose, so the projector can move out of position too easily. So the EF21 is the model I\u2019d buy.\nAnother small, smart projector we like is the Dangbei Atom. This DLP projector delivers a nice-looking image for casual TV watching on a modest-sized screen. Like the Epson projectors, this is a 1080p laser projector with Google TV and decent-sounding speakers. The Epson models are better performers overall, capable of a bit more brightness and displaying much more accurate color. But the Atom\u2019s image contrast is comparable, it delivers a very sharp picture, and it has an even smaller form. Plus it usually costs less.\nIf you want an affordable gaming projector: You won\u2019t find a great 4K HDR gaming projector for under $1,300, so we recommend that serious gamers check out our guide to the best 4K projector for better but more expensive options. We have encountered some solid 1080p HDR gaming projectors priced under $1,300, however. We tested the BenQ TH685P, which has a 120 Hz refresh rate, low input lag (listed at 8.3 ms for 120 Hz), and support for HDR10 and 4K signal input (downscaled to 1080p).\nThe TH685P has a claimed light output of 3,500 lumens; we measured a maximum of 2,812 lumens in the Bright picture mode, but that mode is highly inaccurate and looks pretty bad. In this model\u2019s better-looking picture modes like Cinema and Sports, this projector is only modestly brighter than our top pick, the HT2060, and it has performance issues \u2014 namely mediocre contrast, color, and black-level performance, plus noticeable light spill around the edges of the screen \u2014 that make it a poor choice for movie watching in a dark room.\nHowever, for gaming with some room lights on, the Living Room and Game picture modes offer respectable performance. The TH685P has two HDMI 2.0 inputs, plus a powered USB port, an analog audio input and output, and an RS-232 control port.\nWhat about even cheaper projector recommendations?\nWe\u2019ve tested a number of projectors that sell for under $600, and every one of them has had at least one big flaw that keeps it from being a good pick for a big-screen home theater, though it might be adequate for the occasional impromptu movie night. The better ones we\u2019ve tested seem to excel in one performance area but fall short in another. So if you decide to shop in this price range, you need to determine which performance issue you\u2019ll find least objectionable.\nFor instance, the Yaber K3 is one of the better low-priced projectors we\u2019ve tested in terms of image contrast, black level, and overall brightness. Its brightness is comparable to that of our top pick, and the image contrast is solid \u2014 so brighter TV and sports content can look pleasing. But its color performance is poor. It can reproduce only 76% of the HD color gamut (our recommended models come in above 90%); most of the color points measured far off their targets, the color temperature had a notably greenish-blue tint, and the gamma was way too light \u2014 which caused dark scenes to look overexposed. Plus the projector is quite bulky, the fan noise is somewhat loud, and positioning the image is trickier because the projected height is low (16 inches lower than that of our top pick). It does have Google TV built in, plus two HDMI inputs.\nThe Xming Page One has OK contrast when set up properly, as well as a deep black level and good image detail \u2014 but its light output is low, so it\u2019s only suited for a smaller screen and/or light-controlled room. It produces less than 60% of the HD color gamut, so the color just doesn\u2019t have much pop. But it is a small, quiet, smart projector with lots of features.\nOn the flip side, the Epson EpiqVision Flex CO-FH02 is extremely bright (we measured over 2,000 lumens) and wonderfully color-accurate in its Natural picture mode, but its black level and contrast are among the worst we\u2019ve measured. In our tests, the picture had good pop and detail when we watched sports or bright TV shows in a room with some light, but the minute we turned off the lights to watch a movie, the picture looked flat and washed out. The fan noise is loud, and the projector has only one HDMI input and no audio outputs (though it does offer a built-in speaker and Bluetooth support through the included Android TV stick). If you want a projector for daytime sports and gaming, this model is a solid choice, but we don\u2019t like it for movie watching.\nWhat to look forward to\nIn the past, our price limit for this guide has excluded 4K projectors from consideration, but we are seeing some 4K models priced around $1,300 or less. So there is more crossover between the best 1080p models and the most entry-level 4K models. Hisense recently introduced the M2 Pro, which uses a triple-laser light source with a claimed brightness of 1,300 lumens. It offers only digital image-placement tools (not physical lens adjustments) and runs Hisense\u2019s Vidda smart platform. We plan to test it, and hope to compare it with the Xgimi Horizon S Pro, which runs Android TV and has a claimed brightness of 1,800 lumens.\nThe competition\nHere are some recent and notable projectors we\u2019ve tested for this guide. If you don\u2019t see a certain model you\u2019re interested in, check out our running list of budget home theater projectors we\u2019ve tested.\nBenQ GP100A: This is a more lifestyle-oriented 1080p DLP projector that has a slightly smaller form factor than a traditional home-theater projector. It comes with an Android TV dongle and has a USB-C video/power input. Its performance is solid for casual TV watching, but it comes nowhere near the HT2060 in brightness or contrast. Color accuracy is good in the Cinema picture mode, but the black level is mediocre, and the picture adjustments are minimal. Plus, the Android TV dongle is locked into HDR mode for all content, and HDR measured darker than it should. The Epson EF22 and EF21 are better choices if you want a smaller, smart projector.\nThe Epson Home Cinema 2350 is billed as a 4K projector, but the pixel-shifting technology that this LCD projector uses actually delivers half the resolution of 4K \u2014 but double that of 1080p. We did not test the 2350, but other reviewers we trust have said that its contrast and black level represent a big step down from the BenQ HT2050A and HT2060, so it\u2019s not ideal for home theater use. It is very bright and has solid color accuracy, so it might be a good, affordable choice for more casual, everyday TV watching.\nThe LG PF610P is a small, smart DLP projector that delivers a nice-looking image for casual TV watching on a modest-sized screen. In our tests, its color accuracy and detail were excellent, but its contrast and black level were much worse than those of the BenQ HT2060 for movie watching \u2014 and it\u2019s simply not bright enough to use with a 100-inch or larger screen. Plus, the built-in speaker can\u2019t play very loud, and the built-in WebOS smart-TV platform lacks Netflix support. The Epson EF22 and EF21 are better choices if you want a smart projector.\nNebula\u2019s Cosmos 4K SE is one of the few smart 4K projectors on the market to cost around $1,300 (sometimes less). It runs Google TV, supports Dolby Vision HDR, and uses a hybrid laser/LED light source. But in our tests, the measured contrast was quite low, and the brightness and color accuracy were mediocre.\nThe Optoma HD146X is an older 1080p DLP projector that uses a lamp light source. It\u2019s very bright and has low input lag for gaming, but its native contrast is low \u2014 and the Dynamic Black function that\u2019s designed to improve the contrast makes darker scenes (especially skin tones) look unnatural. Plus it provides only 1.1x zoom and a single HDMI input.\nThe Optoma ML1080 uses a laser light source and has a petite form, but it's only rated at 550 ANSI lumens of brightness, which is much too dim for a home-theater projector. We tested it for our portable mini projector guide and found that, while it had very good measured contrast, the color accuracy was just average, and the 1080p pixel structure was more visible than on most competitors. Optoma also sells a more expensive short-throw version, the ML1080ST, that has the same specs.\nThe ViewSonic PX701-4K is an older DLP projector with a 4K resolution and a lamp light source. It\u2019s a decent overall performer, delivering a crisp, bright 4K picture. In our tests, the Game and Movie picture modes produced a pleasingly neutral color temperature (the color of white) right out of the box, but this projector was not as good as our top pick in black level and contrast, so movies looked somewhat flat by comparison. The bigger concern is that the colors look too dark and undersaturated by default. The PX701-4K uses DLP BrilliantColor technology to improve image brightness at the expense of color accuracy; you can turn the BrilliantColor function down or off to make colors look brighter and more accurate, but in the process you lose overall brightness and contrast. Also, ViewSonic omits features such as lens shift and optical zoom on this projector, which gives you less placement flexibility.\nThis article was edited by Grant Clauser.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "So what is the dreaded \u201cScreen Door Effect\u201d & why does it happen exactly? Have you ever taken a closer look at the images portrayed by a digital projector and see the tiny fine lines in between the pixels? What you can see with the naked eye are the pixel line spacing that lies within each unique pixel. It is a type of fixed-patten noice that is usually called by the tech community a \u201cscreen-door effect\u201d simply because it resembles the mesh screen you commonly find on screen doors.\nThe screen door is nothing new \u2014 it has appeared on LCD TV displays for years, and the older the monitor is you look at the more prominent the effect is. If you ever sat too close to the TV when you were younger you would have definitely noticed. With the advent of ULED and the newer TV\u2019s no longer have this effect due to upgraded technology and calibration, however the phenomenon has reoccured with the emergence of Virtual Reality headsets.\nWhy Does Screen-Door Effect Happen\nThe screen door effect happens when the digital images are scaled so big that you can see the space in between the LEDs. Whether that is caused by the lens or from being too close to the display. If you have ever looked at your phones screen or computer monitor through a magnifying glass you would be able to see a tiny grid of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), whether its an OLED or AMOLED display.\nIn order to see the screen-door effect in your VR headset you need to actively focus your eyes straight forward at the display screen itself. You then simply need to move your head around and the head-tracking technology will adjust the image to where you are looking while the LEDs remain stationary. This emits a grid of LEDs you are staring at all the more noticeable. You can notice it much more if you are actively trying to notice it. Some people will be more sensitive to the screen-door effect than others and cant help but find it distracting.\nThe screen-door effect should not be mistaken for anti-aliasing effects, which relates to game graphics specifically as they render smooth curves with square pixels. As mentioned previously, the VR screen-door effect occurs due to a combination of the headset lenses that are used to refract images as well as it being in such a close proximity to your eyes.\nEssentially you are dealing with a much smaller screen, magnified.\nSo this begs the question, should you be concerned about the screen-door effect having a negative impact on your VR experience? In our opinion it shouldn\u2019t matter too much. Most concerns about the screen-door effect have been raised over the past few years based on experience with early stage headsets like the Oculus Rift DK1/DK2. During this time it was much more noticeable and distracting for the end consumer, but as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift improved they have made it much less noticeable. And now with the HTC Vive Pro it has become almost a non-issue as it is almost completely unnoticed to the naked eye.\nEven though it has been greatly improved, it is still there the same way it is still there on TVs and smartphones screens, its just a little bit more noticeable because your eyes are so close to the screen. Fortunately it is not so distracting when you\u2019re in the head of the action slashing boxes in Beat Saber or shooting down aliens in Space Pirate Trainer.\nLike anything with VR you are dealing with a much smaller screen and its magnified via lenses and positioned mere inches from your face. As screen technology for Virtual Reality headsets improves we will see this dissipate more and more as advances and 4K resolutions become mainstay."
