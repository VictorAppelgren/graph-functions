  "description": "Jon McNeil, co-founder of DVx Ventures, says the fundamentals of building companies have changed in the post-AI era. The firm has developed an AI library to help early-stage startups overcome barriers. He speaks with Romaine Bostick and Vonnie Quinn on \u201cThe Close,\u201d explaining that DVx is deploying 80% less capital per company compared with two years ago. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Before we get into the specifics of your company, John, just talk to us about that. Is the US pursuing the right strategic approach when you see the likes of Deep Seek the likes of Ji Fu coming for the US launch? Well, I think you're raising a great question about open source models versus closed models, and that's beginning to shift in the US too. I grew up in a farming area of the US and if you can imagine, there's a farmer in town who just does his own thing and year after year is trying to get better at producing more yield out of his crops than you can imagine. The rest of the town all works together and every week they get together and they share ideas about about how to increase the yield of their farms. You would think that the group that they're sharing ideas every week is going to get faster and better than the one that's just pursuing it by themselves. And that's the argument for open source in the open source model. Large groups get together and they share ideas and they make the model much better, much faster. And I think you can see that in the U.S. there's a signal that not only media is onto this, but also open eye because they release their first open source models last week. So I think we're going to see the world move to a faster pace. And that faster pace probably will be built around open models versus closed models. Yeah, there's definitely long been a split and open air in particular, Right. We saw a couple of models, as you say, you know, last week. And it is interesting because when it came to the Internet, China was pretty closed and it censored and so on. But when it comes to AI and the building blocks that said, let's talk about your company a little bit, you know, where do you stand on sort of offering all of what you've developed for free? Well, I think, you know, our venture studio model was already on a path to return more than six X to our investors. But now we're supercharging that ourselves with A.I., and they were deploying 80% less capital per company compared to two years ago. And that's not because we're being cheap, but it's because the fundamental economics of building companies has changed. So we've crossed into what we call the post eight era in venture, and many VCs are still operating like it's 2021, raising massive funds and writing big checks. But if you can build the same company for 20% of the cost, our question is what does that do to the entire VC model? So we've rebuilt our approach from scratch around this reality. We've developed our own A.I. libraries to help early stage companies overcome the barriers that all early stage companies face. And it's literally reduced our cost of capital to get a company started to series A by 80%. So this, we think, is going to connect to something much bigger in venture as the as the path changes for how much capital early stage companies need. So, John, when you talk about AI tools and the idea that that they will be shared across some of your portfolio companies, are these tools that they're using internally to build out their own business or is this part of the actual product itself that they're producing? It's really to build out their own business remain. It's a great question. So I'll give you an example. One of the things that every early stage enterprise software company faces is access to their customers data. And the customer's data is often in a lot of different places, in a lot of different formats. And so that stretches the onboarding time and that increased costs for everybody. And I'm running time on average is 3 to 6 months in enterprise software. We challenged ourselves to see how can we get that down to 2 to 3 hours? And the only way that you can do that is with the Gen2 A.I., the kind of agents that can go out, gather the data right to the APIs and and then make the software workable. And so that's an example of one of the tools that we hand our new companies. Yeah, it can be deployed within each of our companies to help them get the cash faster. So forgive me, this is probably a dumb question, but if everyone is using the same tools, John, how do they differentiate themselves or does that not matter? I think we're differentiating the businesses based on what the business itself delivers. But in terms of the tools that help that business get up to speed faster, we feel like those can be common. Hmm. Yeah. I'm curious. What do you do beyond sort of automating things like, you know, filing stuff in Delaware or, you know, collecting customer information? So we're using not only to build the product faster and to deploy it faster and have faster onboarding. We're using A.I. tools to help market those products to help sell them, so develop the sales funnel and bring potential customers through that sales funnel. So it's it's really changed. The number of engineers we need per company has changed the number of sales and marketing people we need per company pretty dramatically. How does your business model work as a software, as a service? Is it a subscription model? Is it a one and done? It depends on the company. So we launch companies off of our platform. The companies are usually software as a service where it's a subscription or a consumption basis, and therefore it looks a lot like the kind of structures that business software buyers are used to. I am curious, John, when we get to this idea of sort of broader adoption of AI and not necessarily in the the beat sense that that has kind of engulfed the markets over the last couple of years. But the idea that a lot of people are now talking about more deployment with regards to services, more deployment with regards to some type of hardware or, you know, some sort of physical device of some sort here. When you try to look for the winners in that space, John, do you think they're going to be, I guess, the traditional players, the folks that have, I guess, been sort of leading the charge on AI for the last few years, or is it truly going to be newer companies made ones at least we may not have heard of? You might have heard of them, but the rest of us might still be oblivious to. I think you're going to be hearing a lot about newer companies. Some of the companies that we've heard about for the past few years are are building large foundation models, which requires enormous sums of cash just on a monthly basis. They've developed the models that now application companies are coming and developing specific applications, whether that be for sales, pharma, engineering, manufacturing, etc.. And some of those companies you've already started heard of, so you've started to hear about cursor, which is a coding a coding assistant that helps engineers generate code much faster at a higher quality than they've been able to in the past. That's an example of an application company that's built on a foundation model company. Anthropic is the engine that they largely use. And so I think you're going to see and hear more and more in this era about the application companies. They take far less capital to build because they're not building these huge models that require huge training budgets. And they're solving. And what we're trying to do is solve real world problems with these for the enterprise.",
