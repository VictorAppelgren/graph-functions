  "title": "This $7 Bluetooth speaker is cheaper than any other I've seen \u2013 so how does it hold up to the compeition?",
  "description": "A Bluetooth speaker for the price of a cup of coffee? What could possibly go wrong",
  "content": "Have you ever considered picking up a $7 / \u00a38.99 Bluetooth speaker? I\u2019ll admit I never have \u2013 partly because it never even occurred to me that such a thing even exists.\n\nBut, blow me down, I recently found that Amazon does offer exactly that, in the form of the super-budget WGO Bluetooth Speaker (although it\u2019s temporarily unavailable on the US site). So I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to pick one up and see how it compared to the competition: surely a speaker this cheap couldn\u2019t sound any good?\n\nTo be honest with you, I really was hoping I\u2019d hate the WGO Bluetooth Speaker. In part, that\u2019s because I\u2019m a journalist, and we\u2019re never happier than when we\u2019re trotting out sardonic hot takes over lukewarm coffee. But the much bigger factor is that, as an audiophile, one of my core beliefs is that if you want your music to sound good, you need to be prepared to put your money where your ears are \u2013 and if it turns out that you can get adequate sound quality from bargain-basement prices, it would upset my fragile worldview.\n\nSo I was a little put out when I discovered that the WGO Bluetooth Speaker is\u2026 you know, fine.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: it has clear sonic weaknesses that I absolutely wouldn\u2019t tolerate from any of the best Bluetooth speakers. But it costs just $7: I spend basically that much on my morning bagel. For that price, I was expecting it to sound overdriven or even blown. I was expecting constant dropouts. I was expecting the frequencies to be about as balanced as a tightrope walker with acute labyrinthitis. Instead, it was merely forgettable \u2013 faint praise that really isn\u2019t all that damning given the price point.\n\nStuck in the middle with the WGO Bluetooth Speaker\n\nWhen I first fired up the WGO, I\u2019ll admit I did wince a little. The bass doesn\u2019t so much pull its punches as curl up into a ball and wait for the referee to count it out. Listening to Music Matters (Axwell Remix) by Faithless, the usually punchy kickdrum sounded like someone swatting a squash ball against the wall \u2013 the low end seems to hurtle off a cliff more sheer than El Capitan. At the other end of the spectrum, hats also lack bite and clarity, although the shortfall wasn\u2019t quite as extreme as it was in the low end.\n\nAdmittedly, this sounds less than stellar. So why am I giving it such a charitable treatment? Because in the mid-range it somewhat redeems itself. Firing up Cirrus by Bonobo, so much of the track\u2019s definition sits in the mid-range with which the WGO seems most comfortable \u2013 the looping thumb pianos that drive a lot of the track felt crisp and forward, while the percussion still had room to shine.\n\nPlaying some of TechRadar\u2019s go-to testing tracks, I found the same is true of vocal-heavy mixes. For example, listening to Paul Simon\u2019s Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes, his voice soared clear of the mix, while the African percussion still punched through with sufficient precision. Yes, the bass guitar feels very indistinct, coming from far away like it\u2019s emanating from the bottom of a well but it\u2019s not entirely lacking in dynamism.\n\nWhile the WGO Bluetooth Speaker\u2019s sound isn\u2019t as rough as I was expecting, its design absolutely lived down to my expectations. It definitely feels like $7 worth of materials. Its grille is at least fashioned out of metal \u2013 although it\u2019s hardly the toughest I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2013 but the rest of its body is the kind of flimsy plastic I associate more with kids\u2019 toys than audio equipment. To the eye though, it looks a lot like the Anker Soundcore 2, so if you don't mind the lesser build quality, this is a good way to get that look for a lot less\n\nHonestly, if you remotely care about quality, you\u2019re not going to buy the WGO. While it\u2019s cheaper than anything else on the market by some margin, you can get so much more for not much extra investment. For example, the Tribit Xsound Plus 2 costs just $59.99 / \u00a359.99 and yet offers a broader frequency spread. Alternatively, if you\u2019re wanting the kind of bass thump the WGO just can\u2019t manage, the $79.95 / \u00a349.99 JBL Clip 5 is more likely to deliver the goods.\n\nBut there is a space in the market for a device like this, and it\u2019s not aimed at people like me. I remember being in my early teens \u2013 just about \u2013 and my two criteria in terms of speakers were A: portable and B: affordable with the \u00a315 / $12 I happened to have in my pocket. I wasn\u2019t worried about audio quality because I couldn\u2019t afford it; what I needed was sound that wasn\u2019t actively offensive but that I could pick up with my limited resources.\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely where the WGO Bluetooth Speaker sits. And I\u2019m kinda glad it\u2019s there for those that need it.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Need cheap earbuds right now?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Tribit Xsound Plus 2 is an impressive budget Bluetooth speaker that produces energetic, well-rounded sound. It makes the odd sonic misstep, but thanks to its flexible EQ options you can tailor your tunes to make the most of its capabilities. And while it\u2019s not the hardiest Bluetooth speaker ever, its IPX7 weatherproofing and seriously long battery life mean it\u2019s still a great option for pool parties or multi-day camping trips.\nPros\n- +\nTruly impressive sound for its price\n- +\nSupremely customizable 9-band EQ\n- +\nVery good battery life\nCons\n- -\nYou\u2019ll need the EQ to make some tracks shine\n- -\nFeels less sturdy than some rivals\n- -\nDesign is a bit conservative\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nTribit XSound Plus 2: Two-minute review\nThe Tribit XSound Plus 2 is an impressive Bluetooth speaker, especially given its modest price. Into its slight frame, Tribit has managed to squeeze two 15W, neodymium full-range drivers, as well as a battery that it says will last a healthy 24 hours. You also get IPX7 weatherproofing, which means it\u2019ll see off any splashes or showers, and Tribit\u2019s app offers nine-band EQ, enabling you to fully customize the sound. Not bad for $69.99 / \u00a363 (about AU$105).\nWhen it comes to performance, the Tribit Xsound Plus 2 isn\u2019t short of enthusiasm. It\u2019s able to produce a ridiculous amount of sound for a relatively small unit: it can happily fill a room with energetic, full-bodied sound, and doesn\u2019t skimp on detail just because you\u2019re sitting outside the sweet spot of its stereo field. And it can reach ear-splitting volumes if pushed: I\u2019d urge you to use caution when hitting that volume button, lest it upsets your neighbors or audiologist.\nBut it\u2019s not just a blunt instrument \u2013 it\u2019s capable of some surprisingly sophisticated sound for a speaker of the price. Producing decent, well-rounded and expressive mids, as well as pumping bass, it makes certain genres shine. However, higher frequencies don\u2019t fare quite as well as they do with some of the best Bluetooth speakers \u2013 these sometimes sound a little thin and fragile, and tracks that lean on a full, treble-heavy mix, can end up feeling a bit glassy.\nFortunately, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 has a secret weapon here. That nine-band EQ means you can tailor the sound it produces to suit your favorite songs and genres, create your own presets, and assign them to one of the three settings on the programmable EQ button atop the speaker. Given how much the sound profile of the speaker can vary though, any genre-hoppers among you might find yourselves needing to chop and change the EQ pretty regularly to ensure it keeps sounding its best.\nDesign-wise, the XSound Plus 2 is pretty conservative, with a matte-black plastic casing and slightly convex grille. Behind a rubber plug on its rear is a 3.5mm jack to use as a line-in, and a USB-C port for charging the device. There are buttons on the top for turning it on, activating pairing mode, changing the volume, playing, pausing and skipping music, changing EQ presets, and pairing with another Tribit speaker. It\u2019s maybe not quite as robustly built as rivals like the Ultimate Ears Boom 3, so bear that in mind if you\u2019re looking for something that can cope with a proper adventure out in the wilderness.\nAll things considered, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 can produce sound that its size and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 its price would belie. If you\u2019re willing to really ride the EQ settings, you can get a lot out of it for such an affordable speaker. But if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s a true jack \u2013 or, preferably, master \u2013 of all trades, you'll likely want to spend a bit more on something that has more range, like the JBL Flip 6, which you'll be able to rely on for great sound regardless of the genre you play.\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Price & release date\n- Released April 2024\n- Costs $69.99 / \u00a363 (about AU$105)\nReleased in April 2024, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 is available to buy in both the US and the UK, although it doesn\u2019t seem to be available in Australia at the time of writing.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt's priced at a very reasonable $69.99 / \u00a363 (around AU$105). Perhaps its closest rival at this size and spec is the JBL Flip 6, which costs $99.95 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$149.95; even Tribit\u2019s more pocket-sized Bluetooth speaker, the StormBox Micro 2, costs $59.99 / \u00a354 (about AU$90), making the XSound Plus 2 look like something of a bargain.\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Specs\n| Weight | 1.76lbs (798g) |\n| Dimensions | 7.81 x 2.62 x 2.76 inches (198.5 x 66.5 x 70mm) |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Battery life | 24 hours (at 60% volume with XBass off) |\n| Speaker drivers | 2x 15W neodymium full-range drivers |\n| Waterproof rating | IPX7 |\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Features\n- Supremely customizable 9-band EQ\n- Rock-solid Bluetooth connection with easy pairing\n- Epic battery life\nSurprisingly for a speaker of this price, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 has an impressive feature set. While you\u2019re not going to get top-of-the-range features like lossless audio Dolby Atmos, or fancy automatic room-correction algorithms, this speaker does offer plenty of attributes that rivals twice its price don't.\nAcross the top, a band of buttons allows you to control most aspects of the speaker. The power and pairing switches behave exactly how you\u2019d expect, while there's also a button to toggle between the three assignable EQ presets, and one to toggle Party Mode. There are also volume controls and the play button, which can be tapped once to play / pause, twice to skip forward, and thrice to skip back.\nFire up the Tribit app and not only does it allow you to toggle the speaker's auto-shutdown feature on and off, it gives you access to a pretty comprehensive EQ. This comes with six pre-programmed presets \u2013 XBass, XBass Off, Audiobook, MaxSound Traditional, Rock and Jazz \u2013 but also allows you to create your own profiles with its nine-band EQ. As a result, you can seriously customize the sound it produces, based on your tastes and the genre you\u2019re listening to.\nBy default you can quickly switch between XBass, XBass Off, and Audiobook mode using the physical EQ button on the speaker, with the light above it turning white, off, or blue respectively to indicate which mode you\u2019re in. But what if your tastes extend beyond just \u2018bassy\u2019, \u2018less bassy\u2019 and \u2018books\u2019? Then you\u2019re in luck: you can assign any of the presets, or your custom profiles, to each setting. Personally, as someone with absurdly eclectic tastes, I\u2019m a big fan of any speaker that allows me to quickly fire up dedicated sound profiles for witch house, UK drill, and psychobilly at the press of a button.\nThanks to the inclusion of Bluetooth 5.3, the XSound Plus 2 also has rock-solid connectivity. The connection can in theory extend as far as 150 feet and, while I rarely stretched it this far, it was able to cover the full 46-foot length of my apartment through walls without breaking a sweat. And the multi-device pairing that's built into more recent versions of Bluetooth meant it was always consistently quick to pair and swap between devices \u2013 you won\u2019t need to spend 10 minutes forgetting and repairing connections just to get the speaker to swap from your phone to your laptop.\nThis also means the XSound Plus 2 supports pairing with other Tribit speakers. Once it's paired with your phone, all you need to do is tap the TWS button on the right-hand side of the speaker and the two speakers form a stereo pair. Alternatively, if you\u2019re just looking to boost the volume for a larger space, you can press the TWS button on a stereo pair to switch the speakers into Party Mode, turning them into an ersatz multi-room setup.\nIf you throw particularly epic parties, perhaps the XSound Plus 2\u2019s most attractive feature is going to be its battery life, especially for such a small unit. Tribit claims it will last 24 hours at 60% volume, which is a life long enough to make Methuselah envious. Putting this to the test, I set it to play at that volume until it had dropped down from 100% to 60%, which took eight hours and 45 minutes \u2013 that means it should last almost 22 hours on a full charge. That\u2019s a little shy of what Tribit promises, but very few Bluetooth speakers are going to give you this much juice, especially for this kind of budget.\n- Features score: 4/5\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Sound quality\n- Seriously loud, room-filling sound\n- Punchy bass and warm mids\u2026\n- \u2026but you\u2019ll really need to ride the EQ to make some tracks shine\nThe Tribit XSound Plus 2 offers shockingly good sound considering its cost; both in terms of dynamics and how well rounded its lower frequencies are, it can hold its own against speakers twice its price. It's tuned to play to its strengths, and it smashes any music that matches its preferred sonic profile. Unfortunately, this also means it can rapidly come unstuck when served something outside its wheelhouse.\nDespite its relatively small footprint, it can pack a pretty decent punch when it comes to anything with dynamic bass, especially when you enable XBass. When I dropped Cirrus by Bonobo, I was genuinely impressed by how effortlessly the XSound Plus 2 was able to shift between the punchy kicks and the organic melodies of the kalimbas. The sound felt very cohesive, and while it didn\u2019t have quite the outrageous levels of bass that the more party-focused Bluetooth speakers can muster, the bass response was tight and well-integrated with the rest of the frequency range.\nBut there are definitely some compromises going on in order to enable such a cohesive, well-integrated sound. Listening to Paul Simon's vocals and Ladysmith Black Mambazo\u2019s choral hook during the intro of Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes feels like you\u2019re being immersed in honey and, when the drums kick in, they rise through the mix without overpowering it. However, I could detect some undeniable sharpness in the treble of elements like those jangly guitar chords, suggesting the XSound Plus 2 is less proficient when it comes to handling transients.\nSome songs clash with the XSound Plus 2\u2019s processing, coming off much worse. Initially, when I played Go Your Own Way by Fleetwood Mac, I was rather taken aback \u2013 it sounded tinnier than my hearing after a week-long festival. Both the high-mids and trebles sounded surprisingly brittle and, unlike with other genres, the band\u2019s leaner soft-rock sound didn\u2019t serve up enough bass to stop things from sounding seriously top-heavy. Playing the same song on the JBL Charge 5 really showed me what I was missing \u2013 the tom tom fills that were almost entirely neutered on the XSound Plus 2 added much more body. Clearly the cohesive sound the Tribit delivers while playing some genres means that certain frequencies are ducked and, to me, those low-mids seem to be one of the areas that are squeezed out.\nThis is where those EQ settings come in handy. When I flipped the XSound Plus 2 to its rock setting, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s breakup anthem sounded much more like the song I recognized \u2013 the treble had a bit more oomph across the spectrum, while the bass was less subby, prioritizing the register of those toms and bass kicks. And finding the right setting can make other tracks shine too: Kamasi Washington\u2019s Clair de Lune already sounded solid, but when I popped it into jazz mode, it gave due deference to that double bass, while giving more timbral depth to rest of the instruments, particularly that sultry trombone solo.\nUltimately, though, there isn\u2019t any set-it-and-forget-it EQ setting that shows all tracks off in their best light. That may be less of an issue if you tend to only listen to one or two specific genres, but if you have diverse tastes or chop and change a lot, you may find yourself having to pull out the app more often than you\u2019d like to ensure you\u2019re getting the absolute best sound for your favorite tunes.\nGiven that it only has two forward-facing drivers, I\u2019ll admit I was a little skeptical about the kind of presence that the XSound Plus 2 could deliver. But blow me down: it\u2019s actually a solid little performer when it comes to soundstage. Naturally, it\u2019s very much a point source of sound, but I tried sitting with it at a range of angles, and I didn\u2019t find that the audio suffered when I was outside of the optimum stereo field. Even with the speaker pointing directly away from me, the treble didn\u2019t significantly diminish, so when you have guests round they won\u2019t all be jostling for the one seat from which they can actually hear the tunes playing.\nAnd it\u2019s just absurdly loud when you push it. Not only could it happily fill my living room with sound \u2013 which is no small feat given that I have cavernously high ceilings \u2013 but while running the above battery test at 60% volume in our offices, I could still hear it two rooms away despite the fact that it was wrapped in a jumper, stuffed in my rucksack, and in a room with acoustic damping on the walls. Inevitably, there\u2019s a fair amount of distortion when you really crank it up to its eardrum-melting maximum, but you\u2019re never going to be left wanting when it comes to sheer volume.\n- Sound quality score: 3.5/5\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Design\n- Pleasant (if slightly anodyne) matte plastic finish\n- IPX7 rating protects it from rain and puddles\n- Lanyard feels a bit flimsy for a speaker of this weight\nAll told, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 is a likeable enough package. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it\u2019s not an objet d\u2019art, but equally it doesn\u2019t look conspicuously cheap. It\u2019s far from the most flamboyantly hued Bluetooth speaker ever: your choices here are black or\u2026 erm\u2026 black. But plenty of brands offer brightly colored speakers; the XSound Plus 2 is clearly aiming for a subtler aesthetic, and I\u2019d say it nails it.\nIts body is made of a matte-black plastic that feels pleasingly soft to the touch, while the round curves on its rear make it comfortable to grasp in a single hand. On the front of the device, the drivers are covered by a convex metal grille, which is a bit more visually distinguishable than the cloth-covered cylinders that seem pretty much ubiquitous these day. If there\u2019s any speaker the Tribit resembles, it's the Beats Pill, but less rounded overall.\nIf you\u2019re wanting to take the Tribit XSound Plus 2 into the great outdoors, it will easily be able to handle the elements. Thanks to its IPX7 rating, it should be able to cope with being dunked in water up to 3ft / 1m for up to 30 minutes, which means it\u2019ll shrug off splashes with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever. But, beyond this, it\u2019s probably not as hardy as some of its rivals: it\u2019s not been tested for dust and grit ingress, and I\u2019d argue its relatively dainty build won\u2019t handle accidental drops quite as well as more robust portable speakers on the market.\nAnd that last point really makes me question one design choice. The XSound Plus 2 comes with a lanyard on one end that allows you to wrap it around a wrist or attach it to a backpack, but it feels pretty flimsy, especially given the speaker\u2019s 1.76lbs / 0.8kg weight \u2013 leaving it dangling and pirouetting around at the end of this string felt like I was hanging a $70 speaker from a 50\u00a2 cord. Fortunately, it\u2019s easy enough to hold in a single hand or stick in a pocket that I never really needed to trust the Tribit to this tenuous lifeline.\n- Design score: 4/5\nTribit XSound Plus 2 review: Value\n- Produces sound almost as good as speakers twice its price\n- Offers a broader range of features than many budget rivals\n- IPX7 weatherproofing make it a wise purchase for outdoor use\nWith the Tribit XSound Plus 2, you\u2019re getting a lot of speaker for not very much money. The features it offers exceed what I\u2019d expect for a speaker at this price. Sure, you\u2019re not getting cutting-edge features like lossless audio or Dolby Atmos, but its EQ settings are super-customizable, and the ability to network multiple speakers together should give you a much more impressive soundstage than you\u2019d get from one single $140 / \u00a3130 / AU$200 speaker.\nAnd design-wise, its utilitarian looks are still pleasing enough, while that IPX7 rating will shrug off most of what the great outdoors can throw at it, making it a wise purchase for anyone looking for a cheap, durable speaker to take trekking or camping.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s hardly the most neutral listen, and this does cause some inconsistencies, depending on what you\u2019re listening to. In comparison, the similarly sized JBL Flip 6 offers superior sound \u2013 but it also costs more than double the price. So in terms of bang for your buck, you\u2019re getting a pretty sweet deal here.\n- Value score: 4.5/5\nShould you buy the Tribit XSound Plus 2?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Features | A great variety of features, especially that 9-band EQ. And its battery life is epic. | 4/5 |\n| Sound quality | Sounds better than it has a right to at this price\u2026 but you\u2019ll absolutely need that EQ to make every genre sound its best. | 3.5/5 |\n| Design | It\u2019s not going to set the design world alight but it\u2019s a well-made package, with the weather-proofing and a solid-enough build to take the odd knock here and there. | 4/5 |\n| Value | You\u2019re not going to find sound and features this good without paying at least twice as much \u2013 an absolute bargain. | 4.5/5 |\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou want energetic, bassy sound for little cash\nGiven its modest price, the Tribit XSound Plus 2 is capable of some truly punchy presence and serious volume.\nYou need a speaker that will last for days\nWith a battery that can last 22 hours according to our testing, the Tribit should last multiple days of a camp-out, or one truly epic outdoor party.\nDon't buy it if\u2026\nYou prefer neutral, one-size-fits-all sound\nNot every track is shown off to its full potential, unless you\u2019re willing to spend a lot of time tinkering with the EQ. If you want true set-it-and-forget it sound, it\u2019s worth looking elsewhere.\nYou want something that can take anything you throw at it\nWhile the XSound Plus 2\u2019s IPX7 rating means it\u2019ll happily shrug off wet weather, the lack of dust-ingress protection and its relative dainty build means it might not handle the beach or being dropped all that well.\nTribit Xsound Plus 2 review: Also consider\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Tribit Xsound Plus 2 | JBL Flip 6 | Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $69.99 / \u00a363 (around AU$105) | $99.95 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$149.95 | $59.99 / \u00a354.00 / AU$98.12 |\n| Weight | 1.76lbs / 798g | 1.21lb / 550g | 11.2oz / 315g |\n| Dimensions | 7.81 x 2.62 x 2.76 inches / 198.5 x 66.5 x 70mm | 7 x 2.6 x 2.8 inches / 178 x 68 x 72mm | 3.93 x 3.93 x 1.69 inches / 99.8 x 99.8 x 42.9mm |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3 | Bluetooth 5.1 | Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Battery life | 24 hours (at 60% volume with XBass off) | 12 hours | 12 hours |\n| Speaker drivers | 2x 15W neodymium full-range drivers | racetrack-shaped woofer, tweeter, passive bass radiators | 10W 48mm driver |\n| Waterproof rating | IPX7 | IP67 | IP67 |\nJBL Flip 6\nNot only is the JBL Flip 6 lighter than the Tribit XSound Plus 2 but, thanks to those passive radiators it has at either end, it also offers a little more balance and a lot more bass. It also rocks a little more of JBL\u2019s trademark style, coming in a range of colors, and has IP67 dustproofing and waterproofing, making it a better partner for days at the beach. If you want to know more, check out our full JBL Flip 6 review.\nTribit Stormbox Micro 2\nThe Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 does require you make a few compromises. It only offers 10W of amplification, compared to the XSound Plus 2\u2019s 30W, and its claimed battery life is just half of its bigger sibling's. But in return, you get a much lighter speaker that also offers IP67 weatherproofing. Check out our full Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 review.\nHow I tested the Tribit Xsound Plus 2\n- I tested for two weeks, and I tested it against the JBL Charge 5\n- I used it in the office and at home\n- listened to Spotify, Apple Music and Pocket Casts on an iPhone 13 Pro and a MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019)\nI tested the Tribit XSound Plus 2 over the course of two weeks. Not only did I listen to a wide range of different genres and styles on it, but I also tested it using TechRadar\u2019s reference playlist, which helped me assess the speaker\u2019s full range and how it handled specific frequencies.\nAs well as connecting the XSound Plus 2 to multiple devices, including my iPhone 13 Pro and my MacBook Pro, I also directly compared how it performed relative to the JBL Charge 5, testing each speaker side by side. To test the speaker\u2019s battery life, I set it to play continuously at 60% volume, and measured the battery drop over time.\nI\u2019ve been reviewing gadgets and technology for nearly 10 years, particularly headphones, speakers, and music hardware. I also regularly produce audio and music in my spare time, giving me a strong understanding of sound dynamics and frequencies.\n- First reviewed: June 2024\nJosh is Reviews Editor at TechRadar.

Aber eigentlich 'ne sch\u00f6ne Idee, die Dinger haben heutzutage ja alle keinen Radioempfang, aber daf\u00fcr BT, damit stehen einem \u00fcber's Handy ja die Welten der Internetradios offen! Und die der eigenen Musik auf dem Handy.\nSo, und dann kam \"Prime-Day\" und damit auch dieses Ger\u00e4t zu mir.\nAnforderung war: nicht zu gro\u00df (wegen Koffer/Rucksack), stabil, gut bedienbar und ertr\u00e4gliche Mucke.\nUnd da isser, der Tribit XSound Plus2! Macht alles genauso, wie er soll; ist tatas\u00e4chlich handschmeichlerisch klein und geformt, trotz des erstaunlich hohen Gewichts von 600 Gramm gut zu tragen und bewegen, auch mit Trageschlaufe.\nDazu gibt's 'ne APP, die diverse EQs, diverse preset und einer benutzerdefiniert, eine Lautst\u00e4rkeregelung und diversen ander Einstellungen bietet. Nat\u00fcrlich nur neben den Tasten auf dem Geh\u00e4use, mit denen man auch alles erledigen kann.\nDas was rauskommt ist wirklich gut anzuh\u00f6ren, was auch die baE zu einem erstaunten Ausruf animierte: \"Oh, das klingt aber ganz gut!\". Ja tut's. Ich z.B. h\u00f6re gerade \u00fcber mein Handy Musik von meinem Streamer und es ist wirklich anh\u00f6rbar. Nicht nur ein mieser Notbehelf. Andereseits ist das bei der verf\u00fcgberen Technik (BT-Modul, Chip-Amp, kleine LS und DSP) auch zu erwarten. Hier gibts auch scheinbar tats\u00e4chlich noch nen kleinen Subwoofer.\nOb die 24 Stunden Akkuhaltbarkeit (bei 60% Lautst\u00e4rke und X-Bass aus) erreicht werden, wird sich noch zeigen. Andererseits wird das Dingen ja \u00fcber USB geladen (z.B. mit dem mitgelieferten Kabel), und ein Hady-Ladeger\u00e4t ist ja immer in Reichweite...\nFazit: ein Ger\u00e4t, das klarmacht, was f\u00fcr wenig Geld machbar ist. Klingt gut, fasst sich gut an, scheint gut verarbeitet zu sein und macht alles in allem einen echt guten Eindruck. Demn\u00e4chst geht's auf die erste Urlaubsreise zum bew\u00e4hren.\nDer Kunde ist einstweilen ausserordentlich zufrieden und verteilt daher alle f\u00fcnf verf\u00fcgbaren Punkte.\nWer die gleichen Anforderungen hat (klein, gut anzuh\u00f6ren, praktisch im Umgang), dem sei diese Ger\u00e4t empfohlen.\n-\nRnoooGranskad i Frankrike den 19 maj 2025\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor Super rapport qualit\u00e9 prix\nDes basses profondes, des aigus clairs, tr\u00e8s bonne surprise.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nDespite being pint-sized, this speaker really can blast out the tunes. The level of detail and punchy bass impressed, though the treble could sound strained at over 50% volume. Some great features include the adjustable EQ, Auracast connectivity, IP67 rating, and convenient carabiner, making it an ideal outdoor speaker.\nPros\n- +\nGreat detail\n- +\nIP67 waterproof and dustproof\n- +\nImpressive volume and bass\nCons\n- -\nYou can\u2019t stand it on its base\n- -\nOnly 3 EQ presets\n- -\nTreble trouble when using preset EQs\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe JBL Clip 5 is reasonably priced at $79.95 / \u00a359.99 / AU$89.95 and is available in the US, the UK, and Australia. Considering that the JBL Go 4 costs $49.95 / \u00a339.99 / AU$59.95, if your budget can stretch to the JBL Clip 5 the extra investment will return big gains in sound quality and volume levels.\nFrom minute one I was impressed with what this compact Bluetooth speaker had to offer. The Clip 5 is a satisfying mix of durability, practicality, and enjoyable sound in a small package. Is it one of the best Bluetooth speakers around? All in good time.\nThe JBL Clip 5 is covered in woven fabric on the front and back, with a silicone mid-section. It has a large plastic carabiner on the top that's easy to open and clip onto things. I\u2019ve had it hanging from door handles, the bathroom mirror, and shelving units amongst other places, and could easily change up its position to allow for the best listening experience.\nThere are silicone strips on the back of the speaker body for added stability when the speaker is placed face-up on a surface, and the JBL logo on the front of the speaker is also made from silicone. Above the logo are the play/pause button and the volume up and volume down buttons. These have icons that represent the respective functions \u2013 so, a triangular 'play' icon, and plus and minus signs \u2013 and I found them satisfying to press. Within the silicone area on the left-hand side of the speaker sit the power, Bluetooth and Auracast buttons.\nThis pint-sized speaker measures just 3.4 x 5.3 x 1.8 inches / 86 x 134.5 x 46mm, but at 10 ounces / 285g, it feels a little heavy for its size. It\u2019s a shame that it's only possible to hang the Clip 5 or lie it on its back; there was many an occasion when it would have been more convenient to stand it on its base, but its pebble-like shape makes it unstable.\nThe speaker has IP67 water and dust protection, meaning I wasn\u2019t limited to where I could listen to tunes. It quickly became my favorite bath-time companion, and the steam was no issue for it. We also did a dunk test in the TechRadar testing tank, after which the Clip 5 continued to function quite happily, so whether you want to listen to tunes on the beach or do karaoke in the shower, it looks like this speaker can handle it. JBL has adopted a sustainable approach with the Clip 5 by incorporating some post-consumer recycled materials in the design. Great stuff.\nIf you\u2019ve read my JBL Go 4 versus feature, you\u2019ll already know I\u2019m a fan of the JBL Portable app's user-friendly interface. It has an attractive, easy-to-use design that makes it a snap to view the battery level, use Stereo Group mode to play in stereo from two speakers, or use the PartyTogether mode to add other JBL speakers into the mix for amped-up sound.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFurther features on the app include PlaytimeBoost, which is designed to boost the volume of the music without consuming more battery power, a Product Information section, and an EQ settings section. There are four equalizer profile presets: JBL Signature, Chill, Energetic, and Vocal, as well as a customizable EQ profile.\nI tested out the Clip 5\u2019s Auracast capabilities by connecting it with a JBL Xtreme 4 and Go 4 speaker. The connection process was easy thanks to PartyTogether mode, and the resulting surround sound effect was impressive. I must admit that my colleague, audio expert Harry Padoan, and I couldn\u2019t help but bop along to the tunes in our music testing room.\nThe battery is said to last up to 12 hours on the JBL website. When I tested it by playing our TechRadar testing playlist non-stop at 50% volume, it lasted just under eleven-and-a-half hours, which isn\u2019t bad considering how obnoxiously loud the Clip 5 is when playing at this volume level.\nThe sound quality of the JBL Clip 5 is pretty impressive considering its size and price. It\u2019s capable of some surprisingly deep bass and delivers this without losing the detail, even when just using the default JBL Signature EQ setting.\nWhen I laid the speaker down, I could feel the bass pounding through the surface it was on. Not only was the bass impactful and dynamic in tracks like Black Eye by Allie X, but it also delivered low-frequency bass impressively well when I listened to Angel by Massive Attack.\nUnfortunately, there was a shortcoming that became apparent when listening to Black Eye. The vocals came across slightly strained and overpowering when listening to the track at 75% volume. They were brought more into proportion when the volume was reduced to 50%; the bass continued to bounce dynamically across the track, and I could still hear the detail in the vocals. I changed to the Energetic EQ preset to see if this made any improvements. While it did what it said on the tin and added some energy to the instrumental element of the track, the vocals continued to have a sharp edge to them. As was also the case with the JBL Go 4, changing over to the Vocal EQ preset just results in all the elements sounding distorted, as if they were recorded underwater.\nWhen listening to Hit the Road Jack by 2WEI and Bri Bryant, the delivery was satisfyingly atmospheric and immersive considering the size of the Clip 5. The different elements layered together well. The bass was dramatic and impactful, and I could hear the finer details in the background of the track as the beat was building up.\nCheaper speakers can struggle with the treble and intensity of some vocal sections on this track, making them sound tinny and strained. The Clip 5 handled it well, but the tinniness did appear at around 75% volume, which seemed to be a running theme when I listened to various tracks. The song Boom Boom by the same artists sounded good at 75%, with plenty of detail and drama, but the highs again began to feel a little harsh; at 50% volume, everything blended together a bit better. So this definitely wouldn\u2019t make a replacement for a party speaker if you wanted to blast out the tunes at a get-together.\nAdagio Per Archi E Organo In Sol Minore by the London Philharmonic Orchestra was a satisfying listen with this speaker; there was a clear distinction between the different notes and instruments, but a slightly tinny edge to the sounds of the organ. This will likely only be noticed by audiophiles who are scrutinizing the sound quality, however. I don\u2019t imagine anyone expects perfection at this price point but, actually, outside of the treble troubles, the Clip 5 is certainly reaching for it.\nAnother enjoyable listen was I Believe in a Thing Called Love by The Darkness. The guitar and vocals sounded great, and everything was well-proportioned. I could easily hear the detail and depth in Justin\u2019s voice, and the instruments layered together well, with nothing stepping out of line or trying to steal the limelight when it shouldn\u2019t have been.\nThe difference between the sound quality of the Clip 5 and the cheaper JBL Go 4 is certainly noticeable. While there is of course a $30 price difference to consider, I'd say it\u2019s worth it if you want deeper bass and the ability to blast out some tunes without lugging about a bigger speaker \u2013 though there's naturally some sacrifice when it comes to sound quality at the higher end of the volume scale.\nIf you're still undecided whether the JBL Clip 5 covers all your bases, we\u2019ve curated a list of the best Bluetooth speakers with alternatives suitable for varied budgets and requirements. We also keep track of the best cheap Bluetooth speaker deals, so it's worth checking back now and then to see if there\u2019s money to be saved.\nJBL Clip 5 review: Price & release date\n- List price: $79.95 / \u00a359.99 / AU$89.95\n- Available now in the US, UK, and Australia\nThe JBL Clip 5 was released in June 2024 and is one of JBL\u2019s first speakers to include Auracast capabilities, along with the Xtreme 4 and Go 4. It\u2019s available directly from the JBL website in the US, UK, and Australia for $79.95 / \u00a359.99 / AU$89.95.\nJBL Clip 5 review: Specs\n| Drivers | Integrated class D digital amplifiers x 1 |\n| Dimensions | 3.4 x 5.3 x 1.8 inches / 86 x 134.5 x 46 mm |\n| Weight | 10 ounces / 285g |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C (charging) |\n| Battery life (quoted) | Up to 12 hours |\n| Waterproof rating | IP67 |\n| App available | Yes |\nShould I buy the JBL Clip 5?\n| Section | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Features | The JBL Portable app is simple and enjoyable to use, and the Auracast function worked well across three different JBL speakers. This speaker really blasts out the tunes at 50% volume, so a battery life of just under eleven and a half hours didn\u2019t disappoint. | 4/5 |\n| Sound quality | Can struggle with treble at higher volumes, coming through with a sharp, tinny edge, but mids and bass have no problem. The amount of detail on offer, even when the bass is thumping, is impressive. | 4.5/5 |\n| Design | The carabiner makes for a useful design feature, plus the range of colors available and the IP67 rating make it all the more attractive. It is let down slightly by its old-school appearance and its inability to stand on its base though. | 4/5 |\n| Value | The fact that this compact, IP67-rated, punchy, and portable speaker costs less than $80 leaves no room for doubt, this speaker is definitely good value for money. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want big sound from a small package\nFor a speaker roughly the height of a soda can, it certainly packs a punch. You\u2019ll have no problem using this to blast out tunes at a gathering, especially if you use the Stereo Group feature on the app, too.\nYou want an easy-to-attach design\nThe large built-in carabiner that extends from the top of the speaker body is really efficient and can be easily attached to other objects so you can position it for the best listening experience.\nYou want a durably designed speaker\nWith its IP67 rating, this speaker can survive water and dust exposure. We went as far as dunking it in a tank of water to ensure the claims were true and can confirm it continued to operate with no problems.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou don\u2019t want to keep faffing with EQ\nThis speaker can struggle to deliver good-quality treble, but this issue could be remedied by creating a custom EQ. It can be time-consuming to switch back and forth if you regularly listen to a variety of music types, however.\nYou want a stand-up speaker\nWhile you can lie the Clip 5 on its back, the best sound is achieved when the speaker is facing towards you. This means you need somewhere to hang it, as it can't be stood up on the curved base, which can be frustrating.\nYou want EQ presets to match a range of content\nWhile the customizable EQ is a big plus in my book, there are only three presets to choose from if you don\u2019t want to attempt to fine-tune the EQ yourself.\nJBL Clip 5 review: Also consider\n| JBL Clip 5 | Tribit XSound Plus 2 | Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 3 | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $79.95 / \u00a359.99 / $89.95 | $69.99 / \u00a363 (about AU$105) | $99.99 / \u00a389.99 / AU$149 |\n| Weight | 10 ounces / 285g | 1.76lbs / 798g | 14.8oz / 420g |\n| Dimensions | 3.4 x 5.3 x 1.8 inches / 86 x 134.5 x 46 mm | 7.81 x 2.62 x 2.76 inches / 198.5 x 66.5 x 70mm | 4 x 3.75 x 3.75 in / 104 x 95.3 x 95.3 mm |\n| Drivers | Integrated class D digital amplifiers x 1, Passive bass radiator | 2x 15W neodymium full-range drivers | 2x 40mm active drivers, 2x 46.1mm x 65.2mm passive radiators |\n| Battery life (quoted) | Up to 12 hours | 24 hours | 14 hours |\n| Waterproof rating | IP67 | IPX7 | IP67 |\nTribit XSound Plus 2\nIf you want more opportunity to fine-tune the sound without changing the custom settings each time, the XSound Plus 2 has six pre-programmed presets: XBass, XBass Off, Audiobook, MaxSound, Traditional, Rock and Jazz. You can create custom profiles too with its nine-band EQ. There\u2019s also a staggering 24 hours of playtime on offer from this speaker. If you'd like to hear more, read our full Tribit XSound Plus 2 review.\nUltimate Ears Wonderboom 3\nIf you\u2019re a fan of playing the DJ when you\u2019re out with friends, the Wonderboom 3 has Outdoors Mode, which changes the EQ to a sound profile tailored to listening to tunes outside. This is further helped by the 360-degree sound, so no matter your position around the speaker you still get the full experience. To learn more, check out our full Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 3 review.\nHow I tested the JBL Clip 5\n- I tested the speaker over several months\n- I listened to a variety of music genres and podcasts\n- I played music continuously to determine battery usage\nI tested the JBL Clip 5 over a few months. I listened to a variety of music genres, as well as the TechRadar testing playlist that includes tracks ranging from complex and layered instrumentals to deep bass and delicate vocals. This enabled me to determine the speaker's ability to handle different frequencies.\nI played our TechRadar playlist on Tidal continuously at 50% volume using the default JBL signature EQ preset to test whether the battery could last up to 12 hours.\nI used it to listen to music and podcasts in the TechRadar office, our music testing room, and at home, using Spotify and Tidal from an iPhone 12 Pro and a OnePlus Pad Go.\n- First reviewed: July 2024\n- Read TechRadar's Reviews Guarantee\nCesci is a Reviews Staff Writer for TechRadar.

      "text": "A cheap Prime Day Bluetooth speaker deal is proving popular \u2013 but I\u2019d recommend you spend a tiny bit more on this one from a more reliable brand\nPrime Day is almost over?! Oh no! And apparently, a lot of people are flocking to buy this Bluetooth speaker for $19.99 (was $26.99) at Amazon US.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Anker SoundCore 2 offers a ton of features for the price like water resistance, great battery life and a rugged body. While its sound quality leaves something to to be desired, it\u2019s hard to think of a better speaker for under $50/\u00a350.\nPros\n- +\nExtremely affordable\n- +\nWater resistant\n- +\n24-hour battery life\nCons\n- -\nAverage sound quality\n- -\nAnemic bass\n- -\nNot loud enough outdoors\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe Anker SoundCore 2 is part of the wave of Bluetooth speakers that are cheap and rugged enough that anyone can afford to upgrade their phone-speaker sound without breaking the bank.\nFor around $50 (\u00a346, about AU$63), the SoundCore 2 gives you a staggering 24 hours of battery life, a ruggedized and water resistant body, and much better sound than your phone\u2019s speaker. While it doesn't quite hold against the best waterproof speakers in terms of audio performance, you'll have to pay more to get better sound \u2013 the Anker SoundCore 2 is incredible value for the price if you want to stick with a cheaper model.\nDesign\nAnker won\u2019t win any accolades for the SoundCore 2\u2019s design; it\u2019s a generic-looking black bar with power, playback, pairing and volume controls on the top.\nOn the front of the speaker you\u2019ll find a black metal grille which obscures two 6-watt drivers. On the side you\u2019ll find a water resistant flap that protects the microUSB charging port and 3.5mm aux port for use with older devices.\nThe body of the Anker SoundCore 2 is coated in a grippy matte black rubber, which is nice to the touch but quickly shows fingerprints.\nBuild quality is excellent and it\u2019s nice to know that its rugged body and water resistant design can withstand the abuse of being outdoors. Just be sure to keep in mind that the SoundCore 2 is only IPX5 water resistant, which means it\u2019ll survive splashes but can\u2019t be dunked into a pool like the UE Wonderboom.\nIn terms of size, the Anker SoundCore 2 measures in at 165mm x 54mm x 45mm, which makes it small enough to toss into a bag without fear of it breaking and not too large that it takes up a ton of space. Its bar-shape makes it easy to transport and it\u2019s light enough that you won\u2019t mind taking it with you.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPerformance\nSound quality of the Anker SoundCore 2 is average, though miles better than playing music from your smartphone speaker. While sound quality is nicely balanced, bass sounds anemic at times with electronic dance music and hip-hop. Highs are good but exhibit distortion when the volume is pushed.\nSpeaking of volume, the Anker SoundCore 2 doesn\u2019t get quite loud enough for our tastes. The speaker sounds plenty loud listening in a quiet room but once it has to compete with ambient noises, you\u2019ll quickly find the SoundCore 2\u2019s volume limit. We compared the Anker with the UE Wonderboom and found the UE destroyed it when it came to max volume and distortion.\nCompared to similarly sized speakers, the Anker SoundCore 2 sounds strained, like its amp isn\u2019t powerful enough to drive its speakers. In insolation, the SoundCore 2 sounds quite good but bass lovers will be wanting more.\nBattery life is an incredible 24 hours, which is much longer than much of the competition. For example, the UE Wonderboom only lasts 10 hours and the Bose SoundLink Color 2 lasts just 8 hours.\nThe Anker SoundCore 2 also has the ability to take calls and be used with voice assistants like Siri and Google. Simply press and hold the play/pause button to activate your phone\u2019s assistant. Calls came through loud and clear while using the SoundCore 2, with the other party reporting good voice quality.\nVerdict\nFor around $50 (\u00a346, about AU$63) \u2013 currently $33.59 at the time of this writing, the Anker SoundCore 2 is an excellent entry-level Bluetooth speaker. We loved it for its 24-hour battery life, rugged build quality, and water resistance.\nWhile its sound quality leaves something to be desired in the power and clarity departments, it will please most people. It's loud enough to fill a small room, but will struggle to be heard on a noisy beach or street. This is to be expected from such a compact speaker with stellar battery life but it's a trade-off nonetheless.\nThose who want 360-degree audio, waterproofing, and better sound should look at the UE Wonderboom. Bass lovers should check out the JBL Charge 3, which is much larger but lasts just as long as the Anker.\nYou can save money when purchasing Anker products with our Anker promo codes.\n- Not sold on the SoundCore 2?

      "text": "I tested these $5 wired earbuds and they sounded better than expected \u2013 but I still wouldn\u2019t recommend them\nCheap, but only a little bit cheerful\nIt was just a typical Wednesday. I logged onto my work laptop, threw on my headphones and got typing about the flashy new tech I\u2019d been testing. Everything was going great. That was until I received a message from our Audio Editor Becky, asking if I\u2019d like to try some $5 earbuds\u2026and a chill ran down my spine.\nOK, I\u2019m exaggerating (for dramatic effect), but if I told you I was excited to try the sub-$5 / \u00a35 ZJXD wired earbuds, I\u2019d be lying to you. See, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to try out some of the best wired earbuds around, as well as some of the best wireless earbuds and best headphones too.\nTesting an almost impossibly cheap pair of wired buds, then, did raise a lot of questions for me. Are they going to sound super-tinny? Will audio just sound super distorted? Will they even work properly? Wanna find out? Well, here\u2019s what I made of these mightily cheap in-ears.\nFunctional, yet considerably restricted audio\nOK, so do you want to know what\u2019s crazy? For less than \u00a37 (around $9.40), we didn\u2019t only get one pair of the ZJXD buds \u2013 we got two. For reference, these were identical, other than the fact that one pair came in black, and the other in white.\nSo, after plugging the USB-C connector into my Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, I think it\u2019s fair to say I was barely expecting even average audio. And was it good? Absolutely not. But was it the worst I\u2019ve heard? Again, absolutely not!\nTuning into Black Eye by Allie X, some serious limitations were obvious. These buds produce pretty bloated audio, with the lines blurring between mid-range and low-frequency sounds, resulting in a muddy presentation. Meanwhile, higher-pitched percussion in Merci by Ruze got pretty tinny at high volumes, resulting in a fairly harsh listening experience.\nBut \u2013 and there\u2019s a big but \u2013 hey, I\u2019m talking about earbuds here(!), you still get decently clear audio when listening at medium volume or lower. Vocals, though not beautifully separated, aren\u2019t distorted or overly recessed. And bass, though muddy, is actually fairly impactful, providing solid punch for dance and hip-hop tracks, say.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnd also, if you\u2019re spending around $5 / \u00a35 on some wired buds, I expect you\u2019re not looking for \u2013 and certainly aren\u2019t expecting \u2013 great sound quality. This model is functional and doesn\u2019t make your music sound as if it's being played underwater or out of your phone\u2019s built-in speaker. That\u2019s about as much as you could ask for at this price-point!\nThe clue\u2019s in the build\nSome of the biggest sacrifices you make with these unfathomably cheap buds is in the build department. These are essentially replicating the look and feel of the Apple EarPods USB-C, donning a loose-fitting in-ear design, in-line controller, and minimalistic aesthetic.\nHowever, they don\u2019t have the same high quality finish you\u2019d expect from Apple\u2019s in-ears. Instead, these wired buds wear their low price on their sleeve, with a plasticky, cheap-looking exterior. The attached controller is also pretty stiff, and the chin slider isn\u2019t very effective at keeping the two wires together.\nYep, the bottom line is, I don\u2019t see these buds being particularly durable, and they don\u2019t exactly look all too hot either. More of a personal thing, is that I\u2019m not huge on the loose-fitting design of these, but if you don\u2019t like the feeling of an in-ear seal \u2013 something you get with models like the Skullcady Set USB-C \u2013 then that may suit you.\nOne more thing: the microphone on these buds is, without question, the worst I\u2019ve ever used. When taking a voice note, it sounded as if I was giving a speech while deep sea diving without a helmet. So, if you ever plan on taking a phone call, avoid these, believe me.\nThere you have it, then. These buds may sound better-than-expected for their price, but you\u2019re undoubtedly making big sacrifices elsewhere. In my opinion, you\u2019re better off spending just a little more to unlock much higher quality \u2013 not only in terms of design, but also in terms of sound. Want to know what to get instead? Well it\u2019s your lucky day \u2013 I\u2019ve listed a couple of alternatives below, which I\u2019ve personally reviewed.\nWhat to get instead\nJBL Tune 310C\nGiven that they only cost around $25 / \u00a315 / AU$30, the JBL Tune 310C are an impressive pair of budget wired earbuds. They plate up warm bass, surprisingly strong mic quality, and different EQ modes \u2013 something that\u2019s quite rare for a wired option. They provide an in-ear seal for better noise isolation and more concentrated audio output, but you can grab their sibling, the JBL 305C if you want a looser fit.\nRead our full JBL Tune 310C review.\nApple EarPods USB-C\nIf you\u2019re interested in the cheap buds we\u2019ve been talking about, I\u2019d suggest you spend a tiny bit more to get the real deal. Yep, even though these are Apple buds, the EarPods USB-C are actually inexpensive, typically costing $19 / \u00a319 / AU$29. These buds are sleek, stylish, and support Apple lossless audio.

      "text": "Need cheap earbuds right now? Here are the three best options I\u2019ve tested\nThe three best affordable earbuds I've tested, plus an honorable mention\nI review audio products to pay the rent, and yet when I don\u2019t have any tester buds on the go, the default pairs I use day-to-day tend to be from a price bracket we like to call the best cheap headphones or the best budget earbuds. That is to say, in 2025, you don\u2019t need to spend lots of money to enjoy the best headphones or the best earbuds if you know where to look.\nAnd how do you know where to look? Easy: I\u2019m about to tell you. If you\u2019re on the market for some cheap earbuds and need some suggestions, I\u2019ve got the key options to put you on the right track.\nI\u2019ve reviewed or tested each of the three options I\u2019m about to list here (except the honorable mention, more on that later), but there\u2019s more to recommend these three products than just my nod of approval; I\u2019ve only selected buds that launched in the last year, and that released for $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$200 or less (although some of them have seen price cuts and go for even less!). I\u2019ve also picked earbuds which cross three different form factors \u2013 this was unintentional, but if you\u2019re particular about what you need, you\u2019ll be glad to know that there\u2019s one true in-ear, one stem in-ear and one open-ear selection.\nEach of the options you\u2019ll find below sound great for their price, but that\u2019s not the only factor I looked at in ranking these buds so highly \u2013 I have the controversial opinion that audio quality isn\u2019t the most important metric by which to judge audio products \u2013 as they\u2019re also comfortable to wear, have a useful feature set and offer competitive bang-for-your-buck.\nReady to find some new cheap earbuds to enjoy? Let\u2019s take a tour through three great options I\u2019ve tested\u2026 after a quick but noteworthy detour past one I haven\u2019t.\nHonorable mention: JLab Go Pop ANC\nI would\u2019ve included the JLab Go Pop ANC as a full member of this list, however I\u2019ve not used them, which would make the above headline \u201coptions I\u2019ve tested\u201d a little misleading. This great little product still needs mention, however, based on how much I\u2019ve heard about them \u2013 all from audio experts, too.\nThe draw to these JLabs is their low price: at $29.99 / \u00a329.99 / AU$69.99, they undercut anything else on this list, and are easily the cheapest earbuds you should consider (don\u2019t give in to the temptation of the Amazon bargain bucket!).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDespite the low price, the Go Pop ANC sound great by all accounts. Our reviewer complimented the buds\u2019 trebles and mids, as well as its noise cancellation which, I think we can all agree, is a rare feature in buds this cheap.\nIn fact most of the criticisms of these particular earbuds seems to be in their design, and while I\u2019m all about funky-looking headphones, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a boring-looking bud if you\u2019re not paying for anything more.\nSo if you need really cheap headphones and don\u2019t want ones that sound like those free wired buds you get on airplanes, the JLab Go Pop ANC will be that option.\n1. Sony WF-C510\nSony has loads of headphones and earbuds on offer, but you don\u2019t really need to stretch to its pricier sets when it sells the likes of the WF-C510. These buds cost $59.99 / \u00a354.99 / AU$109 and went on sale in September 2024, and six months on from release, I\u2019m already easily finding them for a reduced price.\nI really enjoyed the Sony WF-C510 due to the punchy audio they offered, which isn\u2019t something you can say about many options at this price point. That\u2019s particularly true of trebles, so vocals and guitars sounded great, and the buds didn\u2019t exhibit many of the signposts of cheap buds like distorting or peaking when you pumped up the volume.\nI know people who love Sony\u2019s WF-C earbuds simply due to how small they can be, and that\u2019s certainly the case here: the buds are light and small, and the case itself is a tiny pill-shaped thing that takes up very little space.\nBuyers who want ANC should skip the Sonys as these buds don\u2019t have noise cancellation, but I\u2019m convinced that most of you buyers don\u2019t care about ANC as much as tech brands think you do, so I\u2019m not going to mark it down for that. Plus, the lack of noise cancellation means that the battery life is great at an impressive 11 hours, which is a much more useful feature.\n2. Nothing Ear (a)\nThese are the \u2018oldest\u2019 buds on this list, released a year prior to my writing this article, and while I didn\u2019t review them for TechRadar they\u2019re actually my default earbuds when I\u2019m not testing a product. So I\u2019m very well versed in them, and even wrote an ode to them being my favorite buds of 2024.\nWhen they launched, the Nothing Ear (a) cost $99 / \u00a399 / AU$192, and it goes without saying that a year has brought a couple of price cuts (not as many as I\u2019d have expected, though!). They\u2019re officially the budget alternative to the Nothing Ear but, between you and I, are definitely the attention-grabbing option of the two. And I\u2019m not just talking about that vibrant yellow-and-see through color option they come in.\nI love how the Nothing Ear (a) sound \u2013 they have the best bass of any earbuds I\u2019ve tested and it\u2019s not even close, with various bass booster or equalization modes letting you tweak to a large extent exactly how much you want your ear to be tickled. It\u2019s a fun sound that really puts the \u2018cheerful\u2019 in \u2018cheap and cheerful\u2019.\nThe design is, it goes without saying, fun but divisive \u2013 but I like them. The case is also really lovely and small and the buds have some of the best buttons I\u2019ve ever seen, as simply pinching the stems plays or pauses your music. I\u2019m so fed up with bad gesture controls or hard-to-press buttons on earbuds and the (a) is a breath of fresh air. Or is that a breath of fresh (a)ir?\nIn our review we noted that a symptom of the price is the lack of hearing tests (something other Nothing buds have). But you\u2019re still getting an easy-to-use equalizer, LDAC support and robust ANC \u2013 something you can\u2019t say about the other options on this list.\n3. Huawei FreeArc\nWe move onto our newest earbuds: the Huawei FreeArc were released in February 2025, and they\u2019re a bit different from the other options on this list because they\u2019re open earbuds (you'll find them in our guide to the best open ear headphones). That means the bud hovers above your ear, letting surrounding sound in as well as your music, and this form factor has become all the rage in the first few months of 2025.\nThe Huawei FreeArc launched at the same price as the Nothings mentioned above: \u00a399.99 (no US or Aus pricing has been revealed yet). However I\u2019ve already seen them discounted by about the same amount as the Nothings, so they\u2019re again pretty affordable.\nOpen earbuds often sound horrible \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get pleasing audio when the bud is a distance from your ear canal \u2013 and the Huawei are the best-sounding ones I\u2019ve tested. There\u2019s an expansive soundstage and a zesty tone, and while ANC would be lovely (it\u2019s uncommon in open earbuds, but not unheard of), the max volume is still high enough to ensure you can enjoy music.\nThe FreeArc are comfortable and convenient to wear \u2013 again, uncommon in open-ears, with the competitive price undercutting most contemporary rivals.\nIf you\u2019re an audiophile who\u2019s curious about this burgeoning form factor, I\u2019d say avoid it; open earbuds can be hit-and-miss sonically. The fact that they're not creating a seal between the driver neck and your ear canal is a key factor there \u2013 although if you're budget's a little stretchier, the Honor Earbuds Open prove it can be done well (and yes, with an impactful bass response).\nHowever, if you're strapped for cash but you think you\u2019d benefit from buds like it (running one of the big marathons? You likely won't be permitted to wear in- or over-ears), the Huaweis are definitely your best option so far. They sound great and they\u2019re cheap; what else do you need?\nYou may also like\n- Need ANC? See our pick of the best noise-cancelling earbuds\n- Prefer over-ears?

  "argos_summary": "The WGO Bluetooth Speaker, priced at just $7, offers surprisingly decent sound quality for its low cost, although it has notable sonic weaknesses, particularly in bass and treble clarity. While it may not satisfy audiophiles, it serves as a functional option for those seeking an affordable and portable speaker. The speaker's design reflects its budget price, being made from flimsy materials, but it fulfills the basic need for music playback without being offensive to the ears. Overall, it occupies a niche for users who prioritize affordability over high-quality sound.",
