  "content": "A Florida man with near-unmatched gumption for slaying snakes was awarded $1,000 through a new state incentive system for capturing a staggering 87 invasive pythons in just one month.\n\nAaron Mann clinched the monthly prize as part of South Florida Water Management District\u2019s Python Elimination Program, which encourages skilled Sunshine State residents to capture and kill as many of its invasive Burmese pythons as possible.\n\nMann posed victoriously with one of his bounties alongside a hunting partner, draping the monstrous reptile over both their shoulders while reveling in their kill count \u2014 and impending reward.\n\nIn early 2025, the program introduced a monetary award that will be doled out to the daredevils with the highest count each month.\n\nThe Sunshine State already sponsors a series of other events aimed at tapering the python population bit by bit, including the annual Florida Python Challenge, which saw a slew of participants only wipe out 200 of the reptiles over the 10-day hunt last year \u2014 a mere fraction of Mann\u2019s bounty.\n\nLast year\u2019s Challenge winner only removed 20 pythons, but brought home a $10,000 reward.\n\nAdditionally, specialized python removal agents are paid $50 for each snake they secure, with an extra $25 thrown in for every foot on snakes stretching longer than the average 4 feet.\n\nIn 2023, a 19-foot python was captured in Florida, which would be worth $425 under the new incentive programs.\n\nThe state also introduced a tracking program using cartoonish robot rabbits that would alert the SFWMD when it spots a python. From there, officials would dispatch someone to remove the snake \u2014 likely one of the removal agents who would additionally be compensated for their efforts.\n\nThe Burmese pythons have roamed Florida\u2019s Everglades since the 1990s, despite being a non native species to the US. Their population has only grown, and officials have no idea what the exact count could be by now.\n\nRoughly 19,000 have been removed from the Everglades since 2000, according to Fox Weather Service.",

      "text": "Florida deploys furry robot rabbits to fight invasive Burmese python overpopulation\nNight of the Robbits!\nA water management district in Florida\u2019s Everglades is using robot rabbits to help monitor and eventually eliminate its ever-growing population of invasive Burmese pythons that have wreaked havoc on native animals.\nThe solar-powered rabbits were let loose into the Everglades shortly after the annual Florida Python Challenge, a 10-day competition that draws hundreds of eager snake wranglers to hunt the invasive reptiles.\nThe robot bunnies, while cartoonish in appearance, are equipped with an artificial intelligence-powered camera that alerts officials with the South Florida Water Management District when they spot a python. From there, someone will be dispatched to remove the snake, according to a news release.\nThe robots were designed to mimic real rabbits\u2019 movements and include mechanics to imitate a live one\u2019s heat signature and scent, which pythons hone in on when hunting real-life bunnies.\nThe invasive pythons can measure as long as 18 feet in length and are capable of swallowing an entire deer whole. It\u2019s unclear how the robot rabbits may stack up against the pythons, or how many the district may lose to the reptiles\u2019 appetites.\nThe Burmese python, a non native species to the United States, was first recorded in the Sunshine State in the 1990s. Since then, its population has skyrocketed exponentially, though officials aren\u2019t sure what the precise count is.\nMore than 19,000 pythons have been removed from the Everglades since 2000, according to Fox Weather Service.\nOthers have been either killed or removed during promoted events like the Florida Python Challenge.\nLast year\u2019s winner wiped out a staggering 20 pythons and clinched the $10,000 grand prize.\nThe species is exempted from the state\u2019s animal protection legislation \u2014 except for the anti-cruelty law \u2014 and can be humanely killed year-round with or without a hunting permit or license, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\nStill, the python\u2019s domination is clear when looking at the damage other species in the Everglades have suffered.\nThe populations of raccoons and possums, two easy prey for the gargantuan reptiles, have almost been entirely eradicated from the area, with just 1% or 2% left intact, according to a 2012 study by the United States Geological Survey."

Prior to this catch, the largest Burmese python caught in Florida was in October 2020 35 miles west of Miami and measured at 18 feet and 9 inches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to be able to make an impact on South Florida\u2019s environment,\u201d Waleri told the Conservancy, which works to control the threat of the invasive Burmese python, in a press release. \u201cWe love this ecosystem and try to preserve it as much as possible.\u201d\nWaleri admitted that capturing a snake of this size was \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201cvery chaotic\u201d \u2014 but it was also a dream.\n\u201cI knew we were capable of it but I didn\u2019t know it would happen,\u201d Waleri, who has been hunting snakes since 2020, told USA Today. \u201cLast year my cousin and I caught a snake that was almost 18 feet long, and we realized we could handle a snake of that size.\u201d\n\u201cAt first I just held onto the tail for dear life. And then one of my friends took a net and tried to pin its head down, and we quickly realized that was not a winning strategy,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the only snake that\u2019s scared me so much that I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nWaleri said that it\u2019s \u201cconcerning\u201d that the snakes get bigger every year, and \u201cwe need to pull these big females out of the ecosystem before they lay eggs.\u201d [Another high-profile python captured this week was pregnant with 60 eggs but only measured around 16 feet.]\nThe record-breaking python could help experts learn more about the species.\n\u201cWe had a feeling that these snakes get this big and now we have clear evidence. Her genetic material may prove valuable for an eventual understanding of the founding population of South Florida,\u201d biologist Ian Easterling said in the press release. \u201cWe will be collecting measurements and samples that will be distributed to our research.\u201d\nEasterling added to USA Today that its likely the python had already laid about 100 eggs and was on the lookout for its next meal, but that it had no eggs inside of her.\nOther Floridians can have the opportunity to hunt for pythons on their own, with the Florida Python Challenge running from Aug. 4 through Aug. 13.\nThe 10-day challenge offers a $10,000 prize, and is an \u201cexciting conservation effort which helps protect the rare Everglades habitat and the animals that live there from these invasive, non-native snakes.\u201d"
