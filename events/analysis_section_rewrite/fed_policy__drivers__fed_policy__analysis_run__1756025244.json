      "feedback": "Overall assessment: the draft correctly anchors a durable AI/cloud-growth thesis (21.2% CAGR through 2030) and uses numeric anchors (0G3A676BP; 35.95% vs 17.18%; 1.8–2.2% yields; 12–18% JUST premium; IBM hiring pause; IEA 2.5mbpd) but it lacks a tightly structured, world‑class cross‑topic transmission and an explicit scenario framework; it also underutilizes several critical sources and lacks quantified valuation sensitivities. Actionable edits: (1) Build a formal cross‑topic causal chain that ties macro (V7GV8YBQU CPI path), policy/capital (TN66GHPAT cost of capital, 1.8–2.2% yields; 12–18% premium), flows/positioning (0G3A676BP growth, Just Capital labor premium), and valuation/technicals to show how AI/cloud moats translate into persistent margins and FCF; (2) introduce a three‑scenario framework (base, bull, bear) with explicit ranges for CPI, services inflation, and 10Y yields drawn from the cited sources, and show their impact on multiples and capex dynamics; (3) specify catalysts and invalidation signals with timelines (IBM hiring pause as productivity signal via 4LQD15CFU; IEA oil supply shift via J99EM2TPZ; CPI/services prints via V7GV8YBQU) and include concrete failure signals (e.g., sustained CPI services surprise beyond a defined threshold); (4) reconcile and justify underutilized sources (Marijuana Rescheduling; U.S. urban crime dynamics; Intel management) as risk channels or explicitly deprioritize if non‑material, with a clear rationale; (5) add quantitative valuation sensitivity (how, e.g., a 50bp rise in the 10Y or a CPI surprise translates into multiple contraction or expansion) and a concise data appendix mapping claims to IDs; (6) tighten citation discipline so every claim is tied to a source ID and resolved for conflicts (e.g., oil oversupply vs demand risk via J99EM2TPZ); (7) strengthen coherence into a single narrative: AI/cloud leadership drives margin/FCF growth, inflation/cost of capital compresses multiples, macro/news flow signals validate or invalidate the thesis; (8) deliver a compact watch‑list of 3–5 decisive signals and 1–2 invalidation scenarios; (9) ensure the length/style aligns with the horizon (multi‑year) and provide a one‑paragraph executive summary plus a brief data appendix; (10) prune overstatements and replace generic phrasing with the precise numbers and IDs to elevate specificity.",
