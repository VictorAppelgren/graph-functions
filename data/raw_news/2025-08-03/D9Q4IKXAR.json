  "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. is bracing for the first strike in nearly three decades at its St. Louis-area defense factories after union members rejected the company\u2019s modified contract offer.\n\u2022 We Should All Be Biking Along the Beach\n\u2022 Seeking Relief From Heat and Smog, Cities Follow the Wind\n\nAbout 3,200 machinists are set to walk off the job around midnight after members voted down a deal that would\u2019ve raised wages by 20% and boosted retirement contributions. The union last went on strike in 1996, with the stoppage lasting 99 days.\n\n\u201cIAM District 837 members have spoken loud and clear, they deserve a contract that reflects their skill, dedication, and the critical role they play in our nation\u2019s defense,\u201d Tom Boelling, the union local\u2019s top official, said in a statement.\n\nThe labor strife will amplify financial pressure on Boeing\u2019s defense and space division, which generates about 30% of the company\u2019s revenue as of the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers,\u201d Dan Gillian, a Boeing vice president and senior St. Louis site executive, said in a statement.\n\nUnion members build fighter aircraft such as the F-15, the T-7 training jet, missiles and munitions. They also manufacture components for Boeing\u2019s 777X commercial jets.\n\nThere\u2019s been a recent groundswell of activism at aerospace manufacturers, with unions gaining leverage amid shortages of highly skilled mechanics.\n\nMachinists walked off the job for three weeks at Pratt & Whitney this year, contributing to engine shortages at planemaker Airbus SE. Boeing\u2019s commercial factories were shut down by striking workers for two months in late 2024.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg downplayed the potential fallout from a strike during the company\u2019s July 29 earnings call.\n\n\u201cThe order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,\u201d Ortberg said, noting that the St. Louis union is about 1/10 the size of the Seattle-based union that struck last fall. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the implications of the strike. We\u2019ll manage our way through that.\u201d\n\nBoeing had crafted its latest offer to address concerns raised by members of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 837 after they rejected its initial proposal last week, Gillian told reporters on July 31.\n\nBoth offers represented the richest contracts Boeing has ever proposed for district members: average wages would increase to $102,600 from $75,000 for IAM 837 members. Boeing also eliminated a controversial schedule proposal and revised its 401(k) terms so that workers get the full contribution increase upfront instead of spread over three years.",
