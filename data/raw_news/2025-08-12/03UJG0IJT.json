  "description": "KLSE:ENGTEX 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Engtex Group Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select...",
  "content": "Explore Engtex Group Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 Engtex Group Berhad's significant private companies ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public\n\u2022 The top 7 shareholders own 50% of the company AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. Every investor in Engtex Group Berhad (KLSE:ENGTEX) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 40% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Individual insiders, on the other hand, account for 24% of the company's stockholders. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Engtex Group Berhad. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Engtex Group Berhad? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that Engtex Group Berhad does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Engtex Group Berhad, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Engtex Group Berhad is not owned by hedge funds. Nh Holdings Sdn Bhd is currently the largest shareholder, with 24% of shares outstanding. NKG Resources Sdn. Bhd. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and Chooi Ng holds about 4.4% of the company stock. Chooi Ng, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors. On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There is a little analyst coverage of the stock, but not much. So there is room for it to gain more coverage. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Engtex Group Berhad. Insiders have a RM103m stake in this RM424m business. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. We can see that Private Companies own 40%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Engtex Group Berhad (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about. Ultimately the future is most important.
