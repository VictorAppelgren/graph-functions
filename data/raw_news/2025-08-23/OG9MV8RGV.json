  "title": "Grandmother accused of masterminding family murder-for-hire plot in dentist's killing of professor",
  "description": "Prosecutors say Donna Adelson was the matriarch behind Dan Markel's murder, with evidence including her attempted flight to Vietnam and FBI sting operation.",
  "content": "Nearly 11 years after Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was gunned down in his driveway, his former mother-in-law, Donna Sue Adelson, is set to face murder charges on whether she masterminded the killing.\n\nThe 75-year-old grandmother is accused of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation of murder in what prosecutors call a cold-blooded family plot to free her daughter, Wendi Adelson, from a bitter custody battle. She has pleaded not guilty.\n\nFormer Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, who was also a friend of Markel, told Fox News Digital the long wait for trial was deliberate.\n\n\"The day of reckoning for Donna is here and justice has come slowly, but it is going to arrive,\" he said. \"Prosecutors had to go step by step, starting with the hitmen, then Katherine Magbanua [Adelson's former girlfriend], then Charlie Adelson [Markel's former brother-in-law]. Only then did they have enough to take down Donna.\"\n\nHIRING A HITMAN: INSIDE A FLORIDA DENTIST'S ALLEGED PLOT TO HAVE HIS SISTER'S EX, A PROMINENT ATTORNEY, KILLED\n\nSince the 2014 murder, Charlie Adelson has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Two men hired in the scheme, Luis Rivera and Sigfredo Garcia, as well as their go-between Katherine [Katie] Magbanua, are also serving lengthy sentences, according to the Associated Press.\n\nProsecutors argue Donna was the matriarch who orchestrated the killing behind the scenes.\n\nAronberg said the strategy of stacking convictions was key: \"I don\u2019t think you get to Donna without getting to Katie Magbanua and then Charlie Adelson first. It\u2019s been a very successful strategy \u2014 and it\u2019s not done yet.\"\n\nMarkel, a rising legal scholar, was embroiled in a contentious divorce and custody dispute with Donna\u2019s daughter, Wendi Adelson, when he was ambushed and shot in July 2014.\n\nProsecutors say Donna and her son, Charlie Adelson, worked with hired hitmen to eliminate Markel, so Wendi could relocate with her children to South Florida.\n\nDonna, prosecutors argue, was the matriarch who orchestrated the killing behind the scenes.\n\nSIGN UP TO GET THE TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\n\nJury selection began Tuesday in Tallahassee, Florida. Aronberg said the trial will likely move quicker than Charlie\u2019s trial because prosecutors and judges now know the case inside and out.\n\n\"Donna will take the stand, they will cross-examine her \u2014 it will be must-see TV,\" he said. \"And I think justice will be done.\"\n\nOne of the prosecution\u2019s sharpest tools, Aronberg said, is Donna\u2019s \"consciousness of guilt,\" primarily from her 2023 attempt to flee the U.S. to Vietnam. Notably, Vietnam has no extradition treaty with the U.S.\n\n\"The best evidence for the jury will be consciousness of guilt,\" Aronberg explained. \"She tried to flee the country on a one-way ticket to Vietnam. That\u2019s not how an innocent person acts.\"\n\nFLORIDA WOMAN SENTENCED TO LIFE BEHIND BARS IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE SHOOTING DEATH OF PROMINENT FSU LAW PROFESSOR\n\nIn 2016, the FBI conducted an undercover operation known as \"the bump\" against Donna. An agent approached Donna in Miami posing as an extortionist tied to the killers.\n\n\"If you had nothing to do with this crime, you\u2019d throw the paper away or call police,\" Aronberg said. \"She didn\u2019t either. She called her son, who\u2019s now in prison for life, and spoke in code about the \u2018TV,\u2019 which was their code for the murder. That\u2019s not how an innocent person acts.\"\n\nWOMAN, 73, ARRESTED AT MIAMI AIRPORT AFTER ALLEGED MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT TARGETING FORMER SON-IN-LAW\n\nAronberg also noted contradictions in Donna\u2019s story: the Adelsons were outraged at being asked for a fake $5,000 payoff during the sting, yet later were willing to pay $300,000 when Magbanua said the killers wanted it, according to testimony at Charlie Adelson's trial.\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" he said.\n\nAronberg suggested that the defense may lean into Donna\u2019s 75-year-old status as a grandmother and loving mother.\n\n\"She\u2019s going to say she was just being a good mother to her son \u2014 that\u2019s why her money got into the killers\u2019 hands. But that didn\u2019t work for Charlie, and it won\u2019t work for her,\" he said. \"Her better defense would be accessory after the fact, but she wants exoneration entirely. She thinks she can put one over on the jury. That didn\u2019t work for Charlie, and it won\u2019t work for her.\"\n\n\"She may hope jurors will see a frail grandmother, but she\u2019s not sympathetic,\" he said. \"She took the stand pre-trial, and it did not go well. She doesn\u2019t come across sympathetically.\"\n\n\u2018LIFE SENTENCE\u2019: MOTHER OF FLORIDA LAWYER KILLED IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT DETAILS FAMILY'S FIGHT FOR JUSTICE\n\nAt the time of his murder, Markel was a rising legal scholar and embroiled in a contentious divorce and custody dispute with his wife, Wendi Adelson. Prosecutors allege that Donna and her son, Charlie, arranged the murder so Wendi could gain full custody of their children and start a new life in South Florida.\n\nGO HERE FOR MORE TRUE CRIME FROM FOX NEWS DIGITAL\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWendi has not been charged but has been repeatedly named in court filings. She has fought a subpoena to testify at her mother\u2019s trial, arguing it could jeopardize her Fifth Amendment rights. Aronberg expects she will still take the stand, under immunity if called by the prosecution.\n\n\"As for Donna, she\u2019ll testify too,\" Aronberg said. \"She really believes her story. But just like Charlie, she\u2019ll learn the jury isn\u2019t buying it.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Donna Adelson's defense team, Jackie Fulford and Joshua Zelman, for comment.",

(AP) \u2014 Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of the matriarch of a South Florida family on charges of orchestrating the hit man murder of her ex-son-in-law.\nDonna Adelson is accused of arranging the 2014 killing of Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel, who was shot in the head inside his Tallahassee garage.\nAdelson faces charges of first-degree murder, as well as conspiracy and solicitation to commit first-degree murder, in a trial that could extend into the week of Sept. 8.\nAdelson is the latest to go on trial for what prosecutors say was a murder-for-hire plot to kill Markel, her former son-in-law, who had been involved in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife, lawyer Wendi Adelson. Markel had gotten a court order barring her from moving from Tallahassee back to South Florida with their two young sons to be closer to her family, who made their fortune practicing dentistry.\nAuthorities say Donna Adelson helped orchestrate the plot to murder Markel, conspiring with her son Charles Adelson and his then-girlfriend Katherine Magbanua, who prosecutors say served as the go-between with two men hired to carry out the killing, Sigfredo Garcia and Luis Rivera.\nCharles Adelson, Magbanua and her ex-boyfriend, Garcia, were all sentenced to life in prison after being convicted earlier of first-degree murder. Garcia\u2019s friend, Rivera, is serving a 19-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and testifying against the others.\nThe case has riveted Florida\u2019s capital for more than a decade, as sordid details emerged about a messy divorce, tensions with in-laws and child custody battles that culminated in the murder of a prominent local professor.\nDonna Adelson was arrested in 2023 as she and her husband were about to use one-way tickets to board a flight to Vietnam, a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. The arrest came one week after her oral surgeon son was found guilty.\nAuthorities say the Adelsons considered offering Markel $1 million to let his ex-wife and sons move to South Florida, but then members of the family began plotting his death.\nWendi Adelson and her father, Harvey Adelson, have denied involvement and have not been charged.\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "Prosecutor questions Florida dentist\u2019s claim he was extorted, not a murder-for-hire mastermind\nProsecutor questions Florida dentist\u2019s claim he was extorted, not a murder-for-hire mastermind\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida dentist on trial in his ex-brother-in-law\u2019s slaying testified Friday that he never explained to authorities that he was a victim of extortion \u2014 and not the mastermind behind a 2014 murder-for-hire plot \u2014 because no one asked him to reveal the truth.\nProsecutors contend Charles Adelson paid to have Dan Markel killed after Adelson\u2019s sister, Wendi, lost a bitter custody battle. Adelson claims investigators got it wrong, and while he knew shortly after the murder that his ex-girlfriend\u2019s friends were the killers, he didn\u2019t say anything because he thought his life was in danger.\nNine years after Markel, a prominent Florida State University law professor, was shot by hitmen while sitting in his car outside his Tallahassee home, Adelson admitted when questioned by his lawyer Thursday that he paid the killers money after the fact, but said it was only because he was being threatened. The tie between Adelson and the killers was his ex-girlfriend, Katherine Magbanua, who came to Adelson\u2019s home shortly after the slaying, admitted her friends killed Markel and told him he needed to pay more than $300,000 in 48 hours or be killed too.\nOn Friday, prosecutor Georgia Cappleman tried poking holes in his story, saying nobody put a gun to Adelman\u2019s head when he gave Magbanua $138,000 in cash and arranged \u201csome kind of layaway plan\u201d for the rest of the payment. Cappleman noted Adelson spent the night with Magbanua before she left with the money the next day, and even after they broke up continued to give her expensive gifts, put her on his family\u2019s dentistry payroll and gave her $3,000 a month to pass onto the extortionists.\n\u201cDo extortionists send a girlfriend of their victim to collect their extortion money? Is that the way it\u2019s done?\u201d Cappleman asked sarcastically.\nCappleman also noted that Adelson had sexual relations with Magbanua months after the murder and continued to to tell her he loved her via texts. Adelson said he didn\u2019t think Magbanua was orchestrating the extortion and was convinced she was protecting him from the killers. The monthly payments were like a life insurance policy keeping him alive, he said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get killed, I didn\u2019t get robbed. The extortion never went up. She was protecting me,\u201d Adelson said.\nProsecutors contend that Adelson paid to have the professor killed and that Magbanua hired Sigfredo Garcia, the father of her two children, to commit the murder and that Garcia enlisted the help of his childhood friend, Luis Rivera. Magbanua and Garcia were convicted of first-degree murder and Rivera is serving a 19-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testifying against Garcia and Magbanua.\nAdelson is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy and soliciting the killing.\nMarkel and Wendi Adelson were divorced and shared custody of their two kids, but she wanted to move from Tallahassee to South Florida to be closer to her family. A judge ruled that Wendi Adelson couldn\u2019t move the children from Tallahassee, and Markel refused to move to South Florida.\nCharles Adelson testified Thursday that, before the killing, his family offered Markel $1 million to move to South Florida so the children could be near their mother. Adelson said he offered to pay one-third of the cost. He told Magbanua details of the proposal and the contentious custody battle, and she later told Garcia.\nAdelson said he was convinced Garcia and Rivera acted on their own and Magbanua was innocent, even after she was arrested in 2016. It wasn\u2019t until three years later when she was on trial that he realized Magbanua was part of the plot, he told Cappleman.\n\u201cFor three years she was in the Leon County jail awaiting trial ... and you believed she was innocent and you had this whole explanation to assist with exonerating her, right?\u201d Cappleman said.\n\u201cI had the truth of what happened, yes,\u201d Adelson said.\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t offer the truth of what happened, did you?\u201d Cappleman said.\n\u201cNobody came to me. I thought the truth would come out,\u201d he replied.\nAsked how if he felt bad about not letting Markel\u2019s parents know the truth about what happened to their son, Adelson said, \u201cI feel a sense of relief that I was able to tell everyone what finally happened.\u201d\n\u201cYesterday. Almost 10 years later, right?\u201d Cappleman said.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Adelson said with a sigh.\nBoth sides will give their closing arguments on Monday before the jury begins deliberations."

      "text": "Wendi Adelson took the stand in a Florida courtroom earlier this month to testify at one of the trials related to the 2014 murder of her ex-husband, law professor Dan Markel.\n\"I don\u2019t want to know what happened,\" she told the defense.\nWith her long, dirty blonde hair covering the collar of a black blazer she wore over a gray dress, her demeanor varied between the seemingly good-natured, \"Who, me?\"-type witness and the kind who at times grew combative, irked at the questions being thrown her way.\nAdelson, a lawyer herself, testified under oath just feet from the woman accused of acting as a go-between for the woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Adelson\u2019s brother, and the men who allegedly carried out the murder. That woman, Katherine Magbanua, was convicted late Friday of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation to commit murder.\nSome have speculated as to Adelson\u2019s true involvement in the case \u2013 how much she knew before, during or after her ex\u2018s murder about the circumstances surrounding his execution-style death. Wendi has insisted she was not aware of any plot.\nJust weeks before her May 19 testimony in a Leon County courtroom, Adelson\u2019s brother, Charlie, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and solicitation to commit first-degree murder for allegedly hiring two men to kill his sister, Wendi's, ex-husband.\n\"There\u2019s actually tension between you and this office, right?\" asked Magbanua\u2019s defense attorney, regarding the Leon County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office.\nShe admitted, when asked, that testifying was \"very uncomfortable\" in light of the recent events surrounding her brother.\n\"Lots of media insinuates that I did something I didn't do, too,\" she responds.\nRegardless of whether she did or did not know of the alleged plans for Markel\u2019s murder \u2013 and whether she likes it or not \u2013 Wendi Adelson remains at the heart of the case.\n\"For anybody to suggest that she would put her sons through such pain and horrific agony is just absurd and mean-spirited. This tragedy has had a terrible effect on Wendy and her sons,\" John Lauro, Wendi\u2019s attorney, told Fox News Digital on Sunday.\nHe added: \"[For] almost eight years now, the police have done an intensely thorough investigation of Wendi. They have found not a single email, text, recorded conversation, phone record \u2013 anything \u2013 that implicates Wendy at all. Zero \u2026 The bottom line is that if there was something that tied Wendi to this horrific crime \u2013 and there's not \u2013 we would have seen it in real evidence.\"\nDaniel \"Danny\" Markel, a prominent Florida State University law professor, was on the heels of a contentious divorce with Wendi when he was gunned down in his car on July 18, 2014. The pair disagreed and sparred in court documents over certain issues, namely, Wendi\u2019s relocation from Tallahassee to be closer to her family in south Florida.\nTallahassee Police Department investigators have said Markel dropped his children off at daycare around 8:50 a.m. roughly five miles from his home and then made his way to Premier Health and Fitness Center, where he arrived around 9:12 a.m., according to a probable cause affidavit shared online in 2016.\nPolice found that a Toyota Prius had followed Markel not only into the parking lot of the fitness facility, but was also \"trailing Markel\u2019s car\" before and after his time in the gym.\n\"Investigators believe the suspects in the Prius followed the victim throughout the morning and back to this residence, where the victim was shot in the head as he sat in his car,\" the affidavit states. \"Markel\u2019s neighbor heard what he believed to be a gunshot and looked out the window, where he saw a small silver or light-colored vehicle, resembling a Prius, backing out of the victim\u2019s driveway.\"\nMarkel was rushed to a local hospital, but ultimately could not be saved.\nOn the day of the murder, Wendi Adelson sat for an interview with police that lasted at least six hours and without an attorney, she has said. Lauro said she did so willingly.\n\"Immediately after the police went to her, Wendi sat for seven hours. Answered all the questions. Turned over her cell phone, her computer, her car, her home,\" Lauro, her attorney, said. \"When she was told that her ex-husband had been shot and was literally dying at a hospital, she went into a stream of consciousness thought-pattern \u2026 she literally tried every way to search her memory, her thought process to assist the police in coming up with any information that that might be helpful.\"\nSigfredo Garcia and his alleged accomplice, Luis Rivera, were charged in June 2016. Magbanua was arrested months later in October 2016. Garcia was convicted in 2019 of first-degree murder, and has appealed his conviction. Rivera ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\nGarcia\u2019s attorney did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request seeking comment.\nThe affidavit further describes a series of phone calls between Magbanua, the father of her children, Sigfredo Garcia, Charlie Adelson, and other members of his family.\nWendi Adelson\u2019s parents, Harvey and Donna, and her brother lived in South Florida. Harvey founded a dental practice, where his son \u2013 and nearly everyone in the family \u2013 had worked at one time or another.\nDuring Wendi Adelson\u2019s testimony earlier this month, Chief Assistant State Attorney Georgia Cappleman referenced an email exchange between Adelson and Donna Adelson in asking what her mother felt was \"the most important part of your divorce.\"\n\"That was relocation,\" Adelson responded.\nShe later said her proximity to her parents was not the sole reason why she wanted to move. She acknowledged that, \"it was absolutely a reason.\"\n\"I wanted to create some stability for my kids and family, having family around, helps have a more stable environment,\" she testified.\nBut Markel was \"adamantly opposed\" to Adelson taking their children to south Florida, Cappleman contended, to which Adelson agreed. Adelson said her mother suggested changing the children\u2019s religion \u2013 which was said to have been important to Markel \u2013 and even bribe him with up to a million dollars, \"$330,000 each \u2026 my mom, my dad and Charlie.\"\nAfter Markel\u2019s death, Wendi Adelson stayed in Tallahassee \"for a few days\" before moving away from the area, she testified. She told the prosecutor she didn\u2019t feel safe. She later went on to change her children\u2019s last names from Markel to Adelson, and change one of their son\u2019s middle names, despite its symbolism and significance to the Markel family.\nProsecutors pressed her during her testimony about comments she allegedly made during her interview with police just hours after Markel\u2019s death.\n\"One of the things you said was that your family very much disliked him and that you thought it was possible that someone had done this on your behalf,\" Cappleman contended to Adelson, who did not agree that she had made that specific statement.\nAdelson responded: \"I did say I thought someone might have done this on my behalf, yes.\"\nShe also noted: \"I think I speculated about lots of things during the six hours I spent with law enforcement without an attorney present.\"\n\"Did your brother ever mention hiring a hitman to kill your ex-husband?\" Cappleman asked earlier in the examination.\nAdelson responded that he \"never mentioned hiring a hitman.\"\n\"He told one off-color joke where he said, he had bought me a TV when I got divorced and said it was a present and made a very bad joke, in bad taste, that it was cheaper than hiring a hitman,\" Adelson said.\nAsked whether Charlie made the joke once or multiple times, Wendi Adelson said her brother \"has a tendency to repeat himself, so everything he says, he says multiple times.\"\nShe said he had made the joke \"definitely twice at least.\"\nWendi said she had only met Magbanua a handful of times. Magbanua had allegedly also worked for the Adelsons\u2019 dental practice for a short period.\nAsked if she was \"involved in the plot to kill your husband,\" Adelson responded: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\"Did you have knowledge of the plot to kill your husband?\"\n\"No,\" she said.\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital on Sunday, Lauro said \"one of the first things\" Wendi Adelson discussed during her interview with police was the joke her brother had made. He said that further shows that any argument that Wendi could have been \"somehow part of a murder-for-hire plot is absolutely ludicrous.\"\nCharlie Adelson, age 45, was arrested in April 2022 after he was indicted by a grand jury.\nLeon County State Attorney Jack Campbell said in a statement at the time that investigators were able to improve the quality of a secretly recorded meeting between Charlie Adelson and Magbanua, who was arrested only months after their taped rendezvous.\nThe meeting was recorded in 2016 as part of an \"undercover law enforcement operation,\" Cappleman told Fox News Digital. The enhanced recording, \"provided us with some new statements that we felt were damaging,\" Cappelman said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHis lawyers did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment.\nSpeaking about Markel, Cappleman said she was not aware of any evidence to indicate Markel was concerned about his safety prior to his death.\nShe said Markel\u2019s family was \"utterly tormented by the whole situation.\"\nMarkel\u2019s father did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request seeking an interview."

      "text": "A South Florida woman has been sentenced to life in prison plus additional time for her role in a murder-for-hire plot that resulted in the shooting death of a local law professor.\nKatherine Magbanua was sentenced Friday morning to life behind bars without the possibility of probation or parole, as well as two consecutive 30-year prison terms. Magbanua, 37, was convicted in May of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation to commit murder.\nProsecutors said she acted as a go-between for her ex-boyfriend, dentist Charlie Adelson, and the men whom he allegedly hired to kill Florida State University law professor Daniel \"Danny\" Markel eight years ago.\nMagbanua\u2019s attorney, Tara Kawass, had asked for the lightest possible sentence, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\nKawass read a statement on her client\u2019s behalf, in which she told the court: \"She does think about Dan Markel every single day, She does think about his kids every single day. \u2026 Not a day goes by that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t express how her heart is broken for the Markel family. One thing that I can say that Ms. Magbanua hopes and prays for is that justice is ongoing and has not been reached in this case, and she wants each and every person who had a hand in this and knows something about this to be brought to justice.\"\nMarkel, a prominent lawyer, was on the heels of a contentious divorce with Adelson\u2019s sister, Wendi, when he was gunned down in his car on July 18, 2014. The pair had disagreed and sparred in court documents over certain issues, namely, Wendi\u2019s relocation from Tallahassee to be closer to her family in south Florida.\nTallahassee Police Department investigators said Markel dropped his children off at daycare around 8:50 a.m. roughly five miles from his home and then made his way to Premier Health and Fitness Center, where he arrived around 9:12 a.m., according to a probable cause affidavit shared online in 2016.\nPolice found that a Toyota Prius had followed Markel not only into the parking lot of the fitness facility, but was also \"trailing Markel\u2019s car\" before and after his time in the gym.\n\"Investigators believe the suspects in the Prius followed the victim throughout the morning and back to this residence, where the victim was shot in the head as he sat in his car,\" the affidavit states. \"Markel\u2019s neighbor heard what he believed to be a gunshot and looked out the window, where he saw a small silver or light-colored vehicle, resembling a Prius, backing out of the victim\u2019s driveway.\"\nMarkel was rushed to a local hospital, but could not be saved.\nMagbanua had lived with one of the accused gunmen, Sigfredo Garcia, with whom she had two children. She had previously had a relationship with Charlie Adelson, and had once worked for Adelson\u2019s family\u2019s dental office.\nGarcia and his alleged accomplice, Luis Rivera, were charged in June 2016. Magbanua was arrested months later in October 2016. Garcia was convicted in 2019 of first-degree murder, and has appealed his conviction. Rivera pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCharlie Adelson, age 45, was arrested in April 2022 after he was indicted by a grand jury. He was charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation to commit murder. He pleaded not guilty.\nIn a statement provided to Fox News Digital, attorneys representing Markel's parents said Magbanua's sentencing \"marks another important step toward accountability and justice.\"\n\"Dan Markel was brutally murdered more than eight years ago,\" attorneys Orin Snyder and Matt Benjamin wrote in a statement on behalf of Ruth and Phil Markel. \"We are grateful for the efforts of law enforcement and the State Attorney\u2019s Office in advancing the criminal case against Charles Adelson and in continuing to pursue all those responsible for Dan\u2019s murder.\""

      "text": "The mother of a prominent Florida attorney, who was gunned down in an alleged murder-for-hire plot, described the moments she learned of her son\u2019s violent death \u2013 and her continuing quest for justice years later.\n\"The truth of my life is defined by my son\u2019s murder,\" Ruth Markel wrote in \"The Unveiling: A Mother\u2019s Reflection on Murder, Grief and Trial Life.\"\n\"I am seventy-seven years old and will likely die before reaching the small satisfaction of any kind of meaningful justice.\"\nMarkel lost her only son, Dan, on the morning of July 18, 2014 \u2013 just minutes after she had spoken with him over the phone. In \"The Unveiling,\" one of her many books, she described not only how her family has chosen to remember \"Danny,\" but also the \"life sentence\" she herself is serving as she and her family await answers as to who hired the hit men to ambush and execute him.\n\"Ma, I have to take this call,\" and, \"talk to you later,\" were the last words she heard from him, she wrote.\nDan Markel, 41, was a divorced father of two and a respected Florida State University law professor when he was gunned down while pulling into the garage of his Tallahassee, Florida, home.\n\"Life\u2019s progression comes to a stop when you lose a child. It feels like nothing is happening as it should, and everything is flipped upside down,\" Markel wrote. \"I often think that I have been sentenced for life. That Dan\u2019s murder is also my life sentence: a void-like landscape of traumatic flashbacks, anguish, and prolonged anxiety.\"\nMarkel added, \"My hope is that things will get better when justice prevails. In the case of Dan, this has not happened yet.\"\nAt the time, Dan was on the phone with a teacher from a charter school that his children were potentially going to be attending, Ruth explained in her book. \"There\u2019s someone next to me,\" were his final words before the shooter began firing off rounds.\nOver eight years later, four people have been arrested \u2013 including Markel\u2019s former brother-in-law, Charlie Adelson.\nKatherine Magbanua, Charlie's ex-girlfriend, was sentenced to life in prison for Markel's murder, and is reportedly scheduled to meet with prosecutors for questioning later this month.\nSigfredo Garcia, the father of Magbanua's children, was convicted in 2019 of first-degree murder and has appealed his conviction. His accomplice, Luis Rivera, ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Magbanua's May 2022 trial. He described how Magbanua acted as a go-between for Adelson and the alleged hit men.\nMeanwhile, Adelson, a 45-year-old former dentist, is scheduled to head to trial next year on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and solicitation to commit first-degree murder for allegedly hiring Garcia and Rivera to carry out the hit.\nFor over an hour, Markel described to Fox News Digital her love and adoration for Dan's children, her appreciation of the support and the attention toward the case, and her unrelenting effort \u2013 while difficult \u2013 to find answers to questions she never imagined she would have to ask.\n\u2018MACHATUNIM\u2019\nRuth Markel described in \"The Unveiling\" her family\u2019s suspicions immediately following the news of her son\u2019s death. Ruth was in Montreal visiting family when she first learned what had happened.\nShe immediately broke the news to her loved ones, with one uncle responding in Yiddish, \"Machatunim \u2026 Machatunim\"\n\"The in-laws. The in-laws,\" Markel wrote in the book. \"He was talking about the Adelsons, Wendi\u2019s family.\"\nWendi Adelson was Dan's ex-wife.\nAttorneys for Charlie, Donna and Harvey Adelson declined to comment when contacted by Fox News Digital with specific excerpts from the book. Wendi\u2019s attorney, John Lauro, also declined to make a public comment.\nAn August 2016 statement signed by several attorneys representing the Adelson family called \"unsupported speculation\" of the Adelsons\u2019 involvement in Markel\u2019s murder \"categorically false,\" according to multiple reports.\n\"To be clear, none of the Adelsons \u2013 Wendi, her brother Charlie, or their parents Donna and Harvey \u2013 had anything to do with Dan\u2019s murder,\" the statement continued.\nThe statement also described how police and investigators had \"spent the past two years reviewing every shred of evidence out there \u2013 every phone record, financial record, text message, email, internet search, everything.\"\nThe statement went on, \"We understand why the government has put the Adelson family through this type of severe scrutiny. But nothing has turned up that supports this fanciful fiction that the Adelsons were involved \u2026 There is a reason that the police have not arrested any of the Adelsons \u2013 they weren\u2019t involved in Dan\u2019s death.\"\nCharlie Adelson, Wendi\u2019s brother, was arrested in April 2022.\nMarkel\u2019s ex-wife, Wendi Adelson, and her parents, Donna and Harvey Adelson, have not been charged in connection with his death.\nJULY 18, 2014\nTallahassee Police Department investigators have said Markel dropped his children off at daycare around 8:50 a.m. roughly five miles from his home. He then made his way to Premier Health and Fitness Center, where he arrived around 9:12 a.m., according to a probable cause affidavit shared online in 2016.\nPolice found that a Toyota Prius had followed Markel not only into the parking lot of the fitness facility, but was also \"trailing Markel\u2019s car\" before and after his time in the gym.\n\"Investigators believe the suspects in the Prius followed the victim throughout the morning and back to this residence, where the victim was shot in the head as he sat in his car,\" the affidavit states. \"Markel\u2019s neighbor heard what he believed to be a gunshot and looked out the window, where he saw a small silver or light-colored vehicle, resembling a Prius, backing out of the victim\u2019s driveway.\"\nThe neighbor, identified in \"The Unveiling\" as a man named James Geiger, rushed to the Markel\u2019s garage to find him \"in a pool of blood,\" Ruth Markel wrote.\n\"You need to send an ambulance in a hurry,\" Geiger could be heard in 911 call audio. \"He is still alive. He is moving.\"\nEmergency responders arrived 19 minutes later. Markel was rushed to a local hospital, but ultimately could not be saved.\n\u2018BIG ISSUE\u2019\nWhile married, Dan and Wendi faced several issues that created tension not only between the couple, but between Dan's and Wendi's families as well the book states.\nOne of those topics, Markel wrote, was Dan\u2019s wish that their two sons be raised in a conservative, kosher Jewish household.\nA second \"big issue,\" Ruth wrote, was where the couple chose to live.\n\"Wendi disliked Tallahassee,\" Markel wrote. \"Wendi would only move to warm states as well as Washington, D.C. In reality, because she had young children, the only place she really wanted to live was in Miami, where her family was.\"\nMeanwhile, Dan had religious and community roots in Tallahassee, and a job that had \"taken off,\" she wrote.\nAfter the couple had split, Adelson\u2019s efforts to move the children out of Tallahassee and closer to her family were shot down, at which point the \"situation intensified,\" Markel wrote.\n\"Donna felt caged in and continued sending Wendi strong emails. Donna would try anything to gain control over the children and get them away from Dan,\" Markel wrote. \"Donna became obsessed with her hatred of Dan and kept on coming up with new plots for Wendi to move to the Miami area.\"\nIn emails from the year before Dan\u2019s death, Donna allegedly used derogatory terms related to Judaism and wrote: \"Tell Dan that the children will be baptized in the Catholic church as long as he wants you to remain in Tallahassee.\"\nAccording to Markel, \"Donna even documented to Wendi how the family was prepared to offer Dan $1 million to allow Wendi to move to South Florida, using a split of funds between Wendi herself, her parents, and her brother Charlie.\"\nAfter Dan\u2019s death, Wendi Adelson testified at the trial for Magbanua in May 2022. Chief Assistant State Attorney Georgia Cappleman referenced an email exchange between Wendi Adelson and Donna Adelson in asking what her mother felt was \"the most important part of your divorce.\"\n\"That was relocation,\" Adelson responded.\nWendi later said her proximity to her parents was not the sole reason why she wanted to move. She acknowledged that, \"it was absolutely a reason.\"\nAfter Markel\u2019s death, Wendi Adelson stayed in Tallahassee \"for a few days\" before moving away from the area, she testified. She told the prosecutor she did not feel safe. She later went on to change her children\u2019s last names from Markel to Adelson, and change one of their son\u2019s middle names, despite its alleged symbolism and significance to the Markel family.\nQUESTIONS REMAIN\nHowever, questions surrounding who was involved in the hit remain, even as time passes.\nThough police have not charged Wendi\u2019s parents in connection with the crime, they have pointed to evidence of her mother's involvement, and named Donna an \"unindicted co-conspirator,\" Markel wrote.\nMarkel cited certain details that arose during or around the trial that alluded to the family\u2019s alleged involvement.\nRuth wrote that investigators discovered Donna Adelson had written checks to Magbanua from the family\u2019s dentistry business\u2019 account. During trial, Rivera testified under oath that Donna\u2019s \"paychecks to Magbanua began immediately following Dan\u2019s murder in even increments written on sequential checks.\"\nHowever, investigators had \"found no specific evidence that Magbanua was doing any official work for the family\u2019s business or for Charlie himself, despite receiving regular paychecks, which contributed toward the total amount Rivera admitted the three were paid for the murder,\" she added.\nAdditionally, Rivera told investigators and the court that he was paid with cash that had been \"stapled.\" One of Charlie Adelson\u2019s previous girlfriend testified that Charlie \"stapled his cash,\" Markel wrote.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors pressed Wendi during her May testimony about comments she allegedly made during her interview with police after Markel\u2019s death.\n\"One of the things you said was that your family very much disliked him and that you thought it was possible that someone had done this on your behalf,\" Cappleman contended to Adelson, who did not agree that she had made that specific statement.\nCharlie Adelson also allegedly made jokes more than once about hiring a hit man. Wendi testified at Magbanua\u2019s trial that her brother had once told an \"off-color joke.\"\n\"He had bought me a TV when I got divorced and said it was a present and made a very bad joke, in bad taste, that it was cheaper than hiring a hit man,\" Adelson said.\nWhen asked whether Charlie made the joke once or multiple times, Wendi Adelson said her brother \"has a tendency to repeat himself, so everything he says, he says multiple times.\"\nShe said he had made the joke \"definitely twice at least.\"\nWhen asked if she was \"involved in the plot to kill your husband,\" Adelson responded, \"Absolutely not.\"\nRivera, who pleaded guilty and agreed to testify at Magbanua\u2019s trial, told investigators the reason for the hit was because \"the lady wants her kids back.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWendi Adelson's attorney, John Lauro, declined Wednesday to provide comment regarding the case. In May, he told Fox News Digital the tragedy \"has had a terrible effect on Wendi and her sons.\"\n\"For anybody to suggest that she would put her sons through such pain and horrific agony is just absurd and mean-spirited,\" Lauro said in May. He added, \"[For] almost eight years now, the police have done an intensely thorough investigation of Wendi. They have found not a single email, text, recorded conversation, phone record \u2013 anything \u2013 that implicates Wendi at all. Zero \u2026 The bottom line is that if there was something that tied Wendi to this horrific crime \u2013 and there's not \u2013 we would have seen it in real evidence.\""

      "text": "This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nTwo of suspected killer James Craig's daughters took the stand Thursday afternoon in a Centennial, Colorado, courtroom and testified against their father, who is accused of killing their mother over a 10-day period in March 2023.\nCraig is charged with first-degree murder in the death of wife Angela, who prosecutors allege died from potassium cyanide and tetrahydrozoline poisoning after an agonizing week-and-a-half in and out of the hospital.\nCraig's oldest daughter testified Thursday that her mother was far from suicidal, as the defense, led by attorney Lisa Fine Moses, has suggested during the trial, according to KUSA.\nDENTIST ACCUSED OF POISONING WIFE\u2019S SHAKE SAID HE GAVE HER 'TOO MUCH PROTEIN': CO-WORKER\n\"She would talk to me about how fun it would be when I had kids of my own and when she could meet them,\" the daughter reportedly said. \"She was so excited to be a grandma.\"\nShe described Angela as her \"best friend\" and said Angela had hobbies, including woodworking and exercise. She also loved animals, and, above all, her children.\nCraig's daughter testified that while her mother was in the hospital, she was frustrated she could not be with her children.\n\"She wanted to get back home,\" she said. \"She just wanted to get back to her girls.\"\nShe told the jury her parents struggled in their marriage several years before the alleged murder but said things had gotten better before Angela's death.\nThe defense insisted that Angela was unhappy in a failing marriage, reportedly calling her a \"broken\" woman with mental health issues. Craig's attorneys have never disputed that Angela died by poisoning but say Craig was not responsible.\nThe couple's eldest daughter reportedly wanted an autopsy done on Angela's body but said Craig refused.\nLater, the couple's second-eldest daughter testified. She also said her mother was not suicidal and had plans for the future.\n\"We mostly talked about moving. She always talked about her forever home,\" she said.\nAngela dreamed of moving to a home on a large plot of land with a woodworking shop in five years or so, according to the testimony.\nShe also revealed critical information about communications with her father while he was in jail, particularly a list of requests made by Craig.\nUpon her father's instruction, she said she bailed another inmate out of jail. That inmate then gave her a handwritten bundle of documents in her father's handwriting. The documents included instructions for her to make a \"deepfake\" video using a cheap burner laptop that she was to buy using a prepaid Visa gift card. Craig instructed his daughter to access the dark web to purchase the video-making service.\nCOLORADO DENTIST'S ALLEGED INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY TAKES CENTER STAGE AS MURDER TRIAL BEGINS\nHe also allegedly ordered her to upload the video to a thumb drive and tell detectives she found the drive in her mother's bag, then to destroy the laptop.\nCraig told his daughter in the documents that he had been unfaithful to Angela and that she asked him to purchase the poison. He told his daughter that he and her mom were playing a game of chicken when she accidentally took too much of the poison.\nCraig faces a charge of solicitation to tamper with evidence related to this incident.\nFormer Arapahoe County prosecutor and current Colorado defense attorney Eric Faddis, who is not involved with the Craig case, spoke to Fox News Digital about the crucial testimony.\n\"It's absolutely a blow to the defense,\" he said.\nFaddis believes the children would likely have known if their mother was suicidal and that allegedly asking one of them to fabricate evidence would be unnecessary if Craig had done nothing wrong.\nSMALL-TOWN DENTIST FACING TRIAL FOR ALLEGEDLY POISONING WIFE'S PROTEIN SHAKE AMID SECRET AFFAIR\n\"[Craig] reaching out and asking one of the children to do a deep fake video that supported the notion that Angela Craig was suicidal seems like a bit of an act of desperation,\" said Faddis.\n\"And, also, to involve your children in such a way when you're faced with a first-degree murder charge that could even cause those children to be exposed to criminal liability, it's just a horrible look for the defense.\"\nAs for the daughters' denial that their mother was suicidal, Faddis said the testimony could be interpreted by the jury in two ways.\n\"They could interpret it as, if a person is suicidal, it's reasonable to think that the people closest to them would have a sense of that, including their children,\" he said. \"Even if the mother didn't come out and say expressly that she was suicidal to her kids, you would think that the kids may have observed clues that a person might be suicidal, like depressive episodes, excessive crying, disengaging from life.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I guess the defense might argue that a mother could have an incentive to not disclose to her children that she is struggling with suicidal ideation because she doesn't want to worry them, and also, it's a very private, sensitive matter,\" he said. \"So, if the jury sees it that way, that might be a little more mitigated.\n\"But I think, overall, it's problematic for the defense.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to defense lawyer Lisa Fine Moses."

  "argos_summary": "Nearly eleven years after Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was gunned down, his former mother\u2011in\u2011law Donna Adelson faces first\u2011degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation charges for allegedly masterminding the hit\u2011man plot that killed him. Prosecutors argue she orchestrated the killing to free her daughter Wendi Adelson from a custody battle, citing her attempted flight to Vietnam, FBI sting evidence and the chain of convictions of her son Charlie Adelson and others. The trial, set to begin in Tallahassee, follows a decade\u2011long investigation that also saw the conviction of Charlie Adelson, Katherine Magbanua and the hitmen Sigfredo Garcia and Luis Rivera. Adelson has pleaded not guilty, while her defense team maintains her innocence and highlights her age and role as a grandmother. The case underscores the complex family dynamics and legal strategy of prosecuting a long\u2011delayed murder\u2011for\u2011hire scheme.",
