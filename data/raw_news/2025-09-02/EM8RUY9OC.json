  "description": "From cards that earn elevated cash back to those that provide travel rewards, we look at all the ways you can get more rewards for your grocery spending.",
  "content": "The average American family spends about $500 per month on groceries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s one of the biggest expenses for a family, accounting for almost 8% of yearly spending. So it makes sense to get rewards from grocery spending by using a credit card that earns bonus points or cash back on groceries.\n\nThere are many credit cards on the market that earn elevated rewards for grocery spending, but not all of them are created equal. For starters, some cards will earn rewards in the form of cash back, while others earn points that can be redeemed for travel or transferred to airlines and hotels. And the return on your spending can vary widely by card, up to an exceptional 6%.\n\nBut with a wide variety of cards from many issuers, how do you decide which one meets your particular needs and earns the most rewards? The good news is that the cards in our selection of the best cards for groceries are flexible enough to cover pretty much everybody, from single people to families with monthly grocery budgets in the thousands.\n\nIf you\u2019re confident in your ability to meet your financial obligations, since credit cards are a means of paying later for what you are consuming now, then you should consider one of the cards in our lineup of the best cards for groceries. Check out our picks below, and why they made the cut.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a breakdown of why each of these cards is a good choice for your grocery spending or, in many cases, a great choice for spending in other categories too.\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred is a solid credit card from American Express, whose main selling point is a stellar return on grocery shopping.\n\nIt earns 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year, which is the best rate for grocery shopping out there. After you hit that $6,000 in grocery spending, the return drops to just 1%, but the average family spends more or less that amount on groceries a year. (Families with significantly higher grocery budgets may be better served by the American Express\u00ae Gold Card.)\n\nThe same high 6% cash back return applies to select U.S. streaming subscriptions, while purchases at U.S. gas stations and for transit (including taxis and ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more) earn 3%. On everything else, it earns 1%. That cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars, which can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon checkout.\n\nAnother important feature of the card is the intro period of 12 months of zero interest on purchases and balance transfers (20.24%-29.24% variable APR thereafter), which makes it a good choice for people who need to carry a balance for a while.\n\nThe card does have an annual fee, but it\u2019s a relatively moderate $95, and you don\u2019t have to pay it in your first year. You can more than make up for that fee with the card\u2019s $10 monthly statement credit, totaling $120 a year, on a subscription to Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+, which includes bundle subscriptions (enrollment required).\n\nThat credit helps cement the Blue Cash Preferred as a workhorse card for families with an average grocery budget and mainstream viewing habits; you could call it the all-American credit card. It\u2019s not meant for people who travel often, much less for those who travel overseas, since it charges foreign transaction fees. But people who aren\u2019t interested in travel rewards or benefits may find that it fills most or all of their needs in a credit card.\n\nThe Blue Cash Everyday is essentially a no-annual-fee version of the Blue Cash Preferred. They\u2019re both American Express cards that earn cash back, but the Blue Cash Everyday earns 3% on U.S. supermarkets compared to 6%. Like with the Preferred, the elevated rate applies on up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then it drops to 1%. The Blue Cash Everyday earns 3% cash back on U.S. online retail purchases and U.S. gas stations, also on up to $6,000 per year, then 1%.\n\nWhile the return on grocery spending may be less than its sibling card earns, the Everyday has a longer period with no interest, with 15 months at 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers (20.24%-29.24% variable APR thereafter). Its current welcome offer is slightly lower than the Preferred, with $200 in statement credits instead of $250, but you\u2019ll earn it after spending $2,000 in the first six months, not $3,000.\n\nIf you watch streaming content, you\u2019ll find the $7 monthly credit for a subscription to Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+, including bundle subscriptions, useful. Enrollment is required, but for that minor step, you get a $70 credit per year.\n\nOverall, the Blue Cash Everyday offers a good value proposition, but if you spend enough, you may find the Blue Cash Preferred more rewarding despite its annual fee.\n\nWith an annual fee of $325 and elevated earnings on worldwide restaurants and airlines, as well as on groceries, the American Express Gold is aimed squarely at people who travel and eat out fairly frequently \u2014 and can justify paying that much.\n\nIts most relevant feature is the 4x American Express Membership Rewards\u00ae Points it earns per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets, up to $25,000 per calendar year (1x afterward). That means you can rack up four points per dollar on up to $2,083 in grocery spending per month, plenty for most budgets.\n\nBeyond groceries, it earns 4x points at restaurants worldwide, up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1x for the rest of the year). Flights booked directly with airlines or on the American Express travel portal earn 3x; to round out a card clearly designed for travelers, you\u2019ll also earn 2x points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on Amex Travel. On all other eligible purchases, the card earns 1x.\n\nThe card also offers several credits that, all together, are valued more than the annual fee but require some work to keep track of and may not be to everybody\u2019s taste.\n\nWhile some of those credits are relatively easy to use \u2014 such as the Resy credit, which is great for people who live in or travel to major cities with several Resy restaurants, or the straightforward Dunkin\u2019 credit \u2014 others are exotic. Hotels in The Hotel Collection are decidedly upscale, for example, and you\u2019d need to stay at least two nights to trigger the credit.\n\nThis card, however, isn\u2019t aimed at consumers who prefer frugality. With its high annual fee and perks to go with it, it\u2019s a very good choice for people who like to travel and dine out, or for those who have high grocery budgets and want high rewards for it.\n\nThe American Express Gold doesn\u2019t earn cash back like the other Amex cards in this article either. it earns American Express points, which can be used for travel on the Amex portal or transferred to 20 partner airlines and hotels, including Delta Air Lines and JetBlue.\n\nThis versatile, no-annual-fee card is a strong performer when it comes to earning rewards not just on groceries.\n\nIt earns unlimited 3% cash back at grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target) and adds 3% on dining, entertainment and streaming services. That alone would make it an attractive card, but the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards does better than that. It earns a spectacular 8% cash back on purchases through Capital One Entertainment, a portal where cardholders can buy tickets to sports, music and dining events. Then, the card also earns a respectable 5% on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through the Capital One Travel portal. On all other purchases, it earns 1%.\n\nThat\u2019s a remarkable earning structure for a card with no annual fee, and it would be a good argument by itself for getting the Savor Cash Rewards \u2014 but you can get even more value from the card by pairing it with the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card (which has a $395 annual fee) or another Venture card from Capital One with a lower annual fee. That way, you can transfer the cash back earned on the Savor card to the Venture card. You\u2019ll get 1 Capital One mile for each cent transferred, and then you can redeem Capital One miles for statement credits or transfer them to Capital One\u2019s 15-plus airline and hotel partners.\n\nThis can give you outsize value, since miles can be worth well over 1 cent each when transferred to travel partners. Capital One miles are worth 1.85 cents each, according to The Points Guy.\n\nNotably for a card with no annual fee, the Savor Cash Rewards doesn\u2019t charge extra for foreign transactions. This helps make it an exceptionally versatile performer, even for people who travel abroad.\n\nYou could earn more on dining out or on supermarkets with the American Express Gold, for example, but you would also have to pay a high annual fee.\n\nThis card is, quite literally, a jack-of-all-trades. It earns 2% cash back on everything you buy, every time, all the time. Its simplicity and elevated earning rate make it one of the best options for many people. Unlike credit cards that require you to track bonus categories or redeem points strategically for maximum value, the Citi Double Cash earns the same on every purchase, be it groceries or anything else. You\u2019ll get 1% cash back when you buy and another 1% when you pay off those purchases. No frills, no fuss.\n\nThe lone exception to that general 2% earning rate is 5% cash back on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on the Citi Travel\u00ae portal. If you book travel directly from providers, you\u2019ll get 2%.\n\nWhen you want to redeem the cash back, you have three options: a statement credit, direct deposit or a physical check. You can also transfer your ThankYou points to most of Citi\u2019s travel partners at a 1:0.7 ratio.\n\nLike most other cards with no annual fee, the Citi Double Cash does have one drawback: It charges foreign transaction fees, which are typically higher than the 2% cash back rate. But while it\u2019s not a good choice to bring on a trip abroad, within the U.S., it offers a clear, straightforward and strong value proposition.\n\nMany travel cards earn high returns for spending on travel categories but earn relatively poorly in other categories. That\u2019s not the case with the Citi Strata Premier, a rare case of a travel rewards card that still earns a high rate on everyday spending. It could even be a single, do-it-all card for some frequent flyers.\n\nThe Citi Strata Premier earns an exceptional 10 points per dollar spent on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on the Citi Travel portal, as well as a respectable 3x on flights and hotels booked directly with providers. It also earns 3x at restaurants, gas and EV charging stations, as well as 3x at supermarkets, which is why it\u2019s a top groceries card for people who also value travel. On all other purchases, it earns just 1x point per dollar. You can overcome that shortcoming by pairing the Strata Premier with the Citi Double Cash, which earns 2% cash back on all purchases.\n\nThe card does come with an annual fee of $95, but we think it\u2019s still a relative steal for people who need its flexibility. If you fly and/or leave the U.S. with some frequency, the Strata Premier could turn into a trusted companion.\n\nSome cardholders could even offset the annual fee in one fell swoop by using the card\u2019s $100 annual hotel benefit. Once per calendar year, you\u2019ll receive $100 off a single hotel stay booked on Citi Travel and costing $500 or more (excluding taxes and fees). While this credit may not have the widest appeal, it could prove useful, for example, on a family vacation.\n\nThe Strata Premier isn\u2019t perfect, though. Citi has a relatively small pool of transfer partners, with only two domestic airlines \u2014 American and JetBlue \u2014 making its American Express, Chase and Capital One rivals potentially more appealing to some travelers. Some competitors also define travel more broadly; with the Strata Premier, elevated travel earnings don\u2019t apply to trains, transit and cruises, for example.\n\nBut with all that said, Citi\u2019s mid-tier travel card still punches above its weight, for groceries and otherwise. With no foreign transaction fees, the Citi Strata Premier also travels well outside the U.S. Even better news? That elevated 3x earning rate applies to supermarkets abroad too.\n\nThis Chase-issued card makes sense for one group of people only, but for them, it\u2019s perfect. If you\u2019re a frequent shopper at Amazon, its subsidiary Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh, the Amazon Prime Visa rewards you with an unbeatable 5% cash back. On some rotating items and categories from Amazon, you\u2019ll even earn 10% back.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get 5% back on Chase Travel purchases and 2% at gas stations, restaurants and on local transit, including ride-sharing, as well as 1% on all other purchases.\n\nThe catch is that, while there\u2019s no annual fee, you must have a $139-per-year Amazon Prime membership to get this card, but that\u2019s an easy bar to clear since an estimated 180 million Americans are Prime members.\n\nAnother catch is that the cash back rewards from the card are worth a penny each, and that\u2019s it. Points and cash back from other cards can be worth more, but there is a lot to be said for the simplicity of earning and redeeming with the Amazon Prime Visa. In fact, points from this card are the only points we like to use on Amazon.\n\nThe following FAQs have been answered by senior money editor and credit card expert Alberto Riva.\n\nCNN Underscored\u2019s team of expert editors and contributors carefully reviews credit cards, travel rewards and loyalty programs to help readers navigate changes and make informed financial decisions.

TPG\u2019s September 2025 monthly valuations\nEditor's Note\nQuick summary\n- TPG provides updated valuations for major airline, hotel and transferable points programs.\n- Valuations for some programs are determined using a data-driven methodology considering redemption rates, availability and program updates.\n- The new Atmos Rewards program merges Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines loyalty schemes, offering flexible elite status earning and notable perks for top-tier members.\n- Recent program changes, transfer partner updates and new redemption options may affect the value and flexibility of your points and miles.\nWhat to consider\n- Valuations can fluctuate based on program changes, availability and redemption options, so actual value may differ from published estimates.\n- Some programs are undergoing transitions, such as Atmos Rewards.\n- Transfer partner changes and other program changes may affect your ability to maximize rewards.\nWhat you'll miss from the article\n- A detailed breakdown of current point and mile values across major loyalty programs and insight into recent program updates that could impact your travel strategy.\nGenerated by AI with support from our editorial team.\nOne of the questions people often ask us is, \"How much is a point or mile worth?\"\nThe true answer varies from point to point and person to person. It also depends on your travel goals and how much you maximize a particular loyalty currency. Still, some rewards are worth more than others, and our goal is to give you a sense of how they stack up.\nHistorically, TPG has valued points and miles based on a combination of factors: the price at which we would purchase the points or miles, award costs in the program (factoring in availability and fees), and our expertise in the program's inner workings. However, we now use extensive data for the top seven U.S. airline loyalty programs to better estimate the value you should aim to get from your rewards.

This program merges Mileage Plan and HawaiianMiles. Balances will convert at a 1:1 ratio Oct. 1, creating a single points ecosystem across both carriers.\nThe new program offers some unique and impressively rewarding benefits. For example, members will be able to choose whether they earn points and status points based on distance, revenue or segments. This flexibility, launching in 2026, could make Atmos Rewards one of the most passenger-friendly airline programs for earning elite status. You'll still be able to earn elite status from award travel, too.\nAlaska is giving its top-tier Atmos Titanium elite members a great new perk: free day-of-departure upgrades into global business class \u2014 and they can even bring a companion along. No points, no certificates, just an automatic benefit. While it's common to see U.S. loyalty programs upgrade their top-tier elite members on domestic flights, this perk applies to all Alaska and Hawaiian flights.\nCredit cards were refreshed under the new Atmos Rewards brand, and the new Atmos\u2122 Rewards Summit Visa Infinite\u00ae Credit Card offers 100,000 bonus Atmos Rewards points and a 25,000-point Global Companion Award after you spend $6,000 or more on purchases within the first 90 days after account opening. It also offers 10,000 status points on every card anniversary, a faster path to elite status and an astonishing 3 points per dollar spent on foreign transactions, which makes it a great option for international travelers.\nFinally, Alaska's industry-leading partner redemption rates are staying.

If you book a qualifying hotel rate on amextravel.com and then find the same room, in the same hotel, for the same dates, the same number of children and adults, the same rate type and cancellation policy at a lower price online, before taxes and fees, we'll refund you the difference. For pre-paid reservations, your claim must be submitted prior to your stay, before the date of check-in. For verification of \u201cpay later\u201d hotel bookings, your claim must be submitted within thirty (30) days after you have completed the hotel stay, and the customer service representative may instruct you to mail a copy of your hotel receipt to American Express within that time period. American Express will honor the lower price for verified requests. The \"Lowest Hotel Rates Guarantee\" policy applies only to online rates available to the general public and excludes (1) rates or discounts that are not available to the general public, including, but not limited to, corporate, group, charter, meeting/convention, AAA, government/military, and senior citizen rates/discounts; or (2) hotel rooms booked through or in combination with frequent stay, loyalty, points, coupon promotions, rooms won through contests or sweepstakes or transferred, or rooms booked on opaque websites that do not allow you to see the name of the hotel until your reservation is complete; or (3) promotional packages, deals, all-inclusive packages, or bundles that may include additional amenities such as parking, meals, or entertainment, or (4) rates booked through the Fine Hotels + Resorts\u00ae and The Hotel Collection programs. Details\n$200 Hotel Credit\nBasic Card Members on U.S. Consumer Platinum Card Account are eligible to receive up to $200 in statement credits per calendar year when they or Additional Platinum Card Members use their Cards to pay for eligible prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts\u00ae and The Hotel Collection bookings made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com, the Amex\u00ae App, or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card) or when Companion Platinum Card Members on such Platinum Card Accounts pay for eligible prepaid bookings for The Hotel Collection made through American Express Travel (meaning through amextravel.com, the Amex\u00ae App, or by calling the phone number on the back of your eligible Card). Purchases by both the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on the Card Account are eligible for statement credits. However, the total amount of statement credits for eligible purchases will not exceed $200 per calendar year, per Card Account. Fine Hotels + Resorts\u00ae program bookings may be made only by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic Platinum and Additional Platinum Card Members. The Hotel Collection bookings may be made by eligible U.S. Consumer Basic and Additional Platinum Card Members and Companion Platinum Card Members on the Platinum Card Account. Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum Card Members are not eligible for the benefit. To receive the statement credits, an eligible Card Member must make a new booking using their eligible Card through American Express Travel on or after July 1st, 2021, that is prepaid (referred to as \"Pay Now\" on amextravel.com and the Amex App), for a qualifying stay at an available, participating Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection property. Bookings of The Hotel Collection require a minimum stay of two consecutive nights. Eligible bookings must be processed before December 31st, 11:59PM Central Time, each calendar year to be eligible for statement credits within that year. Eligible bookings do not include interest charges, cancellation fees, property fees or other similar fees, or any charges by a property to you (whether for your booking, your stay or otherwise).\nStatement credits are typically received within a few days, however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant\u2019s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if, for example, there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example, if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st, then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due, it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible, you will not receive the statement credits. For example, your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs, (ii) not made through American Express Travel, or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express, in its sole discretion, determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with this benefit, American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account, the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead, the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. Please refer to AmericanExpress.com/FHR and AmericanExpress.com/HC for more information about Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection, respectively.\nFine Hotels + Resorts\u00ae\nFine Hotels + Resorts\u00ae (FHR) program benefits are available for new bookings made through American Express Travel with participating properties and are valid only for eligible U.S. Consumer, Business, and Corporate Platinum Card\u00ae Members, and Centurion\u00ae Members. Additional Platinum Card Members on Consumer and Business Platinum and Centurion Card Accounts are also eligible for FHR program benefits. Companion Card Members on Consumer Platinum and Centurion Card Accounts, Additional Business Gold and Additional Business Expense Card Members on Business Platinum and Centurion Card Accounts, and Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum Card Members are not eligible for FHR program benefits. Bookings must be made using an eligible Card and must be paid using that Card, or another American Express\u00ae Card, in the eligible Card Member's name, and that Card Member must be traveling on the itinerary booked. The average total value of the program benefits is based on prior-year bookings for stays of two nights; the actual value varies. Noon check-in and room upgrade are subject to availability and are provided at check-in; certain room categories are not eligible for upgrade. The type of $100 credit and additional amenity (if applicable) varies by property; the credit will be applied to eligible charges up to the amount of the credit. To receive the credit, the eligible spend must be charged to your hotel room. The credit will be applied at check-out. Advance reservations are recommended for certain credits. The type and value of the daily breakfast (for two) varies by property; breakfast will be valued at a minimum of US$60 per room per day. To receive the breakfast credit, the breakfast bill must be charged to your hotel room. The breakfast credit will be applied at check-out. If the cost of Wi-Fi is included in a mandatory property fee, a daily credit of that amount will be applied at check-out. Benefits are applied per room, per stay (with a three-room limit per stay). Back-to-back stays booked by a single Card Member, Card Members staying in the same room or Card Members traveling in the same party within a 24-hour period at the same property are considered one stay and are ineligible for additional FHR benefits (\u201cProhibited Action\u201d). American Express and the Property reserve the right to modify or revoke FHR benefits at any time without notice if we or they determine, in our or their sole discretion, that you may have engaged in a Prohibited Action, or have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with your FHR benefits. Benefit restrictions vary by property. Benefits cannot be redeemed for cash and are not combinable with other offers unless indicated. Benefits must be used during the stay booked.
