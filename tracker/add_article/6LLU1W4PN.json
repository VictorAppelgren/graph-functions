Kennedy Jr. will testify before the Senate Finance Committee amid controversy over his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the agency’s vaccine policy. Lawmakers will probe Kennedy’s handling of the CDC, the rapid turnover of senior officials, and the impact of his vaccine skepticism on public health. Kennedy has defended his actions as necessary reforms to restore trust and scientific integrity in the CDC, while critics accuse him of politicizing science and endangering public health. The testimony is scheduled for Thursday, with senators warning of hard questions and potential oversight of the agency’s advisory panels.",
